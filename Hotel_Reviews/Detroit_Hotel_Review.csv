http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-detroit-dearborn-dearborn,Courtyard Detroit Dearborn,3.5,$$,7,"One of my first times in a Courtyard, so some of this may be standard to the chain but I'm impressed.  First night here and a few things really stand out: FAST internet, great food at the lobby bistro, and very friendly staff.Internet: 10 ms ping, 35 Mbps down / 17 Mbps up - that's insane and its free!Food: Interesting and tasty choices at the lobby bar/restaurant/bistro thing.  I had a Chicken Cibatta and it was tasty.  It came with a choice of two sides and cost less than $10.  This was better than Subway by far and a good step up from Jimmy John's too.Staff: They've gone out of their way to make me happy and feel cared for.The room is good too; spacious, plenty of outlets, big TV, and a refridgerator.BTW: The renovation spoken of in other reviews is clearly complete.  The lobby and my 1st floor room are very freshly remodeled.I enjoy staying at Courtyard Marriott hotels. Friendly staff, knowledgeable and can carry a conversation. I had a couple problems with the room though... found a small piece of glass on the floor (which I had stepped on... thankfully didnt get cut by it), dark hairs on the floor.. arent my hairs because I have blonde hair, and I used a face cloth to wash my face with and there was some make up on it. I left it on the floor so the cleaners could take it and when I went to shower the next time, that same face cloth had been folded nicely and put back on the rack... so makes me wonder how clean the other towels were...?Would I stay at this particular hotel? Not sure to be honest.I liked this place.  My room was bigger than average and clean.  The front desk folks were friendly and helpful.  The location was convenient (from a certain POV - you can't walk anywhere, really, but well-positioned for driving to different areas).They were doing some remodeling when I was there and adding a little restaurant and Starbucks in the lobby, which is a nice perk.  Though I often stay in hotels that don't have a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, it's always nice when they do.I'd stay here again.My family has had a great experience at this hotel.  Not being from Michigan it was difficult to pick a hotel.  Because my brother was going to be working nearby we wanted reasonable accommodations for a reasonable price.  We were wow'd with the customer service we received.  Whether it was being greeted by Regina with barbeque chicken wings or having a friendly ear to listen to the days events, I am impressed with the extra mile in customer service.  Going forward, the excellent service provided by each of Regina, Jasmine, Darlene, Elizabeth, Isiah, Martel have made this the only hotel I will stay at in Dearborn.  This is obviously the result of excellent management.  Equally noteworthy, is the fantastic food and spirits.  Comfortable beds and spacious rooms makes this a worthwhile stay.The courtyard is currently doing rennovation in the lobby ""to better my future experiences here,"" which leads me to wonder how often travelers stop off at the same place more than once? Because of the remodeling, there has not been continental/complimentary breakfast as was advertised.That being said, it's a decent hotel. It feels new and clean, the water runs nice and hot, the staff is friendly, the mini-fridge is a nice convenience, the location is nice for seeking out the many Middle Eastern businesses &amp; restaurants--but nothing to write home about. I don't often stay in hotels, so I'm not sure if wi-fi is typically available in other hotels--it isn't available here. They do offer free high-speed internet, however, so bring your laptops if you want to connect to the internet. Slightly un-related to the Courtyard--I had a difficult time getting a strong 3G connection (through AT&amp;T) and had many dropped calls--not sure if it's our room's location in the hotel or just the area in general.Checked in. Hotel staff was friendly and effecient. Quickly got to room, which was clean. Only complaint was the thin walls, as I heard neighbors TV until after 1 am.nice hotel, very clean and cozy with the fireplace going, but the thinest walls out of any hotel I have been to!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-detroit-warren-warren,Holiday Inn Express Detroit-Warren,3.0,$$,10,"Musty smelling, clearly remodeled old hotel. The front lobby was nice but the rest of the property was clearly outdated and I wouldn't be surprised if it had been a Super 8 or Econo Lodge in a past life. The rooms were actually decent - very nice bathrooms and comfy beds but the overall damp feeling that others have mentioned is definitely true. We were going to an event in downtown Detroit so this hotel was a bit out of the way for us and I found that there was really nothing besides a Tim Horton's anywhere in the vicinity. There was easy highway access however.Didn't use the outdoor pool but it looked dirty and looked as though it could be accessed off the parking lot by anyone, regardless if they were hotel guests or not. Breakfast is now complimentary, and was better than expected. The bagels and bread items seemed stale, but the hot breakfast food was good and they had a lot of grab and go options (fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, milk in cartons) as well.Probably would not stay here again because of the location, lack of nice amenities, etc. but it was fine for one night.DO NOT STAY HERE!! RUDEST SERVICE EVER FROM THE DESK TO THE WAITSTAFF AT BREAKFAST HORRIBLE. 10:05 breakfast is over at 10 waitstaff watches my girlfriend trying to get orange juice we finally ask is there anything Erin with machine she replies no i turned it off. The man at front desk acted like he couldn't be bothered to help anyone . And they allow people to party at poolAll hours of night drinking and harassing people STAY AWAY!!!My dad was in the hospital for a 2 day stay that turned into a 4 day stay. The hotel was close to his place and not to far from Beaumont, but it was at best a 3 star hotel. It was clean, but it was damp - smelling and feeling - and there were stain spots on the carpet. But I could deal with it because it was clean, there were no bugs and we got plenty of clean towels every day to take showers - just couldn't get rid of that musty feeling, my son called it the ""Detroit funk"". The staff was really great and helpful, they let us re book each night as we needed... the place is just old and needs a remodel, but if you need a place to stay in that area, I am guessing this is your best bet. I did think for $97 a night that it would be a bit nicer. I paid 149 and stayed in a great hotel the next trip. Totally worth it for me..lolStayed overnight on the weekend for a hotel promotion.  Pretty bare-bones.  Free parking and WiFi.  Room and LCD TV was decent sized.  No microwave and mini-refrigerator.   There was an adjoining restaurant and bar.  Morning buffet was $9.95.  It was a good stay and would definitely stay again if I had to do business in the nearby area.  Wouldn't go out of my way to stay though.Stayed one night on business. Room on first floor which is fine but carpet felt wet or damp. Smelled musty, cracked the window but closed later on after dark - no careen and first floor!Room was clean but sparse, double beds??Breakfast was adequate and staff was courteous. Not a lot of choices for dining in the area. Not the best HI Express I've stayed in but ok for a night.We stay here whenever we remodel our house, and also the few times there have been power failures.  It's always been clean and comfortable, no problems ever!Rooms are fresh and clean. The staff is very friendly, especially John, the maintenance man. He made us feel so very welcomed and was one of the friendliest guys we have ever met... If there was a nice restaurant and gorgeous view, I'd give it four stars. We're lucky to have this place so close to our home. We are houseless right now due to plumbing issues. Holiday Inn Express gives us exactly what we need... a clean, comfortable place to sleep and a clean bathroom and shower. Not a single complaint from us. Rooms have large flat screen tv's, a couple of chairs and a desk. a small bench seat. Really nice. Free WI FI too. I've liked every Holiday Inn Express I've ever stayed at, like the one in Bad Axe and one in a Chicago suburb. All of them are great. I recommend this hotel for travelers and guests.For what we paid ($120/night) for a jacuzzi room, I don't think it was worth it. I've paid that at resorts in Orlando, 5 min from Disney. To pay this for Michigan, with nothing around, I feel is ridiculous. Not to mention, they charged my credit card a month in advance, and then charged it another $100 the night we checked in. They said this was just a deposit that would be returned to us. However, we checked out on Dec 28, and the $100 wasn't put back into our account until jan 2. The hotel was pretty empty, and seemed to mostly cater to business travelers. The staff was nice, and bored. I have to say that this was one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in though, hence 2 stars.Nice place to stay. Clean room and friendly staff.This is not the greatest Holiday Inn I've been to.  It's an older one, so you'll get a small, older TV (most new Holiday Inns have large flat screens), and a heating/cooling unit that does not have an adjustable thermostat, just fan and heat level settings.  They did give me a complimentary upgrade because of my platinum Priority Club status, but it was a room with a jacuzzi in it!  Why a business traveler would need a jacuzzi for a one-night stay is beyond me.  Pulling into the parking lot, I noticed that it wasn't plowed very well.  It was impossible to see the yellow lines, and I had to drag my luggage through gray slush.Breakfast was the usual Holiday Inn Express fare, but they didn't have any gravy to go with the biscuits.  This really irked me, as I often get biscuits and gravy in the morning.  I opted for a plain biscuit instead, but they didn't have any butter laying out, so I had to put straight jelly on it.  Curses!They also didn't automatically check me out and slip my receipt under the door, something most other Holiday Inns are able to accomplish.  A few positives to this location: it's not in a bad neighborhood (a real plus for the Detroit area), they have decent irons, they deliver USA Today to your room in the morning, and the staff is friendly. As a frequent business traveler with Holiday Inn, I believe this location to be below average.",,,,,"['musty', 'smelling', 'clearly', 'remodeled', 'old', 'hotel', 'front', 'lobby', 'nice', 'rest',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inns-dearborn,Red Roof Inns,3.0,$,14,"This place is awesome! Great price, safe area, and excellent hospitality. Also everything was clean just the way I expect.The worst place I've ever stayed in. First off for one night without jacuzzi is 140$ gtfo that's insane. And then the heat in the room was unbearable it was like 90 degrees the whole time I mean geezee o Pete it was hot  and then getting woke up at 430 am to ratchets screaming outside my door was not cool. People slamming doors it was a mess and I will never stay here again!!! Also whoever cleaned the room left the old coffee In the coffee machine. Ugh only know what's lurking around these rooms. Smh never again!!I love this place. I've stayed here regularly for 7 years and couldn't be more satisfied. A top notch staff and a super professional manager, Janet. The rates are reasonable and I can get to Detroit and the airport very quickly.For the money, this place was great. It was hidden away a bit from the main street, behind a mini strip mall. Room was clean, free WiFi, Cable tv. I don't care for coffee makers in the room, really, does that stuff ever taste good. Room was cleaner than places I have stayed at and paid a lot more money for. We got a quiet night's rest and that was all we needed after all, we were not in the area for the hotel.Cheapest room and it shows. My stay here was less than pleasant. As soon as you you walk into the room you are hit with a wave of heat. This is caused by a heater that you can not control. There is one above the door and window and another one just outside the bathroom. Cleanliness was a word that never even entered my mind during my stay. Not only did my dog find a condem under the bed but the bath tub was filthy. Throughout my entire time my room was never cleaned. The location was very close to downtown which was nice but the grass was littered with trash and food. The shower was completely extremes it was either way to hot or way to cold. The vending machines were nearly empty and the one row the did have food didn't work. Overall my stay was unpleasant, the quality of service and cleanliness were below average, and the amenities were nonexistent. I will never return to a Red Roof InnWas the worst service I got.   They have employees that yell at you.  Then on top of that. They called the police to escort us out they said we wouldn't want to leave.  They only came and knocked on the door once saying room service and when they knocked they didn't even ask us to leave.  They are the worst ever.  We went to Dearborn Michigan to have fun but that was the worst experience place I ever been too.  I do not recommend it.  They even got our room wrong they gave us false information about the room as well.   Please if you want a good experience and good service.  I do not recommend  this place at all. Save your money.For the price, very nice. I stayed at a holiday inn express the night before. The only major difference was the breakfast. Red roof gives you a bottle of water, a muffin, and an apple. Free coffee @ the lobby.Not the best Red Roof but certainly not the worst. This one is on the border of Dearborn and Inkster (hence the bulletproof glass in the reception area) but the staff are fairly nice and the room was clean. Remember, it's Red Roof, not the Marriot. Breakfast is a lunch bag with an apple, a bag of water and a blueberry muffin. Wifi signal is strong and best of all, it's a non smoking hotel. There's a Big Boy across the street and Leon's (a diner family kind of place) is also nearby.Stayed one night. Standard room is very small. Standard rooms don't have iron and iron board. Had to go to front desk to borrow it. Location was alright. It was very cheap so it was ok just to sleep. Cant expect more from a Red roof.I visited the Red Roof Inn during there 1 cent promotional event and I was extremely disappointed. There marketing department did a great job on the website pictures of the rooms. I was excited: a nice room and a really cheap price. However when I arrived my lip dropped and I couldn't help but frown. Could they have at least taken the nasty, used shower cap off the bathroom door? Did I really have to pad the toilet seat with tissue because it was visibly not clean as it should have been? Could they have at least replaced the tattered blankets in the room? (They were clean, but looked like it was time to buy new ones.) I mean if the place had been remodeled it should still have the new car smell (you know what I mean). The parking lot was small and loaded with truckers who I guess were taking a night break. I never thought I'd be nervous about sleeping in Dearborn, but man did it feel like I was in one of those cheap motels that people go to in horror movies. I slept with my clothes on while laying on top of the blankets. smh I just didn't feel right in that room. I had grabbed my key early in the day but didn't go to the room until late (my fault for thinking it would be a clean room). And I didn't wanna complain because the room was only one cent. Had I paid regular rates, I would have had a major fit!The staff at the front desk was actually nice. I filled out a survey about my stay and received an email from property manager. I explained to her that the room was not to standard in cleanliness. I have not been back since. I WOULD NOT recommend going here unless you are desperate and are doing a short stay. I've been to better.Note: I had out of town relatives stay at this same red roof inn this past month and they were not pleased either (Had they told me where they were staying I would have sent them somewhere else)Spend the extra couple of bucks and stay at another hotel. You will thank me later.This Red Roof worked out great for a mini vacation to the Motor City. We requested a room on the golf course side and it was extremely quiet. We were in town to visit the Henry Ford and the location was perfect. Considering the price you could not ask for more.        The room was clean and the staff was friendly. We asked for extra towels and an iron and they were provided immediately.        Not sure how old the remodel was but be aware our floor was some type of linoleum, so pack slippers or extra socks. The double beds were a bit tight but not too hard. I did not realize till day 2 that the pillows were different, so I slept on a too hard pillow one night.         I am also not a fan of the sack breakfast. I heard they used to give a voucher for local restaurants. That would be best. Skip the sack drive to Leon's or Bob EvansI'm not sure what the other reviewers experienced but I found this red roof very nice.The room smelt new and seemed like it was recently renovated. Everything was really clean and the linen was excellent. The Dearborn area seems pretty great compared to some places around Detroit as well. My girlfriend and I felt safe here anyway.There is a small bar fridge, microwave, safe and a 40inch TV with a bunch of channels. There is also a desk, air conditioning and stuff for ironing clothes and hanging them.Overall this was a great example of a Red Roof Inn and I would have no problem recommending it to people especially for $54 per night.Even though the rooms were remodeled this place is still a dump.  There is bullet proof glass and it is right across the street from Inkster.I called for towels and got them 3 hours later.Would have given two stars but I wanted a copy of my receipt mailed to me and they said I had to talk to a manager.   I called back when the ""Manager"" was supposed to be in and they said call back tomorrow.  They couldn't send me my paperwork unless I came in in person and signed for it.  They wouldn't tell me WHY I had to sign after I asked.DUMPY HOTEL. TERRIBLE SERVICE.PRO: Fairly close to downtown Dearborn bars.  Not walking distance, but pretty cheap and close.***Update - Kevin helped me out and mailed the thing I needed.",,,,,"['place', 'awesome', 'great', 'price', 'safe', 'area', 'excellent', 'hospitality',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-detroit-southfield-southfield,Courtyard Detroit Southfield,4.0,$$,16,"Pleased with the room. My house flooded and I needed a last minute escape close by and I chose this hotel at 7pm on a Saturday night. Rooms clean, modern and spacious. Staff professional and helpful.  Bed was very comfortable and we liked the balcony although it was freezing outside,  it was a plus.Everything here was good. Great decor in the room, extra towels (in hotels you know sometimes they are hard to come by), there were extra blankets in the closet. They had a small fridge included, made it nice to keep all the drinks we had to keep cold. They even had a make up remover pad to use, it surprised me, it was nice. One of the only downside, the housekeeping staff was loud the first morning we woke up. They were loud talking to each other early in the morning, thought it was crazy because you are at a hotel and people are sleeping, or trying to sleep all around you. Also, I wish breakfast was included because for $89 a night, it should've be still.This hotel is pretty decent. From the outside it may appear as a motel-layout, but it's actually not. Turns out it's somewhat of a massive hexagon (I don't know what the hell the shape is, to be honest. All I know is it's a damn maze once you enter it, g'luck!) The interior if the building seems to be freshly remodeled with a very modernistic decor. There is a small cafe and cozy lounge area.  The hotel staff is very professional: efficient, helpful &amp; accommodating. I had initially requested a 2-queen bed rm, but it wasn't available as I had arrived very early. At my request the staff swiftly changed my rm to a king rm and allowed me to check in at about 9am (vs the typical 3pm chk-in). Also later that evening when I requested add'l linens they had them to me in less than 10 minutes. My only gripe was finding the elevator. As I stated, the building is quite large. It seemed that I was walking miles and miles, days and days following an arrow to an elevator that didn't seem to exist! Of course Eventually I found it but I recommend hitting the stairs or checking in and then driving around to an entrance proximal to your rm.The rm was fairly clean. I found a random pine cone in my rm and my brother found a couple of beer caps in his, but other than that it was decent. Each rm seems to have a small patio facing the courtyard area. The courtyard area is quite nice as well.The location is somewhat awkward because it is located off the service drive and you'd have to drive to get to any restaurants/entertainment, but serves it's purpose.I would definitely recommend and stay here again. Pricing is very reasonable for the quality.4.5 stars considering the great price. Stayed here for 3 nights. I paid $59/night via priceline where the hotel's name isn't listed, just their star rating, price, neighborhood (normally it's $90+). Very friendly receptionist (young woman with glasses). The room was spacious with a renovated look. Plenty of lights. Coffee maker and mini fridge included with Paul Mitchell shampoo/conditioner. AC/heating unit was a bit loud. Otherwise I had an excellent stay with the location being a convenient 15mins from downtown Royal Oak.Also, 24hr fitness room and an indoor pool.Just stayed at the Courtyard in Southfield, MI for the second time, on business.  The staff is so friendly and efficient.  Food from the Bistro is actually pretty good!  Lots of coffee options in the morning. There's a full-service restaurant in the Marriott next door.  There aren't any other places to eat within walking distance, so you probably want to  have a car.  Be sure to ask for a room that overlooks the interior courtyard.  You'll have a balcony and view of landscaped area.  It'll be quiet, too.  I plan to stay at the Courtyard every time I have business in the Southfield area.What to like: you get most of the amenities of your standard Courtyard. It is conveniently located close to the highway, however rooms on the back side of the hotel are very quiet. I heard no rush hour traffic. They have the Bistro with bar items so you could get by eating a few meals here if you didn't venture out. What to dislike: Hot tub is out of service... Over 2 years according to staff. As a business traveler, I enjoy a dip in the hot tub at the end of a long day of travel. The elevators are dirty. What is it with hotels that don't daily vacuum the elevator? I know they vacuum at this hotel, as they were vacuuming the hallway outside my room at 8:30 PM. Would it be so hard to give the elevator a little TLC? Although the hotel lobby has had the upgrade, the room and hallways have the look of an older hotel. I will stay here again as the detractors were not major, but I would love to see the hot-tub working and the elevators vacuumed.Also, I didn't notice any nearby restaurants (walking distance) but in using Yelp I found an ample number of great places to eat within a 5 mile radius.Great price for a Saturday night. $89 plus tax. Was looking for a room after a concert at Joe Louis tonight.. 1 king bed and balcony, fridge and very comfy. Customer service was great compared to Marriott in Detroit. I would come back here again.Stayed here for a family function the weekend of 6/11-6/14. The facilities are up to date. The rooms were very clean and well maintained. The amenities provided were plentiful. The most important feature were the employees. All were professional, helpful and friendly. I would recommend this facility when staying in the greater Detroit, MI area.Very nicely appointed very comfortable rooms. White linens on a super comfortable bed, nice LG flat screen, well placed computer desk with plenty of plug ins. There was also a very spacious bathroom with Paul Mitchell products. Friendly helpful staff. Just two downsides it was a little far from local restaurants, and with the condition of the road in front I wasn't inclined to put my car through any more punishment. (I blame that on Michigan winters...) And the breakfast was not complimentary, but they do have a full service Bistro restaurant that has plenty of options. Overall comfortable friendly stay.Was not happy with this hotel. Although I should know what to expect at the Courtyard, there were a couple things that really stuck out. Upon check in I was notified that room service was available until 11pm. I called at noon 4 times and no one ever answered. I then called the front desk and they still transferred me to the same line which was clearly not being answered. Bed was clean and comfortable. Bathrooms were very outdated. They did not even supply a soap to wash your hands with. Would not stay again.Good hotel about to get even better. Getting the full courtyard remodel in September with new rooms, new lobby and new dining area.Marriotts are a favorite of mine so thought to try this one due to it's location. Easy to get in and out, great desk service checking in. Room looked and smelled fresh and good size. Only issue was a flossing toothpick left in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. Shower may have been a touch dated. Bed felt great and slept well, asked for a late checkout of 1:30 because of a meeting granted easily. Breakfast looked OK but all I had time for was some fresh fruit as I was on the road. At around  12 I received a call asking if I was staying or checking out and then housekeeping knocked on my door, It seems they did not record my late checkout but granted it again at that time.I'd go there again as it looked they were updating as well.I was very satisfied each time I stayed here.  My reservations were made in advance and the staff was prepared upon my arrival.The pricing of this establishment is surprisingly affordable for all it has to offer.  On top of that everything is modern and up to date.  The pictures below of the rooms don't do them justice.They have an indoor pool with a lovely view of the outside.  This does make the room a lot cooler, but they have a hot-tub to keep you toasty.  It was nice to use the small gym because there weren't many people in there.  The equipment was clean.I'm a life-long fan and will recommend The Courtyard Marriott to everyone.Friendly staff, close to main office. The down side is the building is old and there was a lot of construction going on (the main road - not there problem).The rooms are nice and quiet, the beds and pillows were nice and they even had a great pool.The thing I hate is loud guests who don't think of others. That is hardly a problem with the hotel, but get someone to walk the halls and settle things down. Another thing I hate is when I hear staff complain about their work! Especially when they are loud And ghetto about it!No wi-fi. Only wired internet. Otherwise not bad.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-windsor-windsor,Hilton Windsor,2.5,$$$,8,"3 stars! Why?First off, the location is great and the view is amazing. Depending on which side your room is located you get a view of the water and then can also see Detroit from your window. Secondly, the service isn't the best. For the price that you pay and the name that it carries, you would expect some better service. One time my A/C was not working properly and the water was leaking from it onto the carpet. Well, they didn't come to see the issue right away and took a couple calls for them to come. On top of that, they didn't even offer to change the room. Really? We had to move our luggage away from the A/C because of the wet carpet that kept getting closer to the bed. Good location with a good view. Hilton? Surprised it carries that name.I have a couple seminars to conduct this morning in Windsor so drove down last night.The room is big.  There is a desk so it's good if you are here for business.  The bed was comfy and I had a great sleep.The view from my window when I checked in about 6pm last night was gorgeous ... the sun was setting on Detroit (I'm on the 16th floor).  It was a lovely sunrise this morning.WIFI is free (in this day and age, I hate it when hotels charge for it). Parking is odd. You can park your car yourself in the back for $10. Or you can have it valet parked for $21 (they take it away to the same spot you would have parked it but charge you $11 more). Or if you are lucky enough, you can leave it in front of the hotel and it's only $15 but you have to pay cash. Huh?! It's a about six blocks from the casino.This is an old hotel and should not be under the Hilton brand. I complained to management but they don't care as they rely on casino business. The drapes have never been vacuumed and everything seems old and worn. For what they charge you can do better. Nice view of Detroit and the bar downstairs has decent food but both times i was there it seemed a ghost town. WiFi is wired which is so 90's so i couldn't use my ipad or iPhone and that was not a nice evening!Not business traveler friendly at all.Really uncertain how to review this place.  I think it does pretty well under the circumstances but maybe there is just not enough business in Windsor to justify good maintenance and upkeep of facilities.Service was excellent -- front desk people were really friendly and efficient.  Too bad they couldn't fix any of my problems.Internet was down for full THREE DAYS of my stay. Really?  How is that possible? Are we in Iqaluit? The staff did send us over to the Radisson next door to sit in their (rather dire) lobby for WIFI.Room had a million dollar view of the Detroit River.  Huge bank of windows, very comfortable bed.  Good coffee service. Alas, only one phone worked and it was never a sure thing that the toilet was going to flush.So my rating is an average of some things being 4 stars and some things being two (or worse).  Bonus points for a great jogging walking path across the street.  Runs by the river and has wonderful sculptures along the way.Came back again this week and they delivered an exercise ball after I complained on Friday and via email over the weekend.  Too bad it was the smallest one I have ever seen (unusable).  Don't understand why you can't get anything to eat after 10PM.  Whirlpool wasn't hot enough and shutoff after 5 minutes.  They gave me free ""giant breakfast"". I am a Hilton Diamond and get the free continental.  They add eggs, bacon, sausage and potatoes for $7 more.  Not worth it.  They needed omelets or pancakes.There have been better days for this Hilton. Decor looks quite outdated; a reno was done, but maybe twenty years ago.Spent three nights here for a work function.I was on the 13th floor facing Detroit. Beautiful view! Looking out made me feel so guilty about saying crap about Motown.The room is cluttered with furniture that it was a tad hard to walk around when I also had my luggage with me. On the other hand, there IS free Internet in the room. Water pressure in the washroom was terrible ... thankfully I had bottles of water so I was able to brush my teeth. After mentioning this little problem, front desk quickly sent up someone.In spite of the ugly, I found staff to be super friendly and courteous. Windsor is ... nice ... albeit small for a city girl like myself.The Hilton room was reserved for me by work so I didn't have any choice in the matter.It's a-ok.Definitely not the poster 'child' for the Hilton brand.Went here for lunch with a business associate.  We went to both lunch and have a business meeting, the restaurant was not busy (Wednesday) and quiet. Perfect.  We were invited to choose any table, but when we did the waitress (working alone) said that we had to move closer to other diners (two other tables) - I guess she didn't want too much exercise!  The food was OK - but very weird service - as if she didn't listen.  I asked for blackened salmon (as on the menu).  Instead she decided to bring me salmon with a lemon sauce!  My associate ordered a club sandwich on white bread.  She decided to bring him a club sandwich on toasted wheat bread!!  Normally I would send it back but we were in discussions - but the whole service thing was F'ed up.  Not a thing came without something being wrong. Deaf?  On something?  WeirdThe view is amazing. Everything else is mediocre. It's not a complete dump but it's on its way. I've been staying here for 15 years and it just gets older and older. A major renovation could really help this place. Not just some paint on the walls in the rooms but new elevators, refresh the bar and address the parking situation. There is real competition out on Huron Church now and they all have free parking as does the casino. Figure out how to get competitive with that because this is now one of the oldest ""nice"" hotels in the area but is still $20-40/night above the others once parking is factored in.",,,,,"['stars',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-near-greenfield-village-dearborn,Comfort Inn Near Greenfield Village,3.5,$$,11,"Yes, I am giving a Comfort Inn a 5-star rating.And it is well deserved.I couldn't have been happier during my 2-night stay for the Martian marathon. The room was spacious, with all the amenities I needed (including a microwave that I couldn't use to make pop corn ""according to local security laws""....mmmk Wayne County...) and extra clean. There was a pool. Free continental breakfast (and GOOD coffee, no joke). Free wifi internet. And the location was super convenient for the race.BUTWhat really brings it to the top is service. The united-colors-of-Benetton (gotta love Dearborn's diversity!) staff was always smiling, welcoming and accommodating at any time of day or night. Ok, I didn't *really* check the state of things at 3 am but you get my drift. The best part?They offered a shuttle to and from the race, starting at 6 am in the morning. Yup, people got up extra early to take us dummies to our run. They even provided a little stool to get in and out of the van easily (which is really thoughtful when you think of the state of our poor legs after 26.2 miles). I was quite blown away.Oh, and five pillows on the bed?I am sold.This is an ok hotel. A bit worn but the king room with one sofabed was adequate for our needs.bad: room carpet dirty in spotstub and surround a worn lobby main entrance ""stuck"" open therefore cold lobby and breakfast areagood:helpful and responsive staffbreakfast was adequatepool was very warm and cleanWe stayed for two nights recently. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the free breakfast had a lot of variety. However....  There is a free shuttle, but I would not recommend taking it. We took it to Henry Ford Museum. The driver who took us was not friendly, and seemed to be annoyed that he needed to take us and another couple. When he dropped us off, he simply said to call the hotel when we were ready to come back, which we did. Long story short, we ended up waiting for 90 minutes for the shuttle. We were given the excuse that the driver, who was not the one who had dropped is off earlier, had waited for us at a different entrance and we weren't there. Maybe if we had been told that we would be picked up somewhere different than we were dropped off this wouldn't have happened? Frustrating. Also, although there are signs stating that it's a 100% smoke free hotel, the second floor smelled very strongly of fresh cigarette smoke on our secondafternoon here. They also charged our credit card for the stay despite our indicating that we would be paying cash at check out.Room was nice however, while sitting in the lobby waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, I accidentally nodded off. My mistake because I was tired after riding 1500 miles in two days on a motorcycle. The lady rudely told me to not fall asleep as it is disturbing the customers, of which there were none in the lobby. In the morning while eating breakfast, I say and listened to the manager and employees yell across the areas to communicate with each other. This was very disruptive. I do not recommend this hotelWe were pleased upon arrival but after that things went downhill. We had asked for information on transportation and were given blank looks and shrugs. We partook of the free breakfast and were sorely disappointed with the coffee. We were told that they have no control over the coffee machine. Then after a day of sightseeing, we came back to find that the keys didn't work and the room was not made up and it was nearly 6:00 pm! We had to ask for more coffee and clean towels. I would have to say this would not rank as a very good hotel experience.These people care. At first I was all upset w the difficulty of choicehotels gimcky discount program but local mger Brad made it right. Plus when their printer was down he let me print boarding pass in his office. Super close to greenfield village and very quiet. Is ready for remodeling but service more than makes up. A 10++We stayed for a hockey tournament.  Room had 1 King bed.  Clean and well appointed room with contemporary decorations and new case furnishings.  Housekeeping polite and attentive to needs and very efficient.  Complimentary hot breakfast with lots to choose from.  I loved the coffee.  Hotel was very busy but staff handled demand well during breakfast hours.  Close to Ford Headquarters and Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum.  Plenty of restaurants close by as well as a large shopping mall.  I would stay again.  The only thing I didn't like about room design was the entrance of the room incorporated the sink/vanity area of the bathroom, but toilet and shower at least had privacy of closed door.  My kids had a ball in the swimming pool.  Fitness room had good weight and cardio equipment and was not busy on the weekend.The hotel changed to a Comfort Inn. All of the rooms are non-smoking, but our room 301 must have been a smoking floor prior to the n/s rules, and 301 still smells of smoke. To the extent that I called the front desk to advise, so they don't hit me with a $250 charge for smoking in the room. We cracked the window open to get some fresh air, but it only opens a few inches.We couldn't keep the windows open for too long because there's a set of train tracks behind the hotel. That was a little noisy when a train would go by. Closing the windows helped a lot, except for the train whistle.The parking lot entrance doors need a key card to enter the hotel. But the door lock is broken on the door nearest our side of the building. Just a pull on the handle gets you inside the hotel.  They said it'll be fixed in a few days. I was surprised to see so many people checking in with cases of liquor and beer. The hotel was pretty quiet until about 3am. Things got quiet about an hour later. The flat panel TV was either 60 Hz, or they're not paying for HD service. The picture can be fuzzy. The hotel is clean, and they have the typical breakfast: waffle iron, eggs, sausage, cereals, pastries, etc.We had a great 2 night stay at the hotel.  Everyone at the front desk was friendly and very helpful.  We arrived early (11:00)and they let us in early ..that was great to have a few mins to rest before we headed off the Greenfield Village.  Their package deal to the Henry Ford saved us some $$ and the fee shuttle back and forth was well worth it.  The room was updated and very neat and clean.  Was impressed with the hotel overall.  Breakfast had a lot of hot and cold options.This was a very nice, clean hotel. And what more can one ask for really when your on the road? Clean rooms, decent breakfast and very friendly staff. A minor concern with the A/C was quickly taken care of and we felt comfortable staying there. Very close to Greenfield Village and the Ford Museum. Quite a few decent restaurants nearby. They have a museum ticket package available if you stay with them which saves you a few bucks.WOULD STAY AGAIN. First i would like to say with great service and a convenient shuttle it only makes it so easy to get cozy here.Thanks for a great stay great service and fresh hot cookies at the counter Kevin at the

http://www.yelp.com/biz/waterfront-hotel-downtown-windsor-windsor,Waterfront Hotel Downtown Windsor,3.0,$$,7,"Stayed here the other night because me and a few friends were going to a Redwings game. Great hotel, in a really nice location.It was nice having the bus stop right behind the hotel as we used the special transit to cross the river. The hotel itself is super clean and pretty up to date. My room had an amazing view of the river and Detroit. Comp breakfast in the morning was really good. It has a lot of great attractions around like the Cesar's casino and joe Louis arena.We got a fantastic rate as the hotel is undergoing renovations. The lobby is torn apart...wires hanging from the ceiling (behind the front desk), lobby restaurant closed, etc.The room itself, while the bed has been updated, still needed repairs..the wallpaper seams are visible (seperating), however it was totally eclipsed by the gorgeous view from the room.  Getting to the hotel from the parking garage was a challenge, as the pathway takes you through several doors and is maze-like (I now know how lab mice feel) ...the pathway dumps you in the lobby of the hotel next door (The Riverside Hotel)..we had to go outside and walk over to our hotel.The view of the Detroit River and skyline from the room was spectacular...it is obviously the biggest selling feature of the hotel.Pros:Very comfortable bedsThe female staff member who checked us in was fantasticThe viewNew carpetGreat water pressureFree WI-Fi ( which was decent for a hotel)Clean roomsConsDreadful pillows (perhaps the flattest I've ever encountered)Maze to the hotel from the parking lot (a $12 surcharge)Rooms needs updating (wallpaper)TV reception on some stations was awfulDidn't partake in the included bkfst.Would stay here again.Room was clean, view was AWESOME!Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast bar was ok, but it was free.I would stay here again no problem.I wanted to stay at the Caesars but was not willing to pay double the price as the Waterfront. So my boyfriend and I chose to stay here for the weekend. We booked the room with a partial view so it was an okay view. We got to visit our friend's room with the panoramic view and it was so nice! So I definitely agree with other TripAdvisor members that the view is spectacular.The hotel definitely needs a facelift because it is very old looking. The driveway entrance in front of the hotel is very small and will only allow 1-2 cars to be in it. However, there were cars parked in it so it's annoying to have to reverse out onto the road. Parking is $12 (plus tax) per day which is kind of lame because it's not even the hotel's property. You have to park in a parking garage across the street that is behind the hotel. Luckily they have a convenient back door for you to use.Our room was clean and was fully stocked with towels when we checked in. The bed was very comfortable to sleep in which was nice.The complimentary breakfast is definitely not worth waking up early for. Their sign in the lobby is very misleading. There are no sunny-side up eggs, bacon, or home fries. The breakfast buffet was pretty sad. There was sausage (which were dry and tasted below average), scrambled eggs (not made from real eggs AND had hair in it), yogurt, toast, english muffins, cereal, and waffles. I have to say that the complimentary breakfast at Holiday Inn was WAY better.I'm pretty sure once the hotel is renovated it would be much more appealing for guests. Also, if the hotel served better breakfast everything would be great.This hotel is gorgeous! It would normally be out of my price range, but I had a discount from a rewards booking site so I jumped on the opportunity to stay here. (It was listed as the Riverside Inn, but the old Riverside lobby forwarded all guests to the Waterfront Hotel.)All of the rooms have a view. I'm sure some are better than others, but it's safe to say there is not a bad view in the entire hotel. The view from the breakfast buffet is also amazing, even on a cloudy and rainy day.The rooms and hallways are in great condition. They are slightly worn, but not bad at all. I was shocked to read people criticizing ""marks on the walls"" in other reviews. If you are looking at the walls instead of the window view and judging wear and tear, then you have bigger problems than the slight wear on your hotel room.We stayed in a King room, and the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was huge. The furniture is all pretty dated with some dings, but it's still a great room with an amazing view.The breakfast is pretty cool, with a do-it-yourself waffle-maker and a small hot food selection. There is plenty of baked goods, bagels and toast, cereal and oatmeal. It was well stocked, even after 9:00am, and someone helped me when I didn't know how to use the waffle iron. The panoramic view is great.Housekeeping was friendly to us in the hallways and asked us if we needed anything every time we passed by in the hall. We also had a mini-fridge delivered to our room for free. Huge plus.Parking is $12 a day across the street, or free at Caesar's with a 5-10min walk. We decided to pay for parking and it was worth it, because we used the in and out privileges a lot. Do NOT take the elevator walkway from the parking garage to the hotel though... it is a long winding walk when you could just cross the outside street to the hotel.I would DEFINITELY stay here again, especially if I could find a good deal online. Great location and friendly staff, I highly recommend.Front desk staff need training on how to professionally deal with their customers.The view was beautiful.. looking at Ren center in Detroit.    Room was nice.   Extra charge 12 dollars to park.   Buffet free, however was picked over by 915 and not restocked...not even coffee.   16th floor.   Carpet in hallway falling apart.... marks on wall...that could be washed off....but housekeeping ignores .... pool room looks nice....Did not use.... lots if young people..  had to call security at 4 am...people in hallway would not quiet down.... security Did come up.",,,,,"['night', 'friends', 'going', 'game', 'great', 'hotel', 'really', 'nice', 'location', 'nice', 'bus', 'stop', 'right',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inns-warren-2,Red Roof Inns,1.0,$,5,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. In general I'm not too picky with hotels. Just want somewhere cheap, cheerful, and clean. We heard from a friend that this place had been renovated recently and was well priced so we thought we'd try it out while in town for a wedding. Huge mistake. Please - for the love of god - nevereverever stay here. We arrived late at night after a delayed flight and checked in. The smoke-free room stank of smoke and when I pulled back the sheets the bedding was crumpled - full of hair and various bits of unidentified debris. Fine - might have been a housekeeping oversight. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. We tried another room. And then another. Same in every room - unwashed sheets full of all kinds of hair. There was also very questionable activity occurring - screaming matches in the parking lot at 1am and I wouldn't have been surprised if the rooms were being rented out by the hour. A total hotel horror show. We ended up getting a room at the St Regis Hotel downtown and it was the best $109 dollars I've ever spent in my life. I nearly wept when I saw the clean sheets.In fairness the person at the front desk couldn't have been more polite or accommodating. She gave us a full refund for our prepaid room and apologized for our experience.I'd be giving negative stars if it were an option, bad service, rooms weren't very clean, loud outside screaming matches at 1am, room was pretty musty. Overall bad experience will not stay here again or another red roof inn. Management was very rude when I needed to renter my ""clean room"" to get something I was missing, clearly when it was right at my checkout time, which I think was wrong. Will not return.This is a slightly sketchy Red Roof off of 696 near the border with Hazel Park. While some other Red Roofs have gotten a make over and have posher furniture and decor, this place must have been overlooked. Basically, it's a dump. I stay in Red Roof hotels all the time, but this place is really bad. It smells, the carpet was dirty and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. When I talked to the manager no one came to clean the room. Really? There's a Ponderosa, a Bob Evans and a Mexican fast food place (Aztec something or other) within a block.I should give this place no stars as my husband and drove from California to here for a Special Event. We had drove into the lot which was being resurfaced so we couldn't park close to our rm. We were also unaware that this place had no elevators so we had to walk up stairs to a second floor to where our rm was as I walk into the rm I smell what smells like stale cigarette smoke well this place was supposedly smoke free rms well I went to desk to complain the lady at the desk was rude and she told me if I don't like it go to another motel. That's nice to say to a couple who is tired, hungry and just wanted a clean smoke free place to sleep. l asked for some Fabreeze as we had to spend one night there as we didn't check out so we would be charged for one night. We had planned on spending 5 days here, but they didn't seem to care about losing a customer. I was  told by a housekeeper that they didn't have Fabreeze, but was given 2 candles and a lighter. Well that didn't really help the smell I was so glad to leave the next morning and don't plan on going back to Michigan again. We found a better motel and they didn't allow smoking in rms and they were cleaner, we stayed the rest of our time at the Comfort Inn in Warren, Michigan. They even had a place for me to wash my clothes in the motel. The Red Roof Inn had no laundry on sight. I am very disappointed in this place and wanted to let others know so they don't go through what we did.Well, it's cheap, I'll say that much.  But honestly, if I'm going to pay 40 to spend the night here, I'd rather spend 80 to stay at a Holiday Inn or something.  Ok, things weren't nice, that's for sure.  The front desk person works in a little cubby behind bullet-proof glass.  My room had carpeting that was torn up, holes in the bedspread, and a black-out only option on the shades, which opened directly on the sidewalk and parking lot.  I.E. either have your shades open and the whole world is looking right in your window, or close the shades and have some pathetic little lamps on and feel like you're in prison.But that's not what really rubbed me the wrong way- my room was dirty.  Really dirty.  Grease and food left on the counter.  The bed was made with a little card saying how fresh and clean it was, but there was hair in it!  Many hairs!  Many different colors and lengths of hair!  Same in the shower.  Yuck!Very much yuck.  Not worth it.",,,,,"['give', 'place', 'zero', 'stars', 'general', 'picky', 'hotels', 'somewhere', 'cheap', 'cheerful', 'clean', 'heard', 'friend', 'place', 'renovated', 'recently', 'well', 'priced',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/detroit-marriott-renaissance-detroit,Detroit Marriott Renaissance,4.0,$$,4,"We had our wedding this past Saturday (10/17/15) at the nearby Waterview Loft and used the Marriott as our hotel to get ready in and for guests to stay. Everything was absolutely perfect! There was not a single issue, all the staff were so helpful and kind, the rooms were beautiful, the rose petals and champagne were a welcome surprise, and all our guests were overly impressed! Definitely a top notch hotel with amazing hospitality and and helpful, classy, and organized staff.Is it possible to have negative stars?  If so, then this place would have -4.  Upon check-in, with a large convention in town, there was one clerk at the desk. Finally, one more slowly strolled in. It didn't seem to phase either one that there was a line out the door.   The next day we came back to our room after lunch to find that the room was so filthy we couldn't believe it. The only way we were sure that housekeeping had been in was that the toilet tissue had been folded in the little triangle they do to prove they've been there.Great location, great on-site dining, great room views, very comfortable bed and absolutely amazing staff! First time to Detroit a few weeks ago and completely impressed with this place. I must say that 1 staff person in particular, Nekitta P., was so unbelievably accommodating, friendly and helpful upon check-in and throughout my stay. If she isn't a customer service manager or trainer, she should be. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Detroit!I stayed here for one night while a friend was playing a show, although I didn't get to spend much time in the room -- what time I did spend there was super nice. We ordered room service, and the burger was huge and juicy with perfect steak fries. The rooms were decorated comfortably, and the bed was big and poofy (perfect!) The view over into maple leaf land was nice, and looking out over the river was not a bad deal at all! Definitely could recommend this place if you ever find yourself in Detroit. It gets four and not five stars because I was running into the trade show traffic a lot and the parking was a bit of a pain.",,,,,"['wedding', 'past', 'nearby', 'loft', 'used', 'hotel', 'ready', 'guests', 'everything', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'single', 'issue', 'staff', 'helpful', 'kind', 'rooms', 'beautiful', 'rose', 'petals', 'champagne', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'guests', 'overly', 'impressed', 'definitely', 'top', 'notch', 'hotel', 'amazing', 'hospitality', 'helpful', 'classy', 'organized', 'staff', 'possible', 'negative', 'stars', 'place', 'upon', 'check', 'large', 'convention', 'town', 'clerk', 'desk', 'finally', 'slowly', 'strolled', 'seem', 'phase', 'either', 'line', 'door', 'next', 'day', 'came', 'back', 'room', 'lunch', 'find', 'room', 'filthy', 'believe', 'way', 'sure', 'housekeeping', 'toilet', 'tissue', 'folded', 'little', 'triangle', 'prove', 'great', 'location', 'great', 'site', 'dining', 'great', 'room', 'views', 'comfortable', 'bed', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'staff', 'first', 'time', 'weeks', 'ago', 'completely', 'impressed', 'place', 'must', 'say', 'staff', 'person', 'particular', 'unbelievably', 'accommodating', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'upon', 'check', 'throughout', 'customer', 'service', 'manager', 'trainer', 'definitely', 'back', 'night', 'friend', 'playing', 'show', 'although', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'room', 'time', 'spend', 'super', 'nice', 'ordered', 'room', 'service', 'burger', 'huge', 'juicy', 'perfect', 'steak', 'fries', 'rooms', 'decorated', 'comfortably', 'bed', 'big', 'perfect', 'view', 'maple', 'leaf', 'land', 'nice', 'looking', 'river', 'bad', 'deal', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'place', 'ever', 'find', 'gets', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'running', 'trade', 'show', 'traffic', 'lot', 'parking', 'bit', 'pain']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 5), ('staff', 4), ('perfect', 3), ('helpful', 3), ('great', 3), ('place', 3), ('definitely', 3), ('time', 3), ('show', 2), ('rooms', 2), ('find', 2), ('absolutely', 2), ('back', 2), ('guests', 2), ('impressed', 2), ('service', 2), ('stars', 2), ('hotel', 2), ('bed', 2), ('check', 2), ('amazing', 2), ('nice', 2), ('upon', 2), ('spend', 2), ('wedding', 1), ('trade', 1), ('four', 1), ('manager', 1), ('juicy', 1), ('rose', 1), ('folded', 1), ('finally', 1), ('location', 1), ('weeks', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('customer', 1), ('triangle', 1), ('views', 1), ('big', 1), ('possible', 1), ('lunch', 1), ('five', 1), ('desk', 1), ('bit', 1), ('day', 1), ('ever', 1), ('large', 1), ('bad', 1), ('either', 1), ('night', 1), ('steak', 1), ('view', 1), ('recommend', 1), ('deal', 1), ('past', 1), ('burger', 1), ('used', 1), ('parking', 1), ('leaf', 1), ('overly', 1), ('looking', 1), ('everything', 1), ('surprise', 1), ('champagne', 1), ('issue', 1), ('clerk', 1), ('completely', 1), ('although', 1), ('super', 1), ('river', 1), ('housekeeping', 1), ('hospitality', 1), ('first', 1), ('trainer', 1), ('throughout', 1), ('maple', 1), ('little', 1), ('prove', 1), ('top', 1), ('negative', 1), ('next', 1), ('much', 1), ('slowly', 1), ('way', 1), ('convention', 1), ('friend', 1), ('door', 1), ('nearby', 1), ('particular', 1), ('line', 1), ('believe', 1), ('must', 1), ('town', 1), ('kind', 1), ('accommodating', 1), ('fries', 1), ('say', 1), ('comfortably', 1), ('beautiful', 1), ('toilet', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/greektown-casino-hotel-detroit-3,Greektown Casino-Hotel,3.5,$$,17,"I arrived from California with my suitcase to meet friends at the greektown casino. I assumed a giant hotel/casino would have some place to check your things so you could go spend money at their establishment. This almost wound up ruining a Christmas reunion with friends I hadn't seen in a year because they wouldn't check my bag and wouldn't let me in with it. Wound up having to pay for an entire room just to put my backpack down. Terrible customer experience, bad business.Update: I was contacted and they were very apologetic to my circumstances and refunded us the cost of the room. The situation was handled by their customer service staff very professionally and timely. I may even be going back next weekend!Staff could be more attentive. Certainly not my ""go to"" casino, but it is on the list of casinos I will more than likely visit again. I have been here a number of times, thought it was finally time to post a review. Overall it's not bad, as I said I would visit again. However the staff could be more attentive and mindful of the mess around them.For example: one evening I was there the cleaning guy was flirting the entire night with the beer girl and ignoring the mess that was quickly building up in between the touch screen roulette kiosks.As for my contact with staff members, serves, bar tenders, etc... they were all positive and friendly. Tables in my opinion were fair. I've had nights where I've left here with money and nights where I left with nothing.** This is a GREAT place to come to for hockey games! park here for free, have a drink or play a little before the game. take the people mover to the arena and then come back and maybe gamble a bit more.**We had an excellent experience here! Service was fast and efficient. The hotel and room were very clean! The bed was comfy - the view from the room was beautiful! We ordered dinner and breakfast from room service and the food was excellent!! I have been to the casino many times it this was the first time staying at the hotel. I will definitely be back.IF YOU READ THIS, DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Stayed at the hotel for a few nights, and now I have the multiple bites you see in the pictures, and some I didn't take pics of. Don't think they're bedbugs, but the only time I wore short sleeves was while I slept since it was 10 degrees outside. If they turn out to be bedbugs, you better believe this hotel will hear about it. In addition, the pillows are awful and the towels feel like sandpaper. STAY AWAY, FOR YOUR SAKE.Meh, it was OK but a little pricey for the accommodations. Personally I didn't really dig this place. It's a little rundown and beat up and look likes it's been mugged. The fixtures look nice enough but overall it's just not as nice as it should be. The bed was mostly comfortable but the pillows are TERRIBLE! They're all extremely hard. The bathroom was small, there was no tub and the towels were just kind of stuffed into their shelf. Room service was pretty quick though. Prices for midnight snacks were standard and their quesadillas are pretty good. I'd pass on the chicken strips next time though. It's definitely about the location here rather than dazzling the guests. If you wanna be downtown and stay in the heart of the action this is probably your best bet, but for my money I'd rather stay at Motor City and Uber over when the fun ends.Stayed two nights while attending the auto show. Nice lobby with helpful staff once you get their attention. . Rooms contemporary and nice. Probably not the casino's fault, however, but the walls between rooms seem to be paper thin as the sound one night from a room full or party goers next door was too much to take. You could hear everything through the walls so be careful what you say... or do!!!I guess that's collateral damage from a hotel being attached to a casino. Too many imbibers looking to party hardy. Good breakfast buffet also. At $259/night it was a bit pricey.It's by far the least classy $200 hotel downtown. Be ready for long check in and out lines, poor customer service and loud loud drunk casino patrons. If you're lucky you might even be staying next to some teenagers throwing a hotel party, or maybe even lucky enough to to be by the ice machine and elevator. Either way, your better off staying at MGM or even Motor City, sadly.. Oh and forget about Room Service.Smoky.  Staff does not seem happy to be there.  Typical casino experience, I suppose.Definitely the least attractive casino and hotel in the area, we chose greektown for our anniversary because it was close to a restaurant we wanted to walk to for dinner. Casino does not have a very ""classy"" feel to it, on the dirtier side. As for the room it was nice looking, however we were so lucky to be placed next to a wild party room that had to of had at least 15 people in it partying until at least 6am.  It literally sounded like they were outside of our window. Yelling, loud music, sexual noises, banging on walls, girl passed out in the hallway. Pretty sure it was just a big orgy going on. We called the desk 3 times to complain, and it was not early, the first time we called was 1am and then we called twice more and finally realized they did not seem to care about us, each time they said theyd ""send security to check it out"" and each time we heard security laughing in the hallway with them, at one point im pretty sure they even told them we were the ones that called. Very professional. Needless to say the noise never stopped. I was half tempted to go bang on their door at 8am just to wake them up so they'd know what it was like. My husband and i wanted a nice night away from home for our anniversary and definitely did not have that experience in your hotel. Could have been handled a lot different. Will pay the extra $ to stay at mgm or motor city next time.Staff was pleasant and accommodating. We arrived early and received our room with a nice view. The hotel was in a great location. Food places were within walking distance. The food court in the hotel had great options. I like the safety feature of using your room key in the elevators to go to your floor. The business center is nice and safe. It was accessible by room key only. The hotels downfall is that they could have a few extra restaurants, and the casino gaming was terrible. The slots were dated. They could use newer slot machines that pay. The machines were tighter than Batman's tights. Ijs.Nice hotel, nice location! Upon arrival we found that the valet service was fast, friendly and attentive which is what we encountered at check-in as well.  The hotel room itself had some slight signs of wear, but nothing to big to discourage another stay in the future...the bed and the pillows were comfortable, which is one of the more important things when staying away from home (in my opinion).  This will definitely be my ""go to"" hotel the next time we stay in Detroit!This is my go to casino when I go downtown love the new remodel more TVs more excitement. Love that it's around a lot of local bars. Also the parking garage is always a plus for free parking. The waitress staff is always on point and polite. The dealers are fun to play with and make it a fun experience. I've been to all the casinos and I prefer this one every time.The good:1: Friendly staff.2: Full casino: tables, machines, high roller area.3: Free parking.The needs to be improved:1: Not enough cashiers.2: Self parking hard to find: street signage lacking.3: Self parking too far from casino.4: Inside signage lacking: not clear.5: Poor ventilation: too much smoke lingers.A few weeks ago, I left a negative review for this company and their services on their old business page.  Since then, my opinion of their customer service (which is everything to me) has completely changed.  I had a corporate representative reach out to me via phone and he was able to not only apologize for my negative experience, but offer me a deal that made up for it.  I gladly took the deal after he also assured me that he would be speaking to the front desk associate that was checking me into their hotel.  I work very hard for my money.  When I spend it, I want to receive top quality and service for it.  The backbone of this establishment made sure that that is ultimately what I ended up walking away with. Thank you Greektown Casino-HotelI am from Detroit and was coming to town for a family vacation, I booked with greektown for their experience specificity to show my wife from out of town a good time.  We spent over $300 for a room.  The room did not have a working thermostat that we tried to call the front desk about FIVE TIMES, and they never answered (even when I tried calling from my cell phone and not my $300+ room) at check out I expressed my disappointment to Joseph who seemed ill equipped to deal with any complaint since he didn't even ask how my stay was. After I told him about room 2917 having a broken air conditioner on the 29th floor when it was 85 degrees and humid at night with NO ANSWER at the desk he gave me a cardFor Natalie the supervisor and said to call her, who has not returned my phone call STILL. I would NEVER RECOMMEND greektown casino EVER... An issue like the room temperature I can understand but with no concern/follow up or customer service solution after spending OVER $300 for ONE NIGHT... I find it completely unacceptable. More then anything the fact I spoke so highly of my hometown while fighting the negative winds the media brings was so quickly shut down by my experience here at Greektown Casino Hotel.When I am in Detroit this is where I stay, period. It is the spot. I don't gamble but my friends do. I don't drink anymore but when I did, I did it at the downstairs bar where I have been known to throw down an insane rap over a Karaoke beat before I fall down and have to be excorted to my room, yes the room, a suite with an enormous window veiw of Canada! If Sarah Palin can see Russia from her window then why can't I see Canada from mine? Then there is the humungous jacuzzi bathtub and if your like me you love a good gigantic bubble bath that is 2 feet tall running over and onto the floor with suds and I tip the maids well so it's all good, but for me I am 6'2 and some 240 pounds so I don't fit into some wimpy bathtub, so this tub is enough reason to have me coming back! Then there is room service that is out of this world. It's 3 AM, I am drunk and hungry so I pick up the phone (yes, this is when I used to drink) and I order the steak and lobster that ran me about a buck twenty ($120) I don't care though cause that's just par for the course, so speaking of course, I swear the server had to be a carnival world's strongest muscle man to pick that plate up off of his cart and I think I felt the floor shake a little when he dropped the giant silver platter with silver domed cover on the table! Then he lifted the dome and like a good rock band fogged out stage show steam came bursting out like a 3 fire alarm fire, my eyes bugged out like Large Marge as the steam cleared and I feasted my precious little pupils on the biggest lobster I may have ever seen. Red as a fire engine, this was a gorgeouse fish tank freak of nature that made the oversized baked potato and 20 some odd ounce slab of steak look like Davie next to Goliath! When my buddies got back to the room even drunker than me and several thousand dollars lighter after a night of gambling and swiping Amex Black cards like crazy people they even stopped dead in their tracks as they laid their eyes on the lobster carcus that took me 3 different eating sessions to finish. The next words out of my buddy Jay's mouth were very remarkable for a guy that just tried to pay a sushi chef to return to the fish restaraunt across the street for $10,000 dollars to make us sush, not more than 5 or 6 hours earlier, and I might add that was one stubborn sushi chef, he turned us down! He said, ""did you charge that to the room? I hope you know that you are paying for that!"" I did and it was worth every penny!We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Everything was clean, we had quick room service(cheap), and no issues. Would stay here again.

It had its good and not so wonderful moments. On the positive side:1.  Offer free coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day.  On the not so positive, they did not always keep the coffee filled.2.  There are free DVD rentals and a DVD player in the room.  3.  Free continental breakfast.  The food wasn't great but there is a nice selection from bananas, to sausage, to biscuits to eggs.4.  The front desk was very friendly.5.  Free Wifi and refrigerator in the rooms6.  Free USA Today in the mornings.7.  There is a gym and pool but they close at 10 PMOn the not so amazing side,1.  The bed was a bit hard and I did not have a good night sleep during my stay.2.  The location is fine but a little out of the way3.  The breakfast could be a little better.Overall, it is a good family hotel and for some business travelers fine.I had my worst travel experience in this hotel. I found some disgusting bedbugs in my room on the headboard of my bed. The reception desk guy promised to give me a new room for free for the rest of my stay. But  finally when I checked out they laughed and said it's hard to believe they said something like that! That was as painful as seeing bedbugs in my room.I could never meet the manager. The front desk guys told me they would contact him and would get back to me. Of course they never did.The bedbug was not my only problem. The second room I received had an issue as well. The window didn't close. I found it the next day when I got cold. Then they changed my room again. This room had a damaged safety box. But this time I refused to change the room.Let's start with the dingy and low light atmosphere when you walk in. Very depressing! Then the fact that I arrived at 3:15 pm and my room wasn't ready, had to be given another room and wait for the two girls to figure out what to do. Went to the room and it was hot, air conditioner was on high cool. Took out both air filters that were black and had to wash them in the shower. Put them back in and the room cooled off! Turned on the tv and it looked like snow, had hotel maintenance come in, they were going to have someone look at it, no one came in 3 days!!!!!! Every night I had to run the bathroom vent and keep the door closed because of the cigarette smell from another room, I don't smoke!!!! The two girls in the lobby love to be on there phones so get use to it, and they will tell you it's not there job to make coffee or cookies, just to look good!!! I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy, I travel all over the world, worst hotel ever!oStayed here over the 4th of July weekend, and I have to say this is by far the worst Holiday Inn Express I have stayed in.The A/C is very inconsistent, making it hard to keep a stable temp throughout the entire room.  I was in the main bed by the window and was freezing all night, while those at the other end of the room near the entrance door were sweating it out.  No fun.Carpet in the room was dingy throughout, which made me very thankful that my baby is just that, and not a toddler who would want to be crawling all over the place.We reserved a suite with a ""wet bar"", though the sink was not functional when we got there.  The carpet in front of the sink was soaked due to an apparent leak in the drain piping, so staff simply turned off the water supply so that we could not use it rather than fix the issue.  I asked to have it fixed, but staff waited until 4 pm the next day to take care of the issue, which was a very inconvenient time for us.I have a cat, and I have to say that the first floor near the breakfast area/pool smelled like an over-full litter box.  There is no other way to describe it.  Staff stated that there was ""an accident"" in one of the bathrooms nearby, but I can't imagine what could have made such a stench.  Perhaps Sigfried and Roy stopped by with some tigers?  We'll never know.  Staff tried to remedy the smell with febreeze and similar, but it honestly just smelled like a flowery litter box after that.The coup de grace was the fact that on Saturday morning, the hotel decided to have their entire parking lot sealcoated and restriped.  We left for the day and had to drive our car around cones/under caution tape to exit the parking lot as the contractors closed it off without asking anyone to move their car.  There was no sign/notice in the lobby, and the girl at the counter had no idea why they were sealcoating that day, nor when it would be complete.  When we returned in the afternoon, there was a single parking spot available at the front of the building since the entire back lot was roped off.  Good thing we had a room at the complete opposite end of the hotel...About 2 hours later, we were told by family that we needed to move our car ASAP because the contractors needed to sealcoat where we had parked.  This conversation was punctuated by several calls to our room from the front desk asking us to do the same.  Seriously?The remainder of the evening was spent basking in the sweet scent of fresh tar mixed with the aforementioned litterbox stench on the first floor.I get that it's a Holiday Inn, and not the Ritz, but the facility needs some major fixing up, no question about it.  Staff was accommodating and the breakfast was good, which were certainly the only high points of this visit.  I can't say I'll be staying at a Holiday Inn (at least not this one) again any time soon.This Holiday Inn has location going for it.  It's right off the highway, close to the airport without being right in the flight path and there are easily a dozen restaurants within a mile or two.  I give three starts because I've stayed in better Holiday Inn Expresses.  It was clean.  The staff were friendly enough.  The a/c left something to be desired in my room and it was completely non-functional in the second floor hallway.  Coming up the stairs (right by the side entrance, which was convenient) and turning down the hall, it was like going through a sauna to get to my room.  I was there for three days and it was like that the entire time.The fridge in my room was huge, which was great for leftovers.  The bathroom was stocked up with the usual supplies, which I've grown fond of (this was easily the 20th night I've stayed at a HIE this year).  Everything smells like cinnamon.  Their lotion, shampoo, soap, conditioner - cinnamon.  My TV left a lot to be desired.  In all seriousness, I think it got 15 channels.  ESPN was not one of them, nor was the Gold Channel.  This is a problem for me.The breakfast was average-to-slightly-above-average.  There was plenty of coffee (to augment the single bag I received in my room - come on, guys, you need to leave two minimum).  There was meat and biscuits and surprisingly tasty cheese omelets.  I would have liked more fruit, or at least something besides bananas.It's pretty likely that I'll return to Detroit before the end of the year, and I could see me staying here again.  I may not simply because I'm in the room a lot and I'd like TV and an a/c that really works well.Also, there were kids in the pool/hot tub area at 9:30p.  Put your kids to bed at a decent hour so the adults can enjoy the hot tub, people!  Ha!  What an old man I've become.  Seriously, though, some piece and quiet in the last hour of hot tub operation would have been awesome.  *sigh*Stayed here for one night. Given that I used 10,000 Priority Club points (that are otherwise worth e.g. a $25 iTunes store gift card) for this one night, I was very happy with this place.Only one complaint: which was that there were no recycling bins. (I'd just come over from a crabby hotel in Canada, but which had recycling bins.) I guess it would just be too un-American to recycle.Came down for a wedding, and this option seemed to have the best reviews.  The staff were very friendly, especially the front desk clerk Katie.  We arrived early because we still had to get ready for the wedding even though check in was 3pm.  After giving her the confirmation number I was given when I made the reservation, she said it had been cancelled.  After researching it, she found out it was an obvious mistake, and corrected it giving us a just cleaned room allowing us to check in 3 hours early instead of waiting until 3.  The room was nice and comfortable, everything worked great.  The wired ethernet jack is an added plus.  The breakfast bar was good, and had quite the selection and was constantly being replenished.  Overall, the staff was very good, and I would definitely come back.Looked great from the outside but the interior halls and dining areas were quite dark. We reserved a suite to accommodate my wife and me along with our two teenage grandchildren. Our room was a great distance in the back corner of the hotel. As we got closer to the room, all the hallways had a peculiar smell and were very humid. There were fans in several locations blowing air out through open windows. There were three broken windows in the hallway outside our room. And a busted door and lock on a nearby room looked like some kind of brawl had recently taken place there. Between the smell and humidity, my wife refused to stay there. When we returned to front desk to say we were leaving, the manager offered a different suite. One of their best suites on the first floor at no increase in rate. That room was fine. Still a bit humid. Complete with a whirlpool tub which we did not use. Towels were quite small for a room with a whirlpool tub.Went to get ice. First floor machine at the other end of the building was out of order. Got ice on the second floor. The next day the machines on all three floors were out of order. The lady tending to the breakfast saw me holding the bucket and gave me some ice. Food was okay. The staff was friendly and courteous.Just spent another week here in January 2011 and not much has changed. Clean rooms, great staff and nice place to stay on a business trip.If it were not for the auto show in town, I probably would not have found this gem. I would have given it a 5 but the television is all jacked up. I mean I sometimes get certain channels and some I don't even get anything other than the local channels. No clue why, or what time, or anything, it just happens randomly.The rooms are clean, comfortable and I love the fact that they have a 24 hour gym, which I sadly have not taken full advantage of, but it is available, but it has been packed every time I want to use it.The front desk girl that I got checked in with when I got here was kind of hot too. I am thinking a Middle Eastern girl. Spoke to her multiple times over the last few days, smart, cute, and talks to me, what a keeper!The morning breakfast is edible and does not give me bad gas, the cleaning folks leave my shoes where I left them and also my socks. I don't like people touching my shit, especially if I leave it at a specific location. Just come in, make my bed and leave. That is what they are supposed to do, not clean up my clothes.I would stay here again if downtown is packed. Front Desk Girl makes the trip worth it!I went here for an anniversary. Our room was spotless. We got a suite with a two-person jacuzzi tub  (which was also spotless!) There were no funny smells either. The gym was small but had nice equipment and two large TVs. Breakfast was great and fresh. Staff was nice. The inside of the lobby and really the whole hotel is beautiful. They have a decent 'library' of DVDs and books that you can check out (with your room key) at any time of day. My husband and I loved this hotel, and anytime we want to get away for a weekend, we will go back!",,,,,"['fundamentally', 'sound', 'hotel', 'good', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'positive', 'side',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/americas-best-value-inn-dearborn,America's Best Value Inn,1.5,$,8,"This is a hotel made by Satan. I don't know where to start with this. The building itself is about 6 years overdue for being torn down. It resembles less of a hotel and more of a crack house.  The baths won't drain so be prepared to take a shower in while taking a bath. And the water tastes like rust. I think I might have contracted a rare African sickness while staying here. The customer service isn't awful. That's why it gets 2 stars.They don't really deserve one star I need to get what I am paying for Their TV Screen isn't clear &amp; I hade to call the room service to tell them I can't spend my night without a tv cuz there was only three channels so they can to bring another TV that was worst any way don't really recommend this hotel it smells bad too &amp; old   &amp; expensive.We originally checked into room 317 after booking a Jacuzzi room online for our first wedding anniversary. We wanted to go cheap since we really just wanted a place to have a relaxing bath together and have sex in peace. Being from out of town there isnt much opportunity to have private time in the houses of family that hasn't seen us in years lol.We knew we wouldn't be getting frills but cheap does NOT equal dirty. Room 317 had tiles missing above the bath tub, a missing fire alarm that was just a bundle of wires hanging down, and no safety latch on the door. We didn't look any more after that. The jacuzzi was just barely bigger than a standard tub as well.  There was barely enough room for the bed in the tiny room and the tv was ancient. The front desk clerk really didn't want to switch our rooms but after a bit of pushing about safety he did. As soon as we opened the door to our new room I could see why. This room is better by leaps and bounds. The tub is big enough for 2, the room itself is much larger with a table and chairs, and a flat screen tv. Though not without fault as there is a huge water stain on the ceiling, unfinished walls in the closet, a toilet like those seen in public restrooms, and yellow drips down the walls that can only be years buildup of rat piss dripping down with all the water leaks. There's a smoke alarm in this room but it's missing the battery so it's useless. We booked online for $15 less than rack rate so they stuck us in the shitiest room possible. This place is a disgusting accident waiting to happen run by dirty people who are a bad mark on all of the lovely America's Best that we have stayed at in the past. It will work for what we need (sex) but I won't be surprised if we wake up covered in bed bug bites.Stay away. Unless you like the smell of curry and mold.I also had to post this from my phone because free WiFi means no working WiFi.HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!  You have been warned. 1. The elevators are so beaten up. They could easily paint it, but they obviously do not care about appearances.2. The hallway smelled like my dog when he has been outside too long and needs a shower.3. The signs everywhere say non smoking, but as soon as we stepped into the room, we were choked with the smell of cigarette smoke. Also, people were smoking marijuana in the room next to us.4. The main wall had water damage and markings up and down the wall. 5. The mattress felt worn out. I could feel the springs and it had barley any cushion. 6. The restroom ceiling was literally falling down.7. The tile grout was stained black and when we turned on the pipe to take a shower, a long snake-like bug came out the pipe. We called the staff to catch it and remove it, then we asked for our money back and went to the Wyndham near the airport instead. I would NEVER stay here again!! Yuck! They should be ashamed of this establishment!!This place is downright horrible. The pictures online while i was making a reservation were deceiving. The entrance was very dirty. The elevator looked disgusting, like it wasn't cleaned since installed. The beds were the only things tht looked ok and the non smoke room stank of smoke and mildew. I probably will never stay at an American best value inn, ever. This experience ruined the whole chain for me.Old TV, soft beds, tiny closet, big bathroom, no fridge or microwave. It wasn't bad if your primary purpose for staying is to sleep. Otherwise the single I was in was very cramp without much. The biggest free space was the bathroom.Had the unfortunate experience of staying here one night when our AC broke. For $50 I got a 20 year old 20"" tv that made me wonder what I was paying for. I think the best part was the HBO lineup info next to the ancient artifact tv and an imprint that looked like maybe at one point there was a flat screen in there on the wall instead. It seems they do not have the money to put the work into it and unfortunately that makes it difficult to ever make the choice to stay there again. I said it is moderately priced because motel 8 would be cheaper.This place doesn't even deserve a star. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We decided to stay here because it was cheap and close. Once we checked in, the lady behind the desk was really friendly, but misleading. She told us that our room had a brand new, updated flat screen tv. But, it had a very old 32'' tv. We were only in our room for abt 5 mins, when we were told that we had to move to another room because someone else had already reserved it. (strike 1). So, in our new room, I decied to take a bath. Before i ran the water, I noticed that the molding around the tub wasn't all the way dry. So once water entered the tub, it leaked all the way to the first floor. So we had to switch rooms again. (strike 2). Then we got another room down the hall, which seemed much smaller. Everything was basically pushed together. So to add on to my anger with this hotel, the air did not work and the tv only got 3 channels.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/royal-dearborn-hotel-dearborn,Royal Dearborn Hotel,3.0,$$,7,"This place is like an undercover shitty hotel. Everything is super fancy and the prices of everything in it is kind of outrageous for a place that doesn't even offer a refrigerator or microwave in the hotel room. Everything outside of the room however is really nice, such as the pool/workout area and the ballrooms.WORST HOTEL EVER!Want half the listed amenities, scowling, unhappy and incompetent staff with no discount?Look no further! The management doesn't know what works or doesn't in the hotel, they make promises they DONT keep. They have the nerve to accuse guests without confirming accusations and will try to charge extra to your room.  The pool is ice cold, hot tub and sauna broken with no fix date in site.  Staff complain out loud to themselves whilst completing their duties.Worst vacation EVER.   Do yourself a favor and don't go here.  Hotel smelled of illegal substances, breakfast waitress took our money then told us we didn't pay!! Paid for late checkout and was locked out of room.  I could go on but it upsets me and I think you get the point. Avoid at all costs. New management has ruined this place.Please please please reconsider reserving a room at this hotel. The entrance or lobby area is totally misleading...the beautiful Palm trees, the elevator, and the ample space gives the impression that this hotel just may be a 4 star facility...let me provide an analogy that best describes this place...it's a cheap bottle of beer dressed up as champaign (miller lite/Cristal). You can fool me with the bottling but I get it!!!! So yeah I got a taste of the Royal blah...and I totally know what this is after the experience. It's a dressed up motel charging 4star hotel prices. We paid 145 dollars plus the 50 dollar hold for incidentals. Save the $$$$ and get a room at a Days Inn. As I write this review I'm praying that there are no critters beneath me.After reading a few other reviews on other sites, I have to agree that the lobby is WAY nicer than the actual room.  There aren't refrigerators, despite what you might read on websites; however you can rent one for 10.00 a day (gouging).  There isn't a microwave either.  If you want coffee in the middle of the night, too bad; they do not have coffee to offer late nighters.  But if you want sugary lemonade then it is in abundance.  It is very difficult to sleep here when it seems like you're sleeping in the mezzanine, since you can hear every conversation going on outside your door, and people are a bit inconsiderate when you hear children running and screaming right outside your door as well.  From first impressions you'd think this place is super nice, but once you settle in you kind of realize that it isn't as great as you'd thought.  The pool is ok, but the spa wasn't working and I didn't even get to relax in a hot tub at all.  The front desk staff kind of acts irritated that they have a guest.  I stayed in a Days Inn just a few days prior to staying here, and it was actually better in a lot of ways, and much much cheaper. The experience of staying here isn't the worst, but next time I will opt for somewhere different and a lot less expensive.  Not even a free breakfast, Geesh!I stayed here for two days. It was a great price for a clean hotel room. We slept well and the hotel restaurant was greatI would give this place a 4.5 stars if i could but the friendliness of the hotel staff tipped me over. Stayed here with my family for 2 nights and it was great. When we checked in Kimberly at the front desk was friendly and helpful. Then about 10 min after we got to our room she called our room and asked if everything was ok...talk about customer service. The rooms was clean and big, but didn't have a mini-bar or fridge. The restaurant Giulio &amp; Sons on the 2nd floor is worth eating at. Another plus was that our room faced the Henry Ford Museum so we got to catch 4th of Julu fireworks show! The only real ""negative"" for out-of-towers is its location. Aside from the Henry Ford compound and a mall you're not too close to any means of transportation or anything else.",,,,,"['place', 'like', 'undercover', 'shitty', 'hotel', 'everything', 'super', 'fancy', 'prices', 'everything', 'kind', 'outrageous', 'place', 'offer', 'refrigerator', 'microwave', 'hotel', 'room', 'everything', 'outside', 'room', 'however', 'really', 'nice', 'pool', 'workout', 'area', 'ballrooms', 'worst', 'hotel', 'ever', 'half', 'listed', 'amenities', 'scowling', 'unhappy', 'incompetent', 'staff', 'discount', 'look', 'management', 'know', 'works', 'hotel', 'make', 'promises', 'keep', 'nerve', 'accuse', 'guests', 'without', 'confirming', 'accusations', 'try', 'charge', 'extra', 'room', 'pool', 'ice', 'cold', 'hot', 'tub', 'sauna', 'broken', 'fix', 'date', 'site', 'staff', 'complain', 'loud', 'whilst', 'completing', 'duties', 'worst', 'vacation', 'ever', 'favor', 'hotel', 'smelled', 'illegal', 'substances', 'breakfast', 'waitress', 'took', 'money', 'told', 'pay', 'paid', 'late', 'checkout', 'locked', 'room', 'upsets', 'think', 'point', 'avoid', 'costs', 'new', 'management', 'ruined', 'place', 'please', 'please', 'please', 'reconsider', 'reserving', 'room', 'hotel', 'entrance', 'lobby', 'area', 'totally', 'misleading', 'beautiful', 'palm', 'trees', 'elevator', 'ample', 'space', 'gives', 'impression', 'hotel', 'star', 'facility', 'let', 'provide', 'analogy', 'best', 'describes', 'place', 'cheap', 'bottle', 'beer', 'dressed', 'champaign', 'miller', 'lite', 'fool', 'bottling', 'yeah', 'taste', 'royal', 'blah', 'totally', 'know', 'experience', 'dressed', 'motel', 'charging', 'hotel', 'prices', 'paid', '145', 'dollars', 'plus', 'dollar', 'hold', 'incidentals', 'save', 'room', 'days', 'inn', 'write', 'review', 'praying', 'critters', 'beneath', 'reading', 'reviews', 'sites', 'agree', 'lobby', 'way', 'nicer', 'actual', 'room', 'refrigerators', 'despite', 'read', 'websites', 'however', 'rent', 'day', 'gouging', 'microwave', 'either', 'coffee', 'middle', 'night', 'bad', 'coffee', 'offer', 'late', 'nighters', 'sugary', 'lemonade', 'abundance', 'difficult', 'sleep', 'seems', 'like', 'sleeping', 'mezzanine', 'since', 'hear', 'every', 'conversation', 'going', 'outside', 'door', 'people', 'bit', 'inconsiderate', 'hear', 'children', 'running', 'screaming', 'right', 'outside', 'door', 'well', 'first', 'impressions', 'think', 'place', 'super', 'nice', 'settle', 'kind', 'realize', 'great', 'thought', 'pool', 'spa', 'working', 'relax', 'hot', 'tub', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'kind', 'acts', 'irritated', 'guest', 'days', 'inn', 'days', 'prior', 'staying', 'actually', 'better', 'lot', 'ways', 'much', 'much', 'cheaper', 'experience', 'staying', 'worst', 'next', 'time', 'opt', 'somewhere', 'different', 'lot', 'less', 'expensive', 'free', 'breakfast', 'days', 'great', 'price', 'clean', 'hotel', 'room', 'slept', 'well', 'hotel', 'restaurant', 'give', 'place', 'stars', 'friendliness', 'hotel', 'staff', 'tipped', 'family', 'nights', 'great', 'checked', 'front', 'desk', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'min', 'room', 'called', 'room', 'asked', 'everything', 'talk', 'customer', 'service', 'rooms', 'clean', 'big', 'mini', 'bar', 'fridge', 'restaurant', 'amp', 'sons', '2nd', 'floor', 'worth', 'eating', 'another', 'plus', 'room', 'faced', 'henry', 'ford', 'museum', 'catch', '4th', 'fireworks', 'show', 'real', 'negative', 'towers', 'location', 'aside', 'henry', 'ford', 'compound', 'mall', 'close', 'means', 'transportation', 'anything', 'else']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 11), ('hotel', 11), ('place', 6), ('staff', 4), ('everything', 4), ('days', 4), ('worst', 3), ('please', 3), ('outside', 3), ('great', 3), ('kind', 3), ('pool', 3), ('microwave', 2), ('much', 2), ('late', 2), ('coffee', 2), ('know', 2), ('front', 2), ('like', 2), ('ever', 2), ('however', 2), ('tub', 2), ('super', 2), ('experience', 2), ('think', 2), ('management', 2), ('area', 2), ('desk', 2), ('door', 2), ('lot', 2), ('ford', 2), ('hear', 2), ('prices', 2), ('restaurant', 2), ('henry', 2), ('inn', 2), ('breakfast', 2), ('offer', 2), ('hot', 2), ('plus', 2), ('nice', 2), ('staying', 2), ('clean', 2), ('paid', 2), ('totally', 2), ('lobby', 2), ('well', 2), ('dressed', 2), ('impression', 1), ('acts', 1), ('less', 1), ('money', 1), ('despite', 1), ('cheap', 1), ('4th', 1), ('whilst', 1), ('sleep', 1), ('cold', 1), ('praying', 1), ('children', 1), ('scowling', 1), ('bottling', 1), ('somewhere', 1), ('fix', 1), ('extra', 1), ('royal', 1), ('gouging', 1), ('unhappy', 1), ('day', 1), ('charge', 1), ('going', 1), ('location', 1), ('save', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('fool', 1), ('customer', 1), ('running', 1), ('analogy', 1), ('ample', 1), ('means', 1), ('read', 1), ('champaign', 1), ('workout', 1), ('fridge', 1), ('trees', 1), ('cheaper', 1), ('shitty', 1), ('sons', 1), ('accuse', 1), ('half', 1), ('amp', 1), ('bit', 1), ('screaming', 1), ('complain', 1), ('relax', 1), ('bar', 1), ('called', 1), ('try', 1), ('bad', 1), ('settle', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-shorecrest-motor-inn-detroit,The Shorecrest Motor Inn,3.0,$,6,"The 'Crest! Definitely not a luxury hotel, but it's a Detroit mainstay. Extremely convenient during DEMF weekend. The people that work there are firm with you, but ultimately nice. One thing that may annoy some people is the old cigarette smoke smell in many of the rooms. Be sure to be clear with them that you want a non-smoking room when you reserve. And I can't forget The Clique! Cheap, greasy and probably one of the best breakfasts in The D.Ended up here booking a ""3-star"" hotel on Hotwire. This place is a 2-star at best.The location is excellent, a block from the bike rental place on the Riverwalk and a short walk to everything downtown. The Clique restaurant in the hotel rules.I'm really, really, not picky. I love simple, basic motels, and never really do much more than sleep and shower in them. However, the deeply ingrained scent of smoke was terrible, and a dealbreaker. The only other place I've experienced anything like this was also in Detroit, at the Corktown Inn. There were no insulated cups to go with the coffee maker, and initially no full-sized towels in the room to boot.For the hell of it, I called Shorecrest the morning of the big Jimmy Buffet concert this past July, and shockingly, they had two rooms available (recent cancellations) so I took them, both!  One slept 6, the other 8...haha...  Both under $100.  Definitely sketchy rooms, old smoke smells, but seriously right downtown!!  Cab rides were less than $10..  I would stay here again, in a pinch, or to save a buck due to it's fantastic location.  I'm not sure I'd hang out at the room, or party...but it was fine for what we needed it to be, a place to crash, and park our cars.....why bother with the other BS when you can just stay here...  DO IT!!  :-)You don't really go to the Shorecrest for luxury - you go there because of the ambiance.  I've been staying at this spot for the last 5+ years, religiously, when I am in town for the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (or whatever it is called from year to year).  Despite all the hassle they have to deal with from rowdy out-of-towner electronic music aficionados, the staff at the Shorecrest is incredibly kind and patient.  It brings a smile to my face every year when I make the usual call to reserve rooms and the woman at the front desk asks me if I want to book for my brother as well; yes, she remembers us every time.  I have much love for this spot, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for somewhere more upscale.  It's a decent (and safe) walk from all the festivities in Hart Plaza and the rest of downtown Detroit.  There is a cafe inside called The Clique, which is decent, but we usually prefer to drive down the road a bit to the Motown Cafe and Grill.Rates are stupidly cheap, but they tend to jack them up for DEMF weekend - be warned to book far in advance as the rooms fill very quickly.It's the place to be when your attending DEMF (Detroit Music Festival). It's cheap, our bathroom tub was huge for all thos late night sex parties, and the diner below serves up some midwest breakfasts. All the cabbies know where it is when you need that 5 am ride home from The Works or need to get picked up to go to Old Miami at 7 am. It's sleazy, easy, and to the point. Hopefully you won't get stuck next to the tweeker guy we did last time. He was more cracked out than half of San Francisco. The ladies at the front desk are there every year and it's only thirty bucks more to stay and sleep that extra late afternoon on Monday when your finally coming down. Unlimited towels and a few block walk to the festival. You can even get a forty and chicken wigs two blocks the oppposite way of the festival. It's worth the walk to get booze to drink on the way. The 9 dollar Labbats beers at the festival suck. Get drunk at the hotel first. Reserve early for the festival. This hidden gem sells out fast!We were in the motor City for 2 nights and stayed at this property . It is a family run operation . Check in and out were quick . The property is older but clean and within walking distance to Ford Field, Comerica Pk, Cobo Hall ect . THe room could use a makeover but as indicated was clean with fridge,air condt, and not far from the room a well stocked ice machine . Staff always had a smile and were able to give directions . THey have a diner style restaurant on the main floor that serves up great food and a good value .

Plus, the door didn't seal real well, so plenty of light came through at night from all 4 sides like it was the door to heaven, like in the movies. Good location though and very fairly priced. I would definitely stay here again when in Windsor.My wife and I stayed at this hotel a couple of times while on a small getaway and both times we enjoyed our stay. This hotel isn't in prime downtown location. It is situated about 7 minutes from downtown but is close to a lot of different restaurants and shops. For the price and service, I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a clean hotel. The service is always friendly and helpful. I have never had any issues with the staff or the cleanliness of our room. Great hotel!!I stopped by here on my way to Chicago and stayed for one night.  I didn't get to check out the amenities, but the friendly front desk made my late check in at 11pm a breeze.   The bathroom fan was pretty useless because the mirrors were foggy long after the shower was turned off.  The hotel includes free wifi, but it was too slow to stream YouTube videos.The hotel itself is located along the main road leading to the bridge between Canada and the U.S., which was very convenient if you're passing through.  If I was passing through here again, I'd come back to this Holiday Inn.Didn't stay at the hotel, but ate at the 24 hour restaurant that is attached to it. Don't know what time it was, but the food hit the spot. I had a chicken club sandwich I think with fries. Sandwich was pretty good from what I remember. Have no idea about prices. I actually don't recall who paid the bill. I do remember we were the only ones in the place though.",,,,,"['visit', 'hotel', 'choice', 'rooms', 'always', 'clean', 'staff', 'always', 'courteous', 'plenty', 'parking', 'people', 'towing', 'boats', 'vacation', 'busy', 'road', 'leads', 'bridge', 'outlet', 'mall', 'road', 'safety', 'deposit', 'boxes', 'charge', 'never', 'bad', 'experience', 'highly', 'recommend', 'holiday', 'inn', 'located', 'close', 'ambassador', 'bridge', 'downtown', 'staff', 'polite', 'front', 'desk', 'helpful', 'hotel', 'well', 'maintained', 'rooms', 'clean', 'front', 'desk', 'area', 'large', 'first', 'floor', 'also', 'accommodates', 'bar', 'restaurant', 'pretty', 'average', 'around', 'value', 'great', 'staff', 'friendly', 'rooms', 'bit', 'old', 'loud', 'people', 'hallways', 'plus', 'door', 'seal', 'real', 'well', 'plenty', 'light', 'came', 'night', 'sides', 'like', 'door', 'heaven', 'like', 'movies', 'good', 'location', 'though', 'fairly', 'priced', 'definitely', 'wife', 'hotel', 'couple', 'times', 'small', 'getaway', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'hotel', 'prime', 'downtown', 'location', 'situated', 'minutes', 'downtown', 'close', 'lot', 'different', 'restaurants', 'shops', 'price', 'service', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'clean', 'hotel', 'service', 'always', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'never', 'issues', 'staff', 'cleanliness', 'room', 'great', 'hotel', 'stopped', 'way', 'night', 'check', 'amenities', 'friendly', 'front', 'desk', 'made', 'late', 'check', 'breeze', 'bathroom', 'fan', 'pretty', 'useless', 'mirrors', 'foggy', 'long', 'shower', 'turned', 'hotel', 'includes', 'free', 'slow', 'stream', 'videos', 'hotel', 'located', 'along', 'main', 'road', 'leading', 'bridge', 'convenient', 'passing', 'passing', 'come', 'back', 'holiday', 'inn', 'hotel', 'ate', 'hour', 'restaurant', 'attached', 'know', 'time', 'food', 'hit', 'spot', 'chicken', 'club', 'sandwich', 'think', 'fries', 'sandwich', 'pretty', 'good', 'remember', 'idea', 'prices', 'actually', 'recall', 'paid', 'bill', 'remember', 'ones', 'place', 'though']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 9), ('staff', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('pretty', 3), ('friendly', 3), ('desk', 3), ('front', 3), ('always', 3), ('road', 3), ('downtown', 3), ('bridge', 3), ('clean', 3), ('location', 2), ('holiday', 2), ('good', 2), ('helpful', 2), ('like', 2), ('night', 2), ('people', 2), ('close', 2), ('never', 2), ('great', 2), ('restaurant', 2), ('times', 2), ('passing', 2), ('service', 2), ('recommend', 2), ('door', 2), ('inn', 2), ('check', 2), ('located', 2), ('sandwich', 2), ('though', 2), ('plenty', 2), ('remember', 2), ('well', 2), ('definitely', 2), ('ambassador', 1), ('leads', 1), ('chicken', 1), ('enjoyed', 1), ('issues', 1), ('busy', 1), ('also', 1), ('actually', 1), ('late', 1), ('charge', 1), ('real', 1), ('hit', 1), ('around', 1), ('food', 1), ('couple', 1), ('choice', 1), ('boxes', 1), ('ones', 1), ('fan', 1), ('outlet', 1), ('bit', 1), ('prime', 1), ('heaven', 1), ('bar', 1), ('accommodates', 1), ('large', 1), ('bad', 1), ('stopped', 1), ('small', 1), ('courteous', 1), ('restaurants', 1), ('old', 1), ('fries', 1), ('back', 1), ('seal', 1), ('situated', 1), ('cleanliness', 1), ('hallways', 1), ('safety', 1), ('free', 1), ('slow', 1), ('along', 1), ('come', 1), ('ate', 1), ('experience', 1), ('plus', 1), ('loud', 1), ('think', 1), ('first', 1), ('highly', 1), ('maintained', 1), ('idea', 1), ('bathroom', 1), ('videos', 1), ('area', 1), ('leading', 1), ('visit', 1), ('vacation', 1), ('long', 1), ('anyone', 1), ('towing', 1), ('lot', 1), ('amenities', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-greenfield-inn-allen-park,Best Western Greenfield Inn,3.5,$$,25,"When this place was being built it was an eye-catching sight.  A raspberry and cream Victorian dream gleaming on the Detroit skyline. I never had a reason to try it because I live too close, but a gift certificate changed that. The place is located near a storage unit in an industrial park and is a stone's throw to Fairlane Green, a shopping center with anything you could want that you forgot to pack. Nearby is the Henry Ford, Michigan's premier attraction. The interior sticks to the pink trend.  It's kind of an Eighties Victorian theme with lots of old car ads lining the walls. The rooms are worn but well-appointed for the business traveler. Irons, Keurigs, mini fridge, etc. We had Room 122 and that one is close to everything-the pool, the lobby, and the restaurant.There's a business center and a small arcade. And a bar in house. The restaurant, O'Henry's, elevates this place to four stars. The breakfast was wonderful!Don't bother with this place.  The service is TERRIBLE!!!!  Stayed here a few times but over Christmas was the worst.  The room card key reader failed so maintenance was called to change the battery.  We left for the day but when we returned at 11 pm, the room door was ajar and all our stuff was gone from the room.  No call, no note, no nothing!!!   We called the front desk and they knew nothing about except to tell us there was a bunch of stuff in the office.  We went down to the front desk only to find all our stuff on a dirty luggage cart in an insecure room off the lobby. My wife's personal items were put in a plastic bag, our clothes were draped on the rack and my CPAP machine was sitting directly on the dirty cart!   GROSS!!!!  The clerk knew nothing about it and they had to put us in a new room. When I asked for the GM the next morning, I was told he would not call me but I should try to call him on Monday.  Seriously????  The place is very trashy and dirty.  The rugs were soiled, there were ladders outside so the anyone could break into a window and it was gross.  You would be better off staying in your call.  Don't let the cute exterior fool you.  It is a horrible place!!!It's a bit noisy at this time, and the building is old. Apart from that everything is good. It is worth the money you pay, and is clean. I recommend it.New management and boy was it great! What an amazing experience! I definitely recommend this restaurant. The hotel and restaurant experience overall was so pleasant that I can't wait to come back. The helpfulness, cleanliness and delicious food are all reasons that I'll be back! Oh, and the fact that it's pretty and pink! Overall great experience.We were in Dearborn visiting the Henry Ford museum and Greenfield Village. Nice hotel somewhat dated but still very clean, staff was very nice and helpful, room had a microwave, mini fridge and my girlfriend was excited to see a Keurig machine in the room. I'm 6'2, and had to bend over to use the shower, that's my only complaint. We used <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> to book this room, it's located in a semi-industrial area, but very quiet. I was somewhat concerned that they lock all the gates to the parking lot after dark, except the one by the main entrance, obviously they've had issues with non guests in the parking lot, and this additional security is warranted, we were there 3 nights, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and it was quiet and our car was fine in the well lighted parking lot. I'm usually skeptical about restaurants that are attached to hotels but this one is a pleasant surprise, I wish we had gone earlier they had an excellent breakfast of great value, large serving and quite tasty.Very nice rooms. Good rate. Friendly and helpful staff. Had breakfast at restaurant on site and it was good.Time for my first vacation of the year, so I check out <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FExpedia.com&amp;s=97a626974b048288cd55b0dd9e7766c0818e8160dff5a4ced59fe49339fdf839"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Expedia.com</a>.  I found this one online.  I just couldn't say no.  It's big and it's pink and it could be had for just $96/night.  So, I bought 3 nights.....It's looks like a Victorian Mansion on the outside and well, on the inside too.  Cool antiques all around.  Looks like you are walking into a real 1890's hotel.  This has everything I look for in a hotel.  To make it easy, let me just make a list for you:Great staffPleasant looking hotelClean inside and outNice reasonably priced full service restaurant on site - O'Henry'sNice Pub / Lounge too - Squire's PubMicrowave Oven in roomRefrigerator in room  Big Screen TVCold ACComfortable bedsPretty quite at night.No sketchy people to be seenNice inside courtyard with a gazeboPerfect location if you are going downtown or to the Henry Ford / Greenfield VillagePlus they gave me a discount coupon for 20% off my next visit.  Guess where I'll be staying next time?My boyfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Greenfield Inn for two nights while attending a music festival in downtown Detroit. We selected this hotel because it fit our budget while offering a safer locale than the cheaper Detroit hotels. We were on the whole pleased with our stay: our room was comfortable and well-appointed, and the location made it easy to get in/out without having to deal with parking, sketchy neighborhoods, or a border crossing, as would have been the case at comparably priced hotels nearby. My only disappointment was the sauna, which was barely warmer than room temperature.Oh yeah, and it's pink. Really, really pink.We, my wife and two daughters (14 &amp; 11) stayed one night this past weekend after attending the Christmas event at Greenfield Village. It had poured rain that night and we were all looking forward to a  quick dip in the pool and soak in the hot tub. We arrived at 9:30 PM and upon check-in am advised that kids under the age of 21 (!) are not allowed in the pool after 9:00 PM. The hotel was near empty no one in the pool area when we went by, and they were not willing to flex. Also, we discovered that the fitness room as not open to anyone under the age of 18. Strange rules. For the business traveller I would also caution that there aren't any proper workstations in the rooms either. Just a table that's too high to work at your laptop from. They tout themselves as offering a ""Victorian elegance"" experience. They are in such bad need of serious renovations that I would describe it as ""fleabag Victorian"". There was nothing elegant about this hotel and I would venture that Queen Victoria herself would not be amused!They haven't got a clue. Not staying here again.We stayed here due to an impending ice storm on the night we had tickets to Holiday nights at Greenfield Village. We got a great price on Hotwire and were pleased with the king room. There is a mini fridge, small microwave and keurig in each room. The bed was comfortable, the flat screen was nicely sized for the room. The bed was not amazing but comfortable enough with a large selection of pillows. The drapes closed tightly to keep the light out very well and the room was fairly quiet. For the price and proximity to The Henry Ford and Greenfield Village, I think it is likely we will stay here again.I recently stayed in the Executive Lafayette Suite (room 400) and it was glorious. The suite was incredible and completely worth the money. The bar was comfortable and friendly. They make a mean Manhattan with dried Michigan cherries. I scheduled a massage for my companion and she loved it. She frequently gets massages and said that it was fantastic. The pool and workout area was perfect. I personally appreciated the adult only hour that the pool had. A few laps with no kids around was just what the doctor ordered. The staff was professional and polite. Just up the road is a huge mall (Fairlane Green) with a Target, tons of restaurants and a thousand stores. I would suggest anyone stay there.Pink.  Perfect. Prime location.  Rooms are great with huge televisions.  Extremely cleanFriendly staff.Great food. Good bar.What more could you want.I was recently treated to a stay at this hotel in the Lafayette suite.  Oh my!  I can't say enough positive about it.   The suite itself was really more of a two bedroom/ two bathroom apartment.  It had a full kitchen with a full sized fridge, triple sink with garbage disposal, dishwasher, a microwave, a Keurig, stove, and oven.  Complete with dishes!  There was a dining room with seating for six.  The master bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable king sized bed with a ton of soft pillows and two built in vanities.  The main bath had a good sized soaker tub and the Jacuzzi tub was in the master bath.  And my favorite part...  I was able to bring my Australian Shepard with us.  The pool was wonderful (I really appreciated that there was an hour of adult only time).  It was nice to be able to relax without a bunch of kids around.  The workout room was better than I expected with a good selection of equipment.  I'll absolutely be returning.I just left this place a few hours ago after staying overnight.  One weekend a month my boyfriend and I try and find just a really basic and clean hotel to stay the night in to get away from our families.  Neither one of us make enough money to live on our own yet, so one night a month we splurge halfsies on a room.Our requirements are simple.  Internet and TV.  When we're together all we want to do is watch Netflix movies and TV shows.  We ended up paying close to $100 for a room which was a little out of our budget.  We chose it because from the outside it looked like it was really well kept.  The rooms, lobby, and hallways were very clean looking so we felt as though we picked well.  Unfortunately, everything we picked it for failed us.Our game plan was to watch Arrested Development off Netflix until The Walking Dead was on AMC.  Then we'd watch another episode or two before going to bed.  In theory, great idea, but neither one of those things happened.The internet in the hotel is awful.  We had a connection that was 1/5 bars, if that, and kept cutting out and failing.  We complained to the desk.  The attendant behind the desk admitted that people complained all the time that the internet didn't work, and their receiver boxes always broke, were really cheap, and never worked right.  I asked if they had any other ones to use.  Come to find out when I took their extra ones back to the room that none of them would work. Why? Because their connection came through a telephone line, and their newer receivers were obviously made for cable modems and needed Ethernet cords.  Neither of which the room was equipped for.  Sadly, our Netflix movie watching night was lost.We thought we were okay because we had decent cable and the list of channels listed AMC as one of them.  We flipped through and noticed only channel 20, AMC, DIDN'T WORK!  We went down to the front desk AGAIN only to find out that they changed cable providers and we were the 6th group of people to complain about not getting AMC.  I felt a little better we weren't the only Walking Dead fans that were dying a little on the inside.  Sadly, the two things the boyfriend and I were looking forward to left us disappointed.  We didn't have a working internet, nor full cable.  We were really upset here we were paying almost $100 a night for two MAJOR amenities to not work.When I politely complained saying that I felt we shouldn't be paying the full amount for these two major things not working they tried to make it up to us by a voucher for a free breakfast at O'Henry's.  I realized that was the best we were going to do and to let the dream go of even a 10-20% refund.  The kick in the shorts in the end?  When I went at 11:06 am (check out was 12:00) to cash in on the free breakfast I was told they are no longer serving breakfast since it is past 11:00 am.Not cool.  Not cool at all.I'd come back here if they updated their internet to cable or Ethernet, fixed their TV cable, and dropped their prices.  $100 is a lot of pay if your services are going to not work and you are not going to cater to the vouchers we were given.The bf and I will not be coming back here.  We'll stick to our good experiences at Holiday Inn Expresses.Cheap room well located.  Close to shopping and good places to eat. We spent two nights here while visiting the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. The rooms were nothing special, but they were clean, the air conditioning was good and the staff are friendly and helpful. Free shuttle to and from the historic sights saved us $5 a day in parking and was very convenient. Free breakfast was standard fare that hit the spot. Liked the Free Press left at our door each morning. Report wireles problems were not encountered by us. Our package contained tickets to Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village and made the value better. Looking for a beautiful BNB experience? Try somewhere else. Here you'll find a place to stay at a decent price.It's big, it's pink, it's faux Victorian, it's dated, and it's perfectly located.  We stayed here for two nights, a weekend.  Our room, which faced the parking lot, was spacious, quiet, and comfortable.  It's right off I-94, just across the freeway from shopping, and 3ish miles from the Henry Ford Museum (shuttle service available).   The room was old and perhaps a bit dim but we survived.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  The shuttle to the Ford Museum and the airport saved us some time and money.  Not a luxurious place but it's more than great for getting a good rest and seeing the area.We chose this place because we wanted to go the The Henry Ford and Greenfield Village, they offered a package deal, and the reviews were good.  We were VERY satisfied.  The room was charming and very clean, the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows, the lobby and restaurant were charmingly decorated with lovely antiques. The package deal included 2 nights, 2 full breakfasts (excellent), 2 passes to 2 venues of The Henry Ford, and free shuttle service, all for about $250!  A great deal. The dinners at O'Henry's were okay, not great, but not bad either.  I will write a separate review for O'Henry's.Great value, friendly staff, convenient location, comfortable rooms. The Henry Ford package enabled us to enjoy a spontaneous, affordable family vacation. The courtesy shuttle to local attractions was a nice bonus. Rooms are clean, if dated; free wi-fi, refrigerator and Showtime are welcome extras. Restaurant, not so great.I left this place about two days ago, I stayed their for five days and loved it. As soon as I walked in the room was clean and it was big. The reason why I didn't like is that when I walked in for the first time the room smelled like ciggarettes but got the order out by spraying some of my cologne. The room I stayed in had a king size bed, a mini fridge (this was a plus!!!), study desk, TV (with great channels). The place was calm right off the exit of the highway and as well near local stores. At the morning it tends to get noisy in the hallway due to the cleaning people and as well some of the occupants down the hall were smoking pot in there room. The wi-fi signals are terreble but hey we can live without technology. The have parking in the front and back of the hotel in which they tend to close the back entrance at night. I am willing to stay here again for my next visit.We have been staying here, twice a year for ten to 14 days each visit, for six or seven years.  It is our home away from home when visiting Michigan relatives.  The rooms, especially those on the second floor, overlooking the courtyard, are spacious and gracious.  O'Henry's Restaurant (with full bar) is quite good.  The new owners have invested some cash in fixing up the parts of the place which were getting to be run down, and it is looking much better.  Our favorite motel has gotten better.","Nice rooms and facility but wireless signal is terrible in the rooms.I think that the rooms and the hallways could use a little fixer-upper. The hallways looked super old and the countless black and white photos of children was to say the least strange. The staff were great though. They were friendly and helpful. The one thing that i was little pissed about was they forgot my wake up call the first night i went there...no biggy because i had a secondary alarm in the room...but still they should pay better attention to things like that. I also had a chance to have breakfast at the restaurant downstairs O' Henry's. It wasn't too bad...again the staff at the restaurant were great. The location is great (unfortunately i didn't have a car so i couldn't explore that much) but the Henry Ford museum is like 2 miles away and there are also a lot of stores and restaurants not to far either.it smells.  really bad.  my first experience was the smell of hot dogs in the hallway.  Then my 1st room smelled of stale smoke.  I changed rooms and it was better.  The hallways are a maze, the restaurant is pretty awful, the service is ok.  Did I mention it smells?  I wouldn't stay there again.  Also internet is slow, oh so slow.We visited this Best Western in November 2010. Great location as it was close to major freeways, shopping and plenty of free parking.   The room was clean and the bed was comfy. However, there was a need for updated cosmetics. Overall, I would recommend as it met our needs for a quick trip to the Detroit Metro area.Great hotel! Comfortable beds and great pool! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the terrible restaurant (O'Henry's...one of the worst I've ever eaten at; dinner and breakfast) and guests making lots of noise in hall all night.",,,,"['place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-corktown-hotel-detroit-2,The Corktown Hotel,2.5,$,26,"This place is under renovations, so when you drive up, it doesn't seem so bad. There is a nice new marble sign with the name of the hotel, and the building was repainted a nice dark grey. First you have to be buzzed in by front desk, then you walk into a small lobby with a giant, I am guessing, bullet proof glass that separates you and the front desk.  Kind of off-putting and scary when you think the hotel needs that much protection against the outside. Hallways and rooms are out of date and need serious updating, but like I mentioned they are in the process. There are a few of the rooms that have already been renovated, but they were not available when we reserved. Our room was not that bad considering how old the hotel is. Some of the plaster falling off the walls near the corners, baseboards missing and a little carpet ripped from sides of walls. But to our surprise, we had full size kitchen, which was kind of cool.The parking was behind locked gates, so we felt the cars were pretty safe, however we were told we had to have our cars out Sunday night because they were going to paint on Monday morning. So we had to park in front where there was obviously no security. Like any big city, do not leave anything in your car, one couple had their back window smashed in, but all other cars were fine. The neighborhood still seems to be in its up and coming stages, there are a few bars/restaurants within walking distance, the downtown area, about a mile is also within walking distance.For the price we paid, about $60/night, where all other hotels were running at close to $300/night, this was well worth the money. Once renovated, I bet this will be a really nice hotel.After my stay, I can totally see how someone was murdered here. Google it for yourself. It screams of snuff films. If you want to feel unsafe and dirty, stay at the Corktown Inn / Corktown Hotel / Trumbull and Porter. This ""hotel"" has had some many names that it makes you wonder why they're constantly attempting to re-brand. It's because they're trying to outrun their awful reputation. The signs outside are ""Corktown Inn"" and ""Trumbull and Porter."" But when I booked, it was the ""Corktown Hotel"" (please pick an identity). Unfortunately, I didn't check Yelp before booking- I only looked at TripAdvisor, which will be my next stop.I've stayed in hotels for conferences, vacations, and even stayed in college dorms for 4 years. This was the worst living/housing situation I've ever encountered. It's absolutely atrocious that an establishment can be pest and mold-covered, yet attempt to present themselves as renovated and clean. Don't even bother looking at their website, it's a lie.I've attached numerous photos of the mold-ridden, dingy, old and broken, ant residence. Yes, I found some ants too, but they didn't want to split the bill! The television is one I remember having as an impoverished child. Shaky static images on an old Zenith tube television atop a heavily stained dresser. I didn't even look inside for fear of finding anything disturbing. Further, the headboard was broken. My dad used to work at HoJo's and the ""blankets"" were just as scratchy and flat as I remember as a poor kid. We took a travel blanket out of our car and slept with that. I checked the mattress for bed bugs because the place was just that gross. The front desk looks like something out of a tragic comedy. One of those moments that really makes you rethink what you're about to do, but it was NYE and everything else was booked or way out of an average person's price range (e.g. suites at MGM).The walls are paper thin and when our neighbors were banging on it at 2am, we called the front desk. The man working there told us that it was the vending machine! Wow, I guess we look stupid enough to believe a vending machine across the hall was causing the noise adjacent to us. Thanks front desk. He hung up on us (stellar service) and when we called back were hung up on again. So we knew we'd be leaving immediately, even though we booked this crap shoot for 2 days. They couldn't pay me to stay any longer. If it wasn't frigid winter in Michigan, we would've checked out and slept in our car. The cherry on top was the 5am wake up call from one of the guests walking and screaming down the hallway. We were on the same floor as the front desk, and only a few rooms down, so I'm sure they heard and could not be bothered. I double and triple checked the deadbolt on our room door. This place was a nightmare.Corktown Hotel, I see you're in the habit of responding to these messages with a half-a**ed apology and convenient plug for what you purport to be a new/not disgusting place. I just want my money back because I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER come back.I understand that this hotel is under renevations, but there was no excuse for some of the stuff we encountered while staying here. Honestly, I'm glad we were only here a night because any more than that and I would have been sleeping in the car. I heard pretty mixed reviews about this place, but I wasn't prepared for some of the stuff I saw.Our friend went in to check us in and honestly the outside looked fine. The parkinglot is gated which is nice.We went inside and the hallways were old. It's obvious that the place was being updated but a lot of things were falling apart. The elevator is small and honestly kind of scary. We encountered a lovely ""$2.00 blow jobs"" sign scratched into the mirror.Up at our room, the first impression I got was that it smelled like weed and cigarettes. It appeared to be clean enough, but upon further inspection we were proved wrong.The floor was filthy. There was a gum stain. The walls were super dirty too. When I pulled back the blankets I was greeted with the wonderful sight of a cum stain, what looked like boogers, and a ton of cigarette burns. Needless to say we didn't sleep with those blankets. The sheets were pretty clean aside from a stray pubic hair. The pillows were ok too except one had eyeliner all over it.Thank god there were no bugs. The bathroom wasn't super great. The toilet paper was almost fully gone. The tub had black mold around the edges as well as some strange brown scratches in it. It smelled like a public bathroom. Also, there is no lock on the door.Just as we finally settled down and decided that we would just suck it up, we noticed that NONE of the plugs in the main living space were three pronged. If you have a laptop or anything needing three prongs, good luck. You'll have to plug it in in the bathroom next to the sink. The television was also unplugged and unusable, and the WiFi was super slow.Aside from this, and the fact that the entire room just had a gross layer of nasty all over it, there were some upsides. It was decently quiet. The beds were pretty comfortable. The room was a nice temperature. The staff were friendly and accommodating. You definetely get what you're paying for and I guess if you don't mind a pretty gross room, it isn't horrible to stay at.Ok, so this is really a 2 star hotel, but considering the reviews I read and the price, I was expecting something much worse. For about $80 a night during Memorial Day weekend (where everything is $300-400 a night), the Corktown met my expectations. The place felt pretty safe, the neighborhood seems very hipstery (a brewery just opened around the corner), and you had to use your key card to get into the building. The room was small but clean, had a full size bed, working AC, older tv, and decent bathroom. One day we did run out of hot water in the shower, but otherwise it was ok. Staff was friendly and helpful as well.In all, a decent place to stay if you're on a budget and want to be fairly close to downtown.BEWARE OF BEDBUGS!!!! I got over 10 bites from a one night stay at this hotel. Customer service was horrible. They tried to overcharge me and were really rude.This hotel is just what I was looking for. Yes, the front desk is somewhat odd because of renovations, and the room had some scuffs on the walls and dust on the dresser--but that's what I expect when I book an inexpensive hotel. I found everything perfectly adequate, and didn't feel unsafe at all.You absolutely get what you pay for here. I have traveled all over the world, so I have experience with less-than-savory conditions. Be prepared for:The good--keycard to get into the building, parking lot, and rooms; very quiet (we felt like we were the only guests staying there); close to downtown in Corktown; very inexpensive; clean bedding (I check, too, for bedbugs and had no problems); clean bathroom; and the employees were all very friendly and helpful.The bad--dingy; old carpet; leaking ceilings in the hallway; cracked windows; and poor WiFi and TV reception. Our first room had a malfunctioning air conditioner, but they quickly moved us.The ugly--powerful cigarette smell even though the entire hotel is a no-smoking zone, and the sheets reeked of it and made for a very uncomfortable night. In all honesty, I cannot recommend it and suggest you spend a bit more for some more comfortable accommodations.I won't bother commenting about the accommodations because the place has BEDBUGS !! I did all the usual checks when I arrived with a hi power led flashlight. Lifted the mattress checked the bed cover underneath couch pillow - nothing. 15 minutes after going to bed I felt something crawling on my shoulder and up my neck. I turned on the light and sure enough it was a bed bug. The clerk was extremely rude and would not refund me for the night I stayed, only for the extra night I was supposed to stay. Needless to say, I should have checked out bedbug registry FIRST. It lists 3 complaints :<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbedbugregistry.com%2Fhotel%2FMI%2FDetroit%2FCorktown-Inn&amp;s=7c594f12b089bf143d2865a5c6954f1b0e28efa8921fc7eba32fb3e64b7a62e4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bedbugregistry.com/hotel...</a>Ugh.My landlord booked this place for my roomie and I when my heat was out and it was yuck. So yuck.The area is fine, I'm pretty familiar with it. I love corktown and it is really close to attractions and if you haven't explored Detroit it's probably a good location to check out the old tigers stadium and bars and whatnot. But holy hell, this place is dirty. I wouldn't stay here again. The hallway smells, and supposedly they have bed bugs but I luckily didn't see any.It's not that bad.  It's 2 miles away from Comerica Park, and an Uber ride from the hotel to the game was less than $5.  Sheets were clean, the decor is a little outdated, but I would compare this hotel to others I have stayed in in New York and Chicago that are older hotels.  I don't know if I would venture out on foot to explore the neighborhood though.So after reading some of these reviews, I was preparing for the worst.  I actually ended up having a fine time here.  Stayed during MoPop festival, hotel was pretty packed. Walking distance to park venue, good food and bars close by.  Yeah the place smells like smoke, the room is clean, wifi could be stronger, receptionist was nice and helpful.Well, in all fairness, this is a motel dressed up as a hotel.  The front staff is very friendly and helpful and considering that they are in the process of ""rebuilding"" the hotel, I will be kind.  Because it really needs a huge million$$ overhaul.The good,- located off the freway close to downtown Detroit- free parking; although the lot needs repavement- front desk personnel very friendly- the Rates from standard ($50 a night) to higher for bigger rooms (I stayed in the standard room, which is a single room occupancy room equivalent to a dorm)-They are rebuilding (and I hope it happens quickly because the rest of the city is passing them up)The bad,- soiled mattress (but clean sheets)- some holes in the comforter- a leaky bathroom faucet (they must have a high water bill)- worn carpeting throughout- old scratched marred furniture - not even vintage or antiquish- no coffee maker, no refrigerator in the room; no cafe inside the hotel.  There's a Burger King one block away- the TV had cable for 1/2 the stations didn't work; the color was washed out.Very few guests were in the hotel, so it was quiet.This is a good hotel to stay in overnight and if you're passing through and can't get a room elsewhere.My wife searched for days trying to find rooms for the Buffett concert. We were supposed to stay 2 nights, but after pulling into the parking lot, no way we were staying here. Reviews are bad. Very sketchy area to say the least. Prostitutes roaming the area. Had to get buzzed in just to talk to someone, and the receptionist is behind nearly 2"" glass! That should tell ya something. Google it! See for yourself, this should be a last resort stop. Run while you can! Wife said 'no nookie' if we stay here..All I can say is you get what you pay for.My first issue arose after reserving a room for 2 nights. I decided to cancel one of the nights a few days later and called back to do so. They had no record of my reservation. Lucky that I called!The next issue and the one that will most likely ensure that I will never stay there again was cleanliness. I wasn't expecting mints on the pillows, but they carpet clearly hadn't been vacuumed, there were stains on virtually every cloth surface (chairs, drapes, comforter, lamp shades), and the TV stands and walls had crud all over them. I even found a fossilized French fry on the ground.  Luckily I was drunk and freezing when we checked in, or we would have been shelling out cash for a different hotel. I definitely took a scalding hot shower and burned all the clothes I wore while there when I left.The last issue was that I called the front desk from the room phone to find out where I could order a pizza and no one picked up. So I called from my cell phone and what do you know? They picked up right away.The good: location (perfect for the St. Patrick's Day parade in Corktown), price, and a funny story to tell the grandkids one day.We stayed in the newly remodeled room last weekend and we loved it!  I am looking forward to the rest of the hotel being renovated so all the rooms and exterior will be just as nice. Although I can understand the reviews from people who did not stay in the new rooms because the exterior and hallways need much improvement. But, never once did I feel unsafe while staying there.  The location is great.  You are just outside all of the hussle and bussle but close enough to all of the expressways.  Parking is free and secure. The staff is friendly and there are lots of great restaurants near by.  I would stay here again and save my money for all the fun that the city has to offer.  The room is for sleeping and it served it's purpose well!I'm giving this review one star instead of zero because I realize the room wasn't as bad as one of those seedy hotels I've seen on episodes of Law and Order SVU- Although we did learn that someone was murdered in the hotel a couple of years ago- our fault for not reading-up on the place before booking the room.  Anyways, the first negative we encountered upon entering our ""premium"" room, was the smell- we were greeted with the smell of stale cigarette smoke- but this was the least of our issues.  More concerning was that there was no phone and no alarm clock- you couldn't call out of the room if you needed to, and no extra lock on the door.  Every piece of bedding in the room (literally every piece- comforter, blanket, sheets, including the extra linens we requested) had cigarette holes in them.  The furniture in the room was filthy, we found spiders in the drawer of the nightstand, the walls and ceiling covered in unidentifiable stains, and our towels had small black hairs embedded in the fibers.  In comparison, the following issues were not that big of a deal, but still not what I would consider expected for a $175 room- there was no lid on the toilet seat (which is necessary when you don't want your clean clothes touching the filthy floor), there were no tissues anywhere in the room, the front office staff are behind a bullet-proof glass window, and the cards to enter your room and the gated parking area didn't work well.  We've read that new owners are trying to call this a ""boutique"" hotel and have renovated seven rooms, but until all the rooms they rent are updated, I do t think you could call it that.We stayed here for the Movement Electronic Music Festival in Detroit. The stay at this hotel was far from adequate. We are actually checking out a day early because this hut was such a shitty amenity. Let me just say that I recommend staying here if you're okay with the following: 1. Resident prostitutes roaming the halls at all hours of the night.2. Every floor smelling like marijuana (curious if this is a covert grow house).3. Paper-thin walls so that you can hear the show on TV in the next room - along with the aforementioned prostitutes performing their business.4. Random ""goodies"" left in the room. For us, a tie-off bag for shooting what appears to be heroin.5. Having to spray your entire room down with Lysol as to not worry about the random stains throughout the room and bed.6. Gated parking that's never locked - when it should be...no wonder people get their cars broken into.All and all...don't stay here if you have the option of sleeping in a car.The location is great. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention coffee and records. Heck, if you aren't in a hurry you can stroll all the way downtown or to Mexicantown in 20 minutes. But yeah, it kind of sucks. I don't need much; I'm a man of simple tastes. I was ready for the comically famous vending machine.But the hallways smelled oppressively of smoke, and our bedroom wasn't much better. They didn't bother bringing towels 1 of 2 days. The walls were paper thin so you could hear every radio, conversation, or, uh, sexytime like you were a part of the action.So you can stumble home from the bar, but I'll try for a plan B next time. Like Hostel Detroit, or maybe the St. Regis up in New Center, where I've had good experiences for similar price ranges.This hotel was adequate and clean. However, when I walked out the hotel this morning our vehicle was stolen within 4Minutes but it was found later in the day. BUT if you want to stay in downtown Detroit for an inexpensive night of $85, then this is your place.I honestly thought the park across the street was called ""Dan Savage Memorial Park,"" (and not Dean Savage Memorial Park), and now I know exactly why I thought that. One of the vending machines at the Corktown Inn stocks what may be the most comprehensive selection of underwear and assorted vice accessories in America: Jezebel halter tops, leopard print thongs, standard mens' boxers, chocolate flavored condoms, vasoline, playing cards, and scope. If all that keeps you too busy to step outside this ""fine hotel"" for air, the next vending machine over offers a wide range of packaged dinner foods, including ramen and Chef Boyardee.Aside from the vending machine offerings, you can tell a lot about a hotel from the reception staff. The woman at the desk, despite seeming stoic on the surface, was quite pleasant-natured and a bit quirky in a good way.""Expedia... Expedia... Expedia..."" she says out loud, as she combs through the laminated index cards of the antiquated manual room card catalog. ""Standard, no. You pay standard, I give you king.""As other clientele shuffled in- a mix of aging rock stars, truck drivers, a woman in pajamas, Japanese businessmen, and a cool cat in a leather jacket who puts his thumbs up and says ""killer!"" (as in, ""awesome!"") when you open the door for him- I took stock of the used furniture for sale across the lobby, a dresser for $60, TV stand for $100... Detroit-style scrappiness at its best. This ""fine hotel"" is making ends meet while keeping prices low.""One night, one night. Two nights,"" said the stoically effervescent receptionist. She'd make a fabulous accountant. All her mathematical reasoning is broadcast out loud."" Sixty, sixty, one hundred twenty.""Sounds reasonable, especially compared to the offerings downtown. And these days, Corktown is arguably a better place to hang than downtown. ""How many key? One key? Two key?"" Well, the most important thing about a hotel is the room. I was generally very pleased with it. Spacious and comfortable, functional WiFi (despite no promises from the desk) and I imagined that my hardworking receptionist had scanned the room earlier:""How many bedbug?"" as she lifts up the mattress. ""Zero bedbug.""Good. I don't like bugs, especially when they're not paying their share of the rent. The rooms look like they've been recently rehabbed, if perhaps not dusted for a week or three, and could probably be a hair cleaner (read between the lines here). But if your main thing is sleeping well, it's unusually quiet, thanks to the brilliant (and unusual) entry layout with doors recessed ten feet in from the hallway and out of earshot of the slamming doors that often curse even the fanciest hotels.Three stars for the hotel itself, but an extra star for the unique charm and the surrounding neighborhood (Mudgie's, PJ's, Steak Hut).","I'm used to roughing it, but I regret not staying in the hostel instead. The cigarette smoke in the hallways was pretty overwhelming and the walls were paper thin. They also didn't seem to replace our towels on 1 of the 2 nights I stayed. Such a good location, it's too bad it's not slightly nicer.I don't even know what to say.  A friend recommended this place to me before Movement festival last year.  I didn't want to pay a lot for a room, and while this looked a little dingy from the website, I wasn't prepared for the reality of this hotel.Firstly, when I arrived, the lobby was full of really questionable characters, and the receptionist was behind bullet proof glass.  The lobby has an assortment of vending machines - including one dispensing underwear - and the receptionist apparently also can sell you a variety of frozen/microwaveable foods.  My next concern was that there was no/little security for outside doors other than the main lobby.  There is a key used to get in, but people had propped open doors and they stayed that way for hours.As for my room, when I entered it, I was honestly really, really afraid that I'd end up getting lice or bed bugs based on how dirty the room was.  But, we checked the mattresses and I didn't see any evidence of bugs, so I decided to stay there (and happily I didn't come home with any 'cooties' from the room).  The bedding was stained and had burn holes. The mattress was incredibly uncomfortable.  The carpeting was very stained and smelled badly.  The whole room smelled like stale beer and stale cigarettes.  On the upside, the TV had free porn.... that truly looked like it was filmed inside this hotel. (Like, the room decor in the movies matched what was in my room).  The other guests.. I was there for a festival and holiday weekend, so I think the demographic was different than it usually is.  There were a lot of questionable looking people around but they didn't seem dangerous.  We did have a problem with people knocking on our doors at all ours and trying to enter the room uninvited but I think they were just drunk, not dangerous.   It seemed like there were a lot of residents living there.I have never stayed in a hotel where they cared less what went on in your room, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.Ultimately nothing bad happened to me there, and I'd be tempted to stay again if I wanted to party in Detroit all night.  That said, the rooms here are cheap, but I was able to pay a similar amount by getting friends to share a suite at a nicer hotel closer to Hart Plaza.They run a shuttle to the festival for Movement / DEMF, which is a plus.The best run down hotel I've ever stayed at.  I just got back from Movement festival in Detroit, and was happy with our visit.  It's not the cleanest motel, it's in a bad neighborhood, the front desk is behind bullet proof glass, they sell panties in the vending machine, and they play shitty porn on one of the TV stations.  But for the price it can't be beat.  The staff was really friendly, especially considering all the drunk/high out of their skull guests that are in and out of the place that weekend.  There is a dollar shuttle that takes you to and from the festival all day which was an awesome perk.  The guy running the shuttle was even nice enough to drive us down to the liquor store late at night after he was done running the shuttle.  We offered to throw him a few bucks which he twice turned down since we had been tipping him a buck pretty much every time we had taken the shuttle.Everyone at the Corktown Inn that weekend was pretty much there for DEMF, and the whole place had a nice camaraderie going.  It was easy to just start a conversation with people as you waited for the shuttle, or were walking down the hallways.  The place just felt like it was made for Movement.  The bottom line:  If you're looking for a cheap place to stay for DEMF and don't mind sacrificing some traditional services you get at a hotel like frequent room cleanings in exchange for a laissez-faire attitude towards your activities (wink wink) then Corktown Inn is the place to be.Cheap and clean!We stayed here during the Movement festival. It's a bit far from the Hart Plaza (the cab fare is around 10 bucks) but the motel offers shuttle bus back and forth only for $1! Although the staff is sitting behind bulletproof glass they are super helpful and friendly.Don't expect anything fancy, but it's a good place to sleep one or two nights.I have stayed at the Corktown Inn twice now, both times on a Friday night. Both times the hotel was pretty empty judging by there being only about a dozen cars in the parking lot. We did encounter some shady-looking people in old Mercedes in the parking lot, but they kept to themselves and we never felt endangered. As someone who grew up in Minnesota, the bulletproof(?) glass was kind of shocking, but the staff was helpful and friendly. One of the elevators was out of service the second time we stayed, and there was a burned out light just outside our room. The rooms themselves are very cozy with a bed, two chairs, a 5-year old television, and nightstands. The clock in our rooms both times we stayed was not set and was flashing 12:00. The bathroom and shower were nice, and the room appeared very clean.  We had a burn hole on our sheets one night, but other than that things were spotless. The best part of our stay, and to me the most important part, was that our room was extremely quiet. I did not hear a single other person both times we stayed. Compared to the other hotels downtown which are only a few blocks away, the Corktown Inn is a great value for about a third of the price. If you're going to downtown Detroit on a budget, I believe this is the best bet.As far as bargain places to just rest your head at night go, the Corktown Inn is a pretty good gig.  They have perqs like incredibly useful and thorough vending machines (from beverages to dinner to toiletries to...underwear), security gated parking, close location to downtown, helpful staff, three channels of HBO, functioning heating/air conditioning units in each room, decent pillows, and a good shower/tub combo.  Oh yeah, and two channels of free porn, and one more channeling the security cameras on the premises.  Cons?  Little quirky things, like the sheets had burn holes in them, the carpets were pretty worn, and there was some questionable (but not threatening) patrons wandering the halls.  None of which really matter all that much if you're just looking for a place to rest your head (and maybe find a microwave burrito) for a discount price.",,,,"['place', 'renovations', 'drive', 'seem',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-detroit-southfield-southfield,Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Detroit Southfield,1.5,$,22,"Let's start with the positives...............priced right I guess. Spacious rooms with a kitchen.Negatives.......dirty....loud....needs a remodel bad. I apparently got stuck in the room next to the room where the staff parties and hangs out because the house keeping staff of men and women were yelling and drinking and partying it up at 3pm until mid evening. Literally, I couldn't have gotten out of my room to walk to my car because they were hanging out in front of my door. Regardless of that...the hotel was just poor all around. I chose it for price...and I won't make that mistake again.0 stars is accurate! I booked a room for one night and I was disgusted. I asked to view other rooms to see if I had another option but all of the rooms appeared in the same disrepair. After my stay, by the way I slept in my clothes, I did contact the front desk and requested the general manager call me he never did. I called back and left a message for the assistant general manager and she never returned my call. If it were up to me I would shut this hotel down as it is in disrepair and not fit for human living. Please see the pictures that I am attaching.I truly cannot understand how a manager or an assistant manager would allow a human to stay in this environment. Further to ignore the request of your guests only exacerbates the obvious problems. Since no one did reach out to me or respond to my request, I can only help others who might find themselves mistakenly booking a room in this dump. If you had the experience that I had perhaps we should start a petition to close this property. As a matter of fact I think we should all contact the corporate office and request at this property be condemned.Can I give this place 0 stars, please??!!! HORRIBLE, DIRTY and DISGUSTING hotel. Front desk staff, one lady was nice and one had an attitude. You can hear people above you arguing all throughout the night.I can't believe I booked this place and didn't read really any reviews, disappointed in myself i wasted my money. They didn't have do not disturb signs for our door, no comforter on the bed when we walked in the door, dirty furniture, dirty floors, shower rod not attached to wall, toilet not attached to the floor, no clean towels, alarm clock un plugged and with the battery hanging out of it. WHAT???? WHO DOES THAT?!I'm not going to list all that was wrong because that would be the LONGEST review in history. Just know do not waste your money!!!! PLEASE. Stay anywhere else that you can. And if you need WiFi, well expect it to be kind of crappy to it kept disconnecting. Whoever owns this hotel needs to get it together. Please update, clean and get a staff that cares to be in Customer Service and cares about their job, might be a nice touch. I hate leaving any reviews with 1 star, but that was beyond necessary it was the worst hotel experience in all my years.I expected more from the suites. The interior was dated and looked as if it's repairs were put on the back burner. The microwave didn't even have the turntable inside of it. Overall, I would not stay here. It's loud on the weekend and had me nervous to sleep. People were outside arguing and fighting at 3am, while other cars were speeding through the parking lot. The only plus was that it was spacious, but that wouldn't have me returning for a weekend stay. It appeared as if it was the local hotel to hang out at on the weekend. The guest that stayed above us were very hood and the parking lot felt like Rouge Park before the policing started (locals will understand what that means). I would like to see how it is during the week when most people are working or the idea of a hotel stay is for business/relaxation and not partying. However, I won't be chancing it. Overall a disappointment.Decided I would do a staycation for Christmas break and booked three nights here. I was immediately disappointed when I noticed how filthy and unkept the grounds were. It was too late to cancel as I pre-paid via Hotwire.The first room was hideous. The furniture in the suite was worn and dirty. I could hear loud rap music and children running overhead. I asked for another room on the upper level, which wasn't much better. I could still hear the other guests fairly well.The hotel lost power after being there for about three hours. I left because that also meant that there was no heat. When I returned in the morning to get my things, the staff informed me that I wouldn't be refunded the first night, but the remaining nights would be. Their offer to me was to return for a ""make-up"" night. No thanks! I'll take the loss.Don't stay here. It's like a low income subdivision. The room smells like cigarettes and burnt vacuum belts...not clean gross. Do not stay here. The photos are misleading. I WAS SO UNHAPPY that I decided to check out early. I didn't want to make a fuss as everyone seemed content with the low standards presented. They attempted to charge me an early check out fee!! Are you kidding they should pay ME for sleeping there. I barely slept. Between the smell and worrying about my car all night I would not recommend this place to anyone. Too many nice hotels in the area.Don't do this to yourself...Honestly this is one of the WORST hotels I have ever seen. I travel a great deal and have often stayed at this hotel chain with great results, but this particular location is terrible!The best description of this location is NEGLECT! Horrible housekeeping as a result of management apathy. The room had torn and ragged furniture (I will post a pic) the walls were dirty and carpet ragged also. The bed only had two over used lumpy pillows the size of a small couch cushion. As I stepped out the front door of my room there was a smelly trash can that had leaked some sort of black ooze  from the bottom. (Seriously? Trash can outside my room door?)The only positive was the staff was friendly and tried to make it better but to give you a picture of how bad it was. I forfeited the money I paid for a 5 night stay and paid MORE money to stay at the Hilton!!The great staff help and location clean suites with fire places Took awail for the outside ,Was told they where fully booked up at thr complex and where trying to get all the Rooms cleanHorrible! So sure it has a full kitchen. Where in the heck are are the dishes and pots and pans? There's a hole in the closet door! The chair has stains galore! Never again will I EVER stay at a Hawthorne! I should have stayed where I typically stay. Back to Marriot!Can I say the WORST place ever!!! Not only did they give me keys to one but TWO DIRTY rooms and have the nerves to tell me that they can't give me my money back that I just handed over to them in cash until the morning!!! They had no problem taking my money to give me two dirty rooms..I would NEVER stay here and I will tell everyone I know about about how unprofessional and disgusting this place is...they don't even deserve one star!!Great rates, clean room. Due to the other reviews, I was hesitant about staying here but decided to try it. Very happy that my husband and I did. Barbara was friendly and helpful at check in as Valerie made checkout easy. Will stay again!Wow, where do I begin? I'll keep this brief but detailed as possible.There isn't anything good about this place, don't stay here.To confirm some of the claims that other reviewers have made as true:1. Fact - There is a $60.00 cash deposit that you are required to pay (doesn't include the cost of the room itself) in addition to a contractual agreement you must sign. This agreement pretty much lays out the ground rules and addresses how your deposit can be forfeited. My concern was why not just hold the deposit on a credit card as a opposed to cash? When I went and had discovered this information I had to make an extra trip to the ATM to satisfy this requirement. This alone will ultimately discourage customers from staying here because its a form of a hustle. It isn't honest, we're already paying an average of $72.00 for a room + the $60.00 cash deposit. Needless to say I lost my deposit because evidently if you are even a minute late after checkout you lose it. The customer service rep was sarcastic and actually joked about the fact that I lost it. Not only was that unnecessary and inappropriate, keep in mind that as a customer I can relay much more damage in the form of word of mouth than anything.2. Fact- The rooms are dirty, no phone unless you pay extra. No dishes in the apartment, tons of safety hazards, blood stains on toilet, curtains.3. Fact- You will be greeted by loud shouts in the morning chanting ""Room Service!"" by the time that I had opened the door granted I told the housekeepers that I would be leaving out shortly. They continued to state how much ""I"" was holding them up and preventing them from doing their jobs. No professionalism whatsoever.4. Fact- Ghetto.This ""hotel/motel"" was selected as the host location for our family as we traveled in for the funeral of a loved one. We blocked 20 rooms. When we arrived, we quickly noted, THIS PLACE is a disgusting DUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Period. If you choose to stay here, you WILL be utterly disappointed. The staff is discourteous and unhelpful; they make you pay for the entire stay upfront as if you are an ""hourly"" patron with a hooker and they  barely agreed to give us a receipt! Our room was filthy, smelled like cigarettes and debauchery, spots on the bed, nasty stains on the couch and BUGS galore! I killed a mosquito the size of a horse...and I live in Florida! I wore shoes in the room the entire evening because the carpeting was almost gummy to the touch. NO iron, I didn't even bother to enter the ""kitchenette"" in fear of something crawling from under the refrigerator. If my flight had arrived before it did at 10:30pm I would have certainly selected another hotel. Even more strange, this appears to be a well-established corporate area. VERY gloomy place!Lets start with the room and I wish I had taken pictures. Burn marks everywhere( non smoking establishment may I remind you), filthy bathroom, filthy couch and terrible kitchen. The smelly garbage can sits right out in front of your suite so when you wake up the next morning expect that. The security detail there is absolutely horrible and sub par to be polite (which they aren't), and Southfield police department is there at least three to four times a night. The breakfast buffet, although petty good, makes you wonder if you should eat it being that the rest of the hotel is so nasty. Housekeeping seems to walk around in a drunken stooper most of the time they are seen or available and I don't believe that most of them even work there, so please protect your valuables, or better yet start somewhere else. The price is to high for what you get. Period.its a scam and a mess. !. to the 'cash' deposit'  , the smoke odor in the 'non- smoking ' room, the lack of blankets, the small pillows, the unprofessional staff, the filthy rooms.DO NOT STAY THERE!!!This has to be the worst hotel in Southfield. When I arrived there was what appeared to be a motor cycle gang in the lobby,Me and a few of my closest friends had a gathering there(total of 8 women). At Around 11pm a black male wearing all black, and a ski mask  knocked on the door and announced he was security. He then demanded to be let into the room. We were clearly afraid at the time and refused to open the door. I can admit we were laughing and having a good time, but there was no wild party at all. After refusing the man, we were evicted, we asked for a reason why and we were told that it's in the contract and the Security can evict whenever the volume in the room is too loud. This has to be a scam! The lobby personnel acted as if they had nothing to do with it. The security stated that they were acting on the behalf of the hotel. They took our deposit and room fee. This place is a dump, that has to scam for profits.This review is two parted... the hotel itself I give 3 stars.  It's not the Ritz but for the price you pay you get a lot.  It's great for a family on vacation who would like the home ""essentials"". You get a full kitchen, etc. and is much nicer and larger than most other ""Extended"" traveler hotels.  The value for what you get is great.  I give it 3 stars.Then we have the hotel staff and it all goes down hill.  - one star.I arrived to check in at 20 minutes to 3pm. I remember checking my time because as I walked in I found myself waiting inline behind a gentleman telling the hotel desk clerk a long story.  She never looked past to acknowledge me the entire time and I was curious how long it would go on.  This happened at 2:41 and probably went on for a few minutes.  (The gentleman actually apologized after he walked away... hotel desk did not).  So now I hand my ID and credit card to the clerk, Nicole.  Nicole tells me ""Check in is at 3pm"".  I glance around wondering if she is not aware what time it is.  I politely ask her if there is a possibility that a few rooms MAY be ready 15 minutes before check-in time.  (Apparently on this property a fairy god-mother waves her wand and rooms all become ready at once).  She says ""It wouldn't matter, check in is at 3.""  Wow.  (I understand at 10AM... but 15 minutes before??...) Okay, I let her know I've never heard of such a thing and Nicole taps the ""check-in"" sign and asks me have I ever seen that?  How courteous and welcoming.  Not!  So at this point I thought my reservation was already paid for through my online reservation so I chose to stay and handed her my ID and credit card again for her to check me in while I wait for the magic clock to strike 3.  She slides me back my stuff and tells me to have a seat in the lobby.  So I wait in the lobby for a few minutes while she calls me back up and loudly announces ""You do know it's a $50 deposit?""  Well, yes, I'm aware hotels (and most any other business where renting is involved) requires a deposit, that's why I gave her my credit card.  I ask her is there a problem with that being on my card and she looks surprised... I'm not sure what level of professionalism goes on here but it is lacking.  At this point she started telling me about how they only have two rooms ready (at 5 minutes to check in time) and blah blah blah... I tell her I don't care which room it is, just check me in.  So she checks me in and I leave the lobby passing by the Fed-Ex guy who she greets HAPPILY as I leave (lucky him).  I then drive around to the room, grab my luggage and open the door to find bed unmade and glasses and cups all over.  Um, no.  I drag everything back to the car and drive back in.  I now have to interrupt her conversation with Mr. FedEx to explain this room is NOT ready.  She takes my card back and then proceeds to talk to Mr. FedEx.  Then, when she decides it's time to check in guests she goes to the back and starts talking about how now it's 3pm and she needs to call people to see if rooms are ready... blah blah blah... I don't care.  Had this been done 25-30 minutes ago when I arrived I wouldn't be as frustrated but instead I am still in the lobby.  Finally, she gives me a new key to a new room...  She does apologize about the room and asks me to double check with her by calling to let me know if it's ok.. which it was.Overall, the hotel itself was fine but the management needs to really work on the courtesy and treatment of guests by workers.  Most hotels I visit are inviting and happy to have your business, especially in an area where the number of hotels is overwhelming.  I understand the property has went through a few changes recently, and saving money is key, but there are plenty of people willing to work with a smile out there to have such piss-poor attitudes.  Oh, and cool points for free wi-fi.First of all let me say that this is The worst place to stay at, EVER. We stayed there memorial day weekend, from Friday through Monday. When we arrived, it took about 3 tries to get our correct room (from walking into other peoples rooms to the key card not working). When we finally got our room, the room was decent but we had absolutely no towels in the bathroom and the sofa sleeper had no sheets or anything. We ended up having to share the ones from our bed. I must admit that I did like the fact that it had a full size fridge and stove, but that's it. Friends of ours that also stayed there over the weekend had people from the hotel ""staff"" walking in to their rooms at all hours of the day. We were literally scared to leave anything in the rooms. We found all kinds of stuff in and around our rooms from pieces of hair weave to used condoms. We had to keep a close eye on our toddlers so they wouldn't touch anything there. This place is just plain horrible, from the place itself, to the people that work there, to the sketchy people that were in and out of the rooms all day and night. If you can, pay a couple extra dollars and stay somewhere else!!I stayed at the Hawthorne Suites with a handful of colleagues and our first priority was a full kitchen (check), second priority was being close to our office (check). For those reasons plus the reasonable price I give this place three stars. The rooms were clean - although the first room I checked into had a strong smoke smell. I was promptly moved to another room that seemed to have a faint smoke smell, but I would imagine it's hard to keep people from smoking in an extended stay hotel.The staff was nice and the breakfast was mediocre at best. I had oatmeal every morning - the eggs and bacon just didn't look appetizing.For the location and amenities, I'd go to Hawthorne again.We had a 2-week stay here, and had a terrible experience.On arrival, our kitchen was dirty and completely unstocked - we had no silverware, cookware, or dishwashing liquid.  The sofa and chair had stains, the kitchen tiles were cracked, the TV in the ""loft"" room was broken, and the bathrooms were not well-cleaned.The stove had not been cleaned in a great while, and on our second day, it caught fire.  There was no fire extinguisher nearby, so we put out the fire with a wet towel.  The general manager Ajay was unhelpful and, despite saying he would come by to make sure things were okay, never once spoke with us about it, and was hesitant to give us any sort of discount despite the fact that our room CAUGHT FIRE.Housekeeping was inconsistent and unfriendly.  There were days we called to ask for clean towels other toiletries, and we would return to find our room largely untouched with a large plastic bag full of our items on the couch.  Some members of the housekeeping staff would enter our room unannounced, not in uniform, and talking on their cell phones.  (I should mention, though, that some of the housekeepers were very friendly and efficient).The general manager, Ajay, was unfriendly and very unhelpful.  Wyndam Hotels should be ashamed of this property and the way it is being managed.","when i go there i lock the door.  Not that i feel unsafe but there is nothing else between me and the outside.  All other residence inn i have been to have a door to the building and then one to the room.  Anyway, this hotel is pretty run down and i would not go there on my own (have to for business).  Depending on the building you are in, you can be close to the highway and have a lot of noise from it.The hotel is now the Hawthorne Suites and it sounds as if the place is now much nicer than it used to be.  I suppose that buildings might still be older, but all the furniture was new, the place was clean, the breakfast was amazing (eggs and bacon and all), the workout room was sufficient, and the kitchen even came stocked with plates and silverware and all.  It was perfect and a great, great deal for the price.  (Probably a three star in general... Ok, but nothing great.... expect that the price definitely bumps it up to a 4.)",,,,"['let', 'start', 'positives', 'priced', 'right', 'guess', 'spacious', 'rooms', 'kitchen', 'negatives', 'dirty',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-southgate-southgate,Holiday Inn Southgate,4.0,$$,11,"Got a free shuttle to The Henry Ford and to the Airport. Breakfast is great. Internet is free and easy. Price is good and pool is nice for kids. Decor is blah.Being a small business manager, I normally only use Yelp to give a referral.  That is sadly not the case here.  To make a long, painful story short, the first problem was overcharging of my credit card.  Of course, there was no one available to fix that issue.  I'll also add that they strongly favor corporate accounts and treat those of us spending a paycheck to just get away as a major inconvenience; constantly asking things like ""who are you even here with - why are you even renting a room here?!?"" Also, (just like the overcharge) their phone staff just tells you what they think you want to hear ... including ""checkout is 12pm"". Well, checkout is at 11am,which is fine, but don't make the mistake of leaving your family there one minute longer because the staff will threaten police involvement and make your wife and toddler wait in the lobby, with all of your belongings, until you get back.  A holiday stay at Holiday Inn is a terrible idea ...unless you're staying with your colleagues for a convention or something.Visited quite a few times, very nice hotel. The pool area is beautiful, the bar has live bands, the free breakfast buffet wasn't anything special but for free it works! My only gripe is, every time we have stayed there is always a huge spider somewhere!! All different times of the year, different rooms, so there must be some issue with them. They might want to look into that. Nothing that would keep me from going back but next time I'm bringing my own spray!! :)Went to this hotel for an office Christmas party, December 11, 2015. This is by far the best Holiday Inn I've been to! The food was so good, not the average banquet food. The food actually had flavor and great flavor at that!!! The staff was amazing!!! Every single staff member I encountered was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate. The pool and hot tub were crystal clear and the pool room was nice and warm as was the water! The breakfast was nice, more on the heavy side but delicious! I would recommend this hotel for staying and especially for banquets. The food was a traditional Christmas dinner with ham, turkey and most of the fixings. The meats were flavorful and best of all not dry! The gravy was tasty and real mashed potatoes! The stuffing was good and the veggie mix was not standard or mushy! The desserts were wonderful a great mix of pies, cakes, and cheese cakes and very scrumptious. Great Hotel!!!My hubby and I went here the Sunday evening after valentine day,  we had a very pleasant experience. Crystal was probably one of the best customer service personal I have come across in a long time. Room 133 was a typical hotel room.Beds were comfortable, sheets were awesome .Toilet was a little to close to the wall for my wide behind. .but manageable..Love that the light goes over the shower!  I hate taking a shower in very dim light...Pool area was gorgeous. Love the fact that it went from 3 feet to 9 feet deep...Hot tub was perfectly heated. . Extra hot.  But unfortunately the seats sit high and the water was extremely low..and there are no good jets.. . also the drain covers stock out horribly. . I stubbed my toes numerous times because I cannot see them under water...Besides our room, the pool area was the only room we visited. . But there is tons to do here...This review is only for Charlie's, the bar/lounge in the lobby.I went for a band's performance. Didn't order food, but the drinks were NOT good. I ordered a vodka tonic and I don't know if it was the tonic that came from the nozzles, but my drink was flat and disgusting. I stuck with beer for the rest of the night. Decent prices, though.Nicely renovated hotel, but most important - the staff went above and beyond for us. Ended up here because our car broke down on the way to Columbus, Ohio and they helped us with transportation (from where we were stuck) to pick up our luggage (where are car was towed) and helped us with a room that fit our family's needs. Thank you - highly recommend!!Outstanding value. Near to Detroit, and a safe area, without having to stay downtown and be charged parking at a downtown hotel. The service is outstanding and the staff are friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and food is good.Fantastic! Clean, friendly, reasonable, and a staff ready to give full effort. We stayed here for a wedding and decided after the 1st night to bring our babysitter for the weekend out and get her a room so the kids can enjoy the pool and convenience. The pool is huge and all very clean. We dealt with one real bitch of a waitress in the bar so it took away the fifth star (yes, she was that bad) but anyone looking for a room downriver, this is the best all round hotel mixing in service and value that you'll be able to find!This hotel gives a good all-around Holiday Inn experience. There's a pool and exercise room, and free wi-fi in the rooms. The restaurant and bar aren't too bad if you don't feel like driving elsewhere for food (and you do have to drive; no walking here!)Also the staff nicely recovered when no one was available to drive me to the airport - very quickly, one of the staff filled in and took me to DTW.The hotel was fine.  It was very clean, the pool was large and clean, the staff were very helpful and responded quickly to requests or concerns. We are thinking this will be our regular spot to stay when visiting relatives in the area (we've tried several of the hotels along Northline and in the area).",,,,,"['free', 'shuttle', 'henry',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/adoba-hotel-dearborn,Adoba Hotel,2.5,$$,57,"The building is new. In my opinion it is a bit overpriced, but I didn't have a bad experience there.5 years ago this hotel was one of the best in Dearborn when it was Hyatt. Now, it's comparable to any cheap motel. The carpet is very old in most of the floors and coming apart that makes you wonder if it ever gets cleaned. One of the shower towels had red lipstick staining it. The bed was comfortable however, I woke up the next day with couple red bumps on my face and chest which could suggest bed bugs. The phone in the room was from 1980 and doesn't work. How can you have a hotel room without a functioning phone !  Next to my room there was a couple staying with children and those kids were very loud, so apparently their walls are deteriorating or not sound proofed. It was a bad experience and won't come backHere again.Aww..sad to see so many people being let down by this establishment when I had a blast there! We got this hotel through Hotwire -- 2 nights for $160(incl. tax). I couldn't be happier with the location, the service staff and the view from our place! The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and stoked with towels, and the TV worked just fine. Only a light fixture was bad by the bedside but that didn't bother us. There was some sort of church convention going on when we went so the hotel was packed -- though I barely was bothered. The poor was nice and had dry towels :) We didn't get a chance to eat there but I'm sure it would've been alright :) Overall, I feel like I got a bang for my buck and I'm happy!I have to say this is a level of a motel, not a hotel.  Don't let the outside fool you, the lobby is structured to attract customers but once you are in the room, you will see the messy details.  I was here with friends visiting for the weekend and decided to stay for a night.  It definitely wasn't my choice, I usually yelp places before making a choice like this, but it was late and my friends and I wanted to crash after a long night of partying.  This was the closest.The beds were neatly tucked, everything looked great walking into the room.  The bathroom even fooled us.  We were too tired to pay too much close attention.  I woke up to my friends complaining on the phone (talking to the receptionist) about how disgusting the bathtub was.  I guess my friend wanted to take a quick shower and she couldn't because well the bathtub was closed up and filled with dirty water and mud.  Let me mention it again, the bathtub plug was closed, The receptionest says the pipes get backed up sometimes, but the plug was literally shut, someone closed it, please explain how the pipe went through the plug to fill the bathtub.  It makes no sense...we had to ask for a new room to shower, they didn't even offer or even suggested to give us some money back.  It was disappointing.If you pay Hotel prices, you better expect hotel service....cleanliness and customer service is what gives a hotel 5 star. I only give 2 stars, 1 for clean beds(as far as I know, they are clean) and 2 for letting us shower in a different room.*Disclosure: I stayed here for a blogger weekend and received a comped room.I had never stayed at this hotel or actually even been in this hotel before last weekend. It used to be a Hyatt Dearborn, and in fact will be rebranding sometime this month or the next to another chain hotel, but for right now it's the adoba hotel. I had a king-sized room all to myself, which was pretty awesome. The room itself is very nice, and the bed was comfortable. I was on the 14th floor and had a view of Ford and Detroit off in the distance. The bathroom is a little small, IMO, but the functionality of it was fine. Rooms also come with Samsung flatscreen TVs, contrary to some of the older reviews here ... I only had the TV on for about ten minutes but the picture was great.We ate in the hotel restaurant, Giulio &amp; Sons, three times (two breakfasts + one dinner) while here - check out my review - and I'd recommend that as well.Hotel has a gorgeous lobby area. We stayed here Thursday through Sat AM; Thurs/Fri wasn't that busy, but Sat the hotel started to get VERY busy, as there was an orchestra association conference (MSBOA) and also a dance group in attendance. I'd stay here again if I ever needed to stay in the Dearborn area / closer to Detroit. We also got a sneak peek of the rotunda area, which is rented out for events, and it had awesome views all around.The hotels is a grand lady who is showing her age. She still looks like a 1970s Hyatt (which it was built as). I have a feeling that if it stays like it is for another twenty years it's going to be a pretty trendy neat place. Now, it's kind of warn out, but really still a nice hotel for the price. I would recommend it.I won't recommend the restaurant. It's one of those dated places that have lots and lots and lots of food, most of it without much flavor.The hotel was a big disappointment. My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night in one of the suites. Big mistake! The suite was not worth the money. Bill was well over $300 for one night. It was unattractive, very outdated, with peeling wallpaper and old furnishings. It didn't even have a frig or microwave. Hotels at half the cost at least have those amenities. The TV didn't have any premium channels available.Unfortunately, they also had a dance competition of some sort that weekend and our suit was across from one of the captains. We knew this because they placed an ugly sign outside the doors of the suites. We endured a lot of loud talking and ""going and comings"" in the hall outside. What a night to remember. We were very tempted to just leave but just tried to be a good sport.We were checked out the next morning by a woman at the front desk claiming to be the assistant hotel manager. She needed to look the part. I don't consider a sweat suit and messy hair to be presentable for hotel staff and management especially when you're paying this kind of money.This place was once a 5 star hotel that has not been updated in years.  When you first see the building you are very impressed with it's size and style...but, very quickly you realize you are not in 5 star heaven.  I read the other Yelp reviews, so I was not expecting 5 star treatment....I love having Yelp.  Yelp is always right on the money.About 25 years ago, I stayed at this beautiful hotel when it was a Hyatt.  It was state of art in design and service.  I felt like I was visiting a an old beautiful friend that had left herself go.  Sad...On a brighter side...I used a Groupon and it only cost me $80.00 a night.  The $80.00 is total...taxes, etc.   Plus free parking, a free appetizer every night and the bed was oh so comfy.  I enjoyed my stay, but sorry to see the place in the condition that it is in...Oh...the service is below average...but for the price I was happy.I was overcharged by $450 dollars for a one night stay. Called the day we checked out after seeing 6 different charges go through on my credit card - I was told it was a mistake and that they would credit me a partial amount until they could figure out what was happening. It's been four days, no credits back to my card and I get the run around when I call, and of course no call backs. The hotel itself was fine, although rampant with small kids...there must have been a dozen in the room above me from the sound of it...The room service was also fine and prompt.We are here right now. I'm so grossed out I called Priceline to get the heck out of here and Adoba won't refund us because they said we've been here since 5. We have not. But let me paint a picture.An opulent lobby at first glance. Look closer and its dirty. Trash on the floors, dirty elevators. The halls for the rooms have carpet so worn, there is tape to keep it down. For real. The room is stifling warm. The carpet filthy. Food crumbs and such, dirty. The bathroom mirror is dirty. The shower curtain is dirty with stains.The bed.Oh my God.The bed has 4 layers. Flat sheet, comforter, flat sheet, flat sheet. There is no fitted sheet just a flat sheet on the mattress. No mattress pad, just a thin sheet between me and a mattress I can't even describe because it makes my skin crawl. There is a bed skirt, but it too is stained. Oh, and you can see how miserable the mattress is.My husband called the front desk (after having to plug in the broken phone) for a fitted sheet. With a promise to call back unfulfilled, he called again and was told they didn't have any fitted sheets. He tried to explain the sheet comes off and he moves a lot in his sleep. He got a sorry and that was that. He actually asked me if he should go to target and buy sheets. Thinking a shower would help our mood we discovered the shower doesn't drain well at all. Ankle deep water was the icing on the cake.We also tried the pool which was also filthy. Garbage on the floor, dirty towels all over. Don't even get me started on the pending $100 charge to my debit card for ""incidentals""Just don't do it. This place sucks.Called four days before check in to request a refrigerator. Upon check in I was told it was first come first serve. Due to a gluten allergy I have a car full of food that melted by the time they got me a fridge.... Additionally, I got up to my room after check in &amp; the key did not work. Twenty five minutes later they sent a new key which also did not work... I have been waiting almost an hour now. Still no working key, the safety lock is about to fall off &amp; the room is very dusty. I have missed check in for my seminar because of this... The wifi doesn't work &amp; the sweet sound of doors slamming all night is just the cherry on the top of this over priced hotel. I hope my continuing ed seminar is held elsewhere next year so I don't have to stay here again.This place is disgusting. I wish I could give it 0 stars. There was an earring left in our bed, the staff at the front desk were extremely rude besides maybe two employees. The only good thing about this hotel was the location and the fact that the manager refunded our money because of our bad experience.This is a cheap motel disguised in a grand looking hotel on the outside. The following were some of the mishaps during our stay:1- Room is really outdated, the Air conditioning unit takes enormous amount of time to change temperatures, rendering us shivering the majority of the night. 2- Room service: advertised products are not actually served, after placing breakfast order, 10 mins later a call was made telling us some of the items will not be available for breakfast. 3- No shower gel! we had to bring our own, and when we asked for it, they stated"" the hotel ran out"" incredible ! so they gave us two bottles of lotion, that was their version of accommodating us. 4- house keeping does an absolutely horrendous job in cleaning, merely did the bed, did not clean bathroom , vacuum or take out the trash, I have stayed in 45 dollar motels before, where house keeping was better than this.5- No Bellman service, despite the front desk telling us they will help us once we are done checking out,  No carts or anything of the like either. Dont waste your money with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> or this hotel, you are better off paying 45 dollars in a cheap motel instead.I just spent time reading a lot of the reviews here. From what it seems like, they have a sincere customer relations employee responding to all reviews but the management doesn't seem to be listening to the feedback. Which makes me feel guilty giving this rating of 3, but well, I would have given it a 2 otherwise.The hotel looks good, from the outside. the elevators are fancy, and the rooms are good. The bathrooms are kind of small and need renovation. My complaint is about the room service- A. Why is there no room service menu?B. Why does dinner service shut at 10? No in room dining post 10? C. Even their bar stops dinner at 10! It doesn't make sense to me. There must be some work around. I, sadly, am a sucker for marriot points and will not return. These guys need to sort some stuff out if they need their rating to get better. Good luck.In 1999, we (Henry Ford High) used their ballroom for prom. It was fun to come back and reminisce as an adult!I have mixed emotions about this hotel. For the price the rooms are not bad (actually quite large) even though they are very outdated. The front desk was backed up with 40 people waiting and only 2 people working. They also did not have any sense of urgency so this exasperated the problem. We had a conference in the hotel and the meals, amenities, and staff were great. The bar downstairs is extremely overpriced ($24 for a double jack on the rocks!) and the service there was average.All in all this was probably a fair value but it could be an exceptional value with just a few improvements.I was really excited to stay here with my husband for the two nights we had booked. We got a good deal for the room online. The hotel itself is beautiful, inside and out. I love the elevators, the way you can see all the floors if you go up and look down. It has a nice classy feel to it. The gift shop, coffee shop and restaurants are definitely nice as well, same with the pool. Although I will say the pool looks smaller in person. Our room was a Standard King room, it included a king size bed, flat screen smart TV, a desk with a desk chair and two other additional cushioned chairs. The view was pretty nice, I like the wide windows. We also had a small coffee pot and some coffee, which we did not use. The room is nice, the layout makes it feel open and spacious, I like that. It doesn't look like the typical hotel room, layout wise.  I really liked how the TV was on a pull out stand that you could adjust for a good viewing angle. I do have some complaints however. The bathroom could definitely use some TLC. The bathtub looked old, and had black rust/gunk around the drain. The sides were tiled, which isn't really good because it holds dirt. *I will admit I am VERY PICKY when it comes to tubs/bathrooms so most people would probably be fine with*. I ended up showering with flip flops on haha. Also the shower curtains should be washed after every guess visit. Ours had soap residue and water stains. The bathroom was also small, but not a big deal. It had shampoo, lotion and nice smelling soaps. The room could use some updating, style wise. The curtains and carpets just seem outdated. Also the carpets were sticky in some areas, and the ground itself was very uneven. The bed was very firm, but I like that. The pillows were soft and comfortable. I enjoyed sleeping in it for the most part.It was a bit noisy, and we could hear the conversations of our neighbors very clearly. This was probably because we were placed in a connecting room (with a second door inside the room that connects to the room next door). So you might want to stay away from that since the noise travels through the doors. This isn't really the hotels fault though, just noisy guests. The room doors were also really noisy at night and woke me up several times as people left/entered their rooms. Again though this could be solved if people just closed the doors slowly.Also the air didn't seem to get much cooler when we turned it down.I enjoyed the free internet, and the free parking as well, there is A LOT of parking areas. Also, they tried to charge us 10$ for two waters from the room. We never even had water in our room besides the Kroger bottles we brought with us. We even called when we first went in to our room and noticed there was no water, to make sure they didn't charge us for it thinking we drank it. They said they wouldn't yet they did. The charge was taken off but still annoying.Would I stay here again? Probably not if I ever returned to Dearborn. Don't get me wrong, it is very nice, and if you get a good deal it's worth it. It just wasn't MY favorite. However, If they ever renovate, and I am in town, I would try it again.I'd read some horror stories on this hotel, so was expecting the worst &amp; my expectations were very low.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised:  Yes, its an old hotel (1976).  Yes, it's only been partially updated - the room's fixtures in particular needed refreshed.  And the gym - don't even bother - walk over to the LA Fitness at the mall across the street instead and get a day pass....But everything that could have been changed that was important, had been done.  The beds were comfortable, the room was quiet, I had a fantastic Samsung HDTV, fast and free internet, and the restaurant was not at all bad (if a bit heavy).  The hotel markets itself as eco-friendly - I'm not exactly sure what was so green about it, but I very much appreciated the boxes of water over plastic bottles - nice touch.So yeah, groove on the 1970's futuristic interior, drink an awesome carton of water, and check out the view across miles of Dearborn's finest parking lots.  Just don't expect a boutique hotel experience. Solid 3 stars.Found this hotel last minute online for under $100. night. I was in town with a friend to attend a concert, and sadly, our plans to stay in Detroit itself did not work out. I was a bit concerned staying in the burbs in regards to traffic... but apparently this isn't much of a problem in Detroit outside of the actual concert traffic.First off, having underestimated the traffic headed into the concert, we chose halfway on our drive between Chi town and the D to skip checking in at the hotel until after the show. One quick call, and I was told a late check in was noted and all set. We arrived at 1 am, and were quickly helped at the desk. Though it may not be brand new and sparkly, the hotel appeared clean and well cared for. With as many people as we saw sitting out front (post concert attendees), the hotel was quiet... though with 700+ rooms, it is easy to space out guests. The room was also spacious and clean. The water in the shower did drain pretty slowly, and one of the sinks in the room had a small leak... but that was the extent of the issues.There is a small Starbucks with a limited menu located in the lobby, and a large mall literally across the parking lot which is nice in the event you forget to bring something, or need extra clothing.The area in general has a very suburban feel. There are nice apartments nearby and the mall appeared large with stores like Macy's visible.  There are also a couple of Starbucks and other coffee shops within a 10 minute drive. We also saw several bars and restaurants which appeared new int he vicinity.Overall,  a clean, quiet, safe location to stay and rest. Though it is not right downtown, we were able to get into the city center in about 20 minutes time on most occasions,Nice hotel, with a cheap price! Pretty modern And very clean! Valet and self parking!","Can I give negative stars? Seriously, my husband, my two year old son and I stayed here last night and there are few hotels that are worse. First, we found out they don't have cribs available. So that means my husband and I get to sleep in the bed with our two year old son. Which means we get kicked in the head and the stomach all night not to mention staying half awake to make sure he doesn't fall out of bed. Then, the first thing we see when we step out of the elevator on our floor was a roach walking across the floor. Our room was average for most hotels. Then when we got back on the elevator, there was broken glass on the floor. I do have to say, everyone we met who was working at the hotel was very friendly. I should probably give one star for those people.From the moment we pulled up to the dark entrance, we knew it would be a weekend from hell. Let me preface by saying that we travel at least 10 times a year, staying in all different hotels and I have personally never found enough unsatisfactory that I found it necessary to complain, until this past weekend. No bell service, 1 attendee at the front desk with a line of angry people waiting, filthy rooms (I'm talking mold and chewed gum on the headboard, not to mention, maintenance had to come to my room 3 separate times) A staff member who shall remain nameless (SUE) harassed 2 children in front of at least 20 adults and when it was brought to the 20-year-old manager's attention, she practically rolled her eyes. I will NEVER stay at this hotel EVER again. I don't even want to think about it anymore, it makes me so sick to my stomach. Should be torn down.And I just went through all of the responses from Adoba...bathtubs still not fixed. Liars.Not cheap, but not expensive either. We stayed because it is close to the Henry Ford museum. The music was on in the lobby all night which we could hear from our room, so that was a pain. But the rooms were spacious and they are also dog friendly.Not too bad!  Stayed here as part of a conference that I attended recently.  Like other reviewers, I found some of the decor and furniture a bit outdated.  The service was good...not great.  The conference rooms/accommodations were fairly typical.  The good:  Stayed on the 14th floor, great views!  The amount of channels available on their cable was astonishing.  The room service was prompt and attentive (the burger was good too). The bad:  Outdated decor, Average service (outside the room service).  I would go back!On the outside this hotel is beautiful and right in front of a big mall. It literally takes 5 minutes tops to walk to the mall. On the inside the hotel is even more beautiful than the outside. There is a Starbucks right when you walk in. They have the best breakfast I've ever had at a hotel by far. The pool and gym is amazing and indoor. The room was nice. I have to take off one star for this hotel still having old school standard definition TVs. How hard is it to buy a flat screen TV for every room in bulk. Oh well. It was still a good experience overall and I would go back.Good place for conference (big hotel), meeting and such, nice parking, not too busy location....BUT..Room is not good where I stayed. not cleaned up well. Bathroom is awful (even after I mentioned it to front desk), ventilation/HVAC is bad. I will stay nearby newer (and cheaper) hotel while attending meeting/conference from now on.I have traveled all over the world with my organization. To arrive to Dearborn  Michigan, at the Adobe hotel. The whole set of the hotel is bad including the station  elevator button. Room did not get clean until 4pm. Request clean face rags only for maid to say you only get one. Front desk management was rude. Had no coffee in room. Trash was every where. Floors where not vacuum and trays where not picked up for the two days I was thier. Guests smoking drugs.call corporate office and has not heard back yet. Not a good place to relax.I have stayed here several times in hopes that the first two times were just pure coincidence that my terrible experience wasn't an actual reflection, unfortunately staying this last time just proves this place  should be a motel! My first experience the front desk staff double charged me and instead of offering to refund offered me a ""free"" in other words come back and stay for the same amount we just charged you. Considering I'm in Michigan a lot I stupidly took this so call ""free"" room. Upon arriving to my room my second visit I was exhausted from my 5 hour drive only to find that my room hadn't been cleaned from the people before and there was fresh blood stains on the sheets of the bed when I called down to customer service she said she'd call me back...when she called back her response was ""it's not possible that the room wasn't cleaned, I just checked the clip board and it was marked cleaned."" I requested for her to come up and look which she said wouldn't make a difference. Finally after hours of complaint and taking the dirty sheets off the bed and too the front desk she finally moved my room to another one but STILL charged me for the old rooms open water! This last experience once again wasn't any better, I checked in at 2am and checked out by 8am, would of checked out sooner had I realized that my tub had hair chucks and dirt filled in it floating, when I told the manager she said oh that happens our building is old just rinse it off and I can send a engineer up to fix it. What kind of customer service is this? I'm not paying motel price for motel services I'm paying hotel prices...n getting less than I would at the worst rated motel. She wasn't apologetic nor did she even attempt to accommodate us in any way. A picture is attached of the disgusting tub. I would never ever stay at this garage hotel again.My stay here can be summed up as utterly disappointing. For how large, centralized to nearby businesses and how expensive it is, this hotel really needs to step it up and act like a hotel, not a motel. When I checked in, my room's toilet was leaking and constantly running, the lighting on the wall was falling out of the wall and everything was extremely run down and dirty. I ordered food daily and it was some of the most flavorless and overpriced food I've ever had. I had better and cheaper food at The Henry Hotel across the way. I had several encounters with staff who seemed annoyed with having customers and honestly, didn't seem like they wanted to be working there. I waited for 20 minutes to get my receipt upon checking out and they just never tended to me. I called when I got home to get my receipt emailed and sat on hold two different times for 45 minutes each and never got helped. I usually stay at The Henry when I'm in town monthly for work and for being a direct competitor I don't know what this place is thinking. Do yourself a hugeI had a miserable experience.  It was freezing. It was my wedding night too. They knew that the heater wasn't working but they still pretended that they are working on it! Avoid this place like the plague!!!! Even worse is how they refused to refund me!2.5 stars really, not terrible, but nothing special. Staff was very courteous, lobby nice, rooms average. We were unable to control the room temp with the thermostat and it was quite stuffy. The pool area was pretty dilapidated.This hotel has the potential to be a solid 4-star, but...  it falls a little short.  My husband and I stayed overnight and came to the same conclusions...1)  Room service, Martini lounge, restaurant - while all nice, we thought were pretty overpriced.  For a large pot of coffee from RS, we paid $13, and tipped on that!  Martini's averaged $9 - $12 PER drink at Archimedes.  Dinner was pretty good, but not worth spending  $25+ an entree by any stretch.  The in-room water-in-a-carton was $5.  Really.........?  2) They're not very generous with room items.  Two bath towels are standard, had to ask for more.  The toiletries were ""meh""...  I can't use shampoo/conditioner in 1, I have long, thick hair, so just as well I packed my own.  Also, the in-room coffee maker was one-serving, and of course, they leave one regular, one decaf, leaving the couple to fight over who gets the regular, hence our ordering our high dollar coffee via room service.One cool thing is that they're all digital - including menus!  I enjoyed looking over menus on a tablet...    Plus, staff was very nice and helpful.  I have nothing bad to say about any staff experiences.Another great aspect is that it is right there next to Fairlane Mall.It's clean, close to shopping and points of interest, but a bit spendy compared to other places.The hotel is a beautiful structure, but don't let the beautiful lobby fool you.The problem starts with customer service and the administration.  I booked my room through a third party vendor.  The next day once I had flown to Los Angeles I find that my cc had been charged for a full room price in addition to what I had paid the 3rd party vendor.  The customer service from that point was horrible, I could find a manger, and everyone politely passed the buck, or placed me on hold.  My next call is the BBB, I'm sure I won't be placed on hold as long.Very disappointed. Ownership/ management has taken this regal looking building and allowed it to decay--with reference to both the structure and the level of service.On a holiday weekend with the hotel booked to capacity, one elevator did not function, and the rest were stuffed into the others, causing up to 20 minutes to get from your room to the lobby.Understaffed hotel, line out the door in the coffee shop all weekend bc only one person was working. This place has gone in the opposite direction of the neighboring Henry, which had reinvented itself into a beautiful, trendy and contemporary hotel. I'd look into staying there instead in the future.So I booked my room through a third party site at a really good rate for this so called four star hotel for four nights.  The outside and the lobby area look expressive however when I got to my room I thought I was at a 2 star hotel.  This room was very small, no sofa just bed and an awful looking chair.  At one point I went to turn on the standing floor lamp. Upon reaching under the lamp shade for the switch I found the light fixture was off of its base and exposing the wires.  I'm glad my 6 year old didn't try to turn it on.   My 2nd night in Detroit was very cold.  I turned the thermostat up to heat the room expecting a good nights rest.  That morning I learned the heat in the room was not working since me and my family were freezing that same morning.  I called the front desk and was told they would send an engineer to fix the heater ASAP.  When we returned that night I contacted the front desk to make sure we would not freeze again and was assured the problem was fixed.  We got the the room to find a large portable heater.  Not an offer to change our room?  This is not what Ive experienced in a 4 star hotel before.  Each night I would pull our car to the front of the hotel to let my wife a son out so they would not endure the long walk in the cold weather and rain from the free parking lot.  I was never asked by the valet attendant if I wanted to use that service.  I give Adoba Hotel  2 stars for the free parking, free internet and easy check-in.  I won't be back, however I will stay downtown next time.So Im surfing the travel sites looking for a good rate for my third trip ever to Michigan and I see the Adoba Hotel, which excited me because I stayed here 6 months ago and had an incredible time. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous... Glass Elevators!! I rode them like 300 times!!! Anyway... Im looking at some recent reviews and can't believe this is the same place.... Not sure if these people live in castles or if the hotel had some off nights.  I sort of wish I gave the hotel some review love after my trip but no complaints equals no motivation to review.    My experience was quite pleasant, my room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable... so much that I inquired about the mattress type and found it was made by the brand.  I loved the lobby and the pool area. The breakfast buffet is amazing and the last night I stayed I had a ribeye steak that rivals the Ruths Chris that I frequent back home... I still dream about that piece of meat.  I will for sure book there again this time around. DONT LET ME DOWN ADOBA!!!!!Firstly, I just want to explain that the ONLY reason I am not giving this hotel a 5 star is because the pool/hot tub/sauna closes at 10:00pm.I recently booked this hotel through hotwire because I had a 6am flight out of DTW. When we received our confirmation and showed up to the hotel, we were floored! The hotel is absolutely gorgeous inside and the outside looks like some sort of fortress. The front desk staff was super friendly and we even received two free drink tickets to enjoy at the ""welcome reception"" for new guests.The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious with two sinks. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others. Although I was only there for a few hours because of my super early flight, I had a great time. The TV wasn't a flat screen which didn't bother us but thought we ought to include it in our review in case that's a deal-breaker for others.Also, it's across from the mall and 15 minutes from DTW.This place is awesome!Stayed one night a while back and it was such a great deal. The place was clean and tastefully decorated. We had an interaction with the manager and she went out of her way to ensure we were happy customers. Even put us on the top floor.Best part mighta been the grub. We got there as they were closing so they treated us to an extra cream puff or five :)No joke...this hotel is SO dry. Bring lots of tissue. You will need it to blow crusty snot from your nose and sop up the blood that is gushing from your nose. :/I stayed at this hotel for 3 days, this past weekend for a dance convention. While I like the whole idea of a green hotel, I wasn't impressed at all.Back when this hotel was The Hyatt Regency, it was super fancy and a nice place to stay. Since it switched to Adoba, it's truly not worth the price point, IMO.My room was not stocked as it should have been. There was no information for room service or local attractions as every other hotel that I have stayed in did. The carpet was worn and warped in a few areas. The bathroom door was filthy and the wallpaper was peeling off of the walls in the sink/coffee area. The only reason that I did not give this hotel 1 star is because the bed and pillows were SO comfortable! Again though...not worth the $120+ a night.The price and location of this hotel support the four-star rating it receives. But, mostly, since we were traveling to Detroit with our 33-lb. dog who travels with us 99% of the time, the fact that they were pet friendly was an added bonuses. Our story begins when we pulled up to the hotel after spending 10 hours on the road (three of which were spent in very bad traffic), we found the valets to be extremely professional, kind, and helpful. They helped unpack a lot of our gear at a late hour in a pleasant demeanor and during our 2-night stay, we continued to find the staff at the hotel to be nothing short of friendly, helpful, and courteous. And as with most service industry folks, if you throw them a little extra green, they will up their level of service even more.  As many yelpers have stated, the hotel was built in the late '70s and the decor was certainly a throwback to a what I call ""mid-western Ramada  chic"" circa 1987. I have been lucky enough to have been a business traveler in my previous career and also have family in the hotel industry, so I've stayed at some truly exceptional 5-star properties: the Ritz Carlton, A number of Fairmonts, Le Parker Meridien in NYC, some JW Marriotts, so with that said, If you've really got your heart set on a haute coture boutique hotel that would don the pages of Dwell or Vogue, you might want to shift your expectations, but if what you seek is a safe, clean, almost anonymous -feeling hotel (they have 700 rooms), then this place is great as a home base. We felt wonderfully safe at all times, both in the hotel and leaving our car in the parking lot. A large mall is right across the street, so while I'm not a mall shopper, it was definitely nice to be able to run in there for some necessities since we were on the road for two weeks. The distance to the Henry Ford Museum is minimal (go there, it is one of America's best kept secrets). It's also a quick drive to other local points of interest: Dearborn, Corktown, Midtown, Belle Isle, Ferndale, etc. etc. We grabbed a yummy latte in the morning from the Starbucks downstairs since our in-room coffee maker was leaking (my only complaint). I can't give a rating to the onsite bar or restaurants since we're poor grad students who ate out of a cooler most of the time we were there, and when we did splurge to go out to eat or drink, we preferred to have a bite out in Detroit to support the local businesses. We loved our experience and would have no problem staying there again given the fact that it's Detroit and is very much a town still rebuilding itself. My last and most important observation is that the bed was extremely comfortable and clean and as far as hotel experiences go, this is the biggest thing I care about after traversing around town all day.","From the moment I walked in I was impressed. The hotel was immaculate.  This was previously the Hyatt so I wasn't too surprised. The check-in process was a breeze and I was very impressed with Nicholas who assisted me. I felt like he took ownership in his job and I could tell he liked working there. He explained the layout of the hotel in detail and even pointed out how they were ""going green"".  He also told me about the ""organic"" menu at the on-site restaurant.The beds are great and the rooms what I would expect from a former Hyatt hotel.  Definitely on the nicer side of things.  I recommend trying it out!Love the banquet hall! Wedding reception went great with the staff really helpful and on pointOur organization has a contract for our conferences 2 day stay over, for the last 2 years I have gone and it has progressive gotten worse.  The lamp had no switch has to screw the blub off and on. Carpet is in terrible condition in the rooms and in some of the corridors on the main floor and above.  It is mended with duct tape or gorilla tape lots of it. I was charged 15.00 a day for parking. Outrageous.  Rooms are overpriced next year I will be stay at another hotel as will my friends that came with me. The employees were very good. But management sucks.NOTE: My rating is based on the hotel's venue, event planing and wedding services, not the hotel stay as I cannot comment on that.I was very underwhelmed by the staff and front desk who may not be treating guests at an event with the same care as they would paying guests. We came there for an event (so we were not paying hotel guests but still a guest). We were looking for a place to hang our hat before the event (about 2 hours to kill in between) and we came to find out that if you weren't a paying for a hotel room and in possession of drink tickets, you can't get a drink anywhere..even in the restaurant, they refused to serve us a drink unless we paid for a room and had drink tickets...seriously ?!?!!? I'm sure there must be some reason for this hotel to do this..but I have never seen this out of any good hotel I've been for an event.I know I will likely not host any of my events (or recommend it) here as my guests would have to drive away from the hotel to relax and have a drink in between the event if they didn't have a room for the night.If I were this hotel and someone was hosting an event in the ballrooms, I would get a stack of tickets or at least allow guests of the event to sit at the bar and have a drink during the lull times.Oh..one other point..no one on the front desk will tell you that the restaurant also won't serve you without a ticket (even if u get an appetizer) . So, either the front desk has no idea about the hotel or they just didn't want to say no....overall..it may be a great hotel with a great bed but it must be they have some bad element nearby to have such an unheard of policy with drink tickets (and no one really wants to let you know until you directly ask)..I can't think of any other reason nor have I ever experienced such a policy.I checked in on New Year's Eve and I didn't get much sleep because some hoodlums were in the room next door blasting music til well after 1am. I Called front desk to complain and they didn't do anything about it, so I slept with headphones in. The next night my husband requested an extra blanket at around 10, so someone brought up a blanket, knocking on the door, prompting my dog to bark briefly until the knocking stopped. After that, management called my room at 11:30 pm and asked me if I had an animal in my room. I guess the genius check in clerk didn't mark it down and charge me appropriately. I was holding my dog upon check in. Why disturb me that late and bother me with your staffs mistake? The Unprofessional management here also claimed that my dog almost ""bit"" one of the housekeepers earlier that day. Funny how a dog can bite someone from inside a crate. My dog is 4lbs and has never bit anyone! He Also lied and said he stood outside of my door for 25 minutes and listened to my dog bark nonstop, which was also false. (Don't you have better things to do anyways?!) My dog has a shock collar. He also stated that he was doing me a favor by not relocating my room because I wasn't in a ""pet friendly room"" (the stains on the carpet tell me otherwise) This place claims they're ""pet friendly"" but management obviously hates animals. Will never stay here again!Very nice lobby area and check in.  Get three complimentary drinks.  The elevators are very fast and there are five of them.  The rooms were nice, nothing special but very clean.  I really liked this hotel for its price range.Very nice hotel, rooms &amp; beds were very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed here a few more days. The lady that checked us in was very friendly. Upon check in, they had cupcakes, cold water, and were given drink tickets at the front desk. Restaurants were a short drive away.I like this hotel. We stayed to get away from home.  It's quite pretty we liked the restaurant too and not many hotels around here have a sauna. Nice staff.  We changed rooms because the first one had the tv on the side and the swivel wasn't enough to see from the bed.  Next room had heat issues but nothing out of the ordinary. We got the room online for under $100. I would stay here again.Good hotel. I got it off of hotwire for a great price. Lobby and service are extremely nice and helpful. The room are okay. They do not match the swankiness of the lobby, but they are clean and quiet. The lobby and service are  4-star quality, the room is 3-star. Internet a little slow, but okay. It might have just been the room location.If it is the right price, this is a solid hotel, but it is not overall a 4-star hotel like it is indicated on some sites.This is the hotel formerly known as the Hyatt.  It is a new Green hotel and has been getting better and better each and every day. The staff is working hard to make it all work while maintaining a green atmosphere.Check out happy hour in the lobby bar for fun! The food upstairs is really great!Things are sliding down hill a little here. We visited for an event and hoped to get a glass of wine. We learned their liquor license had lapsed. No wine for you!If I could rate this an absolute zero I would.  This place use to be a Hyatt but is an absolute dump now.  There is mold in the showers and the service is horrendous.  We had a work event here and the phones have been out for days, I was in a supposedly clean room and a day later I went to throw something in the trash only to find dirty diapers.  I could understand if this slipped by the cleaning person for one day but not two!Really nice and quiet.They are pursuing a green and eco-friendly business plan, with the in hotel restaurant being predominately Organic. Great restaurant by the way.Really nice staff, was driven in a complimentary town car to a business meeting this morning. When I arrived and they checked my ID I was given 5 drink tickets for a complimentary wine or beer in the lobby every evening from 5 till 10.Some of these may have been extra features due to it being the off season and the hotel not being full for a convention. Nevertheless a really superb place.The hotel is decent... Rooms could be and should be upgraded for the price!!! The tv is old, the phones are old, the iron is old, the bathroom is extremely tiny. No menu for food had to try and read it off of the blurry old school tv... For a random nights stay it would do the job i guess. The Henry across the way is way better.This is a 1970s style and it doesn't clean up well with the Reno because it is so dark inside - the pool and gym are really dated and the surrounding area looks like dated suburbia - boring place to stay -I cannot comment on the rooms themselves, because we never made it to that point.  I was in town overnight with my mother to pick my father up from the hospital.  We had booked the Adoba hours before we arrived, and we did not arrive until late, especially because we went to see my father before we went to the hotel.  Immediately after making the reservation I called the hotel to find out their exact pet policy (I knew they were ""pet friendly"", but that was it), as we had a couple of small dogs with us.  I was only told that it was a $30 charge per dog.  This was acceptable.  The hotel was booked in my mothers name so when we arrived at nearly midnight she went to check in.  She was told that the hotel required a 3 day notice for pets, and that if they were to give us a room (which they wouldn't) it would be a $75 charge per dog.  This, obviously, is more than double what the girl told me just a few hours earlier, and she had not made a single mention of the 3 day notice policy.  I am astonished that a business would feel it acceptable to blatantly lie about their policy.  Needless to say, we were put in the position of trying to track down another room at midnight, when this could have been done earlier in the day, which was the last thing we needed to deal with after the stress of the previous week.Absolutely HORRIFIC.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  It is truly run like a flop house.  It is a run down Hyatt with a new name.  The restaurant is a glorified, OVER-PRICED buffet, they do not have room service (well, they will say they do, but I assure you they DO NOT), carpets are stained, lounges are covered with table cloths over the registers because they do not have a beer, wine or liquor license...just a terrible experience from start to finish.",,,"['building', 'new', 'opinion', 'bit', 'overpriced', 'bad',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dearborn-inn-a-marriott-hotel-dearborn,"The Dearborn Inn, A Marriott Hotel",4.0,$$,53,"Ended up here on a business trip and glad I did! Wonderful staff and great food. I especially enjoyed the apple pie and homemade vanilla ice cream !!I stayed in this place about 5times. It is gradually becoming worst. One thing to be a historic hotel and there is another thing being horrible in maintaining the place. Last two times, they sticked me to the Burkbank house which is worst than a motel 6. The rooms smelled like mildew. The carpet was old. The Computer chair was old and bed was sagging. Worst was the shower. TINY ! You can not face the shower and raise your left arm because the wall was there. you have to shampoo your hair sideway. The iron  in the room was from the 1980's and no heat. Brown steam came out. I suppose the main building is better but DEFINITELY NOT THE BURBANK HOUSE !I am done with this one. Had the Herny hotel was soldout, I would have stayed there with similar price. Even the Courtyard on Mercury drive has bigger rooms and showers as compare to this so called historic hotel. Time has past them by. Dont stay there !Pretty hotel.  The main lobby area is beautiful.  Pros- easy way to get to Henry Ford.  Rooms are clean, nice desk area.   Easy place to stay when attending a wedding close by the hotelCons- parking situation is a bit confusing.  You have to check in in one building then drive to another building where your room is.  They have multiple buildifs so it was difficult to know where to park and to find which building was which.+ beautiful building, friendly staff-  pricey, tiny rooms, needs renovationsI stayed here for a couple of nights for a wedding.  The front desk staff was very nice to us at check-in.  The room on the other hand was super small, you could hardly move around.  The bathroom in the room was also very small.  As I walk around the hotel, it is a nice place, but you can see some hallways and floors that just look too tired and are in need of updating.  Staying here was just not worth the premium we paid.The wedding was nice and the food was good, nothing outstanding.Good hotel and meeting/conference space. Historic property with modern rooms. I have had some rooms there that were very large, with sitting area and TV, etc.  Great Location in relation to Henry-Ford related tourist sites. Property has important and interesting regional history. Pretty good restaurant and bar as well. Well trained restaurant staff sometimes sloppy like anywhere but all in all a good spot to stay, eat or both.I have attended many solid conferences there and it would be a nice place for a wedding.I've stayed here twice now, and nothing but pleasant things to say. The staff is super friendly with multiple greeting points, reception is more than willing to accommodate room requests. The beds were surprisingly comfortable (almost feels like a pillow/foam topper or something) and clean. Bathroom/shower is easy to use.Oh, and if you're hungry, the bar inside the hotel in the main building is open until 11pm. Huge beer list (managed to snag a bottle of Boddington's Pub Ale) and good food. I got the chicken scallopine and creme brulee, and both were delicious.Definitely coming back here if in the Dearborn area. Oh, and it's owned by Marriott, so make sure you have your rewards number!I have heard so many great things about their brunches held here I had to see for myself ~  Confirmed!  Extraordinary! Our family decided to come here for Mother's Day Brunch held in the Grand Ballroom.   The ballroom itself is so beautiful! The gorgeous chandeliers and white linen complete the elegant ambience.  There is a delectable buffet spread that is almost artful! it's spread out so every dish isn't on top of each other.  There is a great variety of mouth watering food to choose from such as salmon, salads, omelets, lamb and desserts to die for!  The prime rib especially was cooked to perfection as it melted in your mouth!  Service here is pristine.  Kim, who originally took my reservation over the phone, was there to greet us and check us in.  Our waitress, Clarisa, was very attentive and personable.  She really helped make my mom feel very special! The gentlemen working the omelet station, carving station and waffle station were very polite and friendly.  Every employee we talked with deserve a round of applause for knowing how to treat every guest.  It was such a pleasure!I would come back again in a heartbeat!  It is definitely worth it for the great service but also the historical value of the property itself.  It's great to explore around the beautiful site!Stayed for a night and was immediately impressed with the grounds although one of the dorms is being renovated. The main lobby is beautiful as is the sitting room just beyond the main entrance. We were placed at the McGuffey dorm and noticed that there are no mini-fridges in the room.  Room wasn't anything spectacular but I have no complaints as this is a ""historic"" hotel. The outdoor pool was terrific. No spa. The bar was nicely updated as was Emerson's restaurant where we had a terrific brunch. I would definitely recommend.This was my fifth or sixth stay at the Dearborn Inn in Dearborn, Michigan and by far it is my favorite property to stay at if I'm in the Metro Detroit area.  It is located next to Ford's headquarters (which means you'll see experimental cars being tested in camouflage), with easy access to the Metropolitan Airport, downtown, and Ann Arbor if you have a car to get around.The hotel is furnished in a traditional decor and is set on a large, grassy property.  It has a concierge's lounge, quality room service, free parking, and exercise facilities.  Basically everything I look for during a business trip at a reasonable price.  When I'm in Detroit for work, this is where I'll stay.Great hotel, excellent service, very well maintained and clean.  What more can I say?  The staff is very friendly and helpful.The food was wonderful, the breakfast buffet in particular can't be beat.  We ended up eating all of our meals at the hotel because everything was so fresh, tasty and reasonably priced.I would definitely stay here again.This place is very convenient but don't be fooled by the dinner they provide here. I was helping out for Dearborn High School prom event and all of the guests received a three course meal. Lasagna was burned from the top layer. Salad is hand cut ( not pre chopped for you) Cheesecake was alright and the service was kinda slow. But overall very beautiful place to book!I only stayed one night but this was like an oasis in the middle of a desert. Wow! The lobby is huge and beautiful. Great gym. Friendly beautiful staff that were very helpful. Room was nice. Bathroom was a tight squeeze with little room for my big toiletry bag. No shower cap amenity which is annoying. They offer valet parking for $12 but the self park space is right next to the hotel and free. I will seek out this hotel in the future.Classic and historic with a beautiful lobby and restaurant.  I chose this property because it offered the same rate (a package) as the Courtyard a few miles away which I stay at often for business.Pros:  Friendly Staff, terrific location to the Henry Ford (museum and Greenfield village). The outdoor pool is the best I've seen outside a resort.  It is huge and has a 12 foot deep section and lap section.  My kids loved it for over 2 hours. Excellent buffet breakfast on Sunday.  Free wi-fi and Shuttle service to/from Greenfield Village.Cons:  Room was extremely small and dated. We were not informed that they had or we'd be staying in a building not connected to the hotel.  I was told our room was a bit larger than those in the main building.  While the bathroom was modern, the mattress in one of the beds sagged.  Luckily we were there for one night only because for four of us, we were very, very cramped.  The hotel offers room service but there would be no room to eat it for four people unless we ate in bed (which we did for our carryout).  I would not stay here again with the family and would instead stay at the Courtyard 3 miles away which offers larger rooms.  The upsetting part was that I checked the sq. footage of both properties and the courtyard's rooms were only a few sq. feet bigger but in reality, they are much larger.  With luggage, we had no room to walk around and no view.  At least at the Courtyard hotel, I could have received a balcony or patio with a view of a quiet courtyard.  As a Marriott Elite member, I expected a better room but was disappointed as I have stayed in much nicer rooms in the last two months at Best Western, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, and certainly Courtyard by Marriott.  But if you are staying for one night in the summer and have kids,you cannot find a better pool!There's a lot of history here. This is nice to admire when you're strolling the grounds, however it makes things a bit cumbersome when you're spending the night.  The rooms are on the smaller side, and while this might be a 4 star hotel by European standards, things are bit shabby.  The heating/cooling was wonky on both of my stays.  The hot water in the bathroom sink only made it to lukewarm, which made shaving quite an adventure (which I suppose is not an issue if you have a beard or are a woman).  There are not many outlets in the room.   However, there is free, good Wifi. Maid service was so-so. The onsite restaurants and bar are good options, free parking is ample, and you are a short drive to downtown Dearborn (if such a place exists), Greenfield village, and Detroit. As far as Marriotts go, this is more in line with a Courtyard experience, and is an ok option if you're in Dearborn for a few days.Nicely done, well maintained, but a few low end items that make it disappointing for the price.  There was no hotel map, so I went to the front desk to ask where the fitness room was. At 8:40 AM, when one would think it is the busy time of checkout, there was one person at the front desk. The front desk person made a point of assisting an employee before a paying customer.  Nice. Then, since it was morning, I decided I wanted to have coffee by the fireplace. I looked around and did not see a coffee service so I want to the bar. They told me they had coffee for purchase. I asked at the front desk, and they said that they did not have a coffee service available. No coffee when paying over $200 a night?  That is common at Hampton, and even days in.  I guess Marriott doesn't feel the same way. It's the details Marriott. You should know know.Beware! Bedbugs! I have pictures and video still! I forget which building my room was in, but it had bedbugs and they had to switch my room in the middle of the night after claiming they didnt have bedbugs. Two associates from the hotel visited my room after I called the front desk to see for themselves. Luckily, I was there for a wedding and was so tired that I left my bags with the bellhop.The next morning, I expected a courtesy call from the front desk or even the hotel manager, but nothing! Then they tried to charge me full price for both nights and I put up a stink! They gave me a reduced rate on the one night, so I wrote corporate! I never heard back from them either. Needless to say, I do not stay at any Marriott properties anymore.Its a shame because it was a cute place with lots of history and a good restaurant. It was fascinating to read about the history of the hotel and see all the pictures they have hanging up. Henry Ford would have been mad, but he probably would have hooked me up too and at least extended a sincere apology!This was our first stay, and definitely not our last! Overall, the staff was pleasant.  It's a beautiful facility.  It's quiet, clean and comfortable.  We had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was delicious.  We upgraded to a cottage which had it's own appeal.  Our next stay will be in the hotel itself just from a convenience standpoint.  The only hassle with the cottage is getting ice.  The closest ice machine was in the hotel at the end of one of the wings.Beautiful renovation, elegant and comfortable. Beds were comfortable, grounds are lovely (even in December!) Complaints: no mini fridge in room, no hair dryer, breakfast buffet moderate at best.However the bar food was good, wonderful bartenderAnother meeting??? What, you call it a presentation? One of our tooling suppliers had a dog and pony show for all of the engineers at Ford.  There was a nice turn out. They do a great job here at the Dearborn Inn for meetings, water bottles, pitchers of water during the meeting and a nice continental breakfast. Lunch was outstanding as well as the steak dinner. The wait staff was outstanding. Did I mention all the food was great?If I'm throwing an offsite meeting or training or any type of presentation, I'm calling here first.I hosted a Christmas luncheon for a customer here and had a great time. They had a lunch buffet with excellent meats, salads, sides and dessert. I will be doing this again next year for sure.Staff was great and the amenities were amazing. Highly recommend!","I had my wedding this past weekend in Dearborn and since the reception was nearby, we had all our guests stay at the Dearborn Inn. I've had my out-of-town family stay here for years when they were in town, and I was not disappointed with this experience.Our guests were treated extremely well (most from out of country). We dropped off gift bags and the reception staff seemed happy to deliver them. Great attitudes!The lobby is always gorgeous and the grounds were cause for a conversation topic amongst our wedding guests. Beautiful flowers and gardens make for a really special place for guests to stay, especially if they have some time to kill while in-town people are busy. Free tickets to The Henry Ford Greenfield Village are amazing, since that's my favorite place in the entire world. :)Our honeymoon suite was wonderful, with chocolate dipped strawberries and lots of room. Although I was exhausted from a long day of smiling for cameras, I appreciated the nice touches before I crashed hard and slept like a rock.The rooms are a bit small, because the hotel is old, but I can't even fault them a star for that. They're tidy, super clean, and well maintained, and the service staff is super friendly and ready to do anything to make guests feel extra welcome.I'm not often a 5-star reviewer, but I can't recommend Dearborn Inn enough for people who are traveling to Dearborn or people who are planning to host a wedding in the area. Enjoy the ambience and never look back!Love this hotel and have been going here for years.  The front desk staff was outstanding and very accommodating, as well as the wait staff at Ten Eyke tavern.  I couldn't give 5 stars for the simple reason of the concierge lounge.  The evening food was almost inedible and the employee, Paulette, sat with us (actually took the best seat) and did crossword puzzles while we fended for ourselves.  She was in uniform with a nametag yet did nothing but sit there the entire time. I think the hotel can find a more suitable ""job"" for her......Unexpectedly very nice place.  The grounds were wonderful and the rooms very nice and overall very clean.  I was pleasantly surprised by the stay, the only downside is it was slightly challenging to find a place to eat as you are literally surrounded by Ford.I was here as part of a digital summit for bloggers held by Ford. The catering for lunch wasn't the best (however the cookies were amazing), but the grounds are beautiful and the wifi was great. I would definitely stay here next time I'm in the area.Dear Dearborn Inn,Thanks for the nice, albeit short, visit. I especially appreciate the incredibly comfortable bed, complete with a handful of squishy (read: goose down) pillows and the firm yet soft mattress. Detroit has a lot to offer and I'm glad to see a really lovely and charming hotel so close to Greenfield Village. Henry Ford would be stoked. Even though your lobby is awfully pretty, your rooms are a little bit stale. I was a bit disappointed for the lack of mini fridge or mini bar. My poor pizza leftovers from Buddy's had to be tossed for fear that I would wake up smelling of pizza. No one needs that. And I have to say, the shower sprayer in particular is incredibly awkward. Even though I'm vertically challenged, I had a hell of a time showering with limited water pressure and a crappy handheld sprayer. But I digress.Your room service was quick, your staff quite friendly and included toiletries were decent. I didn't get a chance to visit the workout room or garden, but I hear they are both pretty solid. Maybe next time we can spend a little more time together and WiFi can be gratis? Here's hoping. Yours truly,Snacks McGeeI've been to the Dearborn Inn a couple of times recently for various large events in the ballrooms. For dinner, I've had an amazing chicken dish at one event and lousy, cold, tasteless pasta at another. I stayed consistent in my drink order as well. One event  my drink had alot of booze. The other had less than a shot. What's with the inconsistencies?The room we had was small and our bed was even smaller. The description said we paid for a queen. The bed was either a double or full. After a long night of dancing, the last thing I wanted to be was pushed off the bed the whole night and in a fight for pillows.Beautiful hotel, great location, nice employees. But otherwise very inconsistent.I've stayed at The Dearborn Inn quite a few times. I've stayed in king rooms in the main building just for traveling, the large suites in the main building for family holiday parties, and the large suites in the annexed building for a friend's wedding.  I love the rooms in the main building, they have a lot of character, but find the rooms in the annexed building to be a bit more generic. The Dearborn Inn is very accommodating to large groups, has a gorgeous lobby, especially during the holidays, and even the ballrooms are wonderful (went to a prom here back in the day). I also love their brunch...and the robes!It's very close to Greenfield Village (though I'm not sure if we're calling it that these days?) and basically anything you'd want to do in Dearborn!Pretty inn that I've never been ashamed to recommend to friends when they come into town. Within walking distance of Greenfield Village, it was once an airport for Henry Ford.Rooms are nice and the restaurants are good. If you travel up Oakwood to Michigan Avenue, you will find an active nightlife!Sometimes you just gotta feel as though you're working off a bender with Zelda Fitzgerald. The environment, decor and energy of The Dearborn Inn will make you feel as though you have stepped through time to enter a world of underscored glamour -- but not glamour in its opulent, gilded sense. Glamour in the ""I spied that sickly-looking Colin peering down upon me from his bedroom window"" sense. I felt like I was the ne'er-do-well cousin sent to live with the well-behaved side of the family whilst my parents set out for a better life. In other words, all of my high school AP English conceits were met. History is the selling point. The entrance is stately, the lobby is impressively proper, the grounds will make you feel as though you're an incoming freshman at your boarding school/university of choice -- where jackets are required. This isn't a 'oh, you fancy' or 'g-l-a-m-o-r-ous, yes' type of place. It's a mansion. The typical guest (during my stay) were gray-haired and buffet-loving. But, I don't need a rock-star life all the time. Sometimes, I hanker for a quiet, well-groomed hotel with red brick, stately columns, white terraces, and manicured lawns. This isn't a hotel to stay in if you want the hustle and bustle of a city. Stay here for a peaceful quiet respite. Stroll the grounds. Wear pearls.Expect colonial furniture in the bedroom, high-thread count sheets, cherry wood, small walk-in closet. I stayed on the 4th (highest) floor and enjoyed a pleasantly spacious room that included two walls of windows with views of trees and grass, overstuffed chairs, sturdy (and impressive) desk, and a lounge. As I am given to flights of dramatic fainting, lounges are always welcome. I had a perfectly suitable bathroom (nice flooring, marble to add texture, enough room to move around)Charming. You will be charmed -- in the Jane Austen, not Alyssa Milano, sense.I've always wanted to visit Detroit and recently visited for the first time.Keeping it real, here, folks and telling you what you need to know.Positives:-charming historic Inn where the common areas really make you feel like you're stepping back in time to the 30s when Henry Ford would visit the dining room-one free (small) bottle of water in the room-luxe beds with high thread count linens (I slept well)-back garden has a lovely lounge area with umbrellas-decent fitness center-extremely courteous staff-lobby area has a display with the hotel's interesting history-bathrobes in roomNeutral:-Bath and Body works products= something between a ""meh"" and an ""AOK""Negatives:-no free wifi-the bathroom seemed downright institutional with bars and a shower chair which was weird. I'm pretty sure they gave me a handicapped room. Was the hotel that crowded that they needed to give me such a room? I also feel strongly that just because someone may be in a wheelchair doesn't mean that an institutional bathroom is the way to go. -the hairdryer is hidden behind ironing board in closet. I don't blame them for hiding the fact that the hairdryers seemed like they had been made in the 1980s and it took me about 15 minutes to dry my hair. It also smelled of burnt hair. UGH-house keeping didn't replace the bottle of water I had drank and the large bottle that costs $5 had already been opened by someone who had stayed there before me which is really gross. Tip: if you can, just get a cup of water from the fitness center where they have a water coolerThe following is a negative for me, but might be a positive for someone else: It's rather remote, so that if you don't have a car, you're reliant upon someone who does; ie no early morning coffee from a real coffee place (sucks for a coffee fanatic like me) and if you're hungry late at night after the lounge is closed and room service is over, you're SOL, as there is no mini bar in the room either.If you do have a car, awesome, because Dearborn is a cool suburb with good eateries nearby, not to mention what I like to call ""Ford World"" ie, the Henry Ford theme park, I mean, Henry Ford complex/park.Conclusion: It's really not worth the high price of a stay, considering the lack of room amenities.Strongly recommend. Lots of history. Great ambiance. Marriott level service which is premier.We were attending a Wedding at the hotel and we decided to spend the night rather than drink and then go home.  The hotel is steeped in history.  We were walking to one of the ballrooms and passed a room called the Edison room and sure enough, there was an old picture of Thomas Alva himself.  It looked to be about a century old.  Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone and other famous folks were all buddies and they all walked the same hallways that I walked when I visited the hotel.  Going to a museum is one thing, but living there is quite another.The food in the restaurants and what we were served at the catered affair, was all very good and the hotel service was great too.The room we had was comfortable and well-appointed.  The walls were a bit thin but with the air conditioning running, the noise level was not obvious.This is a place that I would recommend to others and I would be comfortable putting friends and business associates.Dearborn Inn is top notch when it comes to class. The lobby of the hotel is gorgeous and perfect for wedding photos. The courtyard is very spacious, the gazebo right in the middle of the courtyard makes for a perfect setting for an outdoor wedding. Aside from the main building, there are also several detached houses on the opposite side of the courtyard, each containing 4 beautiful suites. I stayed there the night before the wedding and my wedding night, and because of the honeymoon package, each day we got a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. The rooms in the suites are just as quaint as the rest of the hotel. I ordered room service breakfast for the day of my wedding, and it was delivered at 9:45am (at the time I requested) on the dot. The hotel bar is just as classy as the rest of the establishment. Drinks aren't the cheapest, but you really shouldn't be going there for drinks if you're expecting to get a 36oz beer for $3.50. I had relatives from out of country stay there and everyone raved about the hotel. I highly recommend it for any out of town guests, or if you just want to ""fall off the grid"" for an evening by yourself.Love this hotel except I wish the furnishings inside the rooms was less modern and more vintage... It used to be vintage and then they modernized it and it needs to be more of the period.Went here on a family vacation to see Ford Motor Co. Very convenient to all of Ford sites. We found the rooms adequate and comfortable. The restaurants were good and prices reasonable. Offered us transportation to the sites close by where we could connect to sites further away. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. One of our daughters' favorite stories is being stuck in the elevator at the Dearborn Inn and having to be rescued by maintenance.My favourite hotel in Detroit bar and restaurant are brilliant, the fresh breakfast omelettes are a must along with the fresh muffinsGreat location! Walking distance to the Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, but they also provide prompt and frequent drivers to same. Good value: room included vouchers to the museum and Ford attractions, and a safety depot box. Attractive, traditional decor. Clean, bright interiors and beautiful grounds. Rooms quiet, good beds - great night sleep. The staff is excellent, excepting the lounge where we sat unattended for a while then left. Room service was prompt and they got the order right. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food is mid-west nice. If we visit the Henry Ford again, we'll definitely stay here!I stayed at the Dearborn Inn in DEC 2012. While the hotel is nicely decorated and holds a lot of history, you may want to reconsider actually staying here.I reserved a 4 night stay, but upon check-in I was informed the actual price was twice the price I was quoted. When I questioned this I was told by the clerk that reservations are not handled by the hotel, they are handled through a call center and he was sorry for the error but there was nothing he could do. I took the room (#406) and went about my businessAfter arriving at my room I found it to be small; smaller than my bedroom at home. I was not the guest room advertised on their website (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcache.marriott.com%2Fpropertyimages%2Fd%2Fdtwdi%2Fphototour%2Fdtwdi_phototour30.jpg&amp;s=b7eccb78acd3ad497abb968b3678e074d31a173e956afe58af7bb81d4c2ad323"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">cache.marriott.com/prope...</a>). There was barely enough room to walk at the foot of the bed and forget getting around to the far side of the bed as the walkway was blocked by a sitting chair. The lavatory was comparably small and uncomfortable to use. I can't imagine trying to stay in this room with more than one personLater that night my nephew checked in and we asked for rooms close to each other and he was assigned room #404. His room was approximately 3 feet larger than my room (right next door). While this isn't a huge difference, it made it seem a lot larger due to the already small area. I said that, to say this; if you choose to stay at this hotel, inspect the room and if you find it unreasonably small, request to see another because chances are you'll find one a little bit larger. I assumed all guest rooms were the same, so didn't think to request another (besides they probably would have wanted to up-charge me).Another point of interest; the guest rooms do not have free wi-fi. If you want in-room wi-fi, you'll have to pay an additional $12.95 (+tax) per day.The day after check-in I met up w/ a couple friends who were staying at The Henry (another Marriott hotel 5 mins away) and couldn't believe they were paying the same rate as me. They had an indoor pool, hottub, sauna, workout room and free in-room wi-fi. I immediately went to the courtesy desk and asked the clerk to call The Dearborn Inn and see if she could relocate my reservation, which she did.If you find yourself looking for a hotel in the Dearborn area, I do not recommend you stay at the Dearborn Inn. Do yourself a favor and check out The Henry.This hotel is gorgeous. Very stunning to stay the least. I had an all-around experience with this establishment as I attended a company holiday party there and afterward stayed in one of the beautiful and charming rooms. The whole evening, start to finish, was incredible. The evening began with a cocktail hour in the lobby area of the hotel. Service was excellent. Note: even the lobby area was fancy-smanchy. The cocktail hour ended and the entire party was moved to a huge ballroom. There were roughly 500 attendees to the event so needless to say, the ballroom was uber-huge. The tables/chairs were well-placed and again the service was great. The food was to die for but I can't remember if it was catered in or from the hotel restaurant so I'll skip the details of my meal. After my meal, the party continued in the ballroom where they moved some tables and had a dance floor available. Top 40 music isn't really my thing and I wanted to go somewhere less business-like (as all of my co-workers were obviously in attendance) and ended up over at the bar at the other end of the building. Good move I must say. The bar was totally elegant and gritty at the same time. Weird I know but it was fancy in a gangster kind of way. The bar staff was super-duper chill and really made us feel welcome. Very low-key jazzy type vibe. Loved it!!! And the drinks were top-shelf, not over-priced, and strong. Fan-friggin-tastic!As for the adorable room, I couldn't get enough of it. It was very, very spacious and had the comfiest of beds. The linens were soft and inviting too. When I visited this hotel, I did live over an hour away so it was a nice treat. Now, I live right down the road and though staying at a hotel so close to home might be strange, I have been considering it just for a quick little night away from my 4 legged friends. Every momma (doggie momma's too!!!!) can need a break from time to time. This place was so superior to other hotels that I have stayed at that I might pop in just to have the experience all over again. Can I get a 6 stars please???  What? What?Our family has many fond memories of holiday gatherings and special occasions at the Dearborn Inn.  Last week we returned to eat in Edison's to celebrate our dad's 91st birthday, and we were not disappointed.  Matter of fact, we were all very impressed with the high quality of food and service!   It was a fantastic way to top off a day at the Henry Ford (or Greenfield Village).   SO glad they still are maintaining their long-standing tradition of beautiful surroundings, good hospitality, and quality dining!","The Early American room is pricey but has wonderful steaks, salad, dessert, and service.  I reccomend the salmon oscar or filet oscar.  The  newly renovated rooms are beautiful.  This hotel is definitely a classy place to have a drink and take in a little history.Dearborn Inn if you're reading this:Bring back the brunch so us and our many friends can rejoin the Insider's  Club!  We miss Sunday Champagne Brunch : (I felt pretty fancy staying here.  The only thing that surprised me, was they didn't have a shuttle to the wedding we were attending, and the complimentary shuttle ended at 9pm or something ludicrously early like that.  The *other* wedding that was also happening nearby had a shuttle, so it just seemed a little odd.  For the fancy level, I was expecting a little more by way of transportation across the street to the Ford Estate.  I guess I expected just a scoche too much.I live in Boston now but had my wedding in Dearborn a couple of weeks ago. We stayed at the Dearborn Inn and several of our relatives also stayed there. The rooms were great and the staff was beyond wonderful. I cannot say enough about the staff - they seriously went out of their way to make our stay great, including moving around rooms so we could be together (even though they were very full with other unrelated guests), handing out gift bags upon check-in, and adding extra nights when necessary (particulary for the ""bridal"" suite which was fantastic). My only criticism is that they don't seem to get Fox Sports Detroit in the hotel rooms so the men were slightly disappointed not to catch the Tigers games. However, I didn't care so much and I think they played in the bar. Oh - and speaking of the bar - the renovations were lovely and the bar is now a totally comfy and kinda hip place to hang out.I've stayed in this hotel some years ago, but it is just a very nice almost with a historycal atmosphere to it.I love the brunch served at the Early American Tavern, it is the best brunch in Michigan, nice staff, luxurious dishes, endless options! Not too pricey for what is offered!The Dearborn Inn is a beautiful hotel with lots of charm. I ended up getting this hotel for $55 a night through priceline! The staff seemed really nice even though I didn't have much interaction with them. I told them it was my birthday and they upgraded us to a corner room in the concierge level. The room was really nice, spacious and very clean. Huge king bed was soo comfortable. The flat screen tv was at a bit of an odd angle but it worked. Channel selection was ok. In the concierge level rooms, you get free snacks and drinks during certain times but unfortunately we were there on the weekend and I think it's only on weekdays. My only complaint is their internet is $12.95 a day but other than that, check-in/check-out was smooth and I have no complaints.We blocked off rooms for your wedding. Many guest were from out of town and stayed 2-3 nights. Most of the guest said there rooms were okay. I only hear from a few that had rooms that were too small or dirty. Our room on our wedding night was beyond horrible. We had gotten the suite for 2 nights, Heather was very helpful in setting this up. My husband and the groomsmen would be getting ready at the hotel on the wedding day so I asked for the room to be cleaned sometime after 3:00 p.m. ( our wedding started at 2 p.m.) I also set up for champagne and strawberries to be in the room around 12:30 am ( reception was in Dearborn and ended at midnight)  We arrived at the hotel and there were no strawberries or champagne in the room.  The room was very hot. I understand there is no A/C in the hotel this time of year so we opened the window. I thought I would take a shower but there were no fresh towels and no soap. No one had set foot into the room to clean it. So on my wedding night I had to walk down to the front desk and spend a 1/2 hour asking for champagne, strawberries and towels. I mentioned the room was dirty. They offered to send the cleaning staff up. The last people I wanted to spend my WEDDING NIGHT with would be the Marriot cleaning staff. I got to the room with the towels and shampoo to find black mold in the tub. Really! Champagne arrived randomly at 2:30 am ( way to late and only because I complained). At this point we decided to just pack up and leave. I will NEVER forget having to drag my wedding dress through the  lobby crying while my new husband loaded the luggage in the car.  I will Never forget spending part of my wedding night in the dirty room and I will NEVER forget having to argue with the desk clerk about checking out ON MY WEDDING NIGHT. I am embarrassed that we had 20+ of your rooms booked with out of town and local guests.  I am embarrassed that we chose to have them stay here and they had no other choice not knowing the area. I have heard similar stories from a few of our guests and I am continuing to apologize to them for our choice in hotels.  I was contacted about our issues by Heather ( who I had emailed) and was told cleaning staff did come to the room at 3 but there were people in the room. If our wedding started at 2:00 p.m. and lasted an hour with a reception following who was in our room? Who was given a key? And even if someone was in the room, why didn't staff come late, before 12:30 am? What about the champagne etc? Bottom line is there is NO EXCUSE for the condition of our room. There is NO EXCUSE for how we were treated and for the lack of service. Bottom line OUR WEDDING NIGHT WAS RUINED BECAUSE OF THE DEARBORN INN MARRIOT HOTEL.On a side note it rained on our wedding day. All of our photos were planned for outside. Scrambling for ideas we called the the Dearborn inn thinking they might let us take a few pics (total of 16 ppl) in the lobby. They would not let us. Even with having 20+ rooms booked for several nights ( adding up to about 7-10,000$) They would still not let us take photos for 1/2 hour.Stayed September 2007 with family.  We checked in late at night after a long drive from Chicago and the lady who worked at check in was not friendly and had issue with my friends and family authorization form. I have used this form at least 5 times and have never had a problem. If this woman were good at her job she would have checked us all in since it was about 8:30pm with 4 and 7 year old boys bouncing off the walls from being in the car for hours and just asked me to stop by the front desk after we got settled to discuss. That would have made for good customer service. Instead at 8:30pm at night with 2 active children (none of us had dinner yet) she questions me for a good 15 minutes where I have to call my family member from Chicago to answer questions for her. The manager was there too. I was so disappointed. The actual hotel room was okay. It is an old building so allergy sufferers beware. I will say the building and grounds were beautiful and the breakfast was good but, quite expensive. Overall, I was so disappointed by their lack of service I will never go to this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.Liked -- The groundsDisliked -- the serviceA great place to stay...historic, beautiful. clean.What a beautiful hotel. They have themed ""guest houses"" in the back of the property that you could stay in that are period homes but I didn't get to see what they looked like on the inside. They looked very cool from the outside, though.The inside of the hotel was very cool. The rooms were a nice size and very upscale. The staff, outstanding. The bar made you feel like you should be sipping a single malt scotch &amp; smoking a cigar. heh.Not sure about this place....most reviews I have read about the Dearborn Inn have said the staff was not very good. My experience has been the opposite- the staff I have encountered here have been wonderful- front desk, wait staff, concierge and housekeeping. The only staff issue I encountered was the morning concierge lady seems to like to talk loud and often, but she is attentive.The room was a good size with a tiny bathroom. No big deal to me, as I travel mostly alone, on biz. The room is basically Marriott stock- comfy bed, desk and large TV. Although the inn feel is still present with some dated furniture, heavy doors and great old pictures, this is still got a Marriott feel.The food has been borderline, at best. I had the Salmon Oscar last night with Bernaise sauce...the sauce overpowered everything on the plate. Chicken Quasidillas for lunch were good, but only 2 on the plate- a little skimpy. The Chicken Pot pie and baked potato I had for dinner tonight was downright awful. The pot pie was a runny soup with no substance and the baked potato was destroyed to the point of being inedible.The building itself is very nice, in a 1930's kind of way. The history is evident and the feel of days gone by is palatable. Marble floors, gorgeous lobby and period furniture enhance the experience. The grounds are nice, especially considering the terrible area the hotel is located. A nice hideaway.Overall, I would absolutely come back. Although I may venture elsewhere to dine. It certainly is a break from the standard Marriott experience.Historic old world class, it was built by Henry Ford.  There are the five guest cottages out back, and they let you walk the grounds.  My particular favorite is the Edgar Allen Poe house which is the honey moon suite.  If you feel like splurging you won't regret Sunday brunch in the Grill; it's a champaign brunch so plan on retiring early.   Golden Eagle Lounge is snazzy, in a  boy's club/smoking room kind of way with huge wing back chairs, couches big screen TV's, and a pool table.  Unfortunately you can not kick back with that cigar because the entire hotel is smoke free- come on it's historic !Great hotel, with a historical feel. Have stayed here two weeks on buisness and will spend four more here. Great staff, clean and comfy rooms, and great food.The Dearborn Inn is that rarest of properties - a chain hotel (Marriott) with real charm and character. Tucked behind a stand of mature trees (with vivid fall foliage) in the midst of the Ford industrial complex, the Inn has the air of a well preserved county mansion from the 30's. Inside, the old-style charm persists with nicely preserved and gently modernised rooms (with opening sash windows), a large and gracious lobby, and a snug, paneled bar. If you are fortunate, you'll stay in a room or suite in one of a set of charming reproductions of historic cottages that ring the lawns and gardens in the rear of the grounds. So drive a few more miles past the other corporate sleep-boxes in the area and take in some of the elegance of years past",,,"['ended', 'business', 'trip', 'glad', 'wonderful', 'staff', 'great',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-detroit-at-the-david-whitney-detroit,Aloft Detroit at the David Whitney,4.0,$$,29,"The location is superb, especially if you're going to a show or a Lions/Tigers game. Lots of restaurants in walking distance, plus the gorgeous Christmas lights up and down Woodward during the holidays. The front desk staff was friendly, happy, helpful (even when we checked in at 11:45 pm!). The room itself was small... Felt almost European. But nicely appointed and clean. The rooms feel much more modern than the lobby would suggest. Big windows overlooking Woodward helped with the slightly small feeling. The 24-hour reFuel convenience store in the lobby was helpful. Free coffee and tea at any time comes in handy when one of you (out of a group of four) gets up four hours before everyone else. I would stay here again with friends, but I definitely would opt for The Book if you're looking for a romantic destination.The David Whitney building itself is incredible. The lobby is stunning and makes a wonderful impression right after a courteous valet took my vehicle. The hostess was kind, though not entirely professional. Our room was modern and sleek, as you would hope and expect in a downtown hotel in the price range. However, there was a rather unappealing stain in the carpet that needed to have been replaced. The carpet is laid in an arrangement where that would have been simple, but they don't seem concerned--I was a little skeeved out. When my wife called the front desk from our room, she was placed on hold and after over 10 minutes of waiting we called back and spoke with someone immediately. We asked for a hypoallergenic pillow and received two additional down pillows. When I explained that down (feathers) were the offending allergen, I was told the hotel doesn't have any cotton pillows whatsoever. Lastly, small gripe, but the bathroom door was really difficult for both my wife and I to open. The rollers may have been off or something to that affect, but annoying nonetheless. Overall, nice hotel with a good view of the city, but average vs. above average is in the details for me and they failed in a few categories.I stayed at the Aloft once when it first opened. The building is beautiful and the first stay was alright, there was some water pressure issue that made an alarm go off for quite some time so that was annoying. I booked the night for new year's eve and got a suite. I guess I assumed the suite would be really nice based on the price but I guess they just jack up the rate on their rooms like 350% and give you subpar service. My friend and I had both had kind of a crazy year so I thought we'd go party at the Fillmore and I'd surprise her with a really nice suite at Aloft. I paid the same price as what a corner suite at the MGM would cost. Have you seen those rooms? They are amazing. This room....it was pathetic. Yeah, I said it. The living area was an uncomfortable couch with some scratchy ass wool pillows and two neon orange uncomfortable retro chairs. The bathroom was tiny, just as tiny as the regular rooms. There wasn't any hot water either. The sleeping area was just a larger version of the regular room. There were barely any towels and only one bottle of water. I'm a gold elite member at both SPG and Marriot (which recently acquired SPG) and I'm a Delta rewards member. I'm not trying to be snooty but seriously, I stay at your hotels a lot. At least pretend like you give a shit. Overall, the most bogus 'suite' I have ever stayed in. The only good things about the stay were the friendly front desk staff and the prompt valet. I would never stay here again.My friends and I spent the night at the Aloft Downtown Detroit for our annual Christmas party. The hotel is in the Historic David Whitney building. Let me tell you,  it is a beautiful piece of architecture.  We valeted our vehicles which is $30 per night. I think that is about the norm for downtown hotels. A bellman, Christopher, helped us bring our bags up on a luggage cart. He was very friendly and hospitable. Later there was some confusion about our tipping as he was overheard stating he was only given $1 tip.. hmmm. We tipped him $8, and guests in our party in an adjacent room said they tipped him a $10 bill so...?? I thought it was kind of gauche that we would've been in a position to over hear that.  Back to the rooms. Nice. Contemporary.  We had a great view of Comerica Park and Ford Field. The rooms have thick walls too and we had been concerned about making too much noise and disturbing others  (there were 10 ladies in 4 rooms, but we all congregated in one suite)The employees were friendly and knowledgeable.  I would definitely go back.We were surprised how great this hotel was!  Pros:  - Location!  Located in the dead center of Downtown Detroit and very close to Ford Field!  - Rooms are very large and very nice! They seem recently renovated. Decor is on the modern side. - Staff:  Very helpful. - The building is historic and is just beautiful.  White and gold interior.  Beautiful. Cons: - Lots of traffic during game day.  Our recommendation is not take your car anywhere on game day.  It took us 20 minutes to go around the loop just to get on the right street. Overall:  Great hotel.  It is on the expensive side but you wont be disappointed.LOVED THIS PLACE. It was beautiful!!! Very modern, very clean, a hip, trendy place to be. We will stay here again as our primary place to stay when in Detroit.Two stars for rooms that weren't fully operational. Five stars for the hotel's response to the issues and for the overall concept of the hotel.  Absolutely breath-taking building and artistic decor, but it wasn't enough to cover up the functionality flaws we experienced.We choose this place for a Valentine's day overnight. We drove in on what will probably go down in the history books as the day h*ll froze over; It was very cold outside. But the valet was friendly and the front desk individual greeted us warmly. Taken by the marble and glass of the atrium, I looked forward to seeing what was in store design-wise for our initial room, 403. I was not disappointed! We had a large seating area and bedroom designed with a minimalistic eye. The bathroom was tiny, given the size of the other two rooms, but was adequate for our overnight stay. The first of several incidents with the hotel happened when we went to take a shower. There was very little hot water and our showers were on the luke-warm side. Figuring it was maybe our preference for scolding hot water, we brushed it off. It's when the door wouldn't lock that we made our first call to the front desk. The deadbolt didn't line up to the door jam. Generally, your hotel door should lock.Quickly, we were transferred to a room on the 7th floor. Good news- the door lock worked in this room. Our 7th-floor room was smaller but had superior, sweeping views of the city with an especially good view of Comerica Park. The decor was just as nice and unique as our first room. We noticed that the room was chilly but since we were leaving for dinner, we didn't think much of it. Hindsight being what it is, we should've thought about it more. Because generally, you want your hotel to have heat. It's when we woke up to ice covered windows and a thermostat at 58 that the hot shower was nice. And yes, this room had actual hot water. If you're keeping track, Room 1: little hot water, broken door, has heat. Room 2: hot water, door works, no heat. We complained about the lack of heat to the front desk and they graciously comped our room. Another guest was arguing with the front desk in her coat and hat, saying she has to wear full outdoor gear in her room. So it wasn't just our room that was dealing with this. I've heard great things about the Aloft Hotel brand so I'm still willing to go to another hotel in this brand. Will I come back to his hotel - Maybe in the summer when we don't need heat.Impeccable service, comfy beds, beautiful building in an up and coming area. New restaurants and stores on Woodward, people mover adjacent to hotel, attached bar (didn't open until 4pm on the Saturday of our stay) and everything one needs to be comfortable, feel safe and have fun. I couldn't figure out the heating/act so I just turned it off so the unit didn't run continuously and the area and hotel became very loud at 2am when the bars closed. It was short lived. Wonderful stay, I will be back!My review is for the WXYZ Bar inside the David Whitney on the first floor.This is a great new bar/lounge with quality people.  The music on the nights I have been there is chill dance electro and everyone is dressed to the tee.  They have couches bordering the inside, which are open to any of the patrons as long as there isn't a reserved party.  It is a small place, so if it is too stuffy for you, you can take your drink in the lobby of the David Whitney.  They have a seasonal drink list, but be prepared to pay the prices. I can't speak on behalf of happy hour prices, but drinks will run you around $8-$10 on a Saturday night.If you're looking for an interesting night of mixing and mingling I would hands down direct you to the WXYZ.There are a few specific individuals that you rarely wouldn't recognize but are part of a ""big picture"" mind like view atypical to certain people but needs recognized and is the reason for this rare review. Edgar, employed by Starwood aka Aloft Hotel front desk was so kind, genuine and focused on his job, but went over and beyond not interfering with policy or job guideline.  He is our future and I want to publicly say I would hire him in a minute.  He has the values, integrity and authenticity we need in Corporate America now, the future without all the Applicant Tracking, Psychology, Behavioral Testing ""so called"" to retain employee turnover and recruit the best candidate.  I hope he gets the recognition well deserved as a Gold Member with Starwoods and Marriott.....I'm loyal to people, my family, friends Employer and most of all my Country.Cool modern and chic hotel with just enough amenities to keep me happy. Good quality bathroom soaps, shampoos and nice towels. The beds are comfy and clean. The rooms are cozy with a nice view of Comerica Park. Would come back when I come to Detroit. Staff was very helpful and took care of all needs, fast.I am so glad Aloft came to Detroit.  It's a great hotel chain, the likes of what you would see in Chicago or some other swanky downtown neighborhood.  The building, David Whitney, has been restored beautifully.  Honestly, it caught my breath when I walked in.  Pulling up we were greeted by the valet.  We walked in with the bell hop (who chatted with us about how things had been going at the hotel since its opening a few weeks ago).  He was very nice and even though we had one small bag for our overnight stay he helped with it and made pleasant conversation.  Upon check-in I signed up for the Starwood rewards program.  When asked the reason for our stay I said it was our anniversary and we were upgraded to a suite. Wow...was the room gorgeous!  Very modern, fun colors in the living room.    Walk in shower for 2, great decor, king bed, and great city view.  Got some very cool pics of the people mover right outside our window.The hotel goes up to the 9th floor, and beyond that is residential apartments.  What a fabulous place to live!!  One small con was the fact that the windows aren't soundproofed very well and we could hear the train rolling by.  Luckily we had a late night and it wasn't too long after returning to our room that the people mover stops (it runs until 2:00 am).  So, it wasn't terrible, however if you're a light sleeper or have to be up early in the morning it might cause a problem.  Check out is noon and they gave us late check out so we had the room until 2:00 pm.  That was nice because I just wanted to sit and soak up the atmosphere of the lobby.  They have complimentary coffee and tea as well as other snacks, beverages, etc available for purchase in the 24/7 store in the lobby.  We grabbed a newspaper, some tea and coffee and relaxed before we checked out.Take a look around the city - new stores and restaurants are opening on a regular basis.  This hotel is an obvious choice for Detroit and a very welcome addition.Absolutely a great place to stay in Detroit. The place is new yet old. Meaning, the building is a historic building built about 100 years ago. The architecture is just remarkable particularly the grand lobby. Now it's somewhat new because the building has been converted to a hip hotel after being abandoned for years. Their standard king sized room is beyond standard. Plenty of space to run around. The bathroom is modern and efficient. The ceiling is probably 12 ft high. Free wifi too for spg members.They have a pantry place in the lobby that is stocked with essentials. From frozen packages, Cheerios, cookies, snacks, iced cream and emergency ""stuff"", this place is just so convenient. Their valet is very attentive too. I was trying to check out in the lobby and they quickly helped me with my luggage and placed it in my car without even me asking them to do so. The xyz is bar is stocked and there's a DJ spinning on weekends.Overall, it's truly a great place to stay. It's now my mainstay hotel each time I'm in Detroit.This hotel is outstanding.  From the moment you arrive, Valet is attentive, courteous and friendly.  As we migrated through the gorgeous lobby (it's worth walking in - even if you're not staying there) and the wonderful Concierge helped us.  I believe her name was Shannon.  She provided not only hotel information, but some general information about the city and the area.  She was pleasant and cheerful and made us eager to stay at this hotel.The rooms are nice - albeit not my ideal layout.  There is a large living room area, smaller bathroom and large bedroom.  I guess the living room is useful for longer stays - but with a 1-2 night visit I would have preferred more bathroom space.  The furniture is modern.  A bit art deco in that 1950s way.  Our view faced East - and we woke with the bright sun. My companion hated this - I LOVED it.My biggest shout out goes to the XYZ bartender Shannon.  She is hands down the bees knees.  This chick can make ANY cocktail and she does it RIGHT.  Delicious martinis, perfect margarita, Moscow Mules - you name it!  She is friendly, attentive and DAMN good at her job.  As a former bartender I have insanely high standards for a cocktail and Shannon gets it right every time.I frequent the Book usually when I stay downtown - but quickly added Aloft to my list.  It's a better venue. location, service and price - you can't lose!I have stayed at the Book Cadillac so have something to compare Aloft to.  They are very similar in feeling, stately old buildings gloriously restored and repurposed as hotels.  The David Whitney is worth a look even if you aren't staying here.  The lobby especially the ceiling is beautiful.  A cheery valet took my car at the door. One can access one's car as many times as needed without additional charge, I did not need it though.  The check in was professional and easy. The room is very large and nicely appointed with Bliss soaps. The towels and linens are typical of SPG and very nice. The bed is great, the bathroom clean. The bar was pleasant for a martini.  Good location.  Overall an excellent choice.  The reason I gave 3 stars, is because competition is stiff and it wasn't a bargain and there was one glaring fault.  The A/C unit is so loud it is unusable.  Now it was late August, but not sweltering night and I was alone, had I been a couple on a hot night without A/C it would have been a disaster.  When I asked about it at  during check out, The front desk attendant lamented that they Knew about it, and that the building was old and the unit was really loud.  Further, that if I had complained in the middle of the night I could have switched rooms..... huh?  I said, that sounds really inconvenient, why would you use that room in summer at all if any other was available to avoid that scenario.  To which she had no answer.  Well that sure didn't  make a strong positive impression. The hotel was definitely not fully booked.  I don't understand that at all.   That was the only fault and I wasn't looking for one. just felt it necessary to point out.  Rest of stay was fine.Nice place to stay slightly at the edge of downtown. Like most of Detroit, the outside is dodgy, but the inside was nice and the ambience is different than a regular big box hotel. Room was comfy.We had a great stay here... The building is absolutely beautiful. The room was very comfortable and well appointed, and the staff particularly friendly and helpful....and that atrium!It seems like the #1 topic talked about in Detroit is... Detroit. It's a resurgent city. People who want to make art ... music... food... can afford to feed their creativity with the money they aren't spending on rent. On one hand it's shocking/depressing seeing near-empty downtown streets on a weekday, but on the other hand there's an energy there... something is happening in Detroit... and as an outsider you can kind of feel it, or at least look out on it, in this hotel.This is a beautiful hotel! The people are friendly, but the bar patrons can be too friendly (loud) at night. Your door leads to the lobby which houses the bar. The room is outright gorgeous! Modern and cool, with plenty of room. We had a single suite. There was a pull out couch, lots of seating, and two TVs. The bed was comfortable. It was centrally located and a five minute walk to Comerica Park. On a separate note, we drive a highly modified van for a wheelchair user and the parking for that was a huge struggle throughout. We were told multiple times it would be no problem and when we arrived were told there was nowhere to park it. At 11pm. After about an hour we got a plan settled only to be told the next day it wouldn't work again. Again, more discussion and problem eventually solved (although we were told this time we might get a ticket.) Ultimately it worked out but not without a lot of struggle. Several of the valet staff tried very hard to help us. A four star rating for the hotel had we not had such issues.My wife and I live in Detroit and we wanted to get away for a night to celebrate our anniversary. This hotel is amazing. The David Whitney building is absolutely gorgeous. Built in 1915 and newly restored in 2014, it is a space like none other in the city. You will spend time hanging out in the lobby because of how breathtaking it is.The room was very spacious with high ceilings and fantastic views of the city. The in room decor is vintage/modern and very cool. The staff are extremely accommodating and friendly, and made our stay extra special.The bar in the lobby pours delicious ""and large"" cocktails, and has a great selection of local spirits. Aloft is walkable to many great restaurants, bars, Comerica Park and The State &amp; Fox Theaters.I am so excited that a place like this exists in Detroit, and we will be back!Pros:-Friendly and attentive staff.-I was impressed that the beauty of the original building was still very much intact.-Spacious room (Upgraded as a Platinum perk)-Close to local attractions.-Great price, especially in comparison to the nearby Westin.-Very hip/millennial friendly.Cons: -Room was right next to the People Mover tracks, which runs until midnight on weeknights. It was really loud.-It would be nice if they had a light room service menu. I know it's not custom for all Alofts to offer room service (they do have a reFuel section to buy snacks and serve food in their bar). I think for this particular area, someone traveling alone may not feel as comfortable walking to grab dinner at night. Making the XYZ bar menu available for room service would be a simple fix.","Roxanne was the best at the front desk!!! She was amazing friendly and cool. I highly recommend staying here and talking to her!!!Absolutely beautiful place. The service was awesome. Valet was quick and very helpful. WXYZ bartenders Shannon and Jaimi were outstanding. Best service I have had in Detroit. DJ Tom T had the crowd engaged in a great time. Best hotel bar I have even been to. Will definitely be back.My wife and I stayed there and chose to go there due to the proximity to Comerica.  Excellent choice!  I called about 20 minutes prior to our arrival and asked if they had a room available (early arrival).  They said they did.  We used the valet parking and was parked, checked in and brought our stuff to the room in about 10 minutes.  Comerica (and Ford field) are only about a 5 minute walk, perfect for game day!  As far as the room, it's rather spacious, clean and very nice.  I would highly recommend!My husband stayed here in May and enjoyed his stay. The hotel is very nice and comfortable. However, we had a billing issue due to an error by the hotel staff and it took us almost two months to resolve and get our money back.Wonderful staff!  Couldn't recommend them enough.  If you are in Detroit this is a great place to stay!Went to wxyz for a drink while I had some time to kill before an engagement.  Long story short, I blew off the engagement to hang at the bar. It was a blast.  The bartender, Jaimi, is the best.  The drink selection was solid, the atmosphere was great, and the pool table existed.Go.Although the hotel seems well renovated and I am so pleased that the building has maintained its spectacular lobby, I regret to say I experienced several problems when booking four, special guests for two nights each at this hotel. Even though all reservations were clearly made via email, names were entered incorrectly into the system, and upon arrival the guests learned the dates of their stays had been incorrectly entered as well. Those fixes were made at the front desk by patient concierges. Additionally, I paid for all charges via credit card the day after the guests left, only to find out two weeks ago that one of my guests was charged via credit card for her stay as well (her card # was taken for incidentals only). After repeated phone calls and emails, I cannot get anyone to speak with me to rectify this error, which should be easy to correct. At this time I cannot recommend this hotel to friends or colleagues without explaining the series of errors.Stopped in for a drink and to check out the renovations. This bar is small, overpriced and I found the bartender/waitress to be condescending. (I was a bartender for 11 years and always treat servers with respect) One and done. No reason to go back.Beautiful and bustling.  Greeted first by a top hat wearing gentleman , then quickly by the helpful valets.  Loved the use of this historic building. Rooms were hip and clean. Space are designed well, ample room but not alot of wasted space. A helpful check in and out by Eva-thanks!",,,,"['location', 'superb', 'especially', 'going', 'show', 'lions', 'tigers', 'game', 'lots', 'restaurants', 'walking', 'distance', 'plus', 'gorgeous',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-hotel-dearborn-detroit-2,DoubleTree Hotel - Dearborn,3.0,$$,37,"We really enjoyed our weekend stay at the Double Tree Hilton.  I used my points from the HHoners program to book a free weekend stay.  Tip- it is well worth joining the hotel rewards program with their branded credit card that gives you free points to use for hotel stays.  I found the hotel to be very clean, all of the employees were friendly and helpful.  The beds were comfortable and the feather pillows a delight.  The onsite restaurant though pricey, made up for it in value because all the food was very good.  Fresh fruit in the morning at the buffet included several melons, blackberries and blueberries and fresh pineapple and all the fruit was ripe and tasty. The bacon was lean, crispy and some of the best I have had.  Its the little extras that make this hotel so nice.  A warm chocolate chip cookie on check in and daily free newspaper and starbucks coffee in the lobby in the am. A very nice pool and exercise room with extended hours ( pool and hot tub open until midnight!)Avoid the pool on weekends though, unsupervised children left by parents otherwise occupied in their rooms made the pool noisy and unsafe for the children who were running about unsupervised by any adult.I came to Detroit for a dental school interview this weekend and stayed here with my mom. I don't normally write Yelp reviews but we had SUCH a wonderful experience that I decided to write one. First of all, the hotel shuttle service is ON POINT. We got rides to/from the airport, the university where I had my interview, and the DIA museum in downtown (they'll take you anywhere within 19mi radius). Joe, our driver, was very helpful and accommodating. Grille39, the restaurant inside the hotel, was also really nice. My mom and I appreciate good food, and we appreciated this place. If you like meat, you MUST try their steak - I had their filet mignon and it was awesome.  My mom enjoyed her seafood tacos. The customer service was all around very satisfactory. Josh, who was our front desk assistant, was incredibly helpful and personable. We really appreciated his excellent service. Last but not least, THEIR BED AND PILLOWS ARE SO COMFORTABLE! My mom and I both slept like babies both nights. I wish I could've kept the pillows!  I would definitely recommend this place to loved ones, and stay here again if the opportunity arises.I waffled b/w an A-ok and Yay but went for YAY for one reason alone-Brianna. I pulled a bone-head move after a co-worker in another city had his work laptop stolen from his hotel room. I put my work laptop under the mattress-didn't fit in safe. Yeah. You know what happened next. I was an hour from home when I had that ""KEVIN!"" moment from ""Home Alone"". I had a horrible time finding a person who wouldn't put me on hold for 10 minutes and actually help me find my laptop. I finally found Brianna who handled the problem like an absolute pro. No kidding. My laptop was FedEx'd to me for my presentation in PHL by 7a Tuesday. Life saver. We were there for a hockey tourney. Plus is that there are lots of doors to make access to rooms convenient when carrying in bags etc. My room was clean, spacious and had obviously been updated recently. Cons is that there is obviously an issue with the staff and how to answer the phone. However, Randy the manager assured me that he was nipping that in the bud immediately. Ultimately very grateful for Brianna and her dedication to helping out a desperate customer on a Sunday afternoon.When hearing the word Doubletree, most people would share the same initial reaction and impression that I had when I hear the word: It must be pretty good!Well, there are always exception to the rules. This is probably one of them.Juggling around 3 different Doubletree due to business travel in Detroit so far, this is probably the oldest of the three.  Don't get me wrong, I felt great hospitality upon entering, but the building itself definitely needs some fine-tuning. I definitely come to appreciate the big common area in the lobby, where I can enjoy reading my ipad, or get some work done while being away from the temptation that wreak from my bed in my hotel room. However, putting the elevator that far back to access doesn't seem..convenient for me, personally. Of course, I realize there will be factors that dictate where the elevators will be located in the building...but again, just how I feel.I resided on the 6th floor. I pressed the elevator button to go down every morning to go to work. The button does not seem to be functional. I waited 2-3 minutes before suspecting the malfunction of the button. I quickly thought to myself: Well, guess I am going to have to walk down 5 flights of stairs every morning to go to the car to go to work! Thank god there is another button located at the opposite wall, yay for being lazy!Another big thing that I would prefer to not exist is the fact that I have to use my hotel room key to go in and out of the parking lot. Yes, I understand that this is a rather big security issue, but the inconvenience of doing so really does add up to my annoyance. I am no expert on hotel infrastructure or arrangements. Heck no. But this is just my two cents on the hotel as a whole from a consumer perspective, and believe me when I say the majority of the prospective residents in this hotel will most likely feel the same way I did.This lady is Awesome... I will give Hilton credit for having such an outstanding staff member who takes customer care to that awesome level Thank you Lesley.Also regarding the room loved the mattress, linens and pillows. Excellent place for our family reunion. The food they served at our reunion was top notch.Hotel is always clean and comfortable. Equally outstanding is the staff. Always willing to help eager to please and always with a smile. I have spent a lot of time here on business. Folks are pretty much like family.They even put up a tent outside for smokers. Whether you do or don't what other hotel shows that level of commitment consideration?  First class in experienceHere for a conference.  Though the staff couldn't have been nicer, it didn't make up for the the unclean condition in which I found the room. I wouldn't have picked this hotel if the others hadn't been sold out. The location is just OK, I would have preferred being closer to downtown. The  restaurant is good and based on the convenient location, I would recommend it over room service.  (same restaurant, but it's worth a short trip to the lobby) It was quiet which is important especially on business trip.UPDATE: I was very disappointed in the state of my room when I first checked in, but between the general manager, the front desk, house keeping and the conference staff, the issues were resolved.  So though the first impression was less than favorable, I was impressed by the response.  The location can't be helped, ( in terms of the proximity to downtown) I have to compliment the customer service.  Because of the commitment to address the issue (and in a very pleasant manner- I was not treated like a nuisance, instead  my complaints were greeted with concern and apologies) I upgraded the score.Not a fan of this hotel.  Firstly I stayed there for around 2 weeks.  The walk alone to the rooms is exhausting.  I felt like I was in a casino expect I wasn't walking past slot machines, open bars or food.  Restaurant and bar closed crazy early even though the entertainment space is about the same size as a normal hotel.  I guess it an event space.  Everyday leaving the hotel I would have to walk through a huge crowd of anything from religious seminar check in or model calls.  Even a high school reunion full of old folks in lobby.  Super weird.  Oh and if you think the walk sucks well get used to it because you key won't work about every other day.  Oh but the rooms once you get to them were nice and clean. But the worst part they lost a package of mind and then argued with me and never paid for it even though the tracking has logged that the person with the matching name signed for it at front desk.  They did not handle that well and I felt disrespected.  The restaurants near by close early but the strip club in walking distant could be fun... Pretty skanky one...   Over all.  Stay somewhere else.Check in was quick and easy. The front desk girl greeted us with a smile :) We all received a fresh baked cookie upon check in! Had a horrible time trying to find the elevator! I must not have been paying attention, because I'm sure she pointed me in the direction...lol. The hotel looked like it just went through a major renovation. Everything looked new. The room was nice and clean with nice decor. Didn't get a chance to use the pool. It was very small though and there was probably about 30 kids in it when I walked by...sooo that wasn't happening anyways..lol. They do have adult swim after 10pm and early in the morning. Our family was having a party in one of the banquet rooms. The food was good and the serving staff friendly. The bartender was not very talkative and didn't really smile....strange for being a bartender. All in all it was a nice party. We had breakfast in the restaurant the next morning. They had a pretty good selection at the buffet. Didn't care for the eggs though.This is a nice affordable hotel that's 11.5 miles from COBO center. It's a good choice if you're going to the convention center and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for hotel. Drawback is that you'll have to arrange transportation. The hotel has a huge lobby and makes a great first impression. Go into the rooms and you'll find a TV, round table, single couch, and spacious bathroom. There are outlets on the desk lap which is convenient. I noticed I was missing cups in the restroom, however you can use the ones in the room by the ice bucket. There is no fridge or microwave at the time of this review but while I was here they received a large order of refrigerators for the rooms.  The rooms are decent, however the Double Tree hotels in CA have more amenities. I deducted stars for the service at the hotel &amp; restaurant (attached). Online I requested a room with 1 king bed but received a double instead. I asked to have this changed but had to wait 2 hours for the clerk to find a room. This was clearly a mistake on the hotel's end so having to wait so long for a solution was ridiculous. I went to the Chili's next door to pass the time. There is also a Red Robin down the street but not as nice of a walk. I was here for a business trip so I'm typically not as picky in these situations. This Double Tree is enough to get by for reason of my stay. It's not a hotel when taking a vacation, but hey... Who's vacationing in Detroit lately anyways?The restaurant at the hotel, Grille 39 is a nice little spot. Spacious and good for large parties. I went here each of the 5 days I was at the Double Tree. The food is good (slightly pricy), and the service is slow. I'd hate to also deduct stars for their service at Grille 39 because the bartenders/waitresses (Pam and Bobbie) were really nice. But hey.. It is what it is. Hire more staff! I can see how they have a hard time being a bartender and waitress for the dining area, especially when it gets really busy on days with conventions in town.Clean...and love their warm cookies:):) Got the free breakfast package which was a big mistake, it was terrible, especially if you don't eat pork there wasn't a lot of other options. I did not like the hike it was from the front entrance to the elevator.what a change...I was here in 2012 and I loved it.Couple years later, it appears poorly cared for.The swimming area was disgusting (partly due to the decline of western civilization and the fact people carry themselves like ANIMALS..); dirty towels all over the chairs, floor.  No clean towels available (went to swim an hour before closing).  Hire a security guard (i never saw one), too much ghetto riff raff wandering the halls, taunting women, etc.. Counter staff were very friendly but this place is on the verge of being run down/dirty.  Actual room is pretty nice, city, etc is pretty close.  Hopefully they make some changes, I'd like to return again, maybe in 2 years it will be really great again.... maybe.They're doing a renovation currently so it's all very messy. checking in was a bit of a wait but they def redeemed themselves throughout the week I stayed here. Great customer service from the ladies up front. I'm sure the place is going to look great!I've been here for 4 weeks now and have 4 more to go so I've had more than enough opportunity to evaluate the hotel and staff. They have been wonderful during my stay!  The staff is friendly and very polite. The restaurant has great food.  They have fantastic cookies you can get at the front desk whenever you want!  Plenty of parking and it requires a room key to get into the lot.My flight arrived early, so I headed to the DoubleTree to see if I could check-in early. When I first pulled up to this huge hotel, I was a bit skeptical because it's not a big shiny new hotel.  I didn't expect much more out of Dearborn, so I ignored my hesitation and went inside to be greeted by welcoming staff and a nice waterfall in the lobby area.  The girls at the front desk were extremely polite and accomodating.  They gave me an access code for free wireless internet because I'm a Silver HHonors member :) I also received breakfast coupons! They even came out from behind the desk to personally hand me my room keys and make sure I knew my way around the property. Sweet!They told me to park around the back of the building and enter through door 4.  The doors are numbered and accessible by key only.  I headed to the elevators, which also require you to swipe your key to go to a higher floor.  Though my room isn't the largest, it's more than cozy.  They brought a refrigerator and microwave up for $20 for the week, which I didn't mind because the rates are very good for a DoubleTree.  The bed is SUPER comfy and the furniture is very new.  Though the building isn't the newest, the hospitality and amenities at this hotel make up for it.  Everyone at this hotel is extremely polite and the property is very well maintained.  Great hotel for the price, and they ensure your safety while you're staying in Detroit/Dearborn.  Kudos!My a accommodation were awesome breakfast fantastic.  Wait staff phenomenal.  Remembers me and makes me filling family away from home  Made to order omelette would be icing on the cake.    Housekeeping awesome fulfills my room request and always makes me smile with a great clean room Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the bar!!   Bar staff very unfriendly nothing like other staff.   Not attentive and charge me for a drink I did not even like !!    Left full drink walk away disgusted.Not impressed.  We've stayed here before, and it was nice.  It seems a bit rough around the edges now.  The clerk at the front desk seemed extremely put out by my check in through Hotwire....she could not find the reservation, and asked me repeatedly if I was sure  it was that Doubletree!  Finally she found it.  I don't know where, nor do I care.  We were tired and just needed some sleep.  However her attitude was less than welcoming.  She knew there were 2 of us, yet she scoffed at handing us 2 cookies.....hey the cookies were the only perk of the stay!  When we got to the room the bathroom floor, toilet, and tub had long dark hair sticking to each surface....Gross!  Thats why I carry Clorox Spray Bleach with me when I travel!  You laugh, but it's out of necessity!  My boyfriend left the room at approximately 6:30 a.m. to go to work, and at approx. 8 a.m. the door opens and the woman walks in and says  'Housekeeping'.....Seriously?  There was no knock, no prior announcement of housekeeping....she just walked in!  Scared the daylights out of me....I left soon after even though all I wanted to do was rest. I would most definitely NOT recommend staying here.  Save your money, and go someplace cleaner, with better service, and without the staff barging in your room at 8 am unannounced! Plus this place has the nerve to charge for parking!  They're NOT DOWNTOWN so that situation is a bit overkill!The staff was super friendly, they gave us our delicious cookie! The lobby was really cool with a neat bridge and waterfalls....it seems a bit outdated and old....there was some super lame chess tournament going on, so all of the boardrooms were messy and filled with random people, gross garbage and take out food containers left thrown around on the floor, a bit dirty and not as clean as it could be. The room itself is nice and clean, a great size, the bed super comfortable. The gym was nice and big, the pool area definitely a let down, the pool is tiny, but there are two hot tubs! There were dirty towels left strewn about all over the place, and there weren't any clean towels left, so that's a bit disappointing. The pool is open until 12 am though, so that's always a nice perk! Free wifi and free parking too. There were a lot of annoying kids/teenagers/young adults running around, roaming the hallways, they would harass you if you were walking around - I was trying to find a vending machine and had to encounter two separate groups of people in my travels....most of the time people just want to be left alone at 3 am....When I return to Detroit, I would stay somewhere else just to try something different.After a terrible experience with the people at customer service and on the one 800 number line, Josh, the evening supervisor went out of his way to make sure that we were comfortable. We didn't get a discount or anything but he was pretty much at our beck and call if we needed anything and it was very appreciated after the hour and a half of hell I had gone through with the people in customer service. If you ever have a problem ask for Josh! Great guy and great employee!This place used to be something else, some other hotel chain.  Even though the staff vehemently denied this the 47 times I brought it up during my recent stay, they are wrong.  Embassy Suites?  I suspect so...The rooms are adequate.  Not palatial, not closet-like.  Adequate.  Bed, TV, Bathroom, Closet, Iron, Ironing Board, Coffee maker.  Yep, they have all the bases covered.  That last one becomes important, because in a strange new trend, this place doesn't have the endless coffee pot sitting out in the lobby, free for the taking day and night.  No, if you want coffee in the morning, you have to have breakfast!  Or make coffee in your room.  I found myself bribing the wait staff with my Breakfast Vouchers just for a cup of coffee in the morning.The lobby seems really busy, not exactly a relaxing place to hang out.  Since I never hang out in hotel lobbies, though, this wasn't a big deal.  If you are the type that likes to check into the room, go down to the lobby and grab a cup of coffee while you lounge, well bubba, I've got some bad news for ya....If you use a GPS to get here, you might want to keep the driver's side window of your car rolled down so that after you circle the hotel for the 4th time, you can toss your GPS out the window and navigate to the front door old school style.  The address is Southfield Freeway, but I think that is just to fool the cops.  Just get close then use your eyeballs to figure out how to get to the parking lot.So yes, this is a Doubletree Hotel, very much like most of the other Doubletree Hotels I've stayed in over the last decade or so...although the piped in music that is played in the lobby and all over the common areas of the hotel is different....sort of a cross between Light Jazz and the Soundtrack to a Porn Movie.   You know, the type of music that includes some loopy sounding flute runs and wah wah guitar noises.  Listen closely and you can hear the platform shoes the musicians were wearing when they recorded these tracks.  Wouldn't it be cool if this was a Pandora station (Dearborn Doubletree Pornjazz)?If you have business in Dearborn, stay here.  It is close to everything that you need and far enough away from the stuff that you don't.","We had a suite, and the beds were very comfortable, and the room was huge.  A friend used the pull-out bed and said she had no trouble sleeping there.It is not the most modern of hotels, but we had a nice TV.  The one downer was that I couldn't figure out how to turn on the bubbles in our jacuzzi tub.  Was it my problem or was it broken?  No idea.The staff is extremely accommodating at all times.  It was a pleasure to stay here again.This Doubletree was...adequate for a night's stay. Our reservations at the more upscale Marriott got changed, and this place was available and cheaper. Close to the Henry Ford Museum, and right on the Southfield Freeway, it puts you fairly central in Detroit.There's not much to this hotel. The lobby area is plain and minimal. The bar small, and closes at 11pm. I think dinner was not available, or the restaurant was going through renovations, or something when we were there. Breakfast menu looked good, though.Got a room with two double beds and those were not double beds. More like twin beds! The storekeep was sweet, and they had a lot of snacks, vitamin waters, red bulls, and Detroit Baby t-shirts. I would stay here again if we got bumped from the Marriott (again) and needed something quick.Had an event at this hotel. They were very helpful and backed up everything they said they would deliver. Comfy rooms. Reasonable prices.I've stayed in the Dearborn/Detroit area weekly for over a year now and have long-ago chosen the DoubleTree as my go-to hotel.  The spacious gorgeous lobby and vintage automotive/Ford decor in the hallways are way-cool and the beds are reliably comfortable.  If you find the duvet too warm, ask for a non-feather blanket as a less-hot alternative.  Some room-views are better than others so I prefer views to the west.  The bathrooms are really nice with huge countertops to spread-out your stuff, luxurious shower heads, and plush towels.  The computer desks/tables are large, at a lower level for comfort, and have good wireless service.  The chairs are cloth and comfortable, but since I find them slightly low, I throw a pillow on them for a slight boost.  The workout room, pool, and two hot tubs are all excellent and immaculate.  Self-parking is a breeze.  There is lots of it, all patrolled by contract-security 24x7, with numerous entrances.  I recommend driving all the way around to the northwest corner lot where only the most-regulars park and the walk is minimal.  I confess I only eat breakfast in the hotel, and the buffet is fantastic, but with so many great restaurants nearby, I prefer to get out for dinner.  My favorites are Big Fish, Bravo, Andiamo's, and Crave, but there are many others in the Fairlane Mall area or in downtown Dearborn between Andiamo's and Crave.  Exploring them is the best part of travelling for business!    In summary, as a road warrior I can tell you without a doubt, that the best feature of this hotel is the staff.  From the front desk to house keeping to the waitresses/bartenders to the maintenance techs, everyone I have ever encountered at this DoubleTree is pleasant beyond compare and efficient at what they do.  They make this place an exceedingly delightful place to stay.  This is THE hotel for your stay whether it's for a night or a year.  And I haven't even mentioned the fantastic chocolate chip walnut cookie that awaits you every time at check-in.  They are also THE best!I checked into this place on a miserable rainy Detroit afternoon.  This property has a very spacious lobby with a cascading fountain.  The sound of water is very soothing.  It's so big that it's not easy to find your way to the back elevator.  Even when on your floor, you could easily lose your way if you don't watch it.  The one thing I want to talk about is the DT bed.  When I crashed that first night, I was lying in bed, too tired to get to sleep immediately.  It must have been over an hour, but the bed and pillow were so comfortable that I did not even move once.  That is pretty remarkable.My room, reserved just last week, was $149, pretty decent value, but the room is not nearly as comfortable as the one in Ohio.  They have a nice pool and a well-equipped workout room with a water dispenser.  HATE workout places at half-assed ""fancy"" hotels that force you to drink tap.  Oh how spoiled we North Americans are!!.Ok, to start off, I just want to make clear that this review is from the perspective of an event rather than a traveller.  Although we did certainly stay in the hotel (and enjoy the rooms), it wasn't really our focus.My husband Scott and I got married at this hotel on May 30, 2010.  Our wedding was on a Sunday and it was a brunch wedding with the ceremony at 11am and the reception at 1pm.  We did the ceremony in the lobby and then moved to the banquet halls for the reception.  We had absolutely wonderful help from Nicole Nation and Lauren Rodriguez, the two event managers, and were not bothered with a single problem on the day of the event, so that was absolutely fantastic.  I guess I'll try to break it all down - this may be a long review.We had our rehearsal dinner the night before.  There was another event going on at the time at the hotel, but it wasn't a problem (for either of us, I hope).  We were given a hospitality suite for the duration of the weekend and the lobby was set up for the ceremony when we arrived at 3pm the day before, which was really nice.  When I mentioned the rehearsal dinner, they gave us another banquet room for that as well (no cost) and we had a laid back pizza and salad rehearsal for around 60 people.  The pizza, salad and soda came to about $300 total - at $5 a person, I am not complaining!  They have a nice bar in the hotel, so people could just walk over and buy their own drinks, which they did.  The next day I heard that Lauren and the banquet staff were awesome at helping to set up the reception, and we ended up having a bunch of extra flowers so they pulled a bunch of vases out of their storage and added more beauty to it all.  Of course, I didn't know any of that at the time.  I had the great pleasure of being able to just get ready for the wedding, blissfully unaware of anything downstairs.The ceremony was fine - the only minor glitch of the day is that they were supposed to turn down the waterfall in the lobby (it's *loud*!) and that didn't get down, but once someone ran over and asked them to do it, they did.  (PS, since there were no pictures, I put one up of the waterfall - the lobby really is very nice).  As far as the hotel goes, the reception was good.  Lauren was there the whole time, so when there was a moment of confusion over how long we had the room for, she was able to clear it up right away.  The bar did stay open an hour longer than it was supposed to, but it didn't end up making much of a difference.  While we went and got pictures taken, our guests had access to coffee, juice and tea and also a large variety of fruit, cheese and crackers.  We went with their champagne brunch buffet with mimosas instead of champagne.  I was a little anxious about it because we never tasted *anything* ahead of time, but oh my gosh - it ended being a huge hit.  There was an omelette bar that people loved, and all of the food was really really good.  I had people complimenting me days afterward, so that was really great.  We ended up having about 120 people there, and our total bill was  $6800, including the rehearsal dinner.  For a wedding, that is more than reasonable.  The room rates were nice too - we had a block at $89.95 a night for our guests.  Overall, I'm very happy we chose the Doubletree Dearborn to get married in.  The lobby is beautiful with huge ceilings and skylights and the waterfall, meandering stream and live trees around it.  My guests all had a good time, and the food was wonderful.  Thank you, Doubletree, for helping make our wedding day such a success!!I travel frequently for work and have stayed at this property in the past with no problem. During my last stay in April 2014,  I woke up in the middle of the night covered in itchy welts. I soon discovered that my room was infested with bedbugs. I requested to be switched rooms which the staff was more than willing to do but the damage had already been done. I was incredibly itchy and too scared to get back into bed. Needless to say I had a sleepless night. As goodwill gesture, I was promised 10,000 Hilton points which I have yet to receive. I have contacted their customer service and have heard nothing back. I am highly disappointed and I will never stay at this property again.Dropped by to say hi to a friend for a few hours, have a drink, and put my feet up - the hotel has pretty spacious rooms, and seems nice enough! But we got a knock on our door saying that we were being too loud, and still had our room service to eat. What a dilemma!I have been staying at this hotel during the week for the last 8 months on business and my experience has been great. There is free wifi and breakfast for Hilton loyalty members, and the hotel restaurant is great. There is even a few walkable food places nearby which is very convenient.The lobby has high ceilings and a fountain with a great seating area. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and there are refrigerators and microwaves available upon request. Overall I thought the hotel was very clean and homey. There are a lot of great things about this hotel but the best feature: the staff. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of there way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The breakfast staff is incredibly friendly, and the manager Charles is awesome. He takes time to listen to the guests compliments/complaints/suggestions, which really makes the hotel a success. Definitely recommend it!Area is not the greatest but it's a good rate for what you get, but be warned... the hotel  has several flaws:  1) Usually one person working the front desk so it can't take a while... my last trip had faulty room keys... long walk back to front desk with luggage and had to wait for three people before I could get re-keyed.   2) The workout areas has missing weights and all the attachments to the multi-purpose machine have vanished, presumably stolen   3) The elevators are slow and out of service ... it can take a while.   Room is okay... nothing special...If I would've known that this hotel on Yelp had no pictures, I would have definitely taken some during my stay this week. Sadly I was only in town for a few meetings and a 24-hour trip. I've always been a fan of Doubletree Hotels and not just because of that yummy warm cookie you get when you check in. (Whoever thought that up is brilliant!) I find Hilton Hotels to be consistent, clean, good service and reliable...plus nicely decorated etc. This hotel is big- huge lobby- a bit open like an Embassy Suites, but really beautiful. The staff at the front desk was exceptionally friendly, the woman stepped out from behind the counter to come around, give me my room key and point me in the right direction to my room. My room was outrageously clean. I say outrageous because, I travel a lot. And I expect cleanliness but sadly, I find some chains forget to clean. So I find myself Looking around first to see if I feel like I'm in a clean room. You know, you can be in a ""poshly decorated room"" and it can be dirty and ruin everything. This hotel is spotless. Spotless. The beds are TO DIE FOR. I actually slept in past 6am because of the comfort. The desk has 2 electrical outlets in the lamp plus 2 to the side- so plenty of plug-ins for chargers. Frankly, there could be more, if you think about it. Hotels should do this; we have bluetooths to charge, laptops to plug in, smart-phones to charge and more. Give us PLUGS!! ;-)Room service was prompt and very courteous. They even added 2 after-dinner mints to the experience, nice touch. I will always stay at this hotel in Dearborn. Great location- you can walk to a Chili's restaurant or Wendy's from the parking lot- plus it's quiet and they have a security truck roaming the parking lots all the time. (I noted this when I went for a walk.) Awesome.my reason for giving it a one star:they put dirty towels that we had put on the floor back with the clean towels... we had put them there because they were dirty to begin with... that was highly disappointing...  horrible room service!!! even the hotel was comfortable enough, i was very under-impressed by the service.As some previous reviewers pointed out, the hotel is in a neighborhood that's pretty sketchy. However, to stay at a Doubletree for $129 for room and breakfast buffet for 2 and free parking is a great deal. The hotel is about 15 minutes from downtown on the outskirts of Detroit and spitting distance from Dearborn. Our room was nice and clean, the bed very comfortable, and we had a small sofa as well. When you check in, you get a warm chocolate chip cookie for each guest. Absolute bliss!!! In my opinion, this is probably one of the best deals out there. I got my honors points and airline miles for my stay as well. Doubletree is affiliated with Hilton hotels and you can use points to stay here.When I was pulling into the parking lot I knew it could be a problem. Behind a Chili's and a lame sports bar, sits this hotel. Upon entering the lobby, I was impressed, it is spacious and first impression is the hotel will be nice. After checking in, it is a long walk to the elevators past the conference rooms and my room was about a 4 minute walk from the front desk. The room wasn't bad, but the TV was an old tube TV from the 90's and it made me think how I've come to expect a nice flat screen with a responsive remote. The fan on the air unit was whiny and loud and every time it came on in the night, it woke me up. I had to put my White Noise on my phone to drown out that sound. I will be looking for another hotel next time in that area.Comfortable beds. Decent security. However, my towels had not been changed for I don't know how long. A huge chunk of hair fell out when I removed the washcloth. Gross!! There are numerous floor plans so you have to make sure that you ask for one of the nicer ones. Don't think about dining I the restaurant for dinner. Service is nonexistence and the food is comparable to a low end hospital cafeteria.  The breakfast buffet service is friendly... If you place an order expect to wait a few.  Speediness is not their top priority, but the morning staff is very friendly.  Not a Four Seasons but you get what you pay for I guess.Staff was extremely pleasant and professional, from reception to the bar.  The hotel, however, is pretty dated, and my room was not a winner.There were two filthy hand towels dried on the shower rod that I didn't notice until morning when I went to shower, and it was a 5 minute walk just to get to my room from the front desk/restaurant.The hotel borders a pretty sketchy neighborhood, which is somewhat mitigated by the constantly circling security vehicle and a wall with barbed wire facing the side street, but not a place to go jogging at night.Again, the staff was great, but the hotel was just adequate.While the facility is somewhat dated, we enjoyed our stay there.  The neighborhood (especially to the North) is somewhat disturbing, but fear not, as the security cars and barbed wire keep the parking lot safe.  The cookies on check in at least let us forget about the security while we parked, though.",,,,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'weekend', 'double', 'tree', 'used', 'points', 'program', 'book', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-detroit-downtown-detroit,Courtyard Detroit Downtown,3.5,$$,32,"Great hotel!!!! Perfect downtown location. The people mover is in the hotel and makes moving around downtown so easy. Mike checked us in faster then when I use the Marriott app. Beautiful room with a fantastic view of the Ren Center and the Detroit River. The room, common areas and lobby were very clean and well kept. The only down side was an over zealous security guard who found it necessary to have my wife bring our room key down to the lobby in her pj's. I left the key in our room since she was there and I went to the lobby to get our pizza. Thankfully the staff at the front desk gave me another key, after I showed them my id and my wife didn't have to come down to satisfy the private security guard's need to be a total pain in the ass. Fantastic hotel, don't let the security guard ruin your time.I stay at a lot of Courtyards and love, love, LOVE their newer properties.  This is not one of those.  Which is to be expected as it is Downtown D-town.  But, it is in serious need of renovation.  The signs in the hotel say that this renovation is imminent, but I see no sign of it having started.  Get on it, peeps!I've stayed at this location twice.  The first time I got an automatic upgrade as a Gold member but the second time they must have been full as I just got a regular room.  The upgraded room was huge with a living area and minifridge - probably over twice the size of a regular room.  But, still very disco in furnishings and a lot of bare space.  Basically same amount of furniture from a normal room (plus a couch) but spread over a much larger area.  Ugly ass blue carpet.  Bed was comfortable though.The second time, same floor but regular room.  Still ugly ass blue carpet and comfortable bed, but even though I had upgraded internet service, I could not get an internet connection at all during my whole stay.  I come for business so this is a big problem for me.  So I decide since I can't work to try to watch a little telly... and I note that they have probably *half* the channels that are offered at my usual RenCen Marriott across the street.  That's freaking cheap, folks.  I just want my HGTV, travel channel, food network...not asking for HBO or anything fancy.  But nope.  TV selection is spartan and mostly sports (blech) and news (depressing).The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2 is I think the mattresses here are more comfy than at the RenCen.  But really I don't want to stay here again if I can get a room across the street.The hotel is a great option for staying downtown! We got a room for a bachelorette party in lieu of staying at one of the pricier casinos. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Our room had a nice view as well.The location is really really nice, we were able to walk to &amp; from the greektown area on a Saturday night without any problem. The people mover is right there too, but honestly unless the weather is bad - just walk.Very nice and friendly staff at check in. Disappointing to see the forced wrist bands, but definitely understand the need during Movement. I thought it was a bit extreme to have a policy where you could not get a new wristband at all. What if it's your name on the room? Anyways...Low markings for this hotel due to the exceptionally dirty room at check in. * Grease stains on the headboard from someone's head. Wiped this down.* Dusty couch on the top of backboard up against the wall. I wiped this down with a wet cloth--world of difference.All in all, overpriced for what it is.There are some great things about this hotel. Let me start by saying the room is beautiful and spacious and you'd think you're in a full-service Marriott. The sheets and pillows are excellent. The view of the water was wonderful. The sofa and ottoman very stylish! I was here for four nights on business so this is a good start. But as we head into the spacious bathroom with lots of counter space...the towels are so thin I wouldn't wash my car with them...the toilet seat is WAY smaller than the toilet base, so essentially you're partially sitting on the toilet seat and partially on the rim of the base. Very uncomfortable....and,I found the blow dryer in the closet but it is the kind that one half of it should be screwed into the bathroom wall and then you pull the other half off to blow dry your hair. Instead the whole thing was in the closet!... The Internet worked, but even though I signed up for four days, it asked you every day to re-sign up. And it said it was good for up to six devices but it asked each of my devices to sign up all over again. Very inconvenient...Lastly, the TV was mostly static on all channels. After I complained about all these issues to the front desk, I got thicker towels, which were nice.  Disappointing they didn't care to fix the rest. As a Gold Marriott member, I try to stick with Marriott, but I think they have a lot of improvement to make on this hotel. It's very conveniently located if you have business at the convention center, and the people mover is practically at your door.I've stayed in a lot of  Courtyards for work, and this one is one of the nicest. It's definitely larger and the inside has more amenities. There is a full bar and restaurant in lieu of of the usual mini bistro. Sadly there isn't the usual Starbucks station. The Renaissance Marriott and GM Center are across the street and connected by tunnel for easy (warm) access. That hotel is so integrated into the larger GM complex I prefer the Courtyard. The Courtyard has much less foot traffic, is a bit cheaper, and includes free wifi. It also is as close to Greektown and the Cobo center as the Renaissance.Clean hotel. That's usually my number one criteria when searching for hotels, next to location. This hotel is within a couple blocks of all the action and it has the People Mover which is 75 cents and helps you avoid walking the streets of downtown Detroit, for the most part. However, we had an issue with our air conditioner that was never fully resolved and two guests in our group was sick after eating the risotto dish at the restaurant inside. I think the hotel is overpriced. I think all of the hotels in downtown Detroit are overpriced. There's more casinos, restaurants, more fun and better weather in Vegas and it doesn't cost as much to stay in a hotel as it does in Detroit.Just checked in and I'm loving it already. FIVE STAR SERVICE from the moment I got out of the car. I felt like a big shot visiting my hometown. What a way to come home!I stayed here overall three weeks in late March and most of April. 2014. This is the time of the year it might be hot or cold outside. Room- The rooms were pretty good, comfortable, good views when I had a room overlooking detroit river, fair when I had views of the back alley and street. Environment - Heating and air seems to be an issue during this time of year. If it is warm outside and they have not switched off the heat, you get no cool air. Even it is cold outside and you are hot, hopefully you can open your window.Breakfast - got the breakfast option with my room since I am traveling to cut down on expenses. They have a good breakfast and friendly waitstaff.Dinner - ehhh not so much. I wasn't impressed. Anything with the word Cajun in it seems to be doused with salt.Convenience - absolutely. You go up a few floors and grab the one-way people mover. There is a c-store right outside the hotel but still indoors that will sell you people mover tokens. People mover will take you to Joe Louis arena, Greektown, and I'm sure many other interesting places.My room was 74 degrees all night and it's  summer I found a dirty thong which I brought to the front desk and found a cockroach in the shower Needless to say never againThis is our second stay. Comfortable, clean, consistant and up to date. Valet parking available, skywalk to Ren Cen, People mover in nearby.  Really nice indoor pool, rec center, bar and restaurant in the lobby.  Breakfast and parking packages available with booking rooms. The breakfast is pretty good for the price, but service is lacking.  Best thing about this place - I love the showers.  Can't beat a great shower with unlimited hot water.  Just wish there was an exhaust fan too.  Room can get steamy but the nice AC unit fixed that pretty quick.Overall, a good alternative to the Marriott at the Ren Cen and conveniently located if you're doing business in the RenCen, you can walk across the street to it in a covered tunnel and are never exposed to the elements. Room was pleasant, bed was comfy and got a good night's sleep.Stayed here for the Detroit Marathon in October.  It was convenient to the start/finish line, and they had a special marathon rate.  The parking is additional - $20 per night, but the room was clean and roomy.  We got a king room and it also had a sofa/sitting area.  Free wi-fi.  I'm picky about the bathroom and it was nice - granite and clean grout in the bath/shower (it really bothers me when the grout is not well-kept).  The towels were on the thin side and I could hear the neighbors - thus, the loss of one star in the rating.  But it did have indoor access to the People Mover, a monorail system that is 75 cents to access places like Greek Town if you don't want to walk it.  The desk personnel were also friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.Honestly, the hotel is nice and the last time I stayed there everything went smoothly. However, this past weekend, there was an incident that makes me think otherwise about a repeat stay. When we went to valet, the valet said just leave the keys in the car and they will take care of it, because they were a bit backed up. Fine, no problem there. Fast forward to the next day when we go to retrieve our car from valet, and they ask for our ticket. We said they never provided us with one. They said we needed to speak to the front desk; enter Ash. Ash was very unhelpful, and borderline rude! He kept asking for the plate number (which sorry we didn't memorize), and was like ""oh well"". We were like we aren't leaving without our car, so he said go look at the keys and see if you recognize them, which we didn't until we looked at this other area and saw the keys there. We asked what those keys over there are, and Ash said it's for unassigned cars. Well what the hell have we been saying for the past 20 minutes. Ash should take a course on customer service and try and be a problem-solver, not problem maker.Yes, this is ""just"" a courtyard hotel, but you wouldn't know it by the amenities. The beds were comfortable (though the pillows left something to be desired.) We were especially happy that the hotel had a grocery store in the lobby. Being connected via indoor passages to both the people mover and Ren Cen were also nice touches.One of my favorite things to do at most any hotel is to check out the hot tub. This one didn't disappoint. In fact, the entire fitness center was quite nice with ample equipment, separate mens and women's saunas and both a massive indoor pool and a good sized hot tub. Nice bonus, you get a view of ren cen from just outside of the pool room.We also checked out the breakfast buffet. It's pretty good and has a good selection of breakfast food and a made to order egg/omelet station.The best free perk though has to be the WiFi. Not only is it completely free, but it's also fast. Increasingly a luxury in hotels that I visit.This hotel has terrible customer service. I pulled up to the front door and asked about parking. The valet driver stated there were 2 options, to valet park or just park around the corner and walk the skyway to the hotel. I chose to self-park. BAD IDEA! The ramp was huge and I could not find the skyway. I ended up having to walk outside in the bitter cold using my iphone to find my way back to the hotel. I asked about parking at check-in and the receptionist informed me that if you park in the ramp it is $15 EVERY time you come and go! Valet parking is $23 but you can come and go at no extra cost. I explained that nobody had explained this to me and she directed me back to the ramp to move my car. I had to run back to the ramp in the hopes to make the 15 min cutoff(for $2 charge). I missed it, paid $4 to leave the ramp and on top of it had to pay the FULL $23 for valet parking. The receptionist informed me I would be welcome to walk back over to the ramp and talk to the people at the window about getting my $4 back, but there was nothing she could do to help me. Absolutely ridiculous given I specifically asked about parking and was given bad information! On top of that, it took me over 30 minutes to check in given this whole fiasco. I would have at least expected $4 off the cost of my valet.Overall nice hotel.  Great location. People mover on fifth floor. Nice pool with handicap lift.  They could however do some things to improve it.  The in room coffee was pathetic. Only enough coffee for one cup of regular coffee. Also the restaurant service at dinner was very poor. We had to walk up to the bartender to get our drinks refilled and it took almost 25 minutes to get our nacho appetizer. It was not busy at all. For a cost of 240 dollars which yes did include parking and breakfast but I would think they could include some features such as an upgraded coffee maker and better service in the restaurant.I can see Canada from my hotel room!!!This is my go to hotel in Detroit.  I love this place.  Great location ( for me ) and I've always had great service when I've been here.  The restaurant here is even great as well.  Front desk people have always been friendly and very accommodating.  My only complaint, is the wifi is pretty shady.  It drops out here and there.First off lets start by saying why this Courtyard is a 4 star instead of a 3. There is a a glass enclosed room on the 8th floor overlooking the GM Renaissance Center, riverfront, and Windsor, Ontario. Oh and did I mention there was a heated pool and hot tub in this room? Yes going to that every night after doing tours of the city in 30 degree weather was rather relaxing. Other than that the rooms are standard, service is friendly, mediocre-good breakfast buffet depending on your taste, downstairs restaurant was a tad cold....Another plus is this hotel is connected to the people mover(mono-rail) &amp; GM Rencen leaving you little reason to go outside.This hotel is close to the border and Greek Town plus local to several casinos for entertainment.  Once you leave Jefferson Street however, be prepared for homeless people begging for money, sleeping on the sidewalks and run down graffitti filled buildings.  The hotel itself made you feel safe as there were sky walks to the General Motors building across the street with a pretty large food court, a few shops and a CVS.  You can also access the People Mover from one of the sky walks in the hotel.  The rooms are big and the fitness facility is probably one of the best I have ever seen in a hotel.  The restaurant was also reasonable priced for hotel food.  The maid service needs work.  My shower had hair on the walls and when I came back the next day after my meeting, there were black shoe prints all over the floor and something brown all over the ceiling.","Came here for one night only for my Giants who were playing in Comerica that night.  Location wise, it was very close walking distance to the park and to the nearby water where one can see the MGM Grand across the way.  Across the street in the Marriott Renaissance, they have a Starbucks and a food court with McDonalds and Subway.  Inside the hotel, it was pretty well laid out with the business center located near the convenience store.  I used my card key to get in to print out maps and driving directions.  Of course, I thought I could sneak a Facebook login to check my virtual restaurant...denied!  Seems like they filter out certain websites...Checkout wasn't a problem although I noticed that after the valet brought back our rental car, there were some scratches on the back left bumper?  Since we were in a rush, I never made a big stink about it and left.  The hotel and location is nice but probably will find somewhere else closer to the park to stay.Our nonprofit organization was extremely happy with the formal luncheon for 100 students and professionals that we hosted at the Courtyard Marriott Detroit Downtown. We had a number of guests in attendance who were deaf, and the event Manager Nico made sure that we incurred no additional cost for accommodations such as an extra projector screen (to display text of the speeches being made). We were also awarding an honoree who was in a wheelchair, and Nico went out of his way to secure a ramp to attach to the stage so he could come up to receive the award. Nico and the catering manager Nona both went above and beyond to make our event run smoothly. I would highly recommend this venue and their kind and helpful staff!It's downtown Detroit and an ok place to stay. Staff is enormously friendly and helpful but otherwise it's a no frills standard room that is decent and fairly clean. The property is showing some age from its last renovation. Convenient to the people mover and a inside walk to the Ren Center make this ideal for getting supplies at one of the small shoppes or CVS.Ok, this place wasn't bad.  The rooms were large, but not particularly well laid-out.  When I checked in on 6/6 the ice bucket in my room was still full of the melted ice of the previous occupant.  Otherwise, it was clean and quiet.The little hotel shop for snacks and incidentals was out of a staple - toothpaste - and, I'm guessing had been for a while, as it was on the price list, but all the pegs in the display case were filled with other things.Desk service was efficient if not friendly.  When I checked in, the person at the front desk might have said two words to me total.The FUNNIEST thing (and you HAVE to pay attention to this if you stay here) are the recorded female voices in the elevators.  OMG.  What is with this overtly sexy, sultry voice for announcing floors?  Especially funny is the way she says ""floor"" . . . you halfway expect a lap dance with the experience.  Hilarious (so much so that I did a voice recording of it and plan to post it on facebook later today).  I actually laughed out loud every time I rode the elevators!A bit pricey for a Courtyard.BTW, this is nothing about the hotel - but about Detroit . . . what the hell is it about taxis there - what horrible transportation hell is this?  Wow.  If you're traveling here, add an extra 30 - 40 minutes to every trip you need a taxi for - because even if you call and request one, and even if they call and say it is right outside - it probably isn't.Pretty nice hotel in the middle of downtown.  Rooms are large and spacious and bed is super comfortable.  And really nice views of the downtown area and riverfront.Very nice hotel. I was a bit bummed when my company book me here rather than the  Renaissance across the street, but this place is pretty nice for a courtyard. I got one of the biggest hotel rooms i've ever stayed in, and I'm a Marriott Platinum elite. So I stay in a lot of Marriott's! Anyway the gym at this place is also the best hotel gym I've been in also which helped since the April weather in Detroit was pretty crappy for a run. The food at the restaurant was ok, if you got other options I'd not eat there. The hotel also connects to the people mover and  a bridge connects to the Renaissance Center. So you can avoid the crappy Detroit weather pretty easy.Though not as ""ritz-y"" as the Marriott at RenCen the staff more than make up for any nits or chips in the armor. From check in to check out to the Cafe, the staff is friendly and really makes you feel at home. I cannot remember staying in a Marriott that made me feel more welcome. The only nit is that the internet was very sporatic and lost connection ALL the time.Could have just been my room was in a bad location, but enough of an irritant to deduct one star.Highly recommended if not for the fact that you will come away feeling like your patronage was truly appreciated.** If the management is reading, Shout out to Tanya as she was my first point of contact and she gave me a very warm welcome which set the tone for the whole stay.Convenient downtown location.  It's across from GM, the Windsor tunnel, and Riverwalk.  You also get free wired internet.  We got a standard double. The room appeared clean but it was uncomfortably hot.  It was in the 40s outside but our room felt like 85 degrees.  Why not turn on the AC?  Well, we tried.  The theromstat was set at 60 but it definitely did not feel like 60.  We also couldn't adjust the theromostat to go any lower either.  Long story short, we complained to the front desk and only got a measly ""sorry.""  I have 2 basic requirements for any hotel stay: (1) must be clean; (2) must be comfortable.  The heat just made it unbearable to sleep at night and getting ready in the morning was awful.  Especially when I have to blow-dry my hair.  I felt like I was in a sauna!  After this experience, if I need to stay in downtown Detroit again, I will avoid this hotel.I stayed here for about 6 months every week M-F while working in Detroit.  The staff is excellent from the bellhops to the front desk.  Well, one time I had this one lady at 2am or so who was kind of a bitch.  But other than that, all the others were very nice.Since I was there so long, eventually all the staff knew me and would already have my reservation pulled up for me by the time I was at the front desk.  When I got drinks or food from the store, they would wave me through and either remember which room I was in, or just look it up themselves.  I guess you expect this kind of service anywhere you go, but let's be honest, not every hotel does it well.  Even though the trips were business, I would stay there if I ever go to Detroit for pleasure...I've stayed here every time I've been here--easily  6 times in the last 18 months. Yeah it's a bit pricey but the amenities are great in every way. The in-house restaurant is good, the breakfasts are huge both in price and quantity but also high quality. Rooms are sparkling clean, beds have this memory foam that make these probably the best next to my own bed at home.It's conveniently located across from Windsor Canada if you want to enjoy Canada a bit. It's very near on the riverfront, within easy walking distance. It has complimentary Internet which the more expensive Marriott across the street does not have.The rooms are quiet, the AC doesn't blow on you like so many other hotels seem to. In room fridge is whisper quiet. There's a safe if you need it. Even the desk is set up for Internet and a business function. They have recently provided more comfortable desk chairs to make this even nicer. Right next to the front desk they have a nicely stocked and reasonably priced convenience store with everything from dinners to snacks and drinks etc.Their exercise rooms are neat and clean as well and offer a large assortment of treadmills, bikes, and step and elliptical machines as well as free weights, an aerobics room, pool, and a full gym of free &amp; plated weights and targeted weight machines. They really have thought of pretty much everything.If you can afford $200+ per night, you will not be disappointed here.Great location, great customer service, free wifi.  This is my favorite place to stay in Detroit.Signed up for Yelp to leave this review. Drove in from St. Louis overnight and they let us check in as soon as we arrived at 7am. The room was AWESOME and had a great view. It was a little more expensive than some of the other choices I looked at but totally worth it.",,,,"['great', 'hotel', 'perfect', 'downtown', 'location', 'people', 'mover', 'hotel', 'makes',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-detroit-downtown-detroit,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Detroit Downtown,3.0,$$,40,"Stayed at the Holiday Inn express while we were in town for a Lions game.  No issues checking in or checking out, Valet service had our vehicle ready within mins of calling for our car,  The hotel staff were friendly, service was good. Our room was clean, beds were comfortable and the hot breakfast was decent.   Based on my experience, I'd stay here again.Holiday Inn Express is located very central on Washington Ave in walking distance to all arenas-/attractions (if you like to walk around in Detroit during evening hours :) ). Just one block far away from the Detroit Mover.Hotel is offering Holiday Inn s standard amenities: well equipped gym, basic swimming pool on 17th floor and complimentary breakfeast with good quality.Reason why I have put three stars only? :  - my room was smelly - rooms have seen better times... refurbishment would be nice - valet parking chaoting and asking for 23$ (twenty-three!!) a night! Not to forget that we are NOT in Manhatten... - money paid compared to the value I got (almost 200$ for a single room-/night, maybe the SAE conference was the reason for such immense rate)Will try the Crowne Plaza-/Westin around the corner next time.All of the staff were very friendly during my 4 day stay.  It is a easy walk to Cabo Center and the Riverfront park.I just had the pleasure of speaking with a lovely woman who was chomping on food and slurping a drink directly into the phone while not helping me cancel my reservation. She also used an acronym (fourteen times) for which she didn't know what the letters stood for. Luckily I will not be staying here.If I was standing in front of that sales lady she would've melted as she looked into my gorgeous blue eyes, that's the sad thing about all of this.+Great locationSafeStandard, decent roomsAmazing view if you're lucky enough to be on the top (17th) floorGREAT free breakfast- we're talking bacon and eggs, people!-$20 for parking... seems steep when you're already paying for a roomValet-only, and the valet people aren't very organized or speedyWAY overpriced, considering it's an average chain hotel in DetroitOverall, nothing too special, but fine if it's in the location you need and you get a good deal.The positives: Location was great. One block from people mover.Hot breakfast with nice variety. Nice lobby/breakfast area. Quiet on high floors. Room was clean. Area felt safe. Nice view from room (15th floor)The negatives:Front desk Staff did not seem too professional or knowledgeable. Lots of noisy people (not the hotels fault)Faucet in tub pointed sideways...soaked the carpet out side bathroom Room smelled strange. As if it once was a smoking room. Didn't have safe to lock up valuablesBed was very low We were in town for the Grand Prix. The hotel served its purpose. Next time though would rather stay somewhere classier. Maybe Marriott at Renaissance Center.I went up here for the game @ Ford Field (Buffalo vs Jets) when the Bills got snowed out at home. The check in process is hectic. With limited space to park in front of the hotel and a valet service that is really understaffed. Check-in was quick and greeted as a Platinum member and upgraded to a suite. The room was huge! could have slept 10. Very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to most places downtown but the people mover is a block away which will take you anywhere downtown. 10 minute walk to Ford Field. Not bad for $140 a night. But I used 10K points.Horrible experience here. We paid $330/night because of the national baptist convention in town, and it was a disaster. Wifi was spotty, key cards didn't work, elevator was broken and the ""business center"" is just a computer and a printer in a dark corner of the lobby. Worst of all, my room had BED BUGS and I woke up with dozens of bites.Very bad experience. I stayed in room 518 of this hotel on Saturday, August 1st of this year. While the staff are friendly and the location is great, I am sad to report that they have BED BUGS. This hotel was a stop-over on a long drive to the East Coast. I woke up at about 3:30 a.m. to a slightly painful, itchy feeling on my feet. After turning on the light, and inspecting further I found bites on my feet and elbows. I also found a live bed bug up  near the headboard of the bed. My poor confused dog also had several bites on his little head. Once home, I did the research that I should have done prior to booking, only to discover that people have been complaining about bed bugs at this hotel since at least 2010. I also spoke with employees who told me that they have ended up bringing these bugs home with them.This hotel is in need of a seriously big overhaul, the rooms are out of date small and smelled heavily of weed. The showers take about a full 2 minutes to turn on and the noise is unbearable be prepared to wake up at 6 am when the train rolls by every morning.  The hotel staff other than Laquetta are terribly condescending and rude, the rates are outrageous with zero amenities.  This is a badge of embarrassment for the IHG chain.Just returning from our trip to Detroit.. Saw a Red wings game, went to Greek town Casino, had a Lafayette Coney (2 blocks away). Great weekend.. The Staff at here at the Holiday Inn were GREAT, all of them, Valet, Front desk, Housekeeping.. all.It's an Older Holiday Inn, Its Clean though.. just down the street from Detroit's ""People Mover"",... very fun restaurant/Bar ..  mixture of locals and tourists. I was a bit reserved about traveling and staying in Detroit.. NOT any more.. we walked, people moved etc across the city and had the BEST time. we will be back.Thanks Detroit,,,This place is horrible. I will never ever come back here again. My kids and I checked in at 3pm. We had asked for fresh towels up until 11:30 pm and never got any service. The beds were worn out, the room was freezing cold, and the front desk receptionist was not so pleasant.  The pool area is dull looking. Looks like a jail or an abandoned school swimming pool. I would not recommend this location to anyone!I was at first a little thrown off by the other clientele. Then I remembered it was Hoedown weekend. Holiday Inn forgiven. The front desk staff was very friendly and the room was clean. I was 'in town' for a wedding next door at the Book Cadillac.  The room was $75 cheaper than its neighbor hotel and was fine for our post wedding reception drunken sleep. As a resident of a northern suburb I got a good kick out of the 'what to see and do in Detroit' video. First of all, most of the places to visit were in suburbs. Second of all, almost all of the highlighted restaurants in the video had closed years ago. I would recommend this hotel as a non fancy, slightly worn down alternative in a great location for visiting venues in the city. Take advantage of the free shuttle service in a 3-mile radius before 10pm!I stayed here during Movement and stayed in one of the suites. It was definitely quite large, and the kitchen was nice to have. The refrigerator was leaking a little, though, and dripped onto my pizza box. Nonetheless, the room was clean, and the people who worked here were really nice despite the fact that most of the people staying in the hotel that weekend were not very functional. I, myself, never made it down to breakfast, but it was nice that breakfast was included.There are sticky patches on the carpet, the air conditioner is making strange pulsing noises and not functioning, and the bed creeks every time you move. Unless you need the location, definitely pass.I was going to give this place a better rating but my most recent stay was NOT ok. I'll start with the positive: rooms are fairly new and clean. Nice, new television and a pretty large refrigerator. Good central downtown location. Free wifi and free breakfast every morning, and the breakfast is GOOD! Those biscuits and gravy are awesome! Indoor pool and gym as well.Parking used to be free, but is now $20 a day.My first year I stayed here I had an overall very positive experience. However my most recent stay was terrible. I came during memorial day weekend 2014, a VERY busy weekend for them so they should have been prepared. My friends and I had problems with our plumbing the ENTIRE trip. The pipes would makes this super scary, loud, banging noises anytime you showered and sometimes when you flushed. They water pressure in the shower was terrible and sometimes would not get cold, sometimes it wouldn't get hot! By the third day of our stay they shower TURNED OFF in middle of my boyfriend's shower! And then the toilet completely stopped flushing. So for a day and a half we had no shower and no toilet! We kept having to go downstairs to use the toilet! HOW RIDICULOUS!  If I had known this I would have saved hundreds and dollars and slept in my car all weekend. By our last morning, after a LONG weekend we were trying to sleep in a bit before showering and heading to the airport. We got a call from the front desk at 9:30 informing us that the water would be turned off on OUR ENTIRE FLOOR for TWO HOURS! WHAT?! There was no way we were all getting on a plane without showering! Two of my friends were flying to Berlin for gosh sakes! We PAY for HOTELS so we can have a SHOWER, BED, AND TOILET! Not just for a bed and television!They clearly had known that the plumbing was an issue the whole weekend and did not call at all except the FOURTH DAY. And did not offer ANY type of compensation! Even passing by the plumbers working on it(FINALLY AFTER FOUR DAYS) Said,""This is totally ridiculous I hope all of you get some sort of compensation!""We had to go down to the front desk in person and complain so they opened an empty room for us so we could all go shower and use the toilet for the remainder of our stay(all of 1 1/2 hours). By then it was 10:15, and checkout was 11. Thanks guys, really helpful. We of course stayed past 11am because how were we all supposed to shower and pack in time by then? Thanks for charging us for a room that basically had no plumbing all weekend Holiday Inn. And for the record these plumbing issues were OUR ENTIRE FLOOR. So we weren't the only ones. I won't be coming back.What a room!We decided on this place in relation to Comerica Park for our trip to Detroit.  We were pleasantly surprised!  We were in a suite and it was most definitely the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in.  I'm no world traveler and don't go too many places, but hey, it pretty nice.  We had a huge bed, a cool kitchen area and practially a whole living room.  The bathroom was a little on the small side, but I ended up getting ready just outside the bathroom anyway.Our room and the hallways were quiet, the front desk and valet very helpful and the bartender in the connected lounge was nice as well.  I would stay here again since it's pretty close for what we needed.  My only gripe - they were always cleaning the floor by the elevator in the lobby and it was always wet.I am jealous of all the people that only paid $49, I wouldn't complain at that price, but I will at $120 a night!  The breakfast was so busy, it was hard to get in.  The people working did their best to keep up.  Our room smelled like Urine.  Once the AC was on full blast, the smell was better. It was obvious that the door of the bathroom had recently been kicked in.  That alone was pretty scary.  It was so loud, even after midnight, people in room next to us were fighting.  Lobby was loud also.  Beds were newer but not very comfortable.The WORST!!!!! The key cards don't work. Old property. Maintenance is terrible and shoddy. Front office staff is most disinterested in fixing things. The restroom makes water sounds all night long and no one fixes it. For Holiday Inn very disappointingMy friends and I stayed here during Movement.  The location was good - a lot of our friends were across the street in the Westin, so it was great to be so close by.   The positives for our visit were the free valet parking, free breakfast (though we only made it to breakfast once), and friendly staff.  Unfortunately the room was a bit shabby and there were constant problems with the key cards. Every single time we tried to get back into our room, we were locked out and had to get our keys re-programmed. They even tried replacing the card reader on our door mid-weekend, and no joy.  It was a significant inconvenience, especially with people coming and going at all hours because of the festival and after parties.","We started out alright, and this was after we had to change rooms because of a leaky, running toilet and a handicapped shower that would have soaked the entire bathroom, if it has hot water.   Nice to have a free breakfast, but if you are going to have a big hotel, you need a large eating area.    The line on Saturday morning was so long, we decided not to wait in it.   The long line could have been due to the fact that many people slept in because we were awoken at 4am by a fire alarm.    (I know this is not the hotel's fault for some drunken fool who pulled it, but still sucks getting your scared children down fifteen flights of stairs.)   Housekeeping of the hotel is not the best, certainly not the worst I've been in, but a vacuum and a mop go a long way.    (Especially under the couch hide-a-bed and the elevator floors.  Valet staff needs to stop texting and goofing off with co-workers and answer the phone, so when guests come for their cars, they are waiting.I would have given 5 stars until on the drive back to Saginaw we noticed the valet service stole $ from the middle console that we'd forgotten to take out.  We called  the hotel who didn't seem in the least intersted that the valets that they hire stole from their customers.   We would have stayed there again had it not been for the theft.  We wouldn't steal from them, didn't even keep the toiletries from the bathroom, and expect the same from them.   Will never step foot in this place again, definitely not concerned for their customers.I go to Detroit a hole mess of times. I think easily 30 times in the last two and a half years. I have pretty much stayed at all fo the downtown hotels at one time or another. It may not have the glitz and the glamor of some of them, but this hotel is just down right perfect for me. It is right next to the Westin and right down the street from my work offices in Detroit. I can honestly say that I love this place, even though it is slightly worn down, not the cleanest place I have ever stayed, but for what it is and the price of the place, it is perfect.I get a decent nights sleep, no noise, the shower works, the beds are comfortable, i get free wifi. Breakfast int he morning is edible and not vomit inducing. Maybe I have set the bar really low, but every time I go there, I am ultra content. I also have not been robbed or killed or raped on my way to and from work, either sober or completely tanked off my ass. It is a block away from the people mover, right down the street from Comerica, it is in the perfect place and you do not need to pay Westin rates.Only complaint and it is not really a complaint that would knock it down a star value. But the lady that wanders around at breakfast, you do not need to come by my table every 7 minutes to ask me how every thing is. It is almost like you are shocked that everything is good, or that the food is not making me want to vomit. It is very unsettling. And to the blonde 23 year old that works the front desk, I know your birthday was just the other week, I am also waiting for you to call me back, i left my cell phone number on the receipt when i checked out. I know you were looking at me. I really appreciate you coming up and helping me fold my laundry that one night too. I'll be back soon, I do not remember your name.. but I will keep my eye out for you.When you book this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a>, the price is right ($49/night).  Just look for the only hotel in Downtown Detroit and you'll find it.With the exception of staying here for The Hoe Down weekend, I've always had a nice time.  DO NOT stay here during Hoe Down weekend.  It's just too trashy and icky for comfort.  Since this place is cheap, it brings out all the losers and weirdos that come from down river to experience the trashy country music festival. Outside of that weekend, the hotel is great.  The price is nice, the rooms are big enough and they all have a desk, dresser, flat screen TV, cable, closet and large bathroom (shower + tub).  The bedding is also really nice - feather pillows, feather comforter, soft mattress... very comfortable.  There's an on-site fitness center (not too big but never occupied), free continental breakfast every morning and a restaurant on the premises.  The staff are friendly enough and the check in process is pretty quick.  Valet parking is $18 per day (CHEAP!) and there's in/out privileges all night.  Oh, and did I mention free WiFi?The hotel is within walking distance of everything downtown Detroit has to offer.  10 minutes to Comerica, Ford Field, Opera, restaurants; three minutes to Campus Martius, Detroit Riverfront; three minutes driving to the tunnel to Canada.Really wanted to give it 3 stars as most of the staff was great but a few issues over 3 days; room was musty, the toilet seat can't stay up because the tank cover doesn't fit when remodel happened, so guys prepare for a two handed process. No fan or vent in a really small bathroom. Other issues, Had a room attendant actually drink some of our bottled water and leave it next to the TV while forgetting to clean out the coffee pot and not leaving more coffee or cups, the A/C heater unit was full of dust/ dirt that was evident when we tried to use it, switched it off immediately. One the elevators kind of has a mind of its own, stops short of the floor by a few inches, sometimes just stops on the way up then starts going again??? staff actually got off with us and said ""oh no not again."" The business center is a one pc searching for a wireless signal and a windows op system that was copied from another machine and installed - never actually was able to get one the web.Perfect place to stay after an event downtown! Rooms are nice, beds are comfy and the location is ideal. The staff is super accommodating &amp; friendly. Free, full breakfast in the morning is the perfect way to start the day. My only suggestion would be updating the blow dryers in the bathroom.Shuttle service is very efficient. On the other hand we had to wait more than 30 minutes for the swimming pool to be opened...I've checked in here a few times in recent months and I must say, one thing I noticed is that the clientele is often somewhat louder and a bit rowdier. Not in a menacing way, but just in an inconsiderate way. I am sad to say the staff doesn't call them out. I guess it's just the ambiance in this casual hotel. This place feels somewhat outdated, and while it's rated 2.5-3.0 stars, and has the potential to be such, I would say the upkeep of it is in the 2.0-2.5 star. Rooms are moderately comfortable, but the walls are a little aged, carpets old school and aged, bed was a little old, furniture old, well OK - you get my drift. Looks like they are trying hard to milk their preserved from the 90s interior. Location is good because it is downtown and just walking distance from the famous Michael Symon's Roast restaurant. Also, you are looking at a short drive to any downtown fares and Windsor. Parking was about $20, which is annoying but expected. There is complimentary breakfast with hot items, which is a nice freebie - but it gets kidn of loud and messy from the aforementioned crowd, so that kind of repels me from it anyway. Besides, the extra coin on all the great eats out and about is justified.Overall, a decent hotel, and can be had for a bargain price of around $50-$60 when secured via Hotwire or Priceline. One of me lesser favorable ones downtown, but still a solid level better than your Motel 8 &amp; Best Western tier of hotels. Also, higher floors have a cool view of the nearby skyscrapers of Detroit. Lastly, you want a minimum standard of this place to feel safe and comfortable in Detroit I'd say. They are also very kind to late checkouts at 1PM, which guys like me who party hard on Saturday nights can appreciate on a detox Sunday afternoon.Stayed here  the third weekend in October for the Theatre Bizarre Halloween party. This is the second year I have stayed here, last year it was a last minute thing and they got me in cheap. I think the rooms are fine and clean to boot. everything worked, they gave me a wifi code, but i was trying not to communicate with anyone so i didn't bring any devices to try it. Staff was friendly, and a little slow, breakfast in the morning was the usual fare. The only complaint i had was the valet parking checkout on sunday took about thirty minutes. Apparently they have to walk 4 blocks to get your car, so call down at least 15 minutes before you want it. this is close to MGM Detroit, and the old hulk of a train station that I love to visit, plus a lot of other decaying buildings that  you should go see.For the money, I think it's a good deal.This hotel is exactly what you would expect for the price, which was awesome. The rooms are clean, but nothing fancy. There's valet so you don't have to worry about parking your car in downtown, but it takes a while to get your car back. The b-fast is cereal and stuff, but who doesn't like that. The shower was very nice, and when the blow dryer in our room was broken the front desk was eager to replace it. It's walking distance from Comerica Park and lots of other things in downtown. Overall, a very good experience.Good Hotel considering price and proximity to downtown. It could use a makeover. Staff is friendly. Valet parking is convenient. Had to take away a star for the long black hair I found lying on my neatly-made bed. As you can see from my profile pic , it didn't fall off my head!First off, our room was crawling with bed bugs. Secondly, after checkout, we received a bill for $226 in unknown damages. After many, many calls to management (which were not taken seriously), we finally discovered that the damages we were forced to pay for included:1. A broken mirror in the room across the hall (where none of our party stayed, nor was the room under our party's name or associated with us at all)2. The number plate outside of our room that went missing while our party was not presentAfter many more phone calls, we got rid of the mirror charge, but they still claimed that we were responsible for the missing number plate. I consulted my lawyer, and he informed me because the plate was located outside of our hotel room in the hallway, which is a public space, we could not be held accountable for it.More calls to management resulted only in blackmail- they told us to stop calling because they had ""photographic evidence"" and ""video footage"" of our party committing the crime of stealing the number plate (which wouldn't be possible, as we were either sleeping or away at a convention when the theft took place). During one phone call they even told us that because we were responsible for reporting that the plate had gone missing, and we didn't report it, that they were within their right to charge us for it.Filing a complaint with corporate twice yielded no results. They simply took the hotel's word for it and never investigated into who actually stole the number plate, taking the easy route by stealing our money to pay for it.I stayed here one night recently and had a pleasant experience.  This hotel was specifically chosen because it had an indoor pool.  I really wish I could give a five star, but there were a few stand out disappointments.  At first, I was excited to find that they had valet parking that I paid an additional $20 to have.  It was snowing heavily when I visited.  However, I was dismayed to find out that my car had been parked in a regular lot overnight and valet drove it up covered in snow.  Also, there is no other real option for parking for this establishment besides parking your vehicle in one of the nearby paid lots.  The hotel is clean, but dated. Our wifi consistently dropped.  The elevators have gang graffiti scratched into the doors.  And the pool is quite small.  Many times we had to wait up to thirty minutes to get into the pool because room keys don't unlock the pool door.  For some reason towels were never stocked in the pool room and we also had to wait long periods of time for the staff to bring them up.  We were told not to use room towels for the pool.  The blankets on the bed were very thin and not very warm.  On the plus side...the staff was friendly and not in a we-have-to-be sort of way.  The pool hours pleased us, as most hotels close their pools too early.  The buffet breakfast offered lots of choices and was pretty tasty.  They had a large area sectioned off for people to sit and eat.  So, I wasn't forced to eat my breakfast with strangers.  Would I stay here again?  Yes, but it would depend on the weather/season and I would remember to bring my own blanket.This is worse than the motel 6. I am a platinum elite member  I stay at a lot of different holiday inns this is ranked at the bottom. Ice cold showers all weekend the water did not drain it came up to your ankles fast they did fix that but left my door wide open all day luckily nothing was missing from my room. The made never replaced our wash cloths I went to the front desk and asked for some when we got back late that night we still did not get them. Also the maid never replaced our empty tissue box.Good value. The hotel could use new carpet and fresh paint in the hallways though.The shuttle staff was very accommodating. My driver was super friendly and really funny actually. He had a lot of insights about the city as we drove around.I stayed here on a last minute business trip for a convention at the COBO center. It was really close to the convention hall and in a safe area. The room was really clean, comfortable and had everything you could need.  The bathroom was a little on the small side but since it was only me in the room it was fine. They have a small business center, free breakfast, pool, gym and free Wifi. The staff was excellent! The front desk staff was so friendly and accommodating. They really made it welcoming as soon as you walked in. The Valet staff was incredible! (Thank you Ricky...you ROCK!) I would definitely stay here again on my next trip.Very Helpful service. Nice pool. Great breakfast. Close walking distance to everywhere in Downtown Detroit. Great hotel with a Great price!Great location and customer service from the front desk!  The room was rather small but clean which is more important. Wi-fi was free but super slow, so I didn't even use it on my phone.   The shuttle was great and took us where we needed to go even though our guy backed into another car and told us that ""we didn't see or hear anything.""  We did have an excessively long wait for our car from the valet as we were told several times the car was on its way.  Then the last excuse we were told was that it was stuck in the elevator after waiting 40 minutes for our car.Great location, good price, and fine rooms. This place isn't a hotel of swanky light fixtures and old school glitz. It's a modern hotel with a modern ""I-bought-this-from-china"" feel. It's fine, but not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination. I stayed one night for business and was happy to be able to walk downtown (although I appeared to be alone in this endeavor), and was pleased with the complimentary shuttle service which will pretty much take you anywhere in the city for free. Hot breakfast was all the food I got before leaving town, and was pretty good. Beds were fine and I slept OK despite a strange noise comming from the pipes occasionally... Would do it again for business, although a little extra coin, as the other reviewers have noted, can put you in a VERY different environment.Stayed here on several occasions when on business in Detroit. I gave it 4 stars based on the hotel itself. Rooms are all very clean and modern and the staff is very friendly. There is a decent restaurant attached to the hotel but it is frequently packed as it seems to be the only place open at night in the area. Around the hotel is about what you would expect of downtown Detroit. There is not much of anything. Overall experience would be 3 stars but I'm not going to knock to hotel because of the town there in.",,,,"['holiday', 'inn', 'express', 'town', 'lions', 'game', 'issues', 'checking', 'checking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-fort-shelby-detroit,DoubleTree Suites by Hilton - Fort Shelby,3.5,$$,59,"When the highlight of your stay is that warm delicious cookie that all doubletrees supply you with, it's not saying much. My stay wasn't bad, and the amenities were quite nice, it just wasn't wonderful. We arrived Friday afternoon, and were told about the $25 dollar valet. Which didn't make much sense to me. Seeing how there is a much cheaper parking lot right next door, that you can park and take out yourself. And I'm not exaggerating, it's two connected to the building, right next to it. The room was nice and had a pull out sofa bed and a super plush bed. When I hit that bed later that night I was out. Sure, I had a lot to drink, but I can usually toss and turn. Here I was snugged away in dreamland. I realized when I was upstairs that one of the remotes were missing. I mentioned it when I came back in, and they told me they'd send someone right up. They never did. It wasn't until I got back that night when I called the front desk and they finally sent someone back up to give us another remote. The hotel looked beautiful. Nice decor. The place looked new. It was able to accommodate lots of people, most of which seemed like they were there for the Tigers game like us. The hotel is less expensive than some of the other hotels, more centered in the downtown area. I enjoyed my time at the downtown doubletree, it makes for a good option. Just make sure you have your remotes.We have stayed at this location twice.  Once for a Tigers game and then for the Kenny Chesney concert last week.  Both times we were extremely pleased with our stay.  The staff are friendly.  The rooms are huge and clean.  The Valet staff are efficient and the best thing is the cookie they give you.  Warm, gooey and delicious.The suites are very roomy. They offer a desk, love seat, TV, refrigerator, Microwave and coffee maker. The bathroom is spacious and comes with a tub, and shower as well as very nice soaps, and shampoos.The bed is firm and comfortable and the bedroom offers an additional TV.They have a great bar, restaurant and Starbucks coffee shop.It's in a nice location and is extremely close to the Joe, COBO Center, the People Mover, Channel 4 and a plethora of restaurants.Still a cool place to stay.  They changed the menu in the bar so I am not that wild about the new menu but not bad.I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Our room was spacious and clean. Starbucks in the lobby was handy. I do wish they had a little shop for amenities. Best perk was the shuttle to take us around town.I've stayed here a handful of times when coming to the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (now called Movement).  We typically stay in a 2 room suite which is the same price as a regular room at other hotels.  The room can comfortably sleep 6 with the pull out couch - which is actually quite comfortable for a pull out.  Having the 2 rooms is awesome in case some people want to sleep while others are still up in the living room.  The staff always friendly, and you get warm cookies when you check in.  Often times early check-in is available, but if not they will hold your bags.The breakfast buffet is really good.  They will give you to go containers if you are in a rush!  The bar side isn't as good though - overpriced and INCREDIBLY slow every time I have eaten there.  Last time the room had a weird smell, but other than that I have had no issues with the rooms.I stayed here during my first (and most recent) stay in Detroit since it offered a central downtown location at a reasonable price (I paid about 120$ per night, before taxes).  The DoubleTree is right by some public transit, including a bus that can potentially take you to/from the airport during certain times of the day, and the Fort Cass PeopleMover station.  There's a few restaurants nearby (but not many) so if you want to eat, you'll likely have to walk, cab, or PeopleMover it.  The hotel provides complimentary WiFi and chocolate chip cookie, and as a Hilton Gold member I was provided breakfast buffet vouchers. I can't attest to the buffet as I used my vouchers on the grab-and-go option at their cafe instead, which was decent.  One of the perks of this particular hotel is that they offer a free on-demand shuttle service within a 2-3 mile radius of the hotel.  I took the shuttle service to the DIA, so it was nice since I didn't have to walk there. The drivers can also pick you up and drop you off to another location if need be.The DoubleTree chain typically has very spacious rooms, and here they are suites style with separate living and sleeping areas, which is nice. I didn't score an upgrade here (not sure why) but I was still content with my room since it was very spacious for me as one person.  The bath amenities are from CrabTree &amp; Evelyn, which smell great.Okay so enough about the good things... One of the things that bothered me was my bath towels seemed a bit dirty since they had old blood stains. Granted I'm sure they've been cleaned and bleached many times, but seeing the stains kind of grossed me out.  I called housekeeping and asked for new towels, which were delivered to me promptly.Overall this hotel provides many great services at a reasonable price in a central/convenient location.  Even with the blood stain mishap, the DoubleTree was an overall above average experience.It's a doubletree so it does the job. The food is decent and the location is accommodating for work and personal purposes. Getting a cookie upon check in is pretty sweet.I loved it and the manager helped me with my issue. I'll definitely stay here againI love the royal treatment here at Double Tree.  Keera Akins was very pleasant and friendly during my stay here.  I was always greeted with a welcome smile.  Will definitely come back again for the next property investment.If I was staying for business or a baseball, football, or hockey game, this would get three stars, at best, for what it is. For leisure, I hate myself every time I have to book this place when the Westin is full and holiday rates go up yet somehow a room is always available here. Got me again Hilton. Keep the cookie and buy some wine bottle openers so I don't have to hear from the 'Care Line' that I need to come downstairs to open a bottle of wine because you only have one opener for the entire hotel. Weak.The suite we got was spacious and extremely clean. We reserved the 2 bedroom suite but Of course the Hilton gave away our room even though we had made reservation 5 days before.  We checked in around 6:30. The front desk guy showed no concerned and his response was ""we are busy and first come first serve"". Even though we made a reservation? He replied, ""yes""!  However I contacted Hilton through social media explained to them what happened and the room was free. The breakfast came with our room. It was typical hotel breakfast: eggs, juice, bacon, French toast, cereal. It was ok. The warm chocolate chip cookies were good.LOCATION:  On Lafayette near 1st street.  There aren't really any restaurants or stores close by.  There's a small gas station across the street and a dive bar around the corner.  There's a nice deli (open for lunch) a couple of blocks away.  The Fort/Cass people mover is about a block away.  There are a lot more food options on Woodward, which is about a 10 minute walk.  It's a little creepy at night when there's no one else around on the way there except maybe a bum.INSIDE THE HOTEL:  -BearClaw coffee shop in the lobby that is opened until 4pm.  Besides beverages, they sell oatmeal, granola bars, prepackaged sandwiches, salads, parfait, bagels, and pastries.  There's also a tiny section of medicine and toiletries, which is nice since the hotel doesn't have a gift shop.  I was hoping they might carry contact lens solution, but they don't.-Round Bar - The food here is pretty good and ""happy hour"" is excellent.  Happy hour is M-F 5p-7p, $3 draft, $4 house wine, $5 cocktails and appetizers (chicken wings, potato skins, sliders, zucchini sticks, and chicken quesadilla).  There's also a sushi menu, but the stuff I've tried weren't good at all.-Fin and Porter Restaurant - This is where breakfast is served and is right across from the Round Bar.  I tried having dinner here once, but they said they don't do dinner every day, so I never ate here.ROOMS:  Most are suites (separated living room area), but some are regular non-suites rooms.  Some rooms have a fridge and a microwave while others don't.PARKING:  There is no self-parking, only valet for $23/day.  There's a parking right next door that charges $10 for parking.If you have gold status or above at Hilton, then they will give you a breakfast voucher good for breakfast in their restaurant.  I asked for mine to go and they gave me a container to put stuff in.  The staff here are very nice and friendly.  The selection is decent - oatmeal, fruit, bagel, pastries, cereal, yogurt, sausage/bacon, and eggs.My boyfriend and I stayed for Tigers Opening Day weekend, and the hotel itself was very nice, but the service overall was BAD. The good: super quick wi-fi, nicely deocrated room, warm cookies upon arrival, lobby and elevator areas clean, room clean upon arrival. There is a mini fridge you can actually USE! The windows actually OPEN a few inches. The building itself is beautiful. The Round Bar has good beer on tap, but the food is way overpriced for what it is.So for the bad-The in room movie service did not work. We called the front desk but it wasn't able to be fixed. One of the telephones did not work. We also did not have our room cleaned during the stay. Worst -was the valet-it took 40 minutes to get our vehicle. We called the front desk and they said 20 minutes. We waited 30 before the staff realized no one had gone for the vehicle-then they asked me to find my keys. For 27.50 a night to park, this was really disappointing. Especially for Opening Day weekend of Tigers season! Definitley won't be back, nor would I reccommend this hotel to anyone because of the poor service. Housekeeping also banged on the door the day of checkout before 8 AM in the morning. Very poor service, again, for such a nice facility the level of service is a big letdown.Update: I sent a letter to their management explaining our stay. They wrote back about a month later and apologized and offered me a coupon for a free nights stay with free parking. It's now June, I have not seen anything in the mail from them.I liked this location because you are able to book corner suite rooms for the same amount of points as a normal room. During the second weekend in July, I was able to book a room for two nights for 30,000 points/night. Located right next to the Detroit Free Press, not far from where Detroit City FC plays at Cass Technical High School, and extremely close to the tunnel to Canada, the hotel location worked for us. You will need to rent a car though, and valet parking costs $25/night with in and out privileges (Sheraton Times Square NYC was $50/night, no in and out privileges). Hilton Diamond members receive a free, full breakfast and free wifi, which is nice. I really liked the suite which has a separate living room, bathroom, and bedroom. I liked how the bathroom is actually separate from the bedroom, not a part of the bedroom (like Residence Inns or Hyatt Houses). There was ample seating available, and if you have a third person, a third person could sleep on the pullout sofabed. Would I book here again? Probably. Customer service at the front desk was good, and the service at breakfast was decent enough. Sometimes they ran out of things for breakfast, but items will be re-supplied within ten minutes or less. Nothing bad happened during our stay, but nothing absolutely outstanding happened here either. Not bad!Not cheap.  The service was excellent.  We valet parked our car - $28.00.  The room was very nice compared to what we usually can afford.  We splurged this time.Starbucks in the hotel.   The hotel is downtown and close to everything. We opened our window as the room was at 68 degrees when we walked in.   There is a TV in the sitting area and also in the bedroom.   The sofa had that sickly sweet air freshener smell.I stayed here in 1971 when I got my physical for the Marine Corps.  It was quite different this time a round.  Duh.  Can't afford this luxury very often.   It's a definite step up from the usual ""Inn"".The place was neat. The staff was very nice. I only had one day when room service was not as great as it could've been. The morning buffet in the restaurant was excellent.  The room service staff was very very nice. The room service food was not great.Nice hotel in an up-and-coming part of Detroit. Parking can be a little sketchy unless you valet but you can find street parking (park at your own risk though).  The hotel's bar and restaurant is very good if you're dining in.  Boyfriend and I ordered room service, just appetizers and wine, and it took an hour for our food and wine to arrive. Other than that the hotel is nice and the staff very accommodating. The rooms have been redone and are all suites with a separate sleeping and living room area.Great location and comfortable spacious rooms! However, I was very disappointed with the front desk staff, minus one person, and the restaurant was ridiculously SLOW!We were actually visiting friends at the apartments.  The apartments are very nice inside.  They have a great view and in room laundry.  It comes with valet too which is a favorite of mine since parking downtown is a pain.  They also give you free cookies even if you are not in the hotel part!Everytime I come to downtown Detroit I come to the Double Tree.  Good rooms, service, and the bar is first rate.","Very clean building and nice staff. The check-in line was a little long so we got extra cookies and free valet. Only major snafu was the first set of keys we got were to a room already occupied - surprised us and the person in the room. Once we got that straightened out, it was smooth sailing.Hotels come in many shapes and sizes, sometimes you get a really tiny European sized room, sometimes you get a really spacious hotel room that is clean and tastefully decorated.  Double Tree-Fort Shelby was the latter.   I booked a Double Queen Suite and it was only $119 (not including taxes and fees)!! We had a bedroom separate from the living room and kitchen, two TVs, Comfy beds, free wifi and tons of space!!! The front desk people were kind and very helpful and it really just set the mood for our stay here. Next time I visit Detroit I am definitely staying hereLocation only would be good. Room was gross, staff nasty &amp; rude, specifically suited male bartender. Karrie wouldn't review room after requested, requested multiple times. Specifically asked to visit room. She was ""manager"" on duty. Hilton, get some standards!!! So disappointed and would not recommend. Really, you cannot view room???? Just inspect and do your job!! Terrible management. Hair in sink, hair in bed, toilet seat up and dirty, walls at floors dirty as wow. Before booking next time, check for management and department head changes. Really liked hotel before. Poor Hilton :(We were in Detroit to attend a weekend of Tigers baseball . I knew this property was older but had a makeover . Checkin was quick and the staff in the valet area were helpful with directions . Our room was ready and clean the suite concept is a nice feature and allowed me to sleep in . They offer a shuttle to almost anywhere downtown . The round bar has a nice selection of both local and national  beers .  Service was  ok since only one server was on duty .  For the price $ 113.00  plus assorted taxes and parking fee of $ 25.00 was not all that bad .  If we got a good rate I would consider staying at this property again . Just keep in mind this hotel is a bit removed from the action . However a short ride to Greektown  and the Woodward Avenue strip .Large, clean suite room upgrade for being a loyal hhonors member! Room service was great- Mike took our order, brought it up to us, and helped us clear the table for the tray! The food was great, and Mike got us extra salad dressing from the kitchen! We were on the tenth floor. Elevators are clean and fast, and there is a deli/Starbucks in the lobby. Gave each of us TWO cookies-at the front desk and Mike brought us some. Beds comfortable, sofa clean and soft, two free water bottles upon checkin, and extremely soft tap water. Only downsides were a sketchy parking lot, and that the HVAC system takes a long time. Good view of the downtown Detroit skyline, and a good shuttle service.The ladies up front couldn't be nicer or more welcoming. The gym is great too. Room service didn't speak English well and messed up my order completely. The food didn't taste too good either. The breakfast buffet was out of eggs and fruit and never was replenished even after several requests.Unexpected spaciousness.  Nicely appointed. Odd things, like you can use the refrigerator or microwave, but both cannot be plugged in to the only available outlet at the same time.   The maid knocked at 8:40 am EST, not outrageous, but I am still 3 hours behind on Pacific time. I wave at her and point at my room as I leave for work a short time later. Tonight-- room not serviced-- not a real problem, I just wanted to coffee to be re supplied! Forget the restaurant. Cold potatoes, veggies that tasted like a dirty grill. Only when the manager asked  if I had been taken care of, did a waiter surface--25 minutes of waiting. Nice space, potential...poorly managed.My company always gets us a block of rooms at this hotel each year for the auto show. It is definitely one of the more spacious rooms that I have ever stayed in. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the lack to detail when it comes to cleaning.I booked a hotel room at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> for this hotel in February. A week before my arrival back home in Detroit, I called to confirm my reservations. I was told by the none too helpful clerk in this unmistakable dry tone, that they did not have a reservation for me. He seemed unconcerned and was 100% unhelpful. His only response was for me to call <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a>.I called <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> who informed be that Double Tree Suites had received the reservation 3 months ago but decided to overbook the hotel and ignore my reservation. UNBELIEVABLE!I'm glad that I took the time to confirm my reservation a week before arrival because if I had arrived at the time of my reservation and told this $#!+ I would have been  up a creek without a paddle.I love my hometown and only want the best for it and the businesses that serve the City, but this kind of service speaks poorly to how the City is run overall. What better way to say ""stay away"" than to have hotels that don't honor reservations to visitors. Absurd and ridiculous!So buyers beware of Double Tree Suites in Detroit and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a>. Additionally, I would like to applaud them for their very unprofessional and uncouth behaviour and award both of them the Knucklehead Award [in my best British accent!]DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I have been here for two weeks now staying for the Detroit Autoshow I am working. Last night one of the girls on my team had a man come into her room when she was sleeping. She had her bedroom door closed and was scared so she didn't come out of her room. When she finally did she found that her purse and jacket had been stolen. She didn't have anyone staying with her and nobody else had a key. You can't get a key from the front desk unless you show a picture ID so IT HAD TO BE A STAFF MEMBER WHO CAME INTO THE ROOM AND STOLE HER ITEMS. The hotel is trying to blame it on her saying she must have dropped her key somewhere. Not the case! She didn't have another key and even if she did they don't have their room numbers on the keys.Word spread pretty fast about what had happened as people who work in the autoshow are a tight knit group. At work today we had another woman come up to us from another brand and tell us she HAS HAD A MAN COME INTO HER ROOM UNANNOUNCED LATE AT NIGHT TWICE!!! This happened once two years ago which the hotel tried to explain away by saying she called for her room to be serviced at 11:30pm (which she didn't and is ridiculous either way) and then she had it happen again on this trip!! Again the hotel is explaining it away by saying he was delivering towels at 9:00 at night. The funny thing is she said he didn't have any towels.Something fishy is going on at this hotel. We won't be staying here another year to find out. If you're unlucky enough to have to stay here make good use of your safe!!!Class all the way! We went here for cocktails and dessert after dinner at nearby Harbor House at the suggestion of a friend. It was the perfect nightcap. So clean you can eat off the floor, front door valet, beautiful architecture, fun, upbeat Motown classics playing, our bartender David was brilliant! He made those drinks with love and was impeccably dressed. The desserts were simple, yet decadent. If you're in the downtown Detroit area do come inside from out the cold and eat, drink and unwind.So I was walking barefoot in my hotel room - HUGE MISTAKE.  They had exposed wood from pulled back carpet with staples/nails sticking out and it sliced into my foot  which is bleeding as we speak.  Mike from the front desk came up after I called and all he said was, ""Do you want to change rooms?""  No big apologies, nothing.  Nevermind that a nail from your hotel went into my foot.  I can barely walk right now, let alone pack everything up and haul it to a different room.  I asked if they had a rug or mat or anything to place over this as it is an extreme safety hazard.  He said maintenance would take care of it and left.  I'm still waiting for someone to fix this.Really nice hotel, prices are reasonable too! The bathroom was huge and the entire hotel was very clean.Don't have any expectations and you won't be disappointed. Staff makes promises they won't keep.I stayed here for two weeks for Detroit auto show. I called very far in advance to request a double suite and was promised I'd have one along with a microwave. Neither of these things happened upon check out. One week into my stay I was able to transfer into my double room.The valet is beyond horrible and rude. Give yourself about an hour waiting for your car. I think there are much better hotels in Detroit!Liked the hotel. Had a pretty cool view. If you're from out of town the picture to me was kind of misleading. I thought we were gonna have awesome views of Detroit but the highest floor is 10 the condos next door or whatever must be 20+... Anyway room worked out well for NYE.Nice hotel. Big rooms. Decent customer service. Nice location. Good price. Would stay here again! Never received our cookies though :(I stayed at the double tree down town Detroit for almost 2 weeks for business. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel, as they were not very accomidating to the business patron. Below is what I would consider the pros and cons of this establishment.Pros:Large rooms, the hotel was kept clean and the rooms had nice general ammenidies including a fridge, coffee maker ect.Staff was generally pleasant and waitstaff in the connected restaurant were attentive and very quick to fufill orders.Price of the hotel rooms themselves were resonable.Cons:Price to park a vehicle was around 22.00 a day, in Detroit that's high and fairly unresonable, consitering the cars parked are placed in an abandoned non gated parking lot across the street. Also 22.00$ pays for property taxes for the year down town Detroit.The room during my stay faced a parking structure that apparently makes frequent high pitch beeping sounds everytime a car drives in or out even at 4am.At a lengthy stay of several weeks a incicidental fund associated with a credit card can rack up quite a hefty bill even when you don't use incidentals. The front desk staff was almost hostile to the idea of a cash deposit and totally unwilling to work out an alternative or to accomodate a more resonable deposit, needless to say if you plan to stay several weeks, bring a card with a few thousand dollar credit limit.A shuttle service does exist, which is a nice gesture but is almost always unavailable or out on a run. The one shuttle I did manage to secure left me stranded at mgm casino when I scheduled a return to the hotel. After waiting 45 mins past the pick up time I decided to call them. They told me the driver attempted the pick up awhile ago but went to a secondary entrance. After another 30 mins the shuttle arrived at the scheduled pick up location.On my last day before departing I asked if I could have an additional hour before checking out, since my flight home was delayed an hour as well. The staff explained ""they don't do that"". The staff also went into detail about the policy and made no effort to be tactful about the situation.Needless to say, they do not meet the needs or accomodation that is required with traveling guests, the staff at any point of request to identify with the needs of a customer came up very short. The staff loved to use the term ""its our policy"" when it was anything to do with going above and beyond. Travel and business pros alike know traveling can be draining, its places like this that make it that much harder, leave you more tired, and drain you that much quicker.I had never been to Detroit before.   I didn't do much research before I got there since the primary purpose of my trip was to see Muse.  I made the drive in like three and a half hours and stayed at the Doubletree downtown.  There is nothing to brag about as far as the room goes,  but it seemed as the hotel was an excellent value.  It was within walking distance of the Joe Louis Arena where the concert.  Whenever I am planning on going to sporting events or concerts I usually try to get a hotel within walking distance of the venue, so I can save on parking.  In this case it worked to my detriment since parking was pretty cheap almost everywhere.  Still I liked the security that the valet parking of the hotel offered.My wife and I, along with some friends spent the weekend in Detroit for the Fall Beer Festival. We left this hotel with mixed feelings.  From the $15/pp breakfast buffet (we've had better selections AND better food elsewhere for free) at the onsite restaurant to the questionable valet fee where our friends were told to run across the street and get their vehicle, one can't help but wonder was it worth the savings over staying at some of the other nicer choices in town.  It's not bad, trust me, I've seen worse, but I can't say we would stay here again.Had great time here, albeit for one night.  The front desk was very accommodating to us, and the room was large, and had nice view.  Was short walk to Comerica, so location was good, too.  Staff was great in brining up extra towels and such.  Only negative is I wish they had pool, and were closer to Greektown.  Outside of that was a great stay.","Traveled to Detroit for a baseball game and the hotel was a preferred hotel of one my vendors.  It is also either a quick walk (1/2 mile from the Comerica and Ford Field) or a ride on the people mover at the Fort/Cass stop (75 cents each way).  I'd recommend using the people mover since a stop is right around the corner from the hotel.Valet was hectic as a lot of people were checking in but simple enough.  Unsure if there is street parking available as I am not familiar with Detroit's night time parking laws.  The hotel itself has two restaurants and a little cafe that I did eat at or use.  Check in was easy and they gave us plenty of fresh chocolate chip oatmeal raisin cookies.We had a 1 king bed suite with separate seating area.  Had 2 flat screens, a pull out sofa, and free Wi-FI.  View was of a secured parking lot but not where they parked my car.Check out was just as easy (I did mine on the TV) but they did charge me for parking when it was suppose to be included in the parking.For $99 for the night, you couldn't beat the price, quality, service, and location.I travel for my job so I have stayed at my fair share of hotels and I have to say that one of the main reasons I enjoy coming back to Detroit is because of this hotel.  Okay it's not the most modern or glamorous but the service is amazing.  The staff, from the front desk to the hotel restaurant are always pleasant and accommodating.  It doesn't matter if they are working the morning, mid, swing or night shift.  You get warm delicious chocolate chip cookies when you check in and throughout your stay if you ask nicely.  I requested a microwave, fridge and corner room ahead of time and actually got all three.  Amazing!  The rooms are spacious enough.  You have a separate bedroom and a living room space.  Even though it's not located near other restaurants, it doesn't matter cause the hotel's Finn &amp; Porter Round Bar is awesome!!!  The service is friendly and the food is sooo good.  Try the Roasted Chicken or the White Fish.  Even the chicken tenders are good.  You can also get a made to order fresh salad for like $6 for lunch.I definitely recommend this Doubletree if you're headed to convention center cause its a short walk!The hotel is typical for a Doubletree.  Rooms are nice and large. The breakfast you get as a Diamond member is just continental and doesn't include hot items.  Many other Doubletree's will give you a full breakfast, including hot breakfast, so this was a little disappointing.The one thing that was really annoying is they don't have self parking.  Valet is $23 and I had to wait 10+ minutes for my car.  With all the local parking lots in the area, they can definitely make a deal with one of the lots for guests to self park overnight.  It's one thing for a high, upscale hotel to only offer valet, but a hotel like this needs to offer self parking, in my opinion.  I will not be back unless they begin to offer self parking.The hubs and I stay at this hotel EVERY time we head downtown! We've always had great rooms, fantastic service and who doesn't like the warm chocolate chip cookies you are given when you check in?! Very close to a people mover station and is a pretty easy walk to get downtown.Our stay at the Doubletree was not without a few glitches, but the important stuff was outstanding.  The people, from check in to valet to wait staff, were friendly and attentive.  The room was very clean, big, and the bathroom was huge.  I would not hesitate to stay here again, but there could be some improvements.  Housekeeping never showed up to clean our room, which was no big deal, but we had to ask for new towels and then it took several hours for them to show up.  The wifi dropped connections a few times, and one of the TVs had to be fixed.  The food in the Round Bar was good, but it took forever to appear.  The server was attentive, but it took 25 minutes to get a sandwich when the bar was empty.  That evening the appetizers during happy hour also took 30 minutes to show up.  Breakfast is not included, and that would have been appreciated.I stayed here during the Movement music festival, and for the price we paid, I think it's a great value. The location is convenient to Hart Plaza and the ball park.  The hotel has many suites which have living room and bedroom separated, with a sleeper sofa in the living room, so there is plenty of space for a family or group of friends.  There is also a microwave and mini fridge so you can keep some food items in your room.  Everything was very clean when we checked in, and due to our fault (leaving the privacy sign out), our room did not get serviced every day; despite that, housekeeping checked in with us to make sure we had clean towels.  On the night we arrived, there was a problem with the air conditioning in the room.  The first person they sent to fix it did not get it working, but the next person I spoke to fixed the problem quickly and even gave me a number to reach him should we have any more problems. (Fortunately no further issues).  I have to say that even though I stayed there during a festival, when the majority of the guests were there for a festival and seemed to be partying at all hours of the night, when inside my room, there was no noise.  So the sound proving for rooms seems to be very good.Had a two room suite, rooms were nothing fancy. Clean, spacious, but isn't that what's expected? The best part about staying here were the chocolate chip cookies, reminded me of the ones they used to sell in the tins at Jacobson's. Am I showing my age by talking about Jacobson's? LoL Brunch on Sundays with the bottomless mimosas left me stumbling to my room. The biscuits and gravy were phenomenal!This hotel rocks.  My friend and I purchased our rooms on Hotwire:  $87 + tax.  Each of us got a 1 bedroom suite.  Our suites each contained a fluffy King-sized bed with two flat screen TVs.  The cool bathroom had long, soft towels and even the in room coffee service was pretty delicious.Lots of amenities contained in this hotel.  The ""Round Bar"" is a sports bar off the main lobby that's open until midnight.  There's a coffee shop serving espresso right off the front desk as well.  There's also a pretty rockin' Fitness Center on the 4th floor with all your favorite Precor cardio machines as well as a cable station and free weights &amp; dumbells.  Pretty frickin' decent.$20 bucks per night to park -- that sucks.  But you're NOT gonna want to park in the street in this neighborhood, so suck it up.All-in-all a great value for a modest price.Spacious rooms. Very clean rooms. I'm an annoying about clean hotel rooms, and this one definitely passed the test. Great televisions so my whacked out mother could watch the Casey Anthony trial all day long and I could imagine Casey's attorney, Jose Baez, running his ginormous hands through my hair. Hate all you want on Detroit. I really love it. For realz. I do. This hotel is in a great location if you're going a Tigers game, going ghetto gambling or having dinner in Greektown. The parking situation is kind of weird on the street outside, so make sure to read the signs before parking for the night.The valets/doormen sucked though. They just stood there while my lovely mother struggled with her luggage. Shame on them for not having good manners. Other than that, I had no problems with this hotel. Oh, and for those of you who are super freak dog mommas, this hotel is pet friendly.this place stands alone, every thing from the rooms, to the gift bag you get when you arive.the food is awsome. and the bar is to die forGreat place.  Excellent value.I would like to relay some of my grievances I have with my recent stay at the Doubletree Hilton in Detroit during the days of 28-30 May.  We stayed in a double bed suite for ~$250/night, valet and taxes included.Beginning with our check-in, the hotel did not have our room ready as it was being cleaned.  We understood these things happen during holiday weekends, and we waited at the lobby bar for over an hour after being told it would be ready in 20-30 minutes.  Our luggage and electronic gear had already been unloaded from our vehicle by valet, and I requested that it be stored in a secure location until our room was available.  I returned to the front desk 45 minutes later to find it sitting in the lobby, unsecured and not readily viewable from the front desk.  After checking into our room, we found the windows closed, the air conditioning off and balmy 86F.  We ran the a/c for the next 24 hours, but with tepid results.  Thankfully we paid extra $50 for the corner suite, the extra square footage in a super 10ft wide hallway, a view of an abandoned office building, and no cross breeze.Around 8am every morning, the cleaning staff on our floor began checking rooms.  This procedure involved opening and closing many doors, which I understand completely.  However, the hydraulic units on each door are either not properly installed, or rated for a different door as they slam shut during the last 12-18"" of closing.  It was impossible to sleep during this time period.Other minor problems with our stay included:-only decaf coffee, sweet!-the coffee machine does not have a plug available within reach without moving the table or maker - thankfully it was on wheels, someone is thinking!-late check-out was 30 minutes or 1230pm -230pm checkout was an option if we paid half the cost of the room was an absurd option after waiting an extra hour to get in-valet parking was in an unsecured lot across the street, which I was assured while booking, the parking would be in a secured covered parking areaOn 01 June, I was charged an additional $310.70, and an additional $10 in separate charges to my credit card for unknown reasons.  I contacted Paul, a manager at the Doubletree Hilton in Detroit with my concerns, and was told I would receive a call back from a financial manager.  These additional charges have not been explained.  I called Hilton corporate and the Doubletree in Detroit for over a week every other day, and finally had the charges reversed.  I am reassured the speedy reversal in 2-5 business days.I would like to compliment the doormen, valet, and bellhop, as their service and demeanor was pleasant and extremely helpful during our stay in Detroit. I highly recommend staying at the Westin Book Cadillac two blocks away.  The only reason I stayed at the Doubletree was the double-suite availability.  I'd rather sleep in my car under the Ambassador bridge than stay here again.This brand new hotel in downtown Detroit just opened in December of 2008. I stayed there on the Tiger's opening day and was more than impressed! It is a beautiful hotel! The rooms are set up like suites featuring a separate room for the beds and a sitting room with a pullout couch. Perfect for multiple people crashing in one room. It's a little off the beaten path but it's really not that far of a walk from central downtown and there are People Mover stations easily accessible to get to sporting events, Greektown, etc. The best part? The fresh baked cookies upon arrival. Even at 2 AM after a full day of celebrating, we were treated to warm chocolate chip goodness!! I would definitely stay here again!!!This is a solid hotel with a great rate (when compared to other Hilton/Marriott options) downtown. Also worth noting: great breakfast buffet, free local shuttle and really impressive service from the front desk and restaurant staff - would absolutely recommend staying here.There are a few things that I normally shake my fist at in hotels - most notable are the lack of cream to go with the in-room coffee (no, an envelope of powdered Cremora doesn't count), and the lack of hair conditioner to go with the shampoo.  Here, two little individual real cream creamers were placed next to the coffee (perfect to sip with the welcome cookie).  The bathroom amenities were better than those found at most hotels, and included not only conditioner, but a Neutrogena day moisturizer with sunscreen (Patrick Bateman would be pleased, as was I) and actual facial cleanser in addition to typical bar soap.  The shower was nice, clean, and spacious enough for two, with sliding glass doors.  The room was a two-room set-up with one bedroom as well as a sitting area, with a fold out couch and desk.  Both rooms had flat screen tvs.  Bedding was extremely comfortable and dreamy to sleep on, and I most appreciated the modern decor and lack of ""party prints"" on any of the upholstery.   The Jacobean flourish carpet pattern in salt fork tan and espresso brown may seem like a laugh a few trend cycles into the future, but for now is suitably au courant in a hotel that is so far doing a good job of keeping itself sparkly in a city where other buildings are rapidly in decline.  This building was recently renovated - My boyfriend, a Detroit native, used to pass before it's renovation, and he thought it was a great turnaround.  The lobby is really beautiful with a marble staircase and stylish furniture.  I did not use the exercise room, but peeked in and it looked nice and well-stocked.  Only saw two people using it over the course of our two day stay.  All staff members were very friendly, and this hotel would be a deal at twice the price.  The only reasons I didn't give five stars: the view (or lack thereof), and the parking situation.  Valet parking is practically mandatory as there is no self park.  The valets were quick and friendly, but it was disappointing to notice as we left that the car had been kept in an unfenced lot right across the street.  Any other hotel where I have used valet has been underground or in a garage.  Our view was of another building, which would not be so bad if it had not been an abandoned (and perhaps soon to be demolished) building, which meant that the view was actually of an inexplicable collection of copy paper reams, old newspapers, an overturned orange cart, and pigeons.  Que sera sera... while the walls of the room featured classic Detroit-representational art (Fox Theatre, etc.), out our window was quintessential modern Detroit.  The best of both worlds.Fresh warm cookies on check in, prompt service, and stylishly comfortable suites  (even the pull-out sofa beds are comfy!) make the stay here memorable. I loved staying here and it's the best deal for hotels in the downtown area -- it cost $30 more for a standard room at the Courtyard Marriott, which is situated a mile away, versus a whole suite here. It's a beautiful hotel with a clean, airy lounge/restaurant downstairs, free Wi-Fi and big, fluffy towels. Had no complaints and would definitely stay here again.Excellent service.  Clean, large room with sitting area in addition to bedroom.  Good thermostat and as a plus the windows actually open, something that you dont always see in hotels anymore.  Close to people mover.  Take it to Greek town if you're looking for bar scene outside of the Anchor Bar just down the street.Amazing cookies. Very nice hotel room with shampoo+ conditioner that fill up everyday! And nice blowdryer too. And beds. Super comfortable beds. Great service and very convenient dt locationAmazing hotel, right in the heart of downtown Detroit. Beautiful rooms, great service, perfect for more than one night! A real treat! Wish we could've stayed longer.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-henry-autograph-collection-dearborn-4,"The Henry, Autograph Collection",4.0,$$$,64,"One of the best hotels in the area. I stayed here for almost a week and I really loved it. The room: I stayed in a suite and it was clean, large, comfortable, and overall very pleasant to stay in. The bathroom was huge and the sitting area was separated from the bedroom by a pair of doors. The decoration of the room was simple and modern. For me the most important part of a hotel experience is the cleanliness and The Henry really shinned here. There was no dust, and no stains on the couches or sheets.The food: The room service was surprisingly delicious. The grilled cheese sandwich had a generous amount of cheese that was melted well and paired with a tasty tomato dipping sauce. The souffle was also delightful and really satisfied my sweet tooth. The service: everyone was kind and courteous and very willing to help. The rooms were always kept very clean, and the room service always arrived in a very timely fashion. This was some of the best service I've ever received during a hotel stay. The lobby is also pretty cool. They have tons of art on the walls that I believe are actually for sale.I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in or around the Dearborn area.My work team stayed at the Henry for a few weeks for a project in Detroit and was certainly one of the nicer hotels we've stayed at. Beautiful decor and very clean; our rooms were spacious and the service was great. They had a concierge lounge open for platinum members, so my team and I would re-group after the day with cocktails and free appetizers / desserts. The surrounding areas of the hotel weren't the best, but it's not like we were walking around at night. All in all, very comfortable stay and we will definitely be returning again in the future - Best,CharlieI've stayed at this hotel a few times for a nice parents getaway. We really enjoy the restaurant inside the hotel that is mostly the reason we stay. This last trip we enjoyed the spa facilities. The pool is nice along with the spa pool. My only complaint is that it would have been nice if they had lockers for your clothes. The staff at this hotel really go out of their way to make you feel like a VIP. They keep the same employees so you see a lot  of familiar faces when you come and to me that says a lot about the way the hotel is ran. The food in the restaurant is always changing and is absolutely delicious .The chef  really takes great pride in the menu and food quality. This would be a great venue for a wedding or event. We have also enjoyed the Mother's Day brunch this past year which was phenomenal.Super swanky hotel. I mean, really swanky. High ceilings, crown molding, sparkling chandeliers and wall art renders this spot a luxurious feel for an affordable price. Stay here if you come to Detroit. You'll be 20-30 minutes to anywhere.Rooms are comfortable and the linens are fantastic. Fluffy! Makes you want to just plop on the bed and take a nap. Well, we didn't eat at the restaurant so I can't comment on the food here. But it did seem pricey like your typical marked-up-for-the service hotel. I do have to say, though, I really enjoyed the art on the walls. It is so full of color and texture. Just a really nice touch. 2 out of 3 computers weren't working in the business center. Bummer. (my station felt like it was operating on internet speed from 1998). And I only wish there was an outdoor courtyard or dining area. This would have been such a great bonus on our recent trip during the 4th of July. Would have been perfect for watching fireworks. Instead, we had some really great service on July 4th. The bartender opened our bottle of wine when we forgot our bottle opener. And the front desk agent gave us access to the 10th floor exclusive lounge where we watched fireworks late at night - complete with a panoramic view of the Detroit skyline and ambassador bridge.I'm really impressed with the service and the luxurious vibe here. Just get that internet crankin' up and point me to the outdoor patio area, okay?I finally found a place I can call home when I'm visiting Detriot! First, it's close enough to the airport. I love the actual hotel location as there is plenty to do right around it with decent food and shopping options. Second, it's an old Ritz, and a new autograph. It's just has a classy feel with excellent service. The rooms are very comfortable with a decent sized bathroom. The bed was excellent with different options of pillows! They have 24 hour room service which is so nice when you get in late. I love the art... It's everywhere and they give art tours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The gym is pretty big and has plenty of equipment which is always a plus!There is self park and valet options. The bar and restaurant Tria is a great option! By far the best place I have stayed while working in Detroit!Its a nice hotel , it has this old nice touch to it. I love every single minute i spend there, the room service was fast and amazing. I asked for a bottle opener and I got within a minute, literally. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel is the valet service. I parked at the main entrance and waited for someone to get out and take my car, but no one did. I looked around to see if im at the right entrance, i was. I actually parked really close to the sign that says valet parking. After a while i got a little bit sick of waiting so i took it to myself to park my car behind the hotel. The weather was really cold. And I would give the hotel five stars but maybe next time.This was my first visit back here since it changed names, from the Ritz Carlton.  I still love this property!  Rooms are very nice, staff is incredible.  I went to celebrate an anniversary with my husband and we had dinner there as well.  It is a great get away for locals who want to spend a nice evening at a nice hotel.  However, I am sad the surrounding area isn't what it once was.  I am not sure there is much to offer outside of the hotel itself.I'm back and how much I love this hotel. I found long hair on the shower wall, no in the shower, literally on the shower wall. I wouldn't expect this from a hotel where I spend my hard earned at. (Over $200 a night..)Great hotel with impressive art. Very nicely appointed and with many nice touches. A step above the Ritz Carlton level consistent with the Autograph Collection feel. Definitely worth staying in Dearborn rather than downtown Detroit.   Would definitely recommend to friends.Great hotel, staff was incredible, parking was a little bit tough as space is limited for self parking. They do offer valet service, but didn't catch the price.Beautiful art gallery inside with many different types of art. Many are for sale too. Concierge lounge was nice and attendant was very pleasant. Seemed fairly busy most of the times I visited. Loved the snacks available, nice to take back to your room.Located right off the highway, but not many restaurants nearby. They do have a restaurant on site, but didn't try it. Did have room service one night and pizza was good and hot. Close to some of the attractions, but unfortunately I was here for business. I hope to stay here again in the future.The art in the lobby is a major plus! Reasonably close to the airport, free parking, easy to get in and out of...would stay again.What an absolutley beautiful hotel, but beauty isn't only skin deep.The beauty of the hotel is it's decor and rooms. My daughter and some of her wedding party stayed here the night before her big day and their wedding night. The location was close to the church. The room they stayed in was huge with a separate living/meeting with a half bath area and separate bedroom with it's own bathroom. The bedroom area was spaceous and the bathroom huge. Very clean roomsand well stocked with amenities!There are two things that make wedding pictures sing out beauty and quality. The first is the photographer(sorry Henry) and the second is the location/background(Yeah, Henry). The background for photographs are outstanding whether in the room, lobby, hallway, outside or just about anywhere as eveidenced by other reviewers. Instead of a lot more pictures at the church the party decided to go back here for additional pictures. They came out great!Now for the ""not skin only deep"" part. The staff was outsatnding opening with the concierge. He was quite helpful in manyways. The reception desk staff, outstanding. Everywhere we went the staff all had smiles and a friendly welcome.One more daughter, one more wedding. I think I'll start my wedding affairs here first. Anybody coming in to town whether friends or business I will recommend this hotel. They won't be dissapointed.A little overrated.  Bar is always very loud. Rooms are normal. Breakfast is expensive.Stayed at The Henry last week for the first time in my many trips to Dearborn. This was a quick utility stop when my business trip got extended by a day; I checked out at 5AM after a one night stay. Very friendly front desk staff. Rooms are bigger than usual for a Marriott property. Comfortable beds. Artwork everywhere. The Tria restaurant is very good if pricey.Nicely appointed bathroom with quality products.This property has something of a reputation for not posting your Marriott Rewards points - I've seen reports that you actually have to request posting of points to your account. I hope that's wrong, but 8 days after my stay and my points/stay haven't posted.I prefer the Dearborn Inn - which is one of my favorite hotels and favorite Marriott properties anywhere, but if they're full, as seems to often be the case, this will likely be my go-to Dearborn hotel.+ Very comfortable room, flawless internet, outstanding service, nice restaurant-  Self Parking Lot can be a long cold walk when it's fullIt's now a year later and this hotel has improved on everything I previously mentioned in my last review.  I stayed here for the Detroit auto show this past weekend and it could not have been better. The room had a nice view of the city, it was quiet, had a mini fridge, thick bed comforters, internet download speeds that were super fast for a hotel (7+ Mbps), a heating system working perfectly, and the TRIA restaurant that was wonderful for breakfast.  They offer a nice breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, various fruits, high quality breads, and a station for preparing you a custom omelette).  Along with the hallways of the hotel, the inside of the restaurant has various artwork throughout and is connected to a waiting room with a classic piano.  A very nice touch.The only downside of the hotel relates to the location of the self parking lot.  It's a bit of a walk from the lot to the front entrance at peak periods, and feels even longer when it's super cold out.  But, there is a valet service which solves that issue if you really don't want to walk.  Other than that, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Detroit / Dearborn area.  Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby, and it being right near the highway, makes it especially convenient.  And I have to say, all the staff at the hotel, from the front desk (hats off to Domingo!) to all the restaurant servers, were just outstanding.  They were always smiling, chatting with you, promptly providing you with what you needed, making you feel right at home.  It's rare to find a hotel which exceeds in so many areas and I certainly look forward to my next stay at this 5 star facility!My husband and I had our wedding reception here (15 years ago) when it was still a Ritz-Carlton, so when we were invited to an event here, we of course agreed!The interior has been completely renovated and is more upscale modern than before, as it is now owned by Marriott. The event was a charity benefit with a ""strolling dinner"". This just translates to ""schlep all over the room to stand in line at different buffets"". The food was very good, especially for buffet, but logistically was a nightmare - lines were long, each buffet station had different items, so if you wanted to try everything, you were going to be there a while. There was not a lot of opportunity to visit with your table since everyone was at different stations and coming back and eating at different times - my husband and I stayed together in the lines just so that we would not be sitting at the table eating alone while everyone else was in a line somewhere.When I pulled up to a handsome man in a top hat I knew this was going to be a spectacular experience. I stayed here years ago when it was the Ritz Carlton and was sad to see it was now The Henry. Fortunately, the Henry left a lasting impression during my visit. This is my kind of hotel. It's posh and luxurious. If you loved the Henry when it was the Ritz, you will love this hotel just the same.Loved my bed, it was extremely comfortable. My view, as always, was wonderful. Nice contemporary decor and updated amenities. The workout facility is a joke. I believe there were two, maybe three treadmills and one eliptical machine. The univeral weight system seemed only slightly big enough to accomodate 1 1/2 people. They really need to consider renovating the workout facility. Many travelers take great pride in continuing their workout while away from home. When there are so many hotels to choose from, many travelers, myself included, will often opt for the hotel with the better workout facility. Fortunately, I am a Marriott snob and the Henry Autograph Collection is supreme. So, I opted to work with the minimal workout offerings.The best part about my stay was the magnificent Concierge Lounge located on the 10th floor. Unlike most Marriott Concierge Lounges, the Henry offered what seemed to be the entire floor dedicated for Concierge service. You literally walk off of the elevator directly into the Concierge Lounge. There are always wonderful offerings throughout the day. Absolutely splended. The Renaissance Downtown Marriott should definitely take note. Their Concierge Lounge lacked in so many ways.I will definitely return.Hotel pretends to be more than it is. Overrated art adorns the lobbies (although there are a few paintings by real masters). Staff is attentive. Rooms are adequate but not luxurious. Wifi works as it should. Bed comfortable. Bedrooms not well appointed, but large. Conference rooms well below average. Food is very good but overpriced. Overall some pluses and some negatives. But compared to the hype not so great.Ok so this hotel is amazing. I love the art I love the executive lounge and the rooms are large and have all amenities.The Henry is wonderful. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful; during our stay, we noted that we didn't encounter a single staff-member that didn't smile at us. The artwork is also such a beautiful feature. All the amenities that The Henry offers are just notably all-around great. Our room was on the 8th floor, we weren't too excited to be able to look into the offices directly across the way. That said, it didn't interfere with our overall experience - the hotel was BEAUTIFUL, we loved our room. It was spacious and comfortable. We also really enjoyed their restaurant, Tria. We just had such a wondeful experience, this Marriott location has really earned their name. We cannot wait to return.","This is one of the best business destination hotels I've ever stayed at. I've stayed at The Henry Hotel over a dozen times in the past year and half for business. It's absolutely beautiful from the lobby to the bedrooms; the photos don't do it justice. The staff and service is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, professional and on their game. They don't have high turnover, so I got to know several of the staff through my stays. The food is delicious; definitely not cheap price-wise but not the absolute most expensive either. The chef knows how to create delicious and engaging meals that satisfy. I was forced to stay at another hotel nearby when The Henry was booked and the differences were alarming. It showed me that The Henry is well-priced (food was worse and more expensive at the other hotel), clean (the other hotel was dirty and items in the room were broken), and has amazing staff and customer service (the other hotel staff were rude and there was no customer service present). Do yourself a favor and unwind from the day's work here. You won't be sorry.Beautiful hotel; the friendly staff was very courteous and helpful and my room was very clean, well stocked and comfortable.  I especially enjoy the feather pillows!  However no breakfast buffet and the only option for miles is the Tria buffet which is grossly overpriced and not worth $23!  Also, the pool was closed ""for renovations"" The  worse thing for me was the fan located in the bathrooms; they run continually and there is no way to turn them off.  Also, the room doors are so heavily made that they tend to get away from you and slam really loud.This is a really nice, swanky hotel. They overdo it a little with the art (it's seriously everywhere - front desk, lobby, hallways, your room) but they're all nice pieces and I think they're on display for sale anyway.If you have the points.. the 10th floor breakfast is great! Real classy, real silverware, just a couple hot options (eggs, toast) but plenty overall (cold cereal, lots of drinks, pastries, muesli). <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oA-lysXZ3dXslIf2M6Kc2w?select=vF-caqtaTr-0pV01CbJKpA#stRWr304sXEBWa8Q2hDkFA"">yelp.com/biz_photos/oA-l...</a>There were just some logistical stuff they messed up on, which was fairly easily fixed. A big group of us were staying here for a friend's wedding and the reception forgot to hand out their wedding gift bag upon our check in. When we reserved, we requested extra towels and we didn't get any. We called the desk for extras and this took forever, almost making us late for the rehearsal dinner (4 of us, 1 shower = timing is crucial!). Also my friend booked using her rewards membership and this was not part of our reservation. She had to get on the phone with them for quite a while to get us access to the free breakfast.We had the rehearsal dinner in the private rooms downstairs.

We got a huge platter of mini pastries!To be clear, I'm not saying this is a two star hotel.  I'm saying that per Yelp's rating descriptions my reaction to them saying they're a 4 star hotel is ""Meh. I've experienced better.""Let's take a chronological tour through my stay, starting with the horrific parking situation.  I expect parking trouble when staying in a city, but not this far out in the suburbs.  I ended up parking completely around the back of the building, and for some strange reason ALL the doors from the back are for employees only.  You would think they would make at least one of the doors for guests.  Instead I hiked around the building from the back in the bone-chilling Michigan weather.  Not a good start to my stay.Next comes the lobby and checkin.  The lobby and hallways are gorgeous, and the checkin experience was flawless.  This part was definitely a 4 star experience.  I was really expecting the gorgeous hotel to continue into the room, but was disappointed.  There was nothing wrong with the room, it wasn't dated and nothing was broken, but it didn't match the 4 star feel of the rest of the hotel.  It was just sort of unimpressive.  The room was 3 star all the way.  Adequate.When we did have a problem with the room it unearthed the fact that they don't clean very well.  When we took a shower the drain wasn't draining, so we pulled it out and a TON of hair came with it.  So we threw it on the floor and left it for the cleaning lady.  When we came back the room was ""cleaned"" but the drain with a huge clump of hair was still sitting right in the middle of the bathroom floor.  That means housekeeping came in, made the bed, straightened up, then left.  There is absolutely no way they could have actually cleaned the floor without seeing the drain.When we told the front desk they sent someone up to fix the drain immediately and comped a night, but I will definitely never stay here again.  There is no way I would trust that they actually cleaned.What was really outstanding in this hotel was the restaurant.  Oftentimes hotel food, even luxury hotel food, is not very good.  This was not the case at all with The Henry's food.We stayed here for a 20th anniversary family event. Lots of my family work for Ford in Dearborn (or ""Fords"" as we say in Windsor) and now live in the area so we thought a swank hotel stay might be nice.The Henry really met expectations. Room rates were reasonable (we got a $99 a night group rate). Even without the discount the room rate was reasonable. The hotel under the new owners has been dolled up with the amazing Roaring 20s/Great Gatsby theme. The art work is amazing. Your room comes with two vouchers for the breakfast buffet next morning. It's a quality spread, including smoked salmon. The sausage, however, was nothing to write home about.The workout room is well equipped. Nothing I hate more than a hotel with a Sears treadmill and an old stationary bike. The pool/hot tub are a bit small and the hot tub could be hotter but all 'n' all quite nice.Service is exceptional across all facets. The only thing I'm dinging them a star for:1) They turned the ice machines off on the odd floors. Sure, during winter maybe but when it's a hot humid summer and all you want is ICE I want it on my damn floor. I don't want to have to go down a floor to get damn ice. 2) Parking, while complimentary, can be tight when there's a wedding. There is overlfow on weekends in the office complex next door.3) The ""freebies"" in the bathroom could have been a bit more glitzy. But that's just a minor point.Random stuff:1) Free, passwordless wireless.2) Free earbud phones in the gym3) Walking distance to Fairlane mall and a movie theater. 4) I noticed they had Korean OB beer at the bar. I asked the bartender about this. She said the hotel was owned by Koreans and they kept some on hand for Korean business people. OB was my favorite beer in Korea.We stayed here for a few nights while attending a wedding held on-site. Overall, this is a beautiful hotel and cost shockingly little for the quality ($99 per night wedding rate).We were very pleased with our room. My only complaint is that housekeeping came late in the day and we found ourselves grabbing coffee in the lounge because our room wasn't ready around 2pm. Staff was generally very helpful and pleasant to talk to, and gave us detailed advice on where to run nearby.The wedding itself was gorgeous. There was also another wedding next door, and the comparison was sort of amazing. The two weddings had completely different decors, but were equally lovely. Clearly the staff at the Henry is committed to helping people personalize their event.The public areas near the lobby are decorated--the word that comes to mind is ""littered""--with paintings for sale. Personally I don't care for this cluttered look, and I was shocked by some of the prices on the artwork ($36,000 for one painting!). Still, it did provide a lot of visual interest when walking through the corridors.I recommend checking out the Henry for a Dearborn-area stay. It's an elegant change of pace from the typical chain hotels.The conference facility is nice, but if you're gluten-free, beware.  I'm not, by I was with a few people who are and they received a smallish side salad for lunch.  No chicken or protein of any kind.  The chef brought out some grilled chicken about an hour later after people complained.  They tried to make it right, but somebody obviously missed a memo somewhere.One of the best hotel experiences of my life and that's really 100% due to Henry's itself. It is not located in one of the wonders of the world, nor does it have great views or any natural beauty like that. The Henry, simply shines with its artsy decor, service, attention to detail, and comfort. The rates are very reasonable as well.Each time we stay The Henry gets better. The staff are the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel. The only place to stay when in Dearborn or going to The Henry Ford.Beautiful hotel, wonderful, accommodating staff -- no matter who you came into contact with.  I was greeted warmly by the person in the hotel gift shop, the folks working in the restaurant, the folks at the front desk, the cleaning staff -- every single person had the same positive demeanor!The bed and room were super comfortable, and the food -- I experienced the lunch as part of the conference I was attending as well as a salad for dinner-- was outstanding.  The only thing I noticed was that noise from the hallway could be heard pretty clearly in the guest rooms -- certainly not the fault of the hotel if guests are loud in the hallway!  But if, for example, they are vacuuming or conversations are taking place in the hallway, you will hear them pretty clearly in your room.That aside, however, I have absolutely no complaints about this hotel, and would stay here again in a heartbeat!Who knew such a fantastic hotel was hidden in the Detroit subarb of Dearborn!  I was traveling to the area on business and was when I heard ""Detroit"" I was expecting to have to fend for myself in a post-apopocalyptic Walking Dead type situation.  Imagine my surprise when I pulled into the luxurious lobby the Henry, with the valet in a top hat and tails, Picasso and other legends of art hanging on the walls, and a staff that bent over backwards to meet my (many) needs.  Still not big on the city or the area, but, but this fantastic hotel certainly made my visit much more enjoyable and comfortable.This used to be the Ritz Carlton, but is now a Marriott property. The rooms are a good size and clean. Beds are very comfortable and the service is nothing short of a four star hotel. We hosted an event here and the catering staff was very helpful. They did their very best to accomodate our groups needs. The food was just okay for hotel catering food, which is what you can expect from hotels. The gym is small but has the basics that you need. There is not too much around the hotel except a mall. They do have a deal worked out with the town cars at the airport in which they will charge you a flat rate including tip, which was just like $5 more than a taxi. Definitely a place I will return the next time I am in the area.Overall, a very pleasant hotel located close to most everything in the area.  The staff was extremely friendly when needed, and invisible when not.  They have a clean workout area, and a nice pool for families.A couple of minor things dinged this one for me.  When we made it to our room, there was a water bottle still partly under the one bed, so it appeared to not be as cleaned as could possibly be.I also noticed the shower vent/fan located in the shower had a tremendous amount of dust/gunk in it, and really could use cleaning.  It just a pet peeve, and the little things are what folks notice.  When you walk in and are greeted by gentlemen in top hats, and six figure art pieces for sale, you don't expect these types of little things.Upon our arrival, The Indiana University football team was staying here, so that reinforced its a decent place.  Saturday, the Cincinnati Bengals checked in as well.  Therefore, with the budgets these teams have, they could have stayed anywhere but chose here.The hotel has a lot of unique artwork located throughout the lobbies and waiting areas.  It makes for a really unique touch!It's not five stars, but most likely one of the nicer hotels in the area given the teams who had a presence here over our weekend stay.Great hotel , helpful staff , massive selection of local beer and a very good restaurant , breakfast it also very good, especially from the menuI recently stayed at this hotel while I was in town for a wedding and had a pretty terrific experience here.  The hotel is very contemporary with lots of great art on the walls and very modern colors and decor throughout the hotel.  It is one of the better hotels in the area, and still very affordable.The amenities at the hotel are great - they have a good restaurant (but get the room service - its faster), a nice fitness center and a nice pool/whirlpool area.  The rooms are also modern but come with great touches such as feather pillows and duvets, plush robes to use during your stay and a nice coffee bar in your room.  The rooms are all equipped with both wired and wireless wi-fi, above basic cable (HBO) and even video games (if you wanna pay to play).  My only gripe about the hotel is the elevator system.  You are given a key card that goes to your room, but you also have to use this key card to get to your floor by way of their elevator.  This is very inconvenient and I can't tell you how many times during my stay that I had to ride all the way up to, then down, then back to my floor because it didn't always work before the elevator started moving or because I simply couldn't get the card in fast enough seeing that I was on the 2nd floor.  Not to mention that if you are with a large party who are staying on multiple floors, it makes it almost impossible to go to that floor because your key card only wants to let you off at the floor you are staying on.  I know that they are concerned about security, but when it that much of an inconvenience to your guests to use the elevator it is time for a better system.Hotel room was spacious, and the bathroom had some really nice touches. It was probably my favorite part of my stay due to the marble from floor to vanity making it feel bright and spacious.The bed was nice, but still can't compare to the Heavenly bed at Westins. The lobby was nice, but the workout room was a little small.  The artwork was ok, but don't expect a museum.. I spent no more than 10 minutes going through the collection. Parts of the ground floor were still under construction.The Henry, formerly a Ritz Carlton, is alright.  The decor is somewhat distracting and disjointed, but it comes very close to actually working.  The food I had was alright.  The service was alright.  All in all, it's a place that's, well, just alright.  There's nothing overtly wrong with it, but what strikes me about the Henry is that if you had the right management in place, this venue could be world class.  It's situated just right, the basic structure is there, but in its current iteration, it's, well, just alright.Nice hotel and conference rooms. Excellent service from the staff, I would certainly come back for another stay.This hotel is especially nice for an older hotel, with big modern rooms and nice bathrooms. Elevators are pretty quick as well. I didn't hear ANY noise from the hallway or other rooms.The big con is the free wireless internet doesn't seem to work too well- it's slow if it works at all (both on my computer and for others I stayed with). The fitness room is tiny for the size of the hotel, with three ellipticals and three treadmills, so expect a line at 6 AM. There also isn't much convenient parking.So you're in Dearborn, Michigan. Lord only knows why you're in Henry 'Too Much Jew' Ford-land. I am because my sister, brother-in-law, and nephew live here. The fam has stayed at the Dearborn Inn many times and while it was comfortable, affordable, and the employees were nice; it was lacking in charm and amenities. Lo and behold I found a lovely and charming spot to rest my weary head while visiting. Anyone who leaves less then a four star review for this hotel is picky and is probably an irritating person. I stay at hotels all of the time. Constantly. It's part of my job to stay at places that look good on paper then disappoint in real life. This place is legit.Not only is it a quirky, artistic spot but also I've always been greeted kindly by the front desk people and all staff. Without fail I've repeatedly gotten a lovely room with a large desk and extension cord in order to do work, ugh, on. The Internet has never been spotty and I've been able to access it from my room, lobby, and restaurant with no issues whatsoever. By the way, eat at Tria. They've updated their service to include tablet menus. Adorable. You can see photos of the dishes they serve and in very navigatable tabs. You also receive drink recommendations to go along with your entree.  I've found it best to stick to wine or beer with my meal because the alcoholic drinks are mixed with a heavy hand. Some people may prefer that, do with that knowledge what you wish.The beds are fluff balls of comfort, the bathrooms always seem to have enough water and adequate pressure to satisfy my shower and bathing needs, and the maids are kind and willing to part with extras to make your stay more comfortable.This is the best hotel to stay in Dearborn, it's a Marriott and prides itself on quality. I always forget to check out the art museum but always am amused by the bits and pieces scattered throughout the entryway (also I'd steal those white leather club chairs at the entrance in a minute if I didn't think the top hatted concierge wouldn't come after me.)Stay here if you are here. Really, it's lovely. Check out the pool and art gallery for me and let me know about it.","""Artsy, Unique, Great Value""Love the design and personality - arts on the wall, grand piano in the ballroom, unique decor, beautiful chandeliers...A boutique feel.There is also a gallery on site that offers guests a tour of the arts - guests also get a piece of art reprint for free.The room is contemporary and very bright.Great service, courteous staff.Very reasonable price.Convenient location, close to Fairlane Town Center Mall and Ford HQs. The area surrounding it is nice and safe.Absolutely love it!This is a retired Ritz Carlton, I would rate it higher, but since they seem to not realize I stayed with them for the first two nights of my five night stay, I have to rate them low.The building has been used, and used well, the L button on the elevators has been so well used that the the L has been worn off!The staff were friendly enough, the room was OK, nothing spectacular (if they knew I was staying there - they might even have made my room up on a daily basis)The lobby bar and eatery was fine, the food was fine.I attended four days of meetings in their meeting spaces, and that was fine.  Location is good, close to the highways, a major shopping mall and FORD World Headquaters.My biggest concern is that they don't seem to know they have guests staying there, glad they did not give the room I was staying in to anyone else.We stayed at this hotel this past Saturday night and I really enjoyed everything about it. The rooms were nice, updated, and clean. My only complaint would have to be that we could not get ahold of room service Sunday morning. We had preordered breakfast delivered to the room and needed togo cups for the coffee. Overall a great establishment for the going rate.So, I pretty much LIVED in this hotl for about 80 nights this year.  As the other reviews note, this is a retired Ritz hotel and is a part of the Autograph collection of Marriott hotels.  PROS: VERY attentive staff, from the doormen (one top hat man in particular) to the front desk ladies who knew me by name and especially the ladies who manned the concierge lounge (free top-shelf booze makes everyone happy). The food and ambiance in the restaurant was very nice.  I recommend the scallops!The room service was good, for a hotel.  I enjoyed the Henry salad with Salmon and they can pretty much bring up anything from the restuarant. Like I said before, the concierge lounge was prestine.  The food is the best free lounge food I have ever tasted.  The ladies were awesome and the drinks were FREE. Bed was comfortable.  Towels were fluffy.  Sheets were soft. Front desk kept my bag for me behind the counter every week and had my key ready when I walked in the door. Valet guys were very attentive.  If it was raining or I couldn't find parking in the back, they'd valet me for free (I think).CONS: The building is a bit older.  Found myself saying multiples times ""I don't know how this was every a Ritz.""The fitness room could be expanded into another area of the hotel: conference rooms, 2nd floor. The Lions stayed here for part of their training camp.  They took over the hotel! I understand that they had a deal with the hotel.  They blocked off more than half the parking lot for their expesive toy cars and left very little parking for the rest of us.  They sped like maniacs in the parking lot and I almost got run over a few times.  I'm more complaining about the players than the hotel.  Overall, the staff treated me like family and bent over backwards for any little need I had, from workout socks I forgot to a ride to the local sushi restaurant in the dark.  I had a great time here and would recommend this hotel to ANYONE in the Detroit area, no matter how far you are staying away from the hotel.  They even gave me a going away gift of a bottle of my favorite wine during my last week. Thanks for everything, Henry staff!Beautiful Detroit. From room 1023. Stay at a ART Gallery! Terrific!!!As an Event Specialist, working with hotels and venues to create a memorable experience for clients is half the battle. Furthermore, working with vendors means you have to trust them enough to represent your brand as they are an extension of your service for a few days. The Henry Hotel did an incredible job. I worked with Alison C., on everything from planning the menus during our meeting days to the floor plan of our meeting room and beyond. She served as a liason for the AV Tech team, the service and banuqet staff, as well as the front desk adn transportation. All of which were attentive, personable and very professional. The food at their restaurant (try the salmon or any of their specials) is amazing. We asked for alot during our stay and they consistently delivered. The hotel itself is refreshing and feels like a clean, modern but quaint hotel with gorgeous art lining the cheerful walls. This place is truly a gem! Thanks Henry Hotel - for an incredible few days!I've never actually STAYED at the hotel - I've only been here for a required work meeting (a THREE HOUR LONG meeting, that was on a Monday NIGHT until 9-friggen-pm!!)/dinner program. Sooooo.... my review will be about my experience with The Henry in regards to that!The place, first off, is quite pretty. Well, the parts of the building I saw were pretty - the lobby, the hallways to the large meeting room, and the room itself were all quite lovely. I was seriously underwhelmed by the food. The salmon was a bit boring - not a whole lot of flavor - and the not-really-creamy polenta just sat on the plate literally like it had been scooped out of a bucket. It was odd. The dessert - a chocolate mousse topped with fresh berries and a weird 1"" thick vanilla-ish wafer/crisp thing (that was SO HARD you couldn't actually friggen eat it) - was equally unimpressive.The parking is also really, really weird. I don't like that you have to park all the way behind the building, or way off to the side (unless you valet, of course).LOVED THIS HOTEL.  Wasn't there long enough but it is a huge improvement over that hideous Hyatt that was there before.I travel a lot and Detroit is always referred to as De-Troilet by the rest of the crew. This hotel saved our opinion of this city. It's basically a Ritz with a different name, owned by the same people. The art is fun to look at as you walk through the hallways. My wife is an interior designer and all about art so if I ever travel with her to the Detroit area we'll be staying here.Well-kept, classic digs. Decent gym and pool, both smallish.Pricey wine at the bar.Free wired Internet / wifi.Beautiful art everywhere. Spacious, but yet isn't a hotel that you'll get lost in. Rooms were immaculate; metropolitan enough without being modern tacky. Food was great at all functions of the Indian wedding. If in the area, I would not consider staying anywhere else.So what happens when a Ritz-Carlton is de-flagged?  Well, in this instance it dropped into Marriott's ""Autograph"" collection of independently-owned upscale hotels.  While I liked this property back in its Ritz-Carlton days, it was admittedly one of the weak sisters in the R-C family, and was definitely in need of some refreshing and updating.  I was curious to see how The Henry would compare with the old R-C.The most notable change is in the lobby.  The dark wood paneling has been painted over in blue and white, and the walls are filled with lots of colorful paintings, all of which are for sale.  Personally, I liked the classic feel of the dark wood, but the new paint definitely brightens things up. The old bar and restaurant have also been updated and combined into a single, open room.  If you like contemporary spaces, you will like the new look.  If you liked the old bar, you will be disappointed, as it now looks pretty much like everything else built in the last ten years.  I had breakfast a couple mornings, and the food was fine, and the servers were excellent.  The breakfast buffet is a decent value, but could use a bit more variety.  I rarely order room service, but on my first night I ordered pasta with grilled shrimp.  It was delivered quickly, the food was served hot, it was delicious.    Despite being in one of the newly-renovated rooms (534, to be exact), the furniture, walls and doors already show quite a bit of wear and tear, and the room had the unmistakable odor of cigarette smoke.  The whole thing looked to have been hastily done, without much thought or care.  Oddly, while the wood headboard unit was pre-drilled for reading lamps, they were never installed.  And while the lobby was filled with art, not a single print or even a mirror was hung from the walls of the room.  On the upside, the bed was comfortable, and the LG flat-panel TV included HD channels.  And a really big plus:  there is good internet connectivity throughout the hotel available at no charge!The fitness center is pretty much the same as it ever was, which is to say small and dark.  They really need to spend some money and improve this space.  I did not check the pool, but I assume it has not changed, either.  As for location, The Henry is very convenient if you have business at Ford or another local business.  The Fairlane Town Center mall is adjacent to the hotel.  While I used to go here frequently, after this last trip it was clear that the mall is feeling the effects of the long recession.  Also nearby is the Henry Ford Museum, which is a must-see attraction if you have the time.  A car or taxi is pretty much a necessity.  I would advise against walking between the hotel and mall after dark.  Once the workday is over, this area is pretty desolate.Overall, for the price, The Henry is a good choice if you are in Dearborn on business.  Many of the staff from the R-C days remain, which meant prompt, professional, and courteous service throughout my entire stay.I love this hotel when staying in Dearborn. Close to everything Ford. Friendly staff and decent hotel restaurant. Nice rooms and amenities.Excellent staff and very fast room service and request filling. Clean rooms and great TV! Free wifi and pretty safe parking lot. Highly recommended!Wonderful hotel.  Undoubtedly the best hotel experience my family and I have had in a very long time.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we felt like we were truly appreciated and accommodated in every way.   My family, with three boys 6 years old and under, can need some special care sometimes.  Bottle needs to be warmed, forgot spoons for ice cream, need quick room service.  This hotel did it all with amazing, friendly staff to make our one night stay not only convenient but truly enjoyable. Food at Tria was on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for... Very good food.  Swimming pool and fitness room- top class. Art work- like a small fine arts gallery.  Feeling like your every need will be met is priceless.... Especially with a young family.   We will be coming back, even if its just another quick trip because this hotel was a true gem that makes their guests want to return.  Not just run like a business as every other hotel out there does.  5+ stars.This is a VERY nice hotel.  if you want to impress family or friends, put them up at this place when they come to town.  I can't use the word beautiful because it's not really elegant or anything.   It's modern and loaded with art everywhere, even has Picasso and Chagall.  We stayed in a King Suite on a Friday and used a travelzoo voucher.  The guy who made the reservation went on about the complimentary all day snacks, night time desserts, and drinks that you get with the Suite.  So imagine our disappointment when we get there hungry and ready to dig into some hotel snacks and the lady at the front desk tells us that  the deal description was incorrect (sent out mass clarification emails)  and there were actually no free snacks on weekends or for the deal whatsoever.   Several Reese cups held us over til we dined at Tria (another review).   So anyway, the room was incredible.  It was huge, clean, 2 big TVs, walk in shower and  bathtub in one bathroom and another 1/2 bathroom.  The art was very cool.     They even have an interesting and informative video  on one of the TV channels about the different artists whose work is featured in the hotel . ""Ooh we saw that, and that,  and OMG  he did the ones in the room   LOL.   As someone mentioned, the thermostat seemed to have a mind of its own, but I figured it out and it was nice and toasty from there on out.  Pillows were so soft. This was the second time at a hotel I had to see who made the bedding items-same place.   The view  wasn't good.  I don't know what was out there, a hill and some miniature chimney things,  but who cared because the room was so nice.  We didn't really spend any time in the living room.  OK so no problems with the room.  But, the only real complaint would be about the whirlpool not being hot enough.   Just wasn't hot enough to feel therapeutic.  The pool wasn't warm either.  The sauna wasn't hot enough and the timer was broken  so I just waited  til I broke a lil sweat. Another note was that the hotel did not allow early check in or late check out.  It wasn't even up for discussion or negotiation.  However, I think this is definitely one of the best, if not the best hotel in Michigan.  If I had more money to blow  I would prefer to stay multiple nights.Go for the art, it's stupendous.  An original Picasso!  and a Chagall!right in the lobby.  fabulous art.Nice room, very comfortable, good rate.Disappointed in the restaurant - they didn't bother to tell usthey had souffles....which - of course - have to be ordered beforeyour meal.  They owe me a chocolate souffle!  Breakfast was only so-so.I stayed at the Henry Hotel in Detroit a few weeks ago while attending the North American International Auto Show, the Henry Ford, which is a Marriott, is absolutely beautiful. The lobby resembles an art museum and the room I stayed in was damn pretty! The bed was cozy, which is not typical of hotels, usually. My only complaint would be the internet connecivity problems, had trouble getting my laptop connected my whole stay, which was kind of annoying, but I had my iphone, so all was saved. :) The rooms were cleaned everyday, stocked with good products and water in the fridge. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend you do too! Oh, the bar has super expensive but equally as strong drinks and you can take them back to your room, which I did. :)I spend 75+ nights annually in hotels and most are Marriott properties.  I'm really conflicted about The Henry.  It's definitely better appointed than the Southfield Marriott where I usually stay.  That being said, the mini fridge didn't work, the showerhead leaked and sprayed as much out the side as downward and the parking lot is absurdly small for the number of rooms in the hotel.  Hotel maintenance quickly took care of the first two problems.  The only solution I saw for parking was to wait for a very long time for a spot to open or to pay the valet fee.  I didn't try the restaurant or bar.  The gym was nice but also very small for the size of the hotel - only 3 treadmills and a few other machines.  I'm still planning to stay here for trips in June and July.  The Marriott rewards program owns me and this is the best Marriott option in the Southfield area that I've found.I stayed here for 4 nights while working on a client project here in Dearborn. The Henry is a nice property (ex-Ritz Carlton) that continues to be updated.Staff is friendly &amp; proactive. Most have a very strong service focus. Rooms are mostly quiet (plumbing is very noisy/squeaky). Beds are comfortable. Flatscreen TVs are standard in refurbed rooms.Lunch at the on-site restaurant - Tria - has been a disappointment. Meals take forever to serve and each time for our group there has been a problem (overcooked salmon, wrong sides with an entree, missed sides unserved). Staff apologizes promptly and removes charges for problem areas from the bill - but length of time to serve and ongoing problems make this a risk everytime one sits down.Concierge service for frequent stayers is on the 10th floor - hot breakfast in the AM, hot appetizers in the PM - are very well done.If not for the Tria restaurant issues, this would be a solid 4 star hotel.","Stayed here on a recent arbitration trip.  Excellent hotel.  Very chic and loaded with so much art its like a mini museum at the hotel.  Was told it used to be a Ritz Carleton.  I never previously stayed there so I'm only familiar with it as The Henry.  Not a giant hotel.  Well located.  Reasonable costs for this type of hotel.   High end decorating as its redone from a traditional look to a really modern look.  They have a fitness center but I did not visit it.  Weekend rates were $129 and weekday were about $189.  Internet was everywhere and included.  Very close to all the Henry Ford museums and locales. I found the room very comfortable with those very high quality hotel sheets and towels.  About 15 pillows on one bed.  I had to move them there were so many.  For those how like pillows, its as good as it gets.They have bed bugs! Booked a room 1/5/14 and when I checked in I went up to check out my room. The hotel is beautiful, but when I checked my bed I  found bugs crawling on my sheets. I called the front desk telling them I was going to need another room because my bed has bed bugs, she acted like it was no big deal and said ""oh ok, I will get you another room. She didn't apologize about it or seem surprised. I asked her, don't you want to send somebody up here to check it out and she said, ""well I guess we could send somebody up there if you want""  I ended up going down to the front desk asking for a refund. They were unapologetic about the whole deal. I asked her at the desk if they were having a problem with bed bugs and she stated ""not recently"". That was enough for me not to stay there. I was very disappointed with the way they handled the whole situation. I posted this review on their website and it has been removed.Been coming here for dinner over the last month or so. Different from the old Ritz-Carlton but most of the same staff (absolutely great) and same quality of food -- fewer choices. Recommend it hightly.Nice hotel, nice decor, friendly staff, super comfy bed, marble bathroom, good price, highly reccommended.",,"['best', 'hotels', 'area', 'almost', 'week', 'really', 'loved',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-detroit-downtown-riverfront-detroit,Crowne Plaza Detroit Downtown Riverfront,3.0,$$,55,"The last time I was in Detroit I stayed at a hotel that was not a good choice. While on a morning walk I passed by the Crowne Plaza where I received a friendly greeting even though I was just walking by. I decided that I would stay here next time. So, four months later the time came and I booked my stay.Walking into the lobby I was greeted as I walked to where the line was to check in. Check in was quick and I was on my way to my room. I was greeted yet again before I even got to the elevator. The staff and inviting atmosphere was exactly as I had expected. I had a few questions throughout my stay and every staff member helped me with no hesitation. I really enjoyed my stay here because of the employees, and the view from my room was really nice! The only thing I didn't enjoy was being able to hear ""my neighbours"" in the adjacent room. I think that was because they talked really loudly, not because the walls were thin. Another set of neighbours kept letting their door slam, and that was annoying. The location of this hotel is great. You are across from the COBO Center, where you can catch the People Mover. You are also across the street from the Riverwalk, which is beautiful. If you like to go for walks (like I do) this hotel is in a great place. Overall I had a pleasant stay and I look forward to staying here again.I recently stayed here while on vacation, the hotel was so nice. Rooms are super comfy and they have wonderful customer service. We had just got back from a game and it had to have been 12:30pm and we were hungry so went to the bar to order food, we'll the gentlemen that attended us was amazing! He had a pack room of people (we all just left the Lions game) and he attended everyone with excellent customer service. He was working alone, and had to say he had 30+ customers trying to get food and drinks. Awesome guy hope they give him a raise for all the hard work he did. I highly recommend staying here. Very nice and you get a view of the lake...can't beat thatWifi did not suck at all, very fast. Everything was nice and clean.Pros: Clean rooms, great views of the city and river, friendly staff.Cons: The WiFi is terrible.  The original iPhone 2G data plan will surf the internet faster than you can at the Crowne.  Ironically, they also have a porn filter on their wifi (you get to click a ""I won't go to bad webpages"" disclaimer splash page )so you'd think that would stifle bandwidth problems.. but apparently not.The shower is also very small.  The bathroom was so small in fact I had to move the trashcan so I could open the shower door.Overall it's in a good location, easy walking distance to Greek Town and lots of food &amp; drink options around so if you're not needing to work in your room, you'll have a good stay.This is a great Crowne Plaza hotel! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The rooms were great, the staff was great, the amenities great. Restaurant on the top 25 th floor was fantastic. Starbucks in the lobby. When in Detroit this is where I'm going.For the money I paid, I wasn't impressed... The view was the only nice thing about this hotel. Elevators were in and out of service. The restaurant upstairs had very poor service. I will never book there again - not for $300 a nightI only came here as an attendee for a day-conference - so I cannot speak to the quality of the rooms, experience as a hotel guest, etc. However, I enjoyed my experience as a conference attendee.Con: the main conference room was more wide than it was long, so anyone who sat at the far corner of the room may have had issues seeing whoever was speaking on the main stage.Pros: Food was tasty with quality options for various types of eaters. Breakout session rooms were spacious enough. Staff was friendly and helpful, signage (to go to breakout rooms, etc.) was well-placed. Great sound system.Overall, very positive experience. Didn't knock my socks off though, hence 4 stars instead of 5.Went here a couple years ago for my wifes company christmas party.  It was the worst one I have ever been to when it comes to the food.  The room was ok but all the food was just cheap pasta and processed roast beef dry.  Wine was cheap.  Was really quite bad.  I posted a rewiew on their site and somehow it was gone within a few days.  I did not stay the night so cant speak to their rooms.  Dont host a banquet here though.The good:* Clean rooms (at least for 2 of the 3 rooms I saw for a 1-night stay)* The view (see pic)* Customer service (details below)* Free Wi-Fi* Location - near the courthouse (in case that's where you need to be; within walking distance of Greektown).The bad:* The first room they gave me was nice but right next to the elevator. I needed a good night's rest for the meeting I'd flown in for, so I called the front desk when I got back from dinner and asked to change rooms.* Went down to the front desk, picked up the key card, went to the second room, only to see that it had not been cleaned since the previous guest. Called down and was told that they'd clean it right away. Waited about half an hour, started dozing off, called back to cancel the room change, but was reassured by the clerk that she'd be up right away to take me to yet another room.Back to the good:* She came up, waited for me to pack up my things, and took me to another room, which was not as big but still perfectly fine. Was super apologetic about the whole thing and gave me a coupon for free breakfast.Back to the bad:* They apparently didn't adjust my reservation in their system, because just as I was about to go to bed, another guest was able to use her key card to come into the room. Quickly saw that it was already occupied and left. * The next morning, got a bill under the door for another guest, presumably the one from the night before, with charges I didn't make. Took it downstairs and had them correct it.* They wouldn't let me use the breakfast coupon for room service or even to get anything to go from the restaurant. Didn't have time to sit and eat.The ugly:* Me without breakfast.First of all, we were a little apprehensive staying here because the reviews we read were mixed at best. But our experience here was fantastic!!!! The room was super. The view of the riverfront and downtown was spectacular. We had a suite on the 20th floor. Plenty of closet space and HD TVs with refrigerator. The room was very clean.... We took advantage of the exercise room, sauna, hot tub, and pool. All terrific. The exercise bike I used was the latest in design.We picked this hotel to be close to Joe Louis for our Red Wings game. The spot is perfect. We walked thru Cobo right next door and got to the arena in five minutes.I'll be honest and say CP'S are iffy. Some are great remodels, some not so much. I probably would have chosen differently for my first time in Detroit but 30k young Lutherans were in town for a conference and options were limited. Lobby v nice. Speedy polite check-in. Asked for highest possible floor-got 24 out of 25. She worried about city vs. river view but it's Detroit! I can see a river every day (literally).Room is a angled-corner with all full wall windows. View of art deco bldgs astounding! Room is nice, small but needs met. Bath very small with shower only (could be because it's accessible ). Clean B+. Outside noise (right on top of people mover) is minimal. Stylish, surprisingly affordable. Would do again (so far).Very nice and classy hotel. The building itself reminded me of the RecCen. It's unique shaped glass and height made me thing and feel as if I'm in another major city. Indoor pool and outdoor waterfront view was nice! I would come back again!Older hotel, but good location downtown. I think the place need some updates. Not a high end hotel. If you need to get to cobo hall, its right next door. I was here for a meeting. the meeting rooms were good. Just think its needs a make overIt started so well. The staff was professional &amp; notably friendly. This area of Detroit felt moderately safe. The initial astetics of the Crowne felt classy. The hotel bar looked aptly equipped and capable, the kind of place that me and my number one gal could really tie one on. But alas, just like the first time you know a gal (in the biblical sense), it was an entirely disappointing experience.The stairwell smelled like diapers. The elevators cannot handle a max capacity hotel. The never ending wait for the lift forced us into the baby's-pants stairwell.There was a Halls wrapper atop our sheets. After informing the front desk of our find, and suggesting they either remove the wrapper or refill it, they offered us free drinks (just 2, don't get excited). But I think they missed the point. Free drinks are nice, but the free drinks didn't make us overlook the fact that the Halls wrapper was still spread eagle atop our bed several hours later!We ate in bed (we're emotional eaters). The next night the bed was made, but our crumbs from the previous night were still in the sheets!So why am I giving then 2 stars instead of 1? Because they were just so dagnab nice. Even when they didn't follow through, they still said whatever they had to say with the conviction of a door to door Jehovah Witness door knocker.I can not say enough about how friendly and personable the staff was during my 5 day stay at the Crown Plaza. I was greeted every day by name by everyone, my preferences were remembered, and no one missed a beat going above and beyond. I really enjoyed my stay and was a little sad to say goodbye! The location of the hotel is perfect if you're attending anything at the COBO center. It's directly across the street. The rooms are very small and narrow, but get the job done. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning. Service was fast all around. The views are great...I could see Canada! And great lighting.If you have time, visit Adam in the bar and have him make you an Adam Bomb! Great drink! Chanel was a great waitress and Officer Miller (I hope that was his name) was always a friendly face at the hotel. Check them out!Checking is at 15:00 and we arrived at 16:48 to find none of our rooms are ready. Most of the people at the checkin desk were busy with other tasks thus the line at the checkin desk desk was flooding into the sitting area of the lobby.We then were sent to a room which was already occupied which we did not learn till we walked in on a family. Then they finally hours later got us into a dirty room. Not a good experience at all but they refunded our money so they get two stars.Pros:  Great view, great location, and gorgeous rooms.  Me and my friends were able to walk to Wright &amp; Co. and the Grand Trunk.  The swimming pool, the hot tub, and sauna were amazing.  The room was comfy and beautiful.Cons: Wouldn't give me an hour later for checkout on my birthday and was rude about it.  Other than this one employee though, everyone else was very nice.Me and my wife stayed here for one night. The place has a really nice lobby and it's real close to the expressway so it's very convenient to get in and out. I wasn't to impressed with the room, for the price we paid it was actually kind of small. The first time we went to use our keys neither of them worked so we had to go back down 23 floors to get a new set. The real reason I'm giving this hotel a lower rating is it might of been the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed it. The excuse at the front desk was ""we were pretty much sold out"" I replied there was noise until 5 am and it reminded me of a Spring Break atmosphere.. Fix the noise with security and get a new valet system in place. But I recommend other hotels in the city.The Crown Plaza is fantastic. Great rooms. The staff is unbelievable and go out of their way to help you. The food in the redturants is great and good prices. Hotel is close to the Detroit Princess for summer time dinner cruises and just accross the street from Cobo Hall.  Great views of Canada, Ceasers Palace, the river and the Blue Water Bridge.Everything was perfect...until I attempted getting my car back from valet the next day.I wish I would've snapped a picture of the room with all the valet tickets. They were ALL OVER THE GROUND. You would see a valet guy run in there, pick a random ticket off the ground, and then go look for your car. There was absolutely no rhyme or reason for how they went to get your car. If you wanted it, you would have to stand by the valet office door, and repeatedly ask the attendant to go get your car. I waited just under 2 HOURS!! Absolutely ridiculous. If there was a system in order, I would have no problem with waiting. But the fact of the matter is there wasn't. It was literally a luck of the draw. Other than the valet fiasco, my experience was excellent!! Just get a better system going for valet.No sleeping here! The doors shake and rattle every time someone in my hallway enters or exits their room!!! Plus the carpet looks stained and the decor is outdated. The bathroom is tiny, and there's a hole in my sheet on the bed. I should have stayed at the Westin.","Pros: This hotel is in a great location downtown and serves great breakfast at the restaurant downstairs. Price was reasonable as well for the night. Gym is adequate for a quick workout and lobby is very clean. Valet parking is quick ($25/day). Staff is friendly and they have happy hour in the bar during the week. Cons: Hallways and guest-rooms are FREEZING! And my thermostat did not function well. Either too hot or too cold all night. Bathroom wasn't that clean. My coworker had a blood stain on her tile floor. My bathroom shower had hot/cold backwards. And my room was in a weird location straight at the end of the hallway. Overall, I would stay here again for work.  It's close to the highways and working walking distance of restaurants (but don't go waking at night). There are alleys nearby but stay inside at night and you will be fine.We were here for a Wings game and loved how easy it was to get to the Joe. Staff was wonderful and room spectacular! Every thing above expectations.I recently stayed at this hotel while attending conference events at the nearby Cobo Center. It was convenient, with nice views, and generally friendly staff. BUT IT HAS BEDBUGS.  The night manager's attitude was somewhat cavalier and it seems that bedbugs have been an ongoing problem that they're not addressing expeditiously. I'll never stay at this hotel again and I would advise all who'd like to avoid bringing home these blood-sucking pests to stay away as well.We were overcharged for our room; the amount taken from my account and what was on the receipt at checkout did not match at all. I called the hotel immediately and the lady that answered the phone told me there was not much she could do and so they transferred me to a manager but turns out they just kept transferring me and no one ever answered. Later I was able to reach a manager and she said she would refund the money but acted as if it were my fault their people messed up. Pretty rude. I told her all of the following as well but she didn't seem concerned. The rooms were not great on the cleanliness scale. I'd give them a low 4 out of 10 (10 being the cleanest). Sheets smelled like straight bleach (good bad I can't decide) pillows had holes in them and the blankets had stains. Bathroom was extremely tiny, toilet was about a foot off the wall requiring you to move the trash can placed in front of it to shimmy into the shower. Shower was also miniature and the drain cover kept slipping off so you could see the black hole of people's hair and shower slime. Watch your step as well. So disgusting. The water glasses in the bathroom had lip marks all over them as if the maid simply replaced the paper cover after the last guest. Where is quality control with housekeeping? Speaking of, house keeping woke us up at about 6am for no reason. Then maintenance began shampooing the carpet with an industrial cleaner in the room next to us at 7:30am.  I appreciate the carpet cleaning as there was dried vomit in the hallway the previous day from what appeared to be the night before  but they need to be considerate of their guests or maybe put guests in rooms where maintenance is not scheduled to complete a job. Upon arrival the hotel looks fabulous and the lady (Barbara) who checked us in was wonderful however the rest of the stay did not match my initial impression. Can be best described as a bummer.I travel the Detroit area quite often for work and everytime I do I book my room with this hotel. The prices are always acceptable and the service has always been wonderful.A few aspects of the hotel could you updating (ex. carpet in some rooms is getting worn) but I've always had a clean room. Irregardless, every time I stay I am treated wonderfully and leave without any complaints. Also, they treat IHG Reward Club Platinum Members wonderfully. The location downtown is nice as well. You're within easy walking distance to a handful of good restaurants and pubs, a feature I always look for when traveling.Stayed here for work and unfortunately they did not deliver the expectation of customer service I expected. Room was clean but not fully stocked with simple things like towels and soap. Was missing my small refrigerator though I specifically requested one. And when I called for room service it took an hour and half to receive it only after I called to inquire. Food quality obviously was poor. Wouldn't recommend except for the extreme convenience of being next Cobo.I had a one night stay to go to a tigers game on 4/18/15. We showed up after the game around 5pm to check-in. Check-in was around 45 minutes. Bryant the front desk agent was not friendly.  The room was showing a lot of wear and tear and was dusty. The pillows also did not have cases. If housekeeping failed to put cases on the pillows what other corners do they cut? It led me to be believe that the rooms are never cleaned properly. Bottom line stay at another location when visiting downtown detroit.The hotel has a great location. Right near the water front which is awesome for a view. We were on the 23rd floor facing the water. Bathroom was horribly small. Small sink, right next to the toilet with a very small single person shower. I am a 5'5 female and skinny and felt crowded in the shower. Hated it. Our room was close to the elevators as well and its all you could hear. My husband didnt mind it but it drove me crazy. The pool area is small and hot tub could be hotter. The staff is amazing tho. Valet crew is top notch. Overall nice hotel for the location and the money. Just need to fix the bathroom situation.By far one of the best customer experience I had at a hotel! Charles the General Manager happen to over hear that I had a misunderstanding with my room assignment. Instead of walking away knowing I didn't know who he was he corrected the situation in such a manner in which I truly didn't expect.(not only did I get a great room with a beautiful view of the city but I also received a dinner voucher!) To top things off I ordered room service and encounter employee Serge who was very knowledgeable about the menu and totally suggest what he felt suit my needs. Boy was he right!!!! I'm a flight attendant and I stay in a lot of hotels and the customer service that I received here was by far the best! Thank you Charles and Serge!!We stayed in this hotel last weekend, when we went for a seminar in Detroit.We thought it was a great value for the price.The room was very clean and spacious, the view from the window was great, overlooking City and the river.The stuff was very helpful and friendly.The only negative was the absence of hot water at night. But in the morning it was okay, SO not sure if it was a glitch or usual.They give great discount if you are a AAA/CAA member. Don't forger to mention.The parking is extra - $25 /nightIt has an indoor pull, but we didn't have chance to use it.The most pleasant surprise was a restaurant. The food is great, the presentation is awesome, and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel restaurant, my meal was around $20 (salad with chicken). Recommend this place if you need to stay in downtown and want a reasonable price.Bottom line: Lipstick on a pig.The hotel was recently upgraded and at first glance appears nice; however, the more you looked &amp; spent time there the worse it got - the building is old and it needs to be stripped to the bones for a proper upgrade vice a new coat a paint &amp; some new furniture.  The bathroom was ridiculous - shower stall was too small for even me (5'5"" and 150lb) and the toilet was placed a foot away from the wall so was nearly in the center of the bathroom. View was great but the wood window surround looked rotted with a new coat of paint. Service was slow, and apart from the Starbucks, a but on tge rude side.  I could go on but my finger is tired.  On the plus side, there are some awesome views from the upper floors, rooms are fairly quiet, convenient to the Cobo Center, and the price isn't too bad (though the Westin is infinitely better &amp; not much more $$).The Crowne Plaza is a pretty killer deal for downtown Detroit.  Centrally located, the rooms boast great views- if you're lucky (and/or ask) you might have a panorama of Windsor, the Detroit River, and Downtown Detroit.  The People Mover is about a block away, as is the river.The Rooms: vary in size from large to smallish.  The rooms themselves are well-appointed, comfortable, and clean.  In some minor instances, the age of the building shows.The Staff: are awesome, knowledgable, and friendly.  The valets were responsive, and the one time no one was available, a different staff member dropped what they were doing to grab the car.  At $25 valet parking is pricey, but it does include unlimited ins and outs.The Restaurant: in the lobby is pretty good, at least for breakfast.  The prices aren't too crazy, and the quality of the food is good.  The portions are enormous (but that is true of everywhere in Detroit!).The Facilities: are okay.  The lobby is fantastic.  The fitness room is on par with most similar hotels- a treadmill and dumbbells up to 50 pounds.  The pool looks nice, though it was closed for most of my stay.  A penthouse restaurant is currently being built, and should be open soon.What didn't I like?  The interior soundproofing was a big lacking; noise from the hallways and adjoining rooms sometimes carried quite a distance.  At night, the elevators can be faintly heard.Overall I would recommend the Crowne Plaza for a stay downtown.I like this hotel! Comfortable beds, nice front desk staff, nice restaurant and bar staff, nice valet staff. They have a little hybrid Starbucks in the lobby that makes the more popular Starbucks drinks. It's only about 3 blocks from the GM building and across the street from the convention center. The room that I stayed in had a great view of the bridge to Canada with a pointed window. There isn't much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but if you walk a few blocks, there are lots of bars and restaurants, even a little casino. If there is someplace you want to go and you don't have a car, the valet will take you where you want to go within a reasonable distance, but they will also call a cab or uber for you if you need to go far. They took me and my coworker to whole foods about 5 mins away and waited for us! The customer service at this hotel is awesome. The only complaint I have is their housekeeping staff is SUPER LOUD while cleaning the other rooms. At times I work odd hours, so I sleep odd hours, and they woke me up :( Other than that, super comfortable!!!Took advantage of a Travel Zoo discount which gave a 1 night stay + breakfast at the Jefferson House for only $99. The hotel is modern &amp; clean, the rooms have great views of downtown, and the breakfast was tasty and featured giant portions. Knowledgable &amp; helpful desk staff. One block away from the financial district people mover stop.I can't say enough about our stay this past weekend. From the valet to the bellman to the front desk and restaurant staff... it was lovely. As a former Ritz Carlton employee, I am aware of stellar 5 star service, and they delivered time and time again. The location could not be better. Our views of the city were breathtaking. The staff is what made the trip so much more than I had imagined. Very particular attention to detail and the needs for our weekend. Having grown up in Michigan I am so excited to share my experience and hope that others follow suit and stay at the Crowne plaza. Nicole and Dawn at the front desk are always helpful and pleasant. The bellmen, and others you meet in the elevators are genuine and friendly. Valet is on top of it, always... Even with our multi-vehicle situation. Breakfast was outstanding. The GM, Charles was present and helpful as well. Highly recommend staying here, and we will always when visiting Detroit.We stayed at the newly renovated Crowne Plaza for only one night while attending an event at Cobo Center across the street from it. Our experience was similar to many of the other reviewers' but more positive:(+) The staff were extremely friendly but (-) not always sure of how things are supposed to work there -- for example, I was given two different answers by two different people when I asked how much it would cost me to keep the car in their garage for a few hours past my checkout time.(+) The interior of the room was new. The bed and the linens were very comfortable.(-) In the evening, we waited forever for hot water to come and ended up taking a lukewarm shower. (+) In the morning though, hot water came right away.(+) The view was nothing short of spectacular. Our room overlooked downtown and we could see a bit on the river on the side. (-) The WiFi connection was a bit spotty, only one or two bars. Enough to read / send emails but not adequate for video streaming.($) Valet parking was $25 per day with in and out privileges. Parking at the Cobo rooftop is $10 per day, there is no in/out and you can't leave the car overnight.(+) The location is perfect: Cobo is across the street, People Mover is at Cobo and can take you to Greektown shops, food and entertainment.(+++) The restaurant downstairs is not cheap but the food is outstanding. Salads would be $15-$19 including your proteins, and other entrees are $22 - $35. The restaurant staff were super courteous and knowledgeable. Honestly, this was the biggest surprise. We didn't expect much from this restaurant and were blown away by their food.Would I stay here again? Absolutely. As long as they keep their prices reasonable.We stayed here for my husband's holiday party last weekend.  The valet/main entrance is not very well marked and it's difficult to wind back around as you are in downtown Detroit.  The front lobby was beautiful, but the staff did not even greet me.  I'm obviously pregnant and was dragging a suitcase, plus carrying my camera bag and purse and not a word, not an offer of help, nothing.  We were given a corner room, which was small, but offered an amazing view of the river, Ren Cen and Cobo.  The shower had to be cranked all the way to hot to give me a warm enough shower, the separate dressing area from the bathroom was wonderful but the bed was not overly comfortable.The staff working the holiday party on the 25th floor were very nice, but the food left alot to be desired.  I had chicken piccatta and I'm fairly certain they made the chicken that morning and possibly microwaved it.  Everyone at our table was having such a difficult time cutting their chicken that water sloshed out of several glasses.  We would possibly consider going back, but it would take a heck of a deal.This was the highlight of our stay at downtown Detroit! We came here for the weekend for the Auto Show at the Cobo Center. The Crowne is a perfect location. And we had a room with a view!! A beautiful corner room with floor to ceiling windows on either corner and the bed facing out. The room looked out onto Windsor, across the river. The GM building was lit up at night and we could see almost 180 degrees from the GM building to the Cobo Center. The room itself was very small but given the view, this was less important. I didn't like that you walk into the room and practically walk right into the bathroom. The bathroom should have been set off a little from the front door. Also, I was a little skeptical as I walked down the hallway for the first time. It felt like a cheap apartment building, with big, beige metal doors that seemed exceptionally narrow and dizzying carpet designs. The entire building smelled and felt clean, though. The lobby was welcoming and seemed nice. The front desk staff seemed cheery and welcoming, though not very knowledgeable when it came to recommending restaurants or modes of transportation. We had to ask a number of people before we finally decided to just Google/Yelp ideas. Figured we'd start by asking the locals. Better to do the research on your own, we found. Valet parking was a hassle. We tried parking across the street on Friday night (~11:30pm) and thankfully, the parking attendant was blunt with us, informing us that cars are broken into on a nightly basis and that they leave the lot at midnight. They recommended the hotel valet parking. We did this, for ~$20/day. When we went to pick up our car on our way out on our last day, it seemed extremely disorganized. There was no where warm to wait. And our wait was a solid 25 minutes. Granted, there were a number of people waiting for their cars, so the valet guys were very busy and were doing the best they could. They just seem to need a better system. The people in front of us were getting frustrated, as they were brought the wrong car three times! I would stay at this hotel again if I ever visited downtown Detroit again. It seems like the best option available within walking distance to anything. And it must have the best view.When we first arrived everything went smoothly. The room was comfortable and the front desk service worked well. But after our check out the valet service ""lost"" our car upon checkout. We had to wait slightly over a hour to find our car. It was hidden behind two other larger cars underneath the hotel. Don't stay here. Not worth your time.My husband and I recently stayed at the historic Ponchartrain now Crowne Plaza Detroit Downtown.I will start with the positive.  The view is amazing, and the building itself was constructed to maximize the views.  Very cool. The price was not high, not low...  the high end of medium I guess would be a good way to describe it.The room service- very good!  Very, very delicious breakfastRealistically - they have ALOT of work to do when it comes to service.  I hate to say this, but sitting and waiting like idiots for a valet that doesn't exist with no sign to clue you into the fact that there is actually no valet is not a good thing.  My husband stayed in the car and I ran in to see what we should do.  This had to be done at the front desk - there were several people in front of me.  So I had to wait in line to figure out if there was a valet or not.The place was really not that clean. Probably not the staff's fault - the problem probably lies with not enough staff...They really don't seem very equipped to take care of really simple things - like to get change for a $20 so you can tip your maid - which, if you don't personally tip your maid, you really, really should! All in all, they may want to consider staffing up so that they can deliver the normal things that people may want/need while paying to stay at a hotel.","Pros: Location, location, location.  Stayed here with friends for the Jazz fest and would recommend for any event at Hart Plaza. Recent renovations make for modern lobby decor, and *some* industry vets make for great service (particularly the night shift).  The architecture of the CP makes for gorgeous views of the right side of Detroit from nearly every room. We had a wonderful look at the Ambassador Bridge over COBO.Cons: Parking.  Valet fills up quickly (something we weren't told when we decided to delay parking for a quick shopping jaunt) and there was no mention of a valet agreement with the nearby Holiday Inn Express until we had parked at COBO (with no in/out privileges). Actually, there was no mention until we arrived after a night out and all nearby structures were closed. Would have been smooth sailing if we had known that initially.  Also, thin walls and (beautiful) glass paneled doors make for tons of noise in the halls and, potentially, in your room.  Reminded me of some of the noisier floors at Motor City - great base for a night out, bachelor(ette) party, or something similar but not the best for a restful night.Stayed one night for a little getaway. Staff was friendly and helpful. I loved the pool and Jacuzzi. Room was kinda small but we had a nice view. I would definitely stay again.Average rooms. Found a cigarette butt on our chair and a yellow stain on our towels. YELLOW STAIN!  Gross. Justin at the front desk is absolute prick. Very unprofessional staff all in all. Belle hop was a sweet heart though.Bed is one of the best I've ever slept on at a hotel. Staff was excellent, pleasant and accommodating. Food at restaurant was great!!! Never thought I would crave Brussels sprouts but they were incredible along with the other menu items we tried. Would go back just for the food.  Great cuz it was right across from COBO and easy access.  Very clean. Only negative was bathroom was small but as long as you aren't totally obese its functional and fine. Views were awesomeMy work reserved a room for a colleague and me at the Crowne Plaza Hotel near the COBO Convention Center.  We were attending a work conference at the COBO Center, and the Crowne Plaza offered ""discounted rates"".  We were unable to make a reservation over the internet due to the discounted rate, so we had to call several times in order to get a hold of the manager to make the reservation.  This seemed strange, but I didn't think much of it.I pulled up in the back and was told the garage was valet only.  I hate valeting my car because it's old and falling apart, but I was told the parking would be free.  I left my car and headed into the hotel lobby, which was on the next floor.  There was an employee who hopped in the elevator with me to escort me upstairs.  It was kind of strange, but I thought nothing of it.  When I got upstairs, there was a massive line to check-in due to the fact that many people were attending the conference.  I waited about 20 minutes to be checked in and all seemed fine once I got my room key.  I headed to elevator to go up to my room on the seventh floor.  After waiting for about ten minutes, another hotel employee escorted a group of us to the creepy freight elevator.  Apparently they were having some problems with the four normal elevators.Up on the seventh floor, the hotel hallways started to small really musty.  I got into my room, and everything was brand-new.  So new in fact, that some one had left a strip of painters tap in the bathtub where the faucet was supposed to be.  I thought it was strange, but figured I could use the handle to turn on the shower.  I realized that I forgot some toiletry items and headed back down to see if the front desk had them.  I didn't want to wait for the elevator again, so I took the stairwell closest to my room.  I walked down a few flights and saw a construction zone sign on one of the floors and then an authorized personnel only sign on the next floor.  I got the bottom and reached an emergency only exit.  I headed back up the stairs and had to once again wait for the elevator to take me down.  At the front desk, I had to wait another 15 minutes only to be told that all of their toiletries were locked up, so I was out of luck.  When I told the person about the missing faucet, he remarked that many people were having issues with their rooms.  He didn't offer to change room, and I figured as mentioned above, that it would be fine.My colleague arrived, who is from Detroit, and explained that there were probably so many issues because the hotel had been closed for several years and that they had just opened in time for this conference.  In the morning, we awoke to take showers, and alas the faucet did not work for the shower. We had to switch rooms at seven am and this made us late for the conference.  That room thankfully had a working shower.  The bathroom door had a clear glass, somewhat translucent, which made it very awkward when someone was in there changing.  This room on the 21st floor did offer a nice view of Detroit/Canada.Throughout our stay, the elevators either were completely out of service or took forever or we had to take the freight elevator.  The hotel staff seemed very confused and inexperienced.  They were always friendly, but it seemed that they weren't trained enough to handle all of the problems related to the opening.   The rooms once everything was situated were nice enough.As we walked to the conference, there were people polling the hotels guests about their stay.  I wasn't sure why and didn't comment.  The morning of our departure, we heard music from the 21st floor and looked down to see a huge protest in the front of the hotel.  It turned out to be a UNITE HERE protest, which normally happens when workers rights are being violated.  When we left, the valet staff had to clear a path for those of use leaving the parking garage, otherwise, we would have been locked in by the protest.  This is not something I want to deal with as a hotel guest.  Please pay your workers a livable wage and offer benefits.The only nice thing I can say about this hotel is the staff are very hospitable.  Not dressed to well, but at least they render good customer service. From the bell hop and valet staff to the front desk receptionist, then to the hotel operator and lastly the room attendant staff, everyone was a delight and very professional. Also, the location of the hotel was very good in downtown Detroit in proximity to the rest of the sites in the downtown area.  My family was very safe walking around and hopping on and off the people mover.Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing about the hotel room.   The property itself is not too good.  We checked in on 3 July and stayed until 6 July.  We rented a room with two double beds.  The bedding was not soft (or quiet) and the general condition of the room is not something I want to see again.  The beds were uncomfortable and the sheets were scratchy and loud.  Even my daughter remarked that the thread count on the sheets hovered around a  2.Then on the last day of our stay, the morning of our check out, the hotel lost water pressure.  The only compensation the hotel gave us was two 10 ounce bottles of crappy water.  2 small bottles of water for three people.  This is what we had to brush our teeth and faces with in the morning.  I was sooooo glad when we checked out of the hotel. A stinky letter was written and slipped under the door sometime in the am of the morning and that's it.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone....not even my enemy.  I'm so done with this property.This is the worst $200 rate hotel I have ever stayed.  The suite size is nice and roomy.  But the shower stall is so small, it is about 2x2.  If you are a guy,  you will fully occupy the shower stall.  The so called double size bedroom has a full size bed for two adults.  This is so small that you can't get a good rest.  Restroom is also very old. Stay away from this hotel if you have a choiceThis hotel is fantastic! I enjoyed my stay there. it is centrally located so you can walk to things, such as Greek Town where I had a great meal. The hotel staff goes above and beyond. I had a sad experience where I left a very special necklace in one of the rooms and then flew home to the west coast the next day so I wasn't able to go retrieve it. The hotel staff responded to my request to mail the necklace back to me with great kindness. They refused my offer to pay shipping costs. I was warmed by such kindness. I will always recommend this hotel to friends as the ambience and service are top notch. Thank you manager High Fisher and staff!I was down here recently for an event at Comerica Park. The hotel was sold-out. I was expecting the customer service to suffer as a result of the event, but it was still stellar. Hugh, a front desk associate, was one of the reasons I had such a great stay. Great customer service!I love this hotel. I have stayed at a bunch of hotels in downtown and probably will come back to this one again.My room was very sizable, when I walked in, I was shocked that it was a suite, the first portion of the entry way is the living room area and the window overlooked the Ren Cen and into Windsor. Very picturesque view from the 23rd floor.Hotel was clean, the staff was excellent, the rooms are very clean. I was really impressed with the place. Hands down one of the better hotels I have stayed at (comparing it to the Westin, Holiday Inn Express, the Atheneum, Greek Town Casino, and Hilton Garden Inn) since having to travel to Detroit. It is easy to get to, it is close to  everything that I need. Greektown, Compuware, the People Mover, Hart Plaza.One other reviewer does bring up the fact the rest rooms are smallish, but at the end of the day you are only spending a small amount of time in there. They are still new and have to smooth the edges out, but for the pricing, it is well worth it.This hotel also goes by the name, Crown Plaza Pontchatrain Hotel.  The hotel has just re-opened under new management and has been renovated as well.Positives and negatives about this hotel.  Positives - The hotel staff were all very nice and friendly. I found the rate for this hotel to be very reasonable compared to others in the area. Our room had a very nice view of the lake and Canada.Right next to the Detroit Convention Center.Negatives - The rooms are small and the bathroom is just tiny.  Bathroom door had a glass window on it with shaded glass.  Everyone in the room can tell what you are doing in the bathroom.  Very limited privacy. Only two of the restaurants on the first floor were open during our stay.  Prices seemed very high and we ate elsewhere during our stay.Our door only seemed to lock if we pushed really hard on it to make sure it latched properly.Fire alarm went off several times suring our stay.  All were false alarms.  We were told they were having problems with the system.  You have to valet your vehicle while staying her at a price of $25 per day.  The valet service was very disorganized during our stay.  They had a very difficult time finding peoples cars and the system seemed to be all screwed up.  This could be due to only being open for a week.  But they could really make some big mistakes.  During my four day stay here they gave me the keys to someone else's car twice by mistake.The swimming pool is tiny and was very over chlorinated.  You could hardly stand to sit in the room with the fumes from the chlorine.  Again, I think they are still trying to figure out how to run things.Lastly the bellhop does not come on duty till 9:00 AM.  So if you want to check out before that you are on your own to try to find a cart, which is no easy task.The hotel staff seemed very confused and inexperienced. They were always friendly, but it seemed that they weren't trained enough to handle all of the problems related to the opening.Okay.  It wasn't horrific.  It wasn't great either.  I'd say it was on the poor side of mediocre.Recently, a Metro Cars driver tipped me off that the Ponchartrain had reopened as a Crowne Plaza.  He told me that it looked nice inside, had a nice view of the river, etc.  Okay, my wife and I were looking for a hotel downtown on short notice.  We planned to make a night of it at our current favorite restaurant in the Detroit Metro Area, Marais, and we figured that it would be safest to find a hotel and let someone else do the driving.  We picked the Crowne Plaza Detroit Downtown for the fact that we found an available room at a reasonably low price.  We figured we'd give it a try.  Why not?Well, I'll tell you why not.  Eh...sometimes, you find a deal, and it's a steal.  Sometimes, you just get what you pay for, and if you just paid a little more, you would have gotten something decent.The hotel, at this point, seems understaffed.  I don't know if that's true, but it seems like it's only half-open.  When we drove up to the comically understated entrance--so understated that we weren't even sure it was the entrance--there was a cab blocking the drive.  No valet.  No doorman.  No sign even confirming or implying that we were at the entrance.  It seemed almost deserted.  My wife went in and had to ask for the valet while I stayed with the car.  No bell staff were around.  We carried our bags ourselves, which wasn't a problem.  We didn't expect to have anyone take our things.  We just found it odd that there was just nobody around except the one guy at the front desk.  The cafe area in the lobby isn't open.  Supposedly, the gift shop items are available--just ask the front desk if you'd like to buy anything.  Apparently, they're going to serve Starbucks coffee. [Sarcasm/On] Ooh! How wonderful! [Sarcasm/Off] Okay fine.  We check in.  We go up to the room.  The view of the river is nice.  We are overlooking Cobo Hall.  Nice modern decor.  Then, I start to become dissatisfied with the room.  Stains on the white tile floor grout.  A solitary pubic hair on the floor, which I just discard with a tissue.  I don't tell the wife.  I start to think, ""Yeah...I'll just wait to shower at home.  All I need is a place to sleep without driving home.""The next morning, we get room service for breakfast.  They have some tasty breakfast items like their fried egg sandwich.  I get over myself.  I take a shower.  I survive.  The hot water, which seemed to take a long time to come up the night before, came up reasonably quickly.When we went to check out, we asked the front desk for change so that we can be nice and tip the valet.  I had used the last of my change to tip the housekeeper, because, hey, people need to make a living--not because I was especially impressed at how well-kept the place was.  Don't get me wrong.  It didn't look too bad.  It only started to look bad when I started to look closely.  I started to notice things like hallway carpeting that needed vacuuming--or at least closer attention to the vacuuming.  But anyway, we were told by the front desk that they didn't have change for a US$20.  We were advised to go to the restaurant to get change.  My wife went to the bar.  The bartender gave her some attitude about needing change and said something to the effect that my wife would need to buy something to get change.  My wife explained that the front desk sent us there for change, and all we wanted to do was get change to tip the valet.  My wife tipped the bartender just for making change, because, man, if it's that much of a problem to make change, well...here's a dollar for your trouble.We figured that it would be cheaper for us to find a hotel room downtown, take a cab to Marais in Grosse Pointe for dinner, and get a cab back rather than getting a car service to take us from home to Marais--to really enjoy the night safely.  Eh...we went back to Marais exactly one week later with friends.  This time we took the car service from home to dinner and back.  It was probably about the same without the hassle and annoyance of dealing with this less than mediocre hotel.  I'm thinking my two stars are overly generous.The floor had a stain on carpet, made the room feel dirty. The water in the shower NEVER even got warm. You have to pay 25$ to have the car valet parked PER DAY! The valets all seemed confused and pulling in and unloading luggage was a mess. Cars were just left in the way of the driveway, unattended blocking space and nobody was in control. The room was over $175. No breakfast, not even stale bagels or juice. No fridge in room, if you want to have anything chilled, bring a cooler. If you needed something in your car after the valets parked it you had no access to your car, you had to call ahead and have car brought around . Much better options closer to the  City Center. I will never stay here again. The staff seemed pleasant, but in no way did they seem like they would help you any more than they had too.Only Pros of this hotel is good view.Again it depends on your room.Cons: * I hate the way the bathroom has a glass door and when you are with family it's embarrassing to go into it          * Rooms are too small for the price          * No Oven or Mini Fridge as most of the hotels have.          * Paints &amp; Carpet smells old.          * I am with my newborn and Thermostat doesn't work.It's too cold in the room and it's snowing out.Heard this is common complaint in most of the rooms.The restaurant downstairs is utterly fantastic and the hotel itself offers some amazing views of downtown Detroit, but for the love of God they need to fix the hot water issues at night! After being outside in teeth-chatteringly sub zero temps, I was looking forward to a hot shower before dinner. After running the water for a few minutes, the water was still freezing. Same thing a full 10 minutes later. We called the front desk to inform them of the issue, and they told us that someone would be sent up to investigate. Another ten minutes passed before I finally gave up and took the coldest, quickest shower in my life, and I came out feeling like an icicle. I might as well have gone outside and rolled around in the snow. From reading the other reviews on Yelp, this seems to be a systemic issue. Crowne Plaza is a beautifully renovated hotel in a prime location with one of the best restaurants in Detroit, but without hot water at night, those Michigan nights can be extra frigid!",,,"['last',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/st-regis-hotel-detroit,St Regis Hotel,2.5,$$,54,"We stayed the weekend here for Beerfest at Eastern Market. I booked several weeks out and got it for $114/night. For the price, it was fine. We needed a comfy place to sleep &amp; shower. It worked for that. Based on previous reviews, I checked the bed for signs of bedbugs when we got there and did not see anything. We kept the window open to compensate for not being able to turn off the heat. The room was clean. The bed comfortable. There's no exhaust fan in the tiny bathroom. The CRT TV wasn't bad but the poor cable signal, channel line up and volume issues were pretty annoying. The hotel was quiet except for the occasional door slam that I suspect came from the utility room (we were at the end of the hall). We never heard anyone in the hallway. The valet parking was fine. Even with that added to the nightly price, it was still a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area. We weren't looking for a luxury hotel experience, just a decent place to stay while in town for an event. It did that.The front desk staff was very nice. We ordered in pizza Saturday. They made an effort to acquire plates &amp; such for us. They even offered to bring them up rather than making me wait downstairs. We did not try the restaurant. A previous review mentions a hotel shuttle, they don't have one. We used Uber or a cab to go back &amp; forth to Eastern Market. Word of caution, the housekeeping staff took/tossed my personal bar of soap from the shower. They provide a free bar and left a new one, so I'm guessing they thought it was there's. Not a big deal. They also charge a $50/per night refundable deposit for the room. Not sure if that's standard but I wasn't expecting it.I'm giving St. Regis Hotel two stars because I thought I would die during the night (a'la American Horror Story), and I woke up to write this tale on Yelp.I traveled to Detroit for a work event, so I arrived at the hotel around 11 pm by myself, which prompted the clerk at the desk to repeatedly ask, ""Are you alone? Is anyone else with you? You're all by yourself?"" DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE WITH ME? Nothing could make a woman more uncomfortable close to midnight in an unfamiliar city asking if I'm flying solo, so please don't.Feeling uneasy, I located my room. My comfort level was increasing but immediately began to deteriorate as I heard snatches of a conversation between two men, one who kept mumbling, ""I don't know what you want me to say, Keith."" Keith, dissatisfied, disconnected from the call. Keith's phone friend aka the man staying in the adjacent room to mine (PAPER THIN WALLS) proceeded to phone a woman and complain about Keith's self-harming tendencies for several minutes while I tried to avoid eavesdropping, which was damn near impossible considering the particle board separating my room from his. p.s. Keith, I hope you're alright, buddy.Then, I noticed a glaring light in the parking lot, which was a spotlight that I could not block out because there were no drapes on my window. Fine, I thought, I'll sleep with the lights on and my contacts in just in case I'm attacked in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, I found sleep near impossible due to how uncomfortable my accommodations were, so I attempted to connect to wifi to get some work in (""attempted"" = key verb). There is no wifi at this hotel, but don't worry, I have a hotspot that causes AT&amp;T to send me text messages relevant to my data overages.  I didn't even bother with the TV.I kept waking up throughout the night mistaking the spotlight for the sun and being so grateful that it was time to leave. Finally, the sun did rise, and I was jolted awake by an incessant, shrill beeping noise. I had to move the bed and nightstand in order to locate the source of this obnoxious noise, which was a dying walkie talkie. Very eerie. I managed to turn the damned thing off and slip back into a brief sleep before quickly packing up and getting the hell outta there. The valet was nice though - she cleaned the snow off my car. :)I'll start by saying I developed more anxiety by reading the reviewers prior than my stay at St Regis. That said, the reviewers all have a point.It's a has been boutique hotel saddled at two stars and fighting (to its credit) for the third. It has a certain level of charm to see the old world built into the facade, lobby and lay out of the room. But it presents poor competition in the era of fresh smelling holiday inn expresses and comfort inns. I stayed partially comped by Henry Ford hospital which made the booking worth it but cannot imagine paying the full $100 for the room.The room was spacious, the bed comfortable King, and the room clean. I felt like I walked into the early 1990s when I entered given the decor and CRT tv. The room was clean, and bathroom was adequately sized without issues with water heating. My major complaint has to do with the AC which was stuck on heat. The management's answer to my friend calling down to the desk was to open the window! Not something expected from a hotel in 2015. Hence two starsIt's obvious in the lobby and outside that the hotel is being renovated. I would not recommend staying there unless your stay is comped or the hotel completes its numerous renovations to modernize.Why 3 stars? Because it got the job done, but is in desperate need of updates.   ---   ---   ---I'm not picky when it comes to hotel rooms, but I don't think I'd stay here again.My only experience in a St. Regis was in Washington DC. I worked for the Tampa Bay Lightning at the time, and actually had the privilege of staying in the team hotel as they were in town to play the Capitals. To this day, that was easily the swankiest hotel I've ever stayed in. Everything was gold-plated. I did not feel worthy of being in my room.This St. Regis finds itself on the opposite end of the spectrum. The whole thing seems like a strong wind would just blow it over. From the elevator, to the base boards, to the bathrooms, to outdated electronics... it's all just kind of hanging on by one finger nail.But it gave me a place to lay my head at night, incident-free. I'll take it.I got to stay at the St. Regis Hotel this past weekend.  It was a great stay.  It is has an elegant feel to it.  Lots of history and charm to it.  The room itself was quite comfortable and pleasant.  The staff was pleasant and helpful. (There is valet parking.)  The hotel was conveniently located for me.  I will be sure to use this hotel again when I visit the Detroit area.would stay here again. the hotel was old but in a good way. the room was clean and for the price we paid it couldn't be beat. The front desk staff was very nice. we ate in the restaurant in the lobby and had a good experience there as well.I have to say it saddens me to say how disappointed I was in the food and the service.  You could see and feel the struggle that was taking place for the organization to properly serve and provide good value to the consumer.We all want Detroit to do well and of course the businesses in it.  But I don't know if somebody's old organizations can make the transition with the challenges of finding good help and qualified serving and cook staff.At any rate I wish them all well there and all future success in their endeavors to bring this restaurant back to its once great glory.The room is a feast for your eyes.This is probably one of the worst 3 star hotels I've visited... The room seems clean but that's about the best thing I can say about the place..... Bathroom is tiny... No amenities... A/C barely works... And an old school CRT TV... Just see the attached pictures... The wifi is so slow I can't even stream a show on my iPad.... They changed my room for me for the issue with the A/C but of course the other room was only slightly better and I was told that all the rooms had the same type of A/C unit... Sorry this is closer to a 1 star than a 3 star... I've been to better MOTELS!!!! Don't waste your money... Don't bother with this place.****update****Just took a shower..... Wow... The water doesn't drain... Once again don't waste your money... Don't come hereA Good hotel for the price and location. The hotel was centrally located, it was easy to take Lyft anywhere I wanted to go. There is a mandatory $20 valet parking fee but you have access to your car as often as you wish. No A/C which could be a problem for some, I called down to the front desk and they sent up a box fan. The hotel has a vibe of tattered elegance and historic charm, everything was slightly worn but clean. The WiFi did not work in the room but we were able to use an office space in the lobby and plug in. I needed a safe, clean room in Downtown Detroit and the St Regis was great.I will make this review nice and quick. My husband and I got married at The Hotel St. Regis a week ago and what an amazing experience it was!! Donna R. Was most helpful with the planning process. Front desk manager Robert was also awesome as far as accommodations go. Our food was delish as well! I had the grilled salmon in a creamy dill sauce and he had the champagne chicken. I would recommend The Hotel St. Regis for your next event. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because of the rude front desk worker (can't remember his name) but he was just a hassle to deal with.Clean rooms, tube TVs, shampoo/conditioner/lotion set was of much higher quality than the room rate would suggest. Would not hesitate staying here again.You get what you pay for. A two star hotel at best. The rooms were what you would expect from a 2 star hotel... Not the greatest but better than a motel. Tube tv in the room gave it a very old feeling. Two reasons for the the one star review.. One would be the rude service from the receptionist at the main desk in the morning. When asked for a copy of our bill we were told that she could not produce one (because we booked through a third party) in a very unprofessional manner. Second reason would be the rooms beside us turned into dorm rooms. A local college is using the hotel to facilitate students. Which is not a big deal, until it's 1am and the adjoining room is filled with people talking absurdly loud and preventing you from sleeping. Now I am in my late 20s so I am no grumpy old man, but I am here for work and would expect a good nights sleep at a hotel. Overall, it was not a good experience and would not stay again.I've traveled a lot this year.  So far this is the worst hotel I've been to in a while. The pictures on the website pale in comparison to how awful this place is. They recently upgraded their rooms but....1) AC barely worked from the built in wall unit, and the room was super small so it was seriously underpowered 2) valet was $20 and they park it in the open air lot next door. I had to retrieve something 15 minutes after check in but they sent their valet home. So I was given the key and walked the 12 feet to my car. I would have rather paid half to self park. Valet also greeted me with ""VALET ONLY 20 DOLLARS"" and then proceeded to tell me I had to hurry to check in and that she will give me just a few minutes to get back. (8pm, no line)3) the ironing board was rusted and burned. So much for my business meeting4) someone got into a fight in the hallway. 5) who is St Regis? Either way I'm sure he's pissed this is named after himWe got to our room and the AC was broken. They sent Marianne to fix it and we left and returned 6 hours later to it still being hot in our room. They said they couldn't do anything so they suggested to sleep with the window open and the brought us a fan. Then we were woken up to jackhammers doing work outside of our window at 6am. DISAPPOINTMENT doesn't even explain how bad this was.When I have to stay at a hotel, my biggest fear is to be placed in a room with a poorly functioning AC, or worse, a broken AC. This is what happened to me last night. It was awful and completely unacceptable. Also, the front desk girl rolled her eyes too much.The restaurant at the hotel was the worst experience you could imagine. Food was not as described, and the the service was incredibly slow. Do not go here!I'm quite disappointed with my recent stay at the St. Regis Hotel. I chose it because of its location, complimentary wifi in each room and then the price, in that order. While the location worked out okay, the rest of my stay made me regret my choice in hotel. I wished I had just stayed the Crowne Plaza or Westin downtown. Overall the level of customer service was uneven, inconsistent and more befitting of a roadside chain motel, not a supposed boutique hotel. In a nutshell, no wifi, old equipment in the rooms and tiny staff. The worst part of my stay was lack of wifi. The entire few days I stayed I had no wifi access. Neither my android phone or my two iOS devices could connect. The staff was absolutely of no help. And St. Regis really needs to fire their wifi provider. I'm sick of hotels claiming to provide wifi but they don't and the front desk could care less. Congratulations, you've just told the traveling business community that you don't want their business.The staffing at the front desk and valet service was meager. There was mostly one person working reception, and one person at valet. Valet also functioned as baggage porters. So you might have to wait a while for him/her to get back to get your car. Housekeeping staff spent mornings yelling down the hall to each other; they were much louder than the construction scene outside in front of the hotel. My room was handsome, clean and sizable. But it lacked attention to details, like the lack of an iPod station and a modern TV. On the desk was an old half-working desk radio. Instead of a flat screen TV, there's a small, old cathode-ray tube telly with some limited and broken cable channel access. The telephone worked half the time with no caller ID; I received two unexpected, mysterious early calls that the front desk couldn't help me identify. This is a 2-star hotel trying to masquerade as something more. It's really pathetic. Although the St. Regis' New Center location makes complete sense if you're working at the neighboring office buildings, going to Wayne State U.'s campus, or attending a play at Fisher Theatre, I chose it so that I didn't just spend my money downtown. There's not much to the area after hours, except for the Fisher, but it's a quick cab ride to downtown and it's easy to hop on and off the highway to get to another part of town. And while it has a rough past and present, the area is getting better as the city transitions.Allow me to start by saying, I've traveled all over the world. Literally. So I have reasonable expectations. However, I have NEVER been in a hotel with a more unprofessional, sticky fingered staff. I stayed at the St. Regis with 9 of my fellow group members, to do a show for Buick. Checked in on a Friday, and left the Monday after. Incident #1: My sister and I were sharing rooms, and had to call down to front desk on Friday night to request a new room because my sister had bugs in her bed. Bugs.... In her bed.... Security came up, saw the bugs, and helped us move to another room, at around 1am. In the midst of all the hustle and bustle, my sister left a blazer in the room, but once she realized it the next day, (Saturday) she called down to the front desk to ask them to check the room for the blazer. Security came, said he checked the room but found nothing. My sister requested that she accompany the security to help him look, but again, the blazer was no where to be found. Frustrated because this blazer was a part of her wardrobe for the show, she called the front desk again, and asked if housekeeping turned it in. They claimed to have looked everywhere, but there was no blazer to be found anywhere in the entire building. Sad. Welp, somehow the jacket reappeared Sunday before we left for our show. Odd right?! When we returned that night, I saw the security guy who helped my sister search for her blazer, I informed him the jacket magically reappeared. He responded with a cheeky grin. So then I asked him, ""you called someone and told them to bring the jacket back, didn't you?"" He responded, ""I did!"" WTH?!?! Incident #2: One of my group members couldn't find his watch in his room anywhere. Somehow, he thought to look at the TOP of the closet, and there it was. Hiding. Incident #3: Upon departure, another group member realized his Jordan sneakers were gone. GONE!!! Incident #4: I was styled for our show by a friend, which included clothes and jewelry. All the jewelry was in a bag inside my suitcase. Upon my return back home to Dallas, I gave my friend her items back, and by golly, some of the jewelry was gone. Seriously, their housekeeping staff can NOT be trusted. In an attempt to watch what the housekeepers were doing, one of my group members hit record on her computer, to record their behavior while we were away. Only to return, to get computer being closed down. Lolol! I'm sure their criminal behavior being recorded was less than ideal for them. Listen to me when I say, DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! Aside from the thievery, their AC doesn't work, so no matter what temp the unit is on, it'll only blow heat. The ONLY reason this hotel even gets a star from me is because of the food. Otherwise, this was a terrible experience. Horrible! Horrible!! HORRIBLE!!!This hotel is over priced for nothing they Dont have flat screens in any rooms. Furniture in the room are old and raggedy. The food Is not that good and over priced for nothing. They are very unprofessional. It look like a old funeral home. I spent suite money for three days and they gave me the worst room ever. I can to visit from Cali I very displeased with this hotel I will never go back.Pros: Pretty clean amenities with an antique French feel. The bed is extremely comfortable. Bath towels are soft. Room layout of the king studio is quite nice -- with a vanity that doubles as a coffee table. Cons: That said, the decor lacks attention to detail, e.g. tv is from 1990, outlets are insufficient, window curtains are torn, shower curtains are worn, staff are incompetent and rude (particularly receptionist named Georgette), breakfast is so so I stayed here for free as an interviewee of Henry Ford. Otherwise, I would not pay more than $100/night for these rooms. Go to Howard Johnson hotel and cab or uber to downtown instead","The hotel is not within walking distance to Comerica, Ford Field or Greektown.   There are five buildings connected to the hotel which offer a food court type of dining that closes around 5:00 PM midweek.  There is nothing walking distance to the hotel and the area is not good. The hotel is ok.  I made the mistake of looking behind the nightstand and observed old food and large quantities of hair.   The hotel rooms only receive a surface cleaning. The first night I called for room service for over an hour and no one answered.  The front desk wasn't too concerned when I told them about no one answering.  If you're traveling for business to one of the five buildings attached, then it's worth it to stay.  If you're traveling for fun, stay someplace else. The restaurant attached,  La Musique, is ok.  I was the only customer is the place and it took 30 minutes for french toast.I booked a block of rooms for my wedding.  I agreed to the terms that 3 days before the wedding date, the block rooms would be freed up (available for anyone to purchase).  That's no problem.  However, we negotiated a rate for my guests.  A few guests did book rooms after the block was freed, and were not given the negotiated rate (even though there were still rooms available within the block).  I found this out months after the wedding from my sister.  This I did not agree to.  So, after giving this hotel about 10-12 rooms worth of business (rooms which otherwise would not have been occupied), they welched on their end of the deal.  Bad business in my opinion.  They've certainly lost of customer.  I hope they lose more.EDIT: In response to Victor: You state that this dirty little trick is something that all hotels do.  This was not told to me.  I don't work for a hotel.  I feel mislead.  It is your prerogative to mislead customers, and it is my prerogative to write a negative review afterwards.If you're staying here it's because it's relatively cheap and because it's one of the few hotels this far north of downtown. It gets by of those two things, and does little otherwise to earn your money. The wifi is terrible (which, okay, hotel wifi is generally bad but don't promise ""highspeed internet in every room""). I stayed in two different rooms and one didn't even have a thermostat to adjust the air conditioner. They gouge you on parking-- just add another $20 a night to your tab for that. It's ridiculous too because the valet literally drives your car to a mostly empty parking lot 20 feet from the building-- as if you couldn't do that yourself to save $20 a night. But hey, it's still almost half the price of the other midtown and downtown hotels, so you get what you pay for.Over Priced Rooms and under delivered service... Last night the room service showed up pretty quick but it was cold and I had to send it back. The second it took a little longer, and it came back slightly warmer - I guess the microwave was on the fritz. I didn't bother to send it back a third time, at that point I was tired and hungry from traveling that I just took it. Today when I came back from work, the only way that I could tell that they performed maid service was that the floor towel had been draped over the tub and I had fresh towels, I think. Maybe they just refolded the old ones and put them back, other than that the rest of the room wasn't touched. Now tonight I wanted to give them another chance and decided to stay in eat at their restaurant (because it is too damn cold outside and Detroit doesn't clean up snow like Chicago) in any event, the restaurant is supposed to be open until 11:00 PM - I was looking forward to a steak. It was closed, when asked, the front desk said ""oh yeah since we have so few clients tonight we decided to close it down, but I have some take out menus if you like.""I've had better experiences at Motel 6. The only reason I'm still here is that I leave Sunday - too much work to go to another place and, again, too cold.I hope this is not business as usual, because the main reason I'm is that I am working out of the  Detroit Regional office and and I can use the skywalks to get to the office without having to go outside. I'm sure I'll be - but only for work purposes. If I came to Detroit for pleasure I'd stay at the Holiday Inn.Oh yeah... I was given an complimentary breakfast - not steak.Now I am using the complimentary take out menu to order Chinese.Main problem was the noise and how staff dealt with the issue (not at all).  Around midnight, other patrons were screaming and throwing a party of some sort. Called the front desk numerous times and nothing was done.  My room was also uncomfortably warm (80).  When I mentioned this to the front desk they stated that the whole building only had heat and the AC was not turned on for the winter. Leaving the window open was the only way to cool the room.  Between hearing the traffic and others screaming down the hall, I did not get much sleep the day prior to an interview.  During breakfast, I asked for an english muffin and was given a bagel. This isn't a big deal, but just added to my frustrations.Had a little trouble w/ our first rooms AC. But overall the staff was friendly and helpful and the decor was vintage Detroit. Great location too. The burger from the restaurant was pretty good and room service was quick. I would definitely consider staying here again.I stayed here for a conference at Wayne State. Not impressed. Orange water came out of the faucet the first time I turned it on. Valet/bell desk did not greet me with a smile or help with bags. Very confused by the lack of costumer service. No real amenities.  The front desk attendants were nice and the building has some nice historic details. I would not rebook.While the reviews are mixed, we had a grand stay.  Newly renovated, this is a nice hotel.  Ate in the dining room and had excellent dinners.  The review that says ""no wifi"", they fixed that as well.I recently had one of the worst hotel experiences of my life at the St. Regis hotel in Detroit. They stole my laptop and wouldn't admit to it. The general manager even lied to me and tried to cover for his maid. Both employees should be fired.I stayed here for one night, and about 3 hours after checking out I realized I had left my laptop in my room. I called the hotel immediately to ask if they had found the laptop. I spoke to the general manager. He said he would call the head of housekeeping, who had already left for the day. He called me back about an hour later saying that they had cleaned the room but hadn't found anything, and that this meant I had not left the laptop there. I knew this wasn't true.I asked him to speak to the actual maid who had cleaned my room, which he said he would do the following day. I told him to tell her that I had a feature enabled on my laptop called ""Find My Mac,"" and that the next day when my company's IT admins were available they were going to log in and see on a map where the laptop was located. I told him to let the maid know that if it turned out that he or she had the laptop, I had every intention of pressing charges.The next day I spoke to the general manager again, who said that the laptop miraculously appeared in the laundry room, and he assured me that it was a total mistake; that the laptop had gotten wrapped up in the linen, and that no one intended to steal it. He then promptly shipped the laptop back to me.I received the laptop in the mail, and I can confirm that someone had indeed tried to steal the laptop and was obviously spooked by my threat. Upon turning the laptop on, I saw that someone had tried to create a guest ID and succeeded in logging in with it -- which I've never done.Obviously it was irresponsible of me to leave my laptop in the hotel room. Shame on me. Beware though: not only are the maids at this hotel likely to steal anything you leave behind, but more importantly, the manager is going to cover for them. The latter is completely unacceptable. Both employees should be fired.Tags: steal, stealing, thief, theft, despicable :)Pros-Clean sheets moderately priced for quasi-downtown Detroit locationshower was cleanCons-Centipede upon entrance to the roomElevator service was poorIce machine only on the 3rd floorThere is a $20 per night mandatory valet charge for parkinghad to get a room key re activated 3 timesI've now stayed at the St. Regis 4 times for business since September. I can safely say that the customer service from the valet, the front desk and at the bar have all been excellent. The condition of the hotel on the other hand has not been as stellar. While it has been updated, I've found that the rooms have not been cleaned as well as I would expect and something has always been broken, so far it's been the lock to the bathroom, the security latch on the door and the TV remote. Also, twice now the hot water was not working... try taking a freezing cold show in Detroit's winter months, not pleasant! It's a good location if you are looking to hang out in Midtown or New Center, especially because there is almost nowhere else to stay in these areas.Room Tip: If you need wifi, ask for a room near the elevator on the lower floorsA fine hotel if you want something quiet and out of the way. I have a soft spot for formerly grand hotels, so keep that in mind. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, although they haven room key to someone else, who walked in on me in bed. That should have been avoided.Beautiful hotel which has long since seen its glory days. It's super cheap (we paid $100/night), and it shows. But it's also gorgeous, the staff are friendly, and there are always taxis in front to take you anywhere. Caveat emptor, of course, but we've been super happy with our stay and we would happily visit the St. Regis again.For a place that seems to be presenting itself as a luxury hotel, it was quite mediocre. Internet is pathetic, barely functioning, don't be expecting to use it for anything but refreshing your email once an hour. The cleaning service was very subpar, after the first night I was there they didn't even clean anything, the next day they... tried. No fresh towels. No changed sheets. It started to feel gross.It's not in a particularly good area, nothing nearby to do, and it's a bit of a ways to downtown. Felt a little sketch walking around and a few cab drivers even warned me to stay inside after dark. Speaking of cab drivers, the front desk was nice enough to call be a cab whenever I needed but I later realized that I was being charged an extra, imaginary fee incurred because the cabby was ""the hotel's"". Otherwise the staff and concierge were very cordial, and the restaurant attached to the hotel was nice.Please Read!!...This is the worst hotel ever...No Stars (zero)...You are better off staying at a $30.00 motel off the side of the expressway...If you spend your money to stay here you are going to be piss off to the highest level...Where should I start; (1) the water from the sink takes 30mins to get hot unless you turn on the tub then it's only 15mins, (2) the towels are dingy, (3) the carpet is dirty, (4) the room wasn't clean, so we changed rooms, (5) the TV is from the late 80's (yes a 1985 bubble screen tv), (6) old and out dated furniture...So please forget about any good reviews...I paid people, and employees to assume a different name to say great things about my restaurant, so they probably did the same...DO NOT STAY HERE!!..UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES...You have been warned...St Regis Hotel in Detroit moto...""It's better to be piss off than piss on""...You will definitely be piss off and probably piss on by some rude, unknowledgeable, uncaring employee...So please take heed to this and stay far, far away from this hotel...You have been warned...Ever had that wtf moment wondering how any of what just happened actually really truly happened?! Try a night at the saint Regis. Valet is an actual inconvenience as the staff was completely lost and took an hour to pull my car up. Then in order to save time I went to check in. Sigh, I can't because the front desk attendant is parking cars. Right. Fast forward to a dump of a room and a tired old building. No clue how they charge what they do.Stayed at this hotel to see the World Series and it was much better than the reviews. Recently they have done some renovation and the room was great. Especially for the price, $139 per night during the World Series; it was awesome.The one downside the shower head wasn't great...but the beds were super comfortable and the blackout curtains covered the window 100%.Valet parking was only $14 per day and it was $10 taxi to downtown.The staff was super nice! While this was a boy weekend, my wife would love this hotel as well. Normally, I stay downtown in most cities but my next trip to Detroit will include a stay here!My friends Hotwired 3 rooms here and it was an overall pleasant experience. Nestled in ""Midtown"" Detroit, near the Wayne State Campus, the location is a short hike from downtown attractions, but is very close to WSU and the DIA. From the outside it looks pretty grand and preserved well in its aged appearance. I liked that the location in Midtown translated to a budget friendly $7 valet charge on the late-March Saturday night.The lobby is well-kept and looks nice as some more upscale hotels. The staff is friendly, but definitely in a brief and to the point manner. The rooms are just a tad on the small side, but are comfortable and reminded me of some 3-star rooms I have stayed at in NYC because of the etiquette of their bare and aged furnishings. My group was listening to music and enjoying cocktails in the room relatively loudly and we got no complaints, which was nice. We also did request to be put away from other occupied rooms, which may have helped the cause. The beds were basic, not the most comfortable I've seen in hotels, but they fared way better than the worst beds I've seen offered to the public.Overall, a solid Midtown Detroit hotel, basic in their room furnishings, well-kept lobby, decent staff, and budget valet parking. The area feels safe and the clientele is mostly friendly. I would recommend snagging this place if you need a hotel in the area.I arrived on a Thursday night. The part of Detroit that the hotel is located at is pretty deserted and dark - at least after sunset. I had a hard time figuring out which way to drive in for the valet parking and there was no one in sight when i arrived. I called the hotel reception desk and they sent someone out to help me. The inside of the hotel was quiet, as well. I felt like the only guest there. Check in was basic. I got a room on the fourth floor facing away from the street. The room was a nice size, comfortable bed, working heater, etc. The room was clean. No complaints there. I really enjoyed the location. It was a short drive to all downtown attractions and it was very easy to find my way back to the hotel everytime i ventured off to different areas of detroit or michigan. My 2 complaints are:1. my room didn't get serviced one of the days i was there. it sucks coming back to an unmade bed when you have been out all day walking and sightseeing.  I was told by one of the staff that i would get my iron switched since it didn't work and this never happened. luckily it wasn't absolutely necessary, but it would have been extra nice to iron my clothes. 2. there were a few rowdy neighbors 2 of the nights i was there. the walls are thin and i kept being woken up throughout the night. Overall, the hotel has a vacant feeling. they charge $14 per day for valet, but its 24hrs. location is good. nice rooms. staff is friendly. would stay here again, but i would definitely look into other places if i ever return to detroit for a trip.With the exception of the front desk, service here is some of the worst I have ever seen at a hotel, especially in the restaurant/bar.  The staff couldn't care less.  And if you need internet in your room, check whether you can connect as soon as you check in.  The internet doesn't ""reach"" to certain rooms.","OK, i'm relatively new to the yelp experience but I now have the forum to tell it like it is. Before I start, it's fair to mention that I stayed at this "" establishment "" in 2009 so perhaps things have changed. The area in which this place is located is the equal to a demilitarized zone. If you walk the streets, even in daylight, be sure to wear a suit of armor and say your novenas. The hotel itself offered nothing special. The rooms were borderline motel 6 quality. I hope that in the years since our last visit, things have changed for the better. I'm rather suspect....especially since i'm reading the same complaints on a few other posts.Where to start? I stayed here last night... The whole night I felt as if I were transported back to 1999. The old carpet, old furniture, tube tv that barely worked. I also went to get ice and realized there was no ice machine on my floor. I called the front desk and they told me they have one machine on the third floor. Why? Any decent hotel has an ice machine on every floor. The worst part was, my room was FREEZING. I woke up a few times because of how cold it was. And I had the thermostat set to 90 degrees. No room service after 11 which was disappointing. Lastly when I was leaving the elevator was out of service and I had to take the stairs 5 stories down. You'd be better off staying anywhere else...I really wanted to like this hotel. For all the exterior grandeur, it should be good. But I ended up leaving it halfway through my trip in sheer frustration. Here is a play-by-play of my ill-fated two nights at St. Regis. 1) Of two elevators, one was broken. I waited for it to arrive for about 5 minutes with all my bags before I realized it was broken. The desk clerk could see me that whole time and did not mention it. She was playing with her cell phone instead. I have to pee very badly. I finally press the other elevator button. 2) On to my room, #619. But what's this--it has not been thoroughly cleaned! Uh-oh. Hair on the sink, on the back of the toilet, crumpled up paper trash on top of the TV, and NO TOILET PAPER.  I really really had to pee. I'd been waiting since the airport. I considered peeing in the sink and drying on a towel, but decided to just get another room.3) I call and asked to be transferred to another room. No apology.I asked someone to bring a new key up. Answer: no. I had to come down and get a new key card. Okay. Waiting on that one working elevator again...4) Room #625. This new room was clean... except for one long black hair in the tub. But as I unpacked, *black ants* swarmed over my stuff, into my bag of rice cakes, and under the keyboard of my laptop. They appear to live in the walls. A bit unsettling. But I was like, no big deal. Ants. I can hang. They're not rats! I like ants. This is an old building that has been recently renovated.5) I'm an ice-cruncher, so I was looking forward to filling up a bucket of ice after peeing and putting the suitcases away. I peek in on the vending room. Just wires sticking out of the wall. No vending machines, no ice machine. I call downstairs. ""Where is the ice machine for the 6th floor, please?"" ""We don't have ice machines. You have to come downstairs and I'll give you some."" Starting to feel like I'm in a bad movie. Not a $150 a night hotel.6) I slept through the night, and worked hard the next day. Come back to the hotel, take a nap, and get up around 8pm. I'm a teacher and was trying to prepare some conference presentation materials. I needed a pair of scissors. So I went to the front desk. ""The last guests who borrowed scissors never returned them, so we don't have any available."" ""Really?"" ""Yes."" Desk clerk would not lend me scissors or a stapler. She claimed that there was NO scissors or staplers in the entire hotel. None. I stood around in postures of disbelief for a while, explaining how public education depended on my using a pair of scissors. No sympathy. No scissors. By this time, no stores nearby were open, and the front desk staff suggested I take a cab to a convenience store to buy a pair. 7) The hotel boasts free internet access in the rooms--score! I hate paying for internet. But their internet only works sometimes. For about ten minutes at a time. Then it goes out. Then I call downstairs. And they say the engineer is looking into it. Repeat X 5 over the course of the evening. Fun! The desk clerk loves me! I'm an entitled white lady, apparently.8) Finally, bedtime! Ah--this hotel is adjacent to the Detroit Police Dept. headquarters. Good. I'm safe. But, sirens scream by all night long. 9) About 3 am, my next door neighbors get in, and start having a party. There were at least 10 people in the room, yelling, laughing, and blasting music. I knocked on their door bleary-eyed to ask them to please keep it down.A young white man opened the door, wearing a yellow thong. He said he was sorry.I tried to go back to sleep but the party continued past dawn.10) At 7:30am housekeeping called. ""Did you want a service today?"" a woman asked. ""Yes,"" I replied. Um...don't expensive hotels always service your room unless you put Do Not Disturb on the doorknob?I told her about the ant problem. I asked her not to use any pesticides or spray chemicals as I have asthma. She said I would have to move rooms. No, I said, I've got all my stuff set up in that room and desk and the closet, moving would be too difficult to do a second time. Please just clean the room and clean up the ants you see, and I don't mind sharing the room with them.10) I get back from working at 4:30pm. I want to crawl into bed and nap. But... the room was dirty and bed unmade, as it was when I left it that morning. I called and asked for a housekeeper to come. Then I decided to take a long walk so they could do their work. When got back an hour later, no one had come. 11) I called downstairs again. ""They're on the way up."" Waited a while longer. Still no one. Then I decided to call and ask for the Manager. I waited on hold for about ten minutes. ""There's no manager available right now, Ma'am.""  ""Where is the manager?"" ""He's in a meeting. But you can wait for him downstairs."" I go down. I wait for two hours, checking in about every 20 minutes. Then, I take a cab to the Marriott.Oh I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this place! So back in October of last year I stayed here. Upon arriving I thought to myself ""oh wow better than what I was expecting."" That was just the first impression I got based on the exterior of the hotel. The lobby was nice but a bit shabbier than expected. The front desk clerk was helpful. So anyhow the first night was good...no complaints. The kicker and the reason why they are only getting one star is because my room was not cleaned!!! The morning I stepped out and had a full day of activities was looking forward to coming back to a clean room, take a nap and resume with the plans I had at night. But nope...got there and it was just like I left it. That had never happened to me...aren't hotels supposed to clean your room unless you specify that they don't??? I've stayed at plenty of Motel 6's, flea hole in the wall hotels and even they come in and clean up the room. So I was very displeased about that. To top it all off on the last night I was there, the fire alarm went off. We had to evacuate the building...not their fault I supposed but it still sucked! Note to whoever is running this place...YOU MUST CLEAN ALL THE ROOMS!! That's what customers are paying for...a nice clean room to sleep. Is that too much to ask for?A very nice little hotel.  Relaxing and a bit out of the way.  Great wait staff, nice comfortable rooms and a very good happy hour/bar.Whoa! The St. Regis! One would think top end, high-brow style. Which it is, but we didnt think that for Detroit we would actually get it for the bargain basement price of $67, includes taxes for 2 beds. This is and was a posh hotel in Detroit. Just because the city has seen better days means you cant get a fabulous deal on a great room! Well equipped, clean, updated rooms with super comfy beds. The bar was a little pricey for drinks, and they didnt serve breakfast, but well worth every penny. I cringe to think of the other places we ""could"" have stayed in the same price range. Good value.I specifically picked this hotel because it has good reviews on every website I check.  WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVERAnd I work for a international travel association so trust me on this one.  The place looks like it WAS one of those trendy hotels but due to shear lack of care, maintenance, and cleanliness it has fallen on rough times - just like this god forsaken city.First thing - I pull up to the hotel and almost mistake it for an abandoned building.  No valet, no lights, and the main entrance has been permanently moved to a pair of double doors you might think lead to a 1970's condo lobby.  As I wait in line (one person in front for 30 minutes), the ""driveway"" becomes completely packed with new guests arriving and still no valet.Finally at the front desk - takes another 30 min to get checked in - the clerk never once looks me in the face or says hello.  She hands me my room key and I make my way up to the 4th floor.  Unlock the door to find someone else is already in the room!  I go back to elevator but the button to go down has been ripped out of the wall - have to wait, go up, and then back down.  Go to the front desk, advise of the situation, they apologized (sorta) and said, ""Oh, this has never happened before.""Head back up to new room, open door, lights are on and two guys are in this room!  They told me the same happened to them.  At the front desk I tell them I don't feel comfortable staying in a hotel that's going to give my key out to the next guest who walks in.  They say they're sorry and completely ignore me.  Furious, I call up Travelocity, with whom I originally booked the reservation and spend the next hour + on the phone trying to find a different hotel.  Not once did any of the hotel staff approach me or offer any help, suggestions, or apologizes while I was in the lobby.AWFUL SERVICE, AWFUL HOTEL.Oh, they did find the valet after three hours - he was in the back smoking a dooby, or so the police said as they took him away...The front desk staff told me about the discount for HFH employees and then didn't bother to give me the discount.We stayed here Memorial Day weekend 2013,the place was nice and remodeled.Pretty close to downtown with car (5-10min.), too far to walk in to town.Area was mostly office buildings so as expected it was empty.Nothing really to do around there besides Fisher Theater.Staff in the restaurant was really nice and the front desk staff were Ok.Elevator seemed to not work once when we were in it so we thankfully got out before being stuck dont know how many times these get stuck, but we were lucky to get out and take the stairs from 6th floor nothing too major. Last night we got in kinda late and tipsy only to see both our key cards didnt work kinda a drag to go down elevators again to tell staff that our keys didnt work.It wouldve been nice to have a quick apology from staff behind desk but ehh... whatvever we were tipsy so our fault no wait both our faults.Rooms were clean when we got there and we had new towels and sheets after we got back so Cleaning Staff get a high grade from us.The shower water was cold one morning but I waited a half hour then let run for awhile and wallah got STEAMING HOT!!!Its a nice Hotel so if you are looking at it on priceline or travelocity the Hotel is nice and what not worth 80-100 bucks a night.If you don't read it all, please read the LAST paragraph!! What a disaster! We booked the St. Regis for price and convience. We should have been less cheap and book elsewhere. As soon as we got out of the car we were 'greeted' by a man asking for money. I am a NYer so I am used to seeing homeless and poor. However there was no one to remove this man from the entrance to the hotel. We were told it was Valet ONLY at $14 overnight. The lot we would find out later is behind the building, where the parking lot is littered with broken glass from other car windows, and not secure at all.When I was checking in the clerk was polite and paged another person to see what room was free. She gave us our key and we went to the 4th floor. From first glance we thought the hotel wasn't ""too bad for Detroit"". When we got to the room there was NO soap &amp; NO Towels. We let them know and went out to explore the town. When we returned to change for the concert we were heading to North of Detriot we found we still had no soap or towels. We also found out that on a Saturday night the Bar / Restaurant was closed. As well as no working ATM. 3 of us went to the concert and one person stayed in the room. They were able to hear NUMEROUS fights between other rooms. Once again he called to ask for towels and was told they would be sent right up. (They never were). The Coffee pot in the room had no coffee, mugs, or anything to make it work. The Alarm clock radio did not work and later that evening we would find out that the AC did not work either. The windows (that have no screens) opened. When we returned to the hotel at 1am after our concert, there was no valet, and I parked in the ONLY available parking that was the lot full of glass. Once we walked towards the lobby we were questioned by men sitting on top of cars in the front of the hotel of what was in our bags... Talking about feeling unsafe and uncomfortable... We were nervous and out numbered. We made it inside to ask once again for the towels / soap and about the AC. We over hear another customer trying to find another hotel to stay in, because of his disatisfaction with St. Regis. He was unable to find a room, so we knew then- we would have to stay for the night. THEN walks in the DAY Receptionist (who checked us in) in a BATH ROBE!!! She was staying there!! She needed towels also. When the clerk gave us the towels she did with a sigh and radioed to another person that they were ""out of towels again""We slept for 4 hours and checked out. ""Slept"" is a word I use loosely... there was people screaming in the hotel, someone tried their key card in our door a few times, and the window having to be open because of the lack of AC made the room bright and loud. When we checked out the clerk had on her suit jacket... no visible top under it and PJ bottoms on.... FINALLY the end of this story is that the credit card I put on file for incidentals was USED 9 days later in the hotel!!! I called and they said I used it in the resturant the PRIOR day... I was not there!! I am in NY.... then they hung up on me. I had to cancel the card and file a report! DO NOT STAY HERE!I forgot to review this after my trip to Detroit last month.All in all, a really nice hotel, with friendly and attentive staff.  I think the place was recently remodeled - with very classy furniture and decor.  In other words, a nicer place than I am used to.  The bar looked pretty swank, but I didn't make it down, because I wanted to check out other Detroit spots.The hotel rooms were small, but comfy.  The beds were amazing - like sleeping on a cloud.  There was also an iPod deck, which was great for the impromptu hotel room dance parties.  Reasonably priced for the amenities.  Though the room service menu was incredibly expensive - +$7 for a bowl of cereal?  You can't be serious.  Good location in Detroit, within walking distance of good spots in the Midtown area and the lakefront.I stayed here last year and this place was way better than I expected.  It had just gone through a renovation and everything was modernized and fairly elegant.  The staff was very friendly and the valet service was quick.  The restaurant there had really good food, bar had great drinks and they even had a piano player serenading the listeners in the bar.  The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were good for a solid sleep.  I also really liked the iPod decks they had, which made it convenient to listen to my music in the comfort of my room. Would definitely recommend for anyone who visits Detroit and wants to be away from all the noise downtown; but still be close enough that they're only a five to ten minute cab ride away from anything in the city.I haven't had the opportunity to stay at the St.Regis but I brunch here often. Obviously if I'm going often, me likey!! The ambiance is beautiful. This hotel has had some recent renovations which has made it worth the pricey brunch. To start, you can have your OJ straight or with wine also known as a Mimosa. The brunch buffet is a free for all! You have a continental style breakfast table with croissants, danishes, fruit and bagels. The next table is for you carnivores, all the bacon, sausage patties and links, ham and turkey you want. There are two chefs that prepare fresh omelette's while you wait. You also have your choice of grits, oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, cold cereals and lots more. I often meet up here with friends whom I haven't seen in a while. The brunch will run you about $24.99 per person. Check Sunday's paper for $10 off coupons. The wait staff is usually pretty on point, the valet is always a plus and I recommend making reservations for parties larger than 6. Even though it's pricey for a brunch (especially without the coupon) I think it's worth it.I really wanted to like this place as I thought maybe it had some glamour back in the day but I got bed bug bites from my room! Stay away from room 410!",,,"['weekend', 'eastern', 'market', 'booked', 'several', 'weeks', '114', 'night', 'price', 'fine', 'needed', 'comfy', 'place', 'sleep', 'amp', 'shower', 'worked', 'based',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/roberts-riverwalk-hotel-detroit-detroit-2,Roberts Riverwalk Hotel Detroit,2.5,$$,73,"Just spent the weekend at Roberts Riverwalk hotel and we had a lovely time. We paid for a standard double but had two incredibly comfortable king sized beds. Plenty of hot water  and good water pressure. We also happened to have lovely views of the river from our room on the fourth floor. Even though it was winter each night before dinner we enjoyed a stroll along the riverwalk with the sun setting and the moon rising. The staff was friendly and helpful and while check-in could have been faster the receptionist, was as nice as could be and was working by herself taking calls from potential guests while arranging our room. The lobby is beautiful and elegant with a 1940s charm-  big windows overlooking the river which had large chunks of ice floating down it (January) and a massive marble fireplace. It was cold outside but we were cozy inside- and in our room the temperature was easy to modulate- unlike so many hotel rooms. We like it cool while we sleep but want it warm as we pad around  in the morning drinking coffee.Friday night after a great evening out we went down to the hotel lounge. 8-10 people were line dancing to Motown music and they were amazing! They absolutely knew how to dance and it was a great pleasure to get to see them. We had been planning to just spend one night but we were so favorably impressed we bought tickets to the Detroit Opera House for Saturday and arranged a second night.The second night we tried the restaurant and while it was a bit of a wait to get our food the cook was very good- even the broccoli was al dente faintly touched by garlic and olive oil- delicious. Yes there were things that were not perfect- it was slightly down at the heels here and there - chip on the enamel bath tub, a drywall repair poorly done, but overall it is a Phoenix rising from the ashes. Fabulous!We absolutely plan on making a return visit in warmer weather so that we can tour the Riverwalk on our bikes- there is even a side path Dequindre Cut that goes to the Eastern Market the best for a Saturday morning.The positives: 1. A very big room!  Which was great since we were traveling with our two kids (4 and 10mo). So they had room to run around a little bit. 2. Um...there's a chance you'll have a room that looks out over the river (we didn't have that luck - we had a view of the parking lot). 3. The breakfast was good. Slow but good. It's not included with the price of the room though.The negatives/could be betters: We had a leaky faucet in the bathroom. The sink had a crack in it and leaked on the floor. There were a handful of unfinished patched holes in some doors. The beds were really lumpy. No extra pillows (yes, I know, we could've asked but we were tired and didn't). When we came back one night, we got off the elevator and were greeted by a wave of pot smoke. My 4 year old looked at us and said, ""woah! Where's the skunk?"" We asked him to look for it. Made for a fun game. The maid staff didn't provide new soaps. This is petty but there wasn't a little guide to tell us which channels were which. Normally not an issue but when it's Saturday morning and your kids are antsy - it'd make life 30 seconds happier knowing where PBS kids might be. All in all, it didn't live up to the price tag paid for a couple nights there. The biggest surprise was the quality of the food!Julia was great at the front desk! Super friendly and helpful. Went out of her way to fix some things for us. Everyone else was great, too, actually, except for the rude ass older lady working the day shift on 12/30/15.We came to said lady, letting her know:-the room had no hot water -one sink faucet handle didn't work-the room was supplied with only the very end of a toilet paper roll-we needed a 'do not disturb' signShe treated us like the monsters we are and we had to wait for Julia to help us out later on. We'll visit again, but hopefully that lady cleans up her act.Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Another guest walked in on us having sex. Holes in the ceiling.  30 minutes to check in. Hotel needs a serious upgrade. Hotel offers ten dollar champagne and breakfast and the restaurant knew nothing about it.  Save your money. Don't book this place please.I checked in late that Thursday (11/26/15) night and off the bat I was nervous driving towards the parking lot because I saw the sign that said ""park at your own risk"". I have NEVER been to an establishment that had such an off putting sign ESPECIALLY since you OFFER no other options for parking. Where else was I supposed to park my car? Because it was late and I had my 2 year old in the car, I drove to the front and not only was there no bell man there were no closer parks. So I had to drive back around and fortunately I saw someone leave a park that was a little closer so I took it. Because it was so late, I was rushing to get in the hotel and I was happy to see a few people leave out so we weren't out there alone. As soon as I got inside, there was no one to great me or offer to help me with my luggage. Because there was no elevator, I had to drag my luggage and a cranky toddler up the stairs. Once in the lobby, the receptionist was pleasant enough, but when I got to my room, things began to change for the worst. After attempting to reach the front desk, I noticed that I had a the wrong phone in my room. I was in 205 and the phone said 203. I was trying to call down to ask for allergy free pillows, but because the phone did not work, I had to use my cell phone. I requested pillows and the lady said they would see if they had some, but she never came upstairs or returned my class. Secondly, housekeeping knocked on my door TWICE and opened the door while me and my son were sleeping between 9-10 am the next morning. I have NO idea why since check out was not until 11:00. Once he was up, he would not go back to sleep. Thirdly, when I returned to my car, not only was it broken into and suffered over 200.00 worth of exterior damage, money and a few valuables were stolen. When I called the front desk, no one came out to assist me at all. I had to go INSIDE to request a broom to clean up the glass. Additionally, I was not offered any type of compensation for my troubles. I asked where there cameras in the parking lot and I was told no even though there was BIG SIGN saying that you had CCTV. I was also told that security drives around nightly and I did not see anyone at all as I was coming from the parking lot. The manager NEVER came out to offer ANY assistance after my ordeal. Being from Chicago, I am not familiar with Detroit and it was very frustrating having to figure out what to do. It was only after my sister requested to see him that Mr. Evans (the manager on duty) appeared and needless to day he was MORE than unprofessional. He lied about when he found out about the incident, REFUSED to comp my room, and implied that if I was staying an extra day he might be willingly to comp me (when asked about it later, he lied that he did not say that even though my sister, brother and the front desk lady Shelia heard otherwise). He did offer to buy us lunch from the downstairs bar but that was only offered AFTER we talked about how unprofessional he was. Lastly, I called back to request the contact info from Sheila and as of today, I have NEVER heard back from your establishment.Roberts Riverwalk hotel is NOT only UNSAFE, they don't treat your customers well. Attached is pictures of the damage and FALSE advertising of CCTV'sI thought this place had some potential. Nicely decorated throughout, but the small things added up. Cold water didn't work in the sink. Hot water didn't work in the shower. Phone didn't work. Then there was a nice wake up call at 2:30am from a couple of guys trying to get into the room. Seems there was a mix up at the front desk and the room was double booked. Buyer beware. You do get what you pay for.I'll agree with everyone else, it's a really pretty hotel. Because it's Detroit and because of how things are going, I'm not going to be super critical. I reserved a large river view room with 2 queen beds. We came in late, around midnight and had no problem checking in. The room was exactly as pictured, which I feel never happens these days. I tried a few websites for the best price, but really wanted a river view and the price wasn't crazy. The room we were in (127) was situated on the corner of the hotel and gave us a pretty view of the Detroit river and Canada (which is across the river).  That being said, cell phone service was really tricky, but manageable.We weren't around long enough to eat at the restaurant or order room service, but I will say there is orange juice served every early morning as well as fresh water with lemon at all times. The reception staff was on duty 24 hours a day, which was nice and the few times we called we were serviced promptly. The only downsides is that our room could have been tended to a little better. The tops of the curtains were super dusty and the faucet in the shower came off. The sink in the bathroom only had cold water, which someone said they were ""waiting on a part""....when that will come, who knows. The televisions were large and we had 2 in the room. The channels were so so , but who comes to a hotel to watch tv?I'd come back and probably try to request a higher floor, although it did make everything manageable walking back and forth from the front of the hotel.Great room, great view, great location. The representative was really helpful, as I shared my concerns w her from reading other reviews. She was honest and made sure our stay was going to be comfortable as possible.Complaints from other reviews: water temperature, room temperature &amp;TV reception I look at it like this. You get what you pay. This place was very reasonable compared to $150-$275 a night.Horrible customer service and the hotel and grounds are in disrepair. The security (who are in place due to numerous break-ins to cars which the hotel will do nothing about) was extremely rude and inappropriate. What a shame, amazing setting but it cannot make up for the poor management/ownership!Has to be the most unprofessional establishment I have ever been too.The place looks really nice on the inside, and that's about the only good thing I can say. Upon arriving to see other people waiting in a lobby, that has a bootleg check in desk. I didn't know what I had gotten myself into. I counted 5 guests that were overbooked that were already angry. Some like myself had been given keys to rooms only to find out that someone was already sleeping in the rooms. Talk about dangerous! Then they don't even want to take responsibility for their own mistakes. The management had no real answers for me or the steady stream of customers that continued to file in with their useless reservations. I will be posting again in a few days after I talk to the general manager. Driving from out of town, with kids and risking strangers coming in your room with a key is a no go for me.When using a groupon to dine here...warning print it first! They do not accept the phone scan! Handicap enter on front ramp to the left of doors.  It was locked. I ran in, downstairs, to door to unlock the door. Service was outstanding!The gal was terrific with what limited menu she is given! View terrific! Potential for an outstanding restaurant. Steak bites were very good! Homemade mashed, fresh green beans. The lobby ladies could not be nicer! Good bones, great staff, listen to their needs for improvement !Shower temp bad, outlets not workingI kept trying to find the catch here because it was such a reasonable rate, but I couldn't find one. Everything was clean, and everyone was helpful. It was a little quirky, but that's more enjoyable to me than a cookie cutter Day's Inn. Unfortunately I didn't get to spend as much time here as I wanted to, since it was just a short trip. I would love to come back and check out the live music.An absolute nightmare.  Security guard in parking lot is aggressive and psychotic.  Front desk is indifferent and unconcerned.  Ownership and management are liars.  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> refunded my money but I was still out $300 for damage caused to my vehicle by their security guard.The could be a real Jewel in the heart of Detroit, under different management.  If you read most of the reviews, you will realilze how little management cares about your stay or planned event.  Front desk staff are very nice, but with little or very slow WIFI, check in takes about 30 minutes and most of the time, your room assignment will be incorrect.  There is literally No staff around to ask for anything regarding your room.  The room we booked was very nice, however, I heard several guests complaining about the air conditioning not working in their rooms.By all means, DO NOT book a wedding at Roberts.  They will promise you the moon and cant possibly deliver.  Unprofessional, inexperienced waitstaff, horrible food preparation (dont let the taste test fool you), no coffee service, bread plates, no ice or water service at dinner, just complete lack of professionalism.  Even the hotel grounds have no landscaping.  Weeds and cigarette butts were found everywhere around the hotel.  They don't take any responsibility for under-estimating food count, losing the wedding cake, running out of liqour and beer...etc.  My advice is  to pick somewhere else in downtown Detroit.  What it could be and what it is are Years apart unless management changes.Very pretty hotel, sort of vintage.  It has a lot of potential but bad administration. Morales hours for check in. The hotel overlooks the river and next is Canada, nice view. We stayed in a king suite which was ok, my friends had a penthouse which obviously was nicer. TV cable sucked quality was bad . Do not order room service. The guy was extremely rude and asked to pay him cash cause "" it's easier "" and then said "" your lucky because this is the last room service of the day "" ( it was 10A) I paid almost $30 for many items from Which I only got half, missed a fruit bowl plus another OJ, and when I called to let re guy know he missed those he said first tried to tell meHow the continental breakfast was only oatmeal and OJ when the menu listed oatmeal, OJ or milk, fruits or granola, etc. then to avoid discussion he said ok I'll send it for $2.40, which then sent me toast which wasn't what I had ordered. When I complained to management they dismissed me quickly. It's supposed to run till 11p however I called at 9 and it ""Was closed early today"". I would recommend another hotel for the price.This hotel used to be nice...keywords...USED TO BE. I stayed here previously when this hotel was the Omni. From the moment we pulled up, we knew things had changed. Gone is the valet. Gone is the bellhop. There isn't even a sign to tell you where to park. In the parking lot,  there was a Detroit Police car with a half-primer colored hood. Ummm...SKETCHY! The lobby was okay. The staff was nice. As soon as we got into the elevator,  we knew things were going to go downhill. The walls in the elevator looked like plywood with no paint. The elevator was noisy and moved like a sloth! We got into our room and the smell was terrible!  It smelled like someone poured a gallon of bleach in the room and then left. There were holes in the drop down ceiling when you walk in. The sheets were stained. The furniture was very damaged. The whole thing felt sketchy. Luckily, the friendly front desk staff let us checkout and get a full refund and we moved hotels. It's sad considering that this hotel is right by the river, in what used to be a beautiful building.The staff were friendly, rooms clean, and it is a great location. Unfortunately, we didn't have hot water in our room and had to take a cold shower. We didn't have time to call the front desk because we were in a hurry. We told them on our way out and they apologized. This hotel was a good deal with a beautiful view.Boutique hotel right on the river in a quiet section of town. Great location. The rooms have beautiful floor to ceiling windows, high ceilings and are well appointed. Parking is included in the rate. It is an older building that has been nicely renovated. We will stay there again. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> reservation was under 100 a nightWhen i booked the room it was suppose to come with a pull out couch and a fridge but my room sidnt have eaither. There was hair on the bed. I left a few personal items in the room after i had checked out. I called shortly after leaving the hotel to let them know i left my belongings. The front desk said she would call me back when house keeper went to the room and she never called me back.","I highly suggest you stay elsewhere if possible. We had so many problems with this hotel. I arrived for a family reunion and came to find they would not allow early check in, which would have made sense however there were already about ten couples waiting, it was 2:45PM, and check in started at 3pm. Instead of being smart and checking in as they came, they let it back up. Then they were so slow it took an hour for us to even get to the check in desk once they finally started checking people in, only to be told we had no reservation. We called and confirmed our reservation twice, and this happened to three other families staying in our group as well. Thank god for Venus, part of hotel management, for working things out for us rather than the rude woman at the check in desk who told us it wasn't her problem. In fact, most of the employees are generally rude. We met about three who were nice (the cook in the restaurant, Venus, and a housekeeper). The rest were just nasty and obviously didn't value the fact that they had a job.  We had to go get new keys every day because, as others have said, they stopped working. There is practically no air conditioning. The live jazz on the terrace was nice until it was past 10 and we wanted to go to sleep.The shower only had one temperature: boiling hot.If you're only looking for a pretty venue, this is a great place for pictures. Just as long as you don't stay the night, expect them to find your reservation, expect polite staff, air conditioning, or anything any other hotel, even a basic Motel 6, would have.They do not deserve even one star.  Worst hotel EVER.  No hot water, rude staff, disgusting conditions.  Only phone that works is in bathroom. No vending machines.  Despicable.  Awful, awful, awful.   Nasty.  Run away.  Wouldn't stay here for free or cash bonus.What is a hotel that cannot honor a reservation made a month ago? Not much of a hotel... No notice, just arrived at 2 am to have receptionist say reservation was cancelled by hotel due to overbooking and that no, no one tried to contact us about it. No room, no manager on duty, no arrangement with other hotel, nothing but ""sorry for the inconvenience.""I would not stay here again.Nice rooms, inept staff. They spent 5 hours checking me in after messing up their reservations. As I sat waiting in the lobby, they repeatedly asked how I could have messed up since it surely wasn't their fault.Later that night a different staff member asked me why I was never checked in properly, as they had an open room left vacant under my name.ProsNice location on the waterSoft bedsDecent water pressureGreat bar downstairs with friendly bartendersConsIncompetent reservation systems/staffLimited hot waterPhones won't connect to the front deskStrange building configuration - a neighboring room had a window looking straight into our roomHousekeeping service didn't pick up towels or refill the shampoo, they only made the bedTo sum up this review, Robert's Riverwalk is extremely mediocre. The room was good, but can give a ""Scooby Doo"" vibe because the lighting is very dim. If you have kids, this probably isn't the best place to stay because it is far away from everything, and you still have to walk through a not-so-nice neighborhood to even get to the Riverwalk. This hotel is also missing a lot of things that you would normally find at a big hotel, such as room service, a good television, and fast service. The front desk staff was slow, but they managed to get us a good cab to the airport at 4am. This surprised us because they seemed to be slow and kind of lazy when it came to everything else. Even the maid service made the bed while leaving things under the sheets, like the television remote, which just made the staff seem even more lazy. Also, the last night we stayed, the lady at the front desk thought it was too cold in the lobby, so she shut off the air conditioning in the WHOLE HOTEL. on a hot, humid summer day in Michigan, this was AWFUL. Next time I stay in Detroit I will definitely stay at the Double Tree or Marriott because my stay here was not up to par. If you are staying more than one or two nights, or plan on actually doing things in downtown, I suggest you stay elsewhere.The parking was a little confusing if you're coming from the back way so be careful with that. My time spent here was short but sweet. There was a beautiful view of the river from my room as well as the lobby which was also pretty gorgeous as well. The customer service was as helpful as could be. We called ahead of time about the shuttle and when we got there were told the shuttle wasn't running (on a Saturday) later in the evening come to find out the cleaning woman is also the shuttle driver and it was available that day only when she had free time though. Aside from that there was no problems with the employees. As for the rooms our phones didn't work and we were told someone was going to come up and fix it but never did, but I mean we had our cell phones so no big deal. The room did smell a little at first but they're remodeling so that was the cause, the air was acting weird but they have people working on that as I type. &amp; there was paint chipping and wall paper coming off the walls but it wasn't really that noticeable. Other than all that I had a nice time I got to stay in My room and watch a nice flat screen and the restaurant in the basement was delicious(get the senior burger platter with everything it's delish). Little tip though if you are y'all be careful in the bathrooms cause the ceilings are a little lower. I'm 5'10 and hit my hand on the ceiling while changing and showering. So just be careful. I will return thoughShort story: Horrible customer service, I never even made it into my room. Do not stay here.Details: My colleague and I reserved rooms 2 months in advance of our stay. I called the hotel to confirm my reservation the day prior to check-in (based on some of the reviews here, I wanted to make sure everything was on track for a successful stay), and was told I was confirmed. I called later that day to ask if there is a shuttle from the hotel (there isn't), and upon arrival in Detroit the evening of my check-in I called a third time to try and set up a shuttle ride the next morning to a local destination (the shuttle doesn't start until 9am, which wasn't early enough for me).When we arrived at the hotel, we were told our rooms were not available due to a water main break that occurred over 24 hours ago. I asked why no one reached out to me with this news (they said they did but when I didn't pick up my phone, they didn't bother to leave a message). I asked why no one told me about this the THREE times I called prior to my arrival. They could not answer my questions.They made alternate reservations for us at a hotel 23 miles away - and they were not willing to pay for my taxi rides during my stay (I had no car). This was not an equivalent accommodation.I ended up getting a room at the Marriott (also located downtown, not 23 miles away) for roughly 5-times the price of this hotel. I asked The Roberts Riverwalk to pay for my Marriott hotel bill, and they, of course, declined to do so.SAVE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY!!! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!Room key system didn't work. Had to have an employee walk us to our room and unlock the door.Water pressure was terrible. Could not take a decent shower. Water was still running in the tub. Room was FREEZING!Other guest were LOUD. No smoking hotel, yet guests were smoking. I'm asthmatic. Purchased ""free breakfast"" package, only to be told, ""we don't serve breakfast no more""Please don't stay here. Only one star because the staff was nice/pleasant.Stayed here 3 to 4 years ago when in town for a Wings game... was nice then...very dingy dirty and smelly now. Got a refund from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and went to Motor City instead.  NOT WORTH YOUR MONEYClean, spacious rooms; wonderful views of the river; great value overall. This family owned hotel is a comfortable place to stay in Detroit. We stayed at the Double Tree when we last visited, but I'd much rather give my money to a locally-owned establishment than a chain. We enjoyed a handful of bars and restaurants in walking distance, such as Atwater Brewery, Andrew's on the Corner, and They Say. Shuttle service is available, but we decided to walk or drive instead. Brunch smelled delicious but we opted for breakfast and Bloody Marys at the Grand Trunk on Woodward. The full bar in the basement includes a pool table and nice views of the river, but it was a bit pricier than I would have expected. We will definitely return to the Roberts next time we visit Detroit.Well, this is interesting. I think I have offended some minor deity and my stay here is penance.The Good: high ceilings, bay windows, a fairly decent Queen bed, good view of Windsor. And we paid for a King bed too. Windsor, as in Wndsor-across-the-river-in-another-country-where-I-wish-was. (side note: the maintenance man wears Fruit Of The Loom tightly whiteys, and I know this as his back end is currently waggling at me from the ceiling) some of the places I've stayed in Mexico with the bullet holes and the guard at the door with the handlebar mustache would be preferable to this place right now.Why? Well, first, there is the aforementioned maintenance man.  We've been here two hours and he's just now starting to work on the AC in the room.  I was a little miffed at them taking so long to sending someone up to fix it, after several calls and their EternaHold call avoidance methods to the front desk, so I decided to vist them personally. Kudos to the flamboyant guy at the front desk and rolling with every hit I gave him.  Well played sir, I have met my match in trolling with you.  Tis is how the conversation went, mostly.""Hi! I'm in room 428, it's hot and getting hotter. We've called a couple of times about the AC and the leak in the ceiling. The good news is that the water has stopped pooling in the entrance to the room and is now going through the hole in the floor to the room below.""Some bare excuse about how the maintenance guy got the call and he'd be there eventually.(maintenance man just told me the water is from the wounded AC unit)""Okay, I'm an engineer and I don't know anything about cooling systems, but I can takes a look at it if you're okay with that.""Guy at the desk brightens up and agrees. Whoa... I need to step up my game.""Sure, I'll see what I can do. There probably won't be any damage. Where are the fire extinguishers?""Guy at the desk tells me to go for it and there are extinguishers on each floor. This guy is good. Another guy walks up and has appranetly caught bits of the conversation. He has that I'm In Charge look and is much brainier than the Mister Oblivious guy at the desk. He reaches for a radio and we're on our way back to the room with Fruit Of The Loom guy, who is a rather pleasant person when he isn't waggling at you.This is a review in progress, so we'll see what the next stage of our adventure will be.I didn't stay at the hotel, this review is just for the bar area. I was here for a function and had wanted a drink. I love a good hotel bar. The people were great (bartenders, kitchen staff) -- I'll give them that. But the drinks are WAY overpriced. This is a bar in a hotel off the beaten path, nice view of the riverwalk from a basement point of view... nice lil patio, which has summertime potential. But I paid $8.48 for a short bloody mary. Really?That being said, I hung out and had some more drinks after the function I was attending was over. Good times with the folks behind the bar, good drinks and GREAT fries. There is live music on Weds nights, which would be great, except for the high prices of the drinks. NO internet service on my phone here  :-(Stayed here for the Orion Fest 2013. From beginning to end everyone was very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the shuttle driver. Room has tall ceilings and plenty of room. Room was very clean upon arrival. All new sheets and towels. Now there is no fridge, microwave, iron, or hair dryer. And the in room safe was unavailable, cable tv with no movie channels or any pay-per-views of any kind. We woke up late on Monday and checked out an hour late with no extra charge. Really appreciated this!!! All in all a really good experience for Detroit and this hotel, would return again. And the A/C was all kinds of cold throughout the stay. We were on the first floor near the lobby.We stayed here for a night on my first visit to Detroit, attending a wedding. We like to support locally owned businesses, so when I was able to reserve a room here for $115, I checked out some reviews and went for it.The hotel itself is gorgeous and historic, with vintage charm. Beautiful high ceilings and tall windows. I loved the dim lighting and classic furniture. It definitely brought some character I wouldn't have found at a chain. This aspect of it allowed me to forgive many of the shortcomings of the management and other parts of our stay.Parking was free for guests, but the valet lot (where we parked) was pretty tough to get to, and the pavement was cracked and filled with potholes. I didn't really mind, but my boyfriend was a little annoyed.The location is kind of out of the way, in a warehouse area that gets pretty dark and deserted at night. Nothing really walkable other than a brewpub a few blocks away, so we opted to stay in when we left the wedding reception.Check-in was a pretty slow process, but I'm guessing that's because of the big event that was apparently going on. It was inconvenient, but the staff was friendly and accommodating when they did serve us. Check-out was simple and quick.We stayed on the 4th floor and opted to take the stairs most of the time, because the elevator is pretty slow. The carpets were a bit stained, and the tub looked dirty. I don't think it actually *was* dirty, it was just old. The lobby was super hot and stuffy, which made me worried that the air conditioning wasn't working, as some reviewers had stated. But our room was cool and comfortable. The bed was clean, spacious, and comfy.Like I said, I appreciate charm, character, and history. Roberts Riverwalk Hotel has all three. If you are looking for a perfect stay, this probably isn't your place. Some of the poor reviews here do point out some justifiable issues. However, it was affordable, safe, and clean for an older hotel. I would stay here again.DO NOT STAY HEREI booked 15 rooms here while it being close to my wedding venue.  I was curious why my venue did not recommend using this hotel, but I after my stay I can see why.  I had such high hopes for this place and they were crushed as soon as I spoke to someone.Customer service- Robert's Riverwalk had the worst customer service I have ever experienced in a hotel.  There were a few male employees that were very helpful, but for the most part it seemed like it was everyone's first job dealing with customers.  I had about over 15 rooms booked at this hotel because of my wedding and any small request I had they couldn't promise me anything.  They acted like even just checking me or any of my party in was a big deal to them.  In fact, I had one employee named Talasha who put her hand in my maid of honors face when trying to help her locate a name on the paper in front of her. The staff here needs to be trained and managed better.Room Quality- 2 of the rooms used were not able to use the phone and call the front desk, my lamp was broken, I had wall paper peeling off the walls., my Maid of Honor's toliet and bathtub were busted, and the list could continue.Food- It would be good if someone's mother cooked it for me.  I would never waste my money on their food again.Summary-  This hotel has potenital.  It's a great location but it needs to be better managed!I will begin with the pros:The hotel is clean. The bed is soft. The hotel has free parking and was easy to find. My hot water never ran out and the pressure of the shower head was relaxing. No one stole anything from my room or my car. Cons: Continental breakfast ends at 9AM? It's Sunday morning. For almost $150 a night I expected many more amenities. This wasn't a horrible experience by any means. I just feel like for the price I could have done waaaaaay more valuable things with my money. I ate at all these nice restaurants and wasted all my leftovers because there is no refrigerator (as advertised). There's a safe (as advertised)  in the room but no key. Allegedly you can receive all these features according to the website when I booked but when I peek around, I can't any of said amenities. Check-in time is ??????? Check out time is ??????? I prefer to stay hotels like this with some personality instead of Holiday Inns usually. The staff was friendly but the check-in process was confusing. No mention of the continental breakfast - when it was served and where. There is no literature in the rooms to inform the guests where to locate these services. The staff was friendly and personable. Under any other circumstances I would have found them enjoyable company, but I'm paying $150 a night and I can't figure out where anything is and when to expect it.  Also, there are two phones in the room and neither of them work. Cable has channels but it's so basic, after surfing through a few times, I gave up and went to bed only to wake up completely disappointed that my leftovers from Slow's BBQ are now expired (because there is no fridge, as advertised). Summary: In downtown Detroit, either go big or go home. Basically $200/night will give your an impressive experience or $60-$70 will give you a minimal/scary stay. I guess $150 is the ""Goldilocks Zone."" No one will steal your car, your bed will be soft, but don't expect breakfast or any volunteered information about what you are paying for at the Roberts Riverwalk. Not bad, just meh. In the time it took me to write this, my coffee is now cold. I'll just heat it in the invisible microwave that was advertised in the Expedia ad.If ur lukn for a mozy wozy place and a trip bac to 1950, the bthrm is lik somethg from a bad verison of harlem nghts ,thn this is ur place ,it sucks big time ,if wnt to jus lay ur head and go n the morning this is ur place .....other than tht donot go thr. This place has the essence to be grt ,but much needed renovating is needed ,nice view of the river ....The Roberts Riverwalk hotel is staffed with unprofessional, untrained and uncaring personnel. A recent stay at this hotel almost ruined my vacation. It seemed the staff went out of their way to be incompetent. They never seemed to know anything about anything. I decided to to talk to the hotel dotcom which I had used to reserve my hotel room to settle a problem with the hotel, a rocking party was going on underneath my room, and the hotel management intentionally hung up on the travel agency representative twice. Incredible they would screw with the service that brings them hotel guests. When I was checking in, the hotel staff had a serious attitude problem - for absolutely no reason. Every question was received with rolled eyes and a sneer. When I was checking out, the hotel staff couldn't figure out the procedure for pre-paid hotel guests. That situation seems to be so uncomplicated everywhere else I've stayed. The owners should be ashamed.I'll never stay here again.I recently stayed here for a Lions game and after reading all the reviews here on Yelp I really wanted to give this hotel some much needed credit. The hotel is located a little outside of the downtown hussle and bussle but it was a quick shuttle ride to the game! The shuttle is also FREE from the hotel. I will warn you make sure you are downstairs waiting for it and plan to have a few loads before you. We did take a cab back to the hotel and it was less than $10. Room was nice and clean, the staff was pleasent and helpful. Overall I would recommend this hotel to others and it was a great value since all we really wanted was a bed to sleep in. I will say don't bother with the food-bar area downstairs. They seemed to be over worked and nothing like the service we received at the reception desk.If you like historic vintage charm with lack of cleanliness and actual amenities, then this is your place. The staff was actually amazing! My wife calls this place janky, and I'm pretty sure there was poop or mud on the wall in the first room we had before we moved for that and lack of water that could be regulated in the shower... Then we were moved to a deluxe room where we got 3 pillows instead of 2, a makeup mirror that broke off as well as a shower head that was  supposed to be a wand but wouldn't move off its mount! Oh and the tub leaked so we then had a water park in the bathroom. It had a big cheap flat screen though and a view of our car in the parking lot! All in all I say it wasn't bad LOL! The actual riverwalk and patio part was very pretty though!","I photographed a wedding reception that was held here in their banquet room.  Loved how they had access to the river from the private room. The banquet room was also very nice and quaint. And I photographed the couple in the lobby which was absolutely stunning. Overall I give them an A - parking is valet or street.  And the rooms are decorated kinda old school but I loved it.Came here for my wedding (along with a thankfully small block of our friends who had booked here as well) and am appalled by the 'service' we received. First of all, the rack rate for our room, 'the honeymoon suite', was $499. Due to what I assume was a temporary issue on their website, we got it for the discounted AAA rate of $149 (when we looked to book another room the next week, it was back to $449, the normal 10% off AAA rate). If we had paid any more than $149 I would have been horrified. The air conditioner wasn't working and there were no windows in the three level 'suite'. 'Suite' is in quotes just because it so woefully underdelivered on the expectations we had after reading the description on the website. It was dingy and didn't feel clean, not to mention we were sweating all night due to the stuffy air that all my friends reported feeling in their rooms too. It was impossible to sleep. But the worst part was checking in. We had called earlier in the week to see if we would be able to get into our room before the 3 p.m. check-in so I could put on my wedding dress for pictures before our 5 p.m. wedding. They were unable to guarantee an early check-in, which I understand. However we called twice more on the day of the wedding to say that we really needed to be in our room at 3 p.m. (called twice instead of once because of the noncommittal response to the first request). We arrive at 2:59 p.m. I am in full make-up with a veil and carrying a huge wedding dress. My maid-of-honor, an extremely sweet and polite person, asked the woman at the desk how long it would be before we could check in (she was just chatting with the man she had just checked in). She rolled her eyes and said 'Ma'am, I'll get to you when we can'. My friend reiterated that we were on a tight schedule (which should've been obvious, I had a freaking VEIL on) and the woman just sighed really loudly and picked up the phone and told whoever was on the other end 'Um yes, these people are apparently in some kind of rush, could you get room 102 ready?' We got into the room by 3:15, and nothing was going to ruin my day at that point, but damn if they didn't try. The only reasons to stay here are if you have an event at this hotel, or at the Rattlesnake Club next door.I booked this hotel on Hotwire (~100 with taxes for one night). I was quite worried about it after reading the reviews on here, but really, I needn't have worried. I wouldn't say that this was the best hotel I've ever stayed at, but everything was just fine. Which, when you are just crashing for a night after some heavy duty shopping, is really all you are looking for. It IS a little far from the downtown core. Not walkable. They do offer a shuttle bus service, but we waited over 30 minutes to catch it. It's also hard to find a taxi in Detroit, so getting back to the hotel is difficult, especially since the shuttle stops running at 10:30. We did call the shuttle to pick us up at about 10pm, but the cell phone was off, and the answering machine was full.It is an older hotel, but I sort of enjoyed the vintage feel. The staff were friendly, as were the other hotel guests. Parking was free and wifi was free. Essential when Canadians travel to the US.In the end it was a good option for me. I would stay there again.Detroit's motto should be: ""It COULD be great, but...""Like much of Detroit, Roberts Riverwalk Hotel COULD be great, but, simply put, it's not. Maybe it's fine in the off-season. Maybe it's fine in the winter, when it's not 90 degrees in the room. Maybe it's fine when there isn't a huge event going on, but maybes don't cut it when you're talking about hotels. Guests have minimum expectations when paying to stay at a hotel, and this hotel does not meet the minimums.The hotel itself has an old charm to it; insanely high ceilings in the rooms on the 4th floor, spacious bathrooms, expansive windows in the room that offer views of the riverfront (if you're lucky; my reservation said I had one but I didn't get one...). It has character. But then, the room is 90 degrees, the air conditioning doesn't work, you're promised a king-sized bed and get a king-sized headboard with a queen mattress tacked onto it, there's a puddle on the carpet when you enter the room and a constant drip from the ceiling above it, the front desk staff is frazzled and harried and promises a visit from housekeeping (for extra pillows) and maintenance (for fixing the leak and a/c) and these things don't happen. Come on, Roberts, get your act together! You're going to lose money and loyalty and go the way of so much of this beautiful city: ruin.Very disappointed.EDIT: When someone apologizes and makes things right, I am willing to re-think my original feelings and sometimes change my mind. Well, this is one of those times. The management at Roberts Riverwalk Hotel was sympathetic to our situation and, upon learning that we were heading home without staying the night, somehow managed to find a beautifully freezing king bed room on the first floor. They even had to let us back in to the room each time we left because they didn't have a key for it (Huh?) and did so graciously and quickly each time. The manager even came outside where we were enjoying the BBQ and live music, found us, and made sure that the accommodations were now to our standards. I really appreciate all the effort and hospitality we experienced for the remainder of our stay. I'd think twice before staying here again, but it will be an option. It turned out to be nice for the Detroit fireworks and it was worth it to stay downtown to avoid the crowds and fake shootings and non-existent bomb scares that got everyone in a panic closer to the action. Still, I stand by my original opinion that this hotel has some issues that should be resolved before it could be considered anything above three stars.I really like the character of this hotel....I have stayed here twice while in Detroit.   First time was a year ago...the room had a broken AC unit and had to switch rooms.  Was given a very nice room with huge windows overlooking the river because of the inconvenience.   Returned again a couple weeks ago...everything was great this time around as well.   Definitely worth the price.   There is a bar downstairs that also serves food.   The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the location is near a lot of vacant industrial buildings and the back parking lot is dark at night....seems a bit shady.  However I did see multiple security guards patrolling on foot and in vehicles around the property which is good.  Check in was quick and they have free Wifi and parking is also free.   I will be backGood to know:Hotel is not in downtown Detroit, its two miles away in a not-so-good area.Rooms are cheaper if you book through the hotel itself, we booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and paid $40 more and got overbooked.Free parking if you trust to leave your car there.The only positive thing about this hotel is that the place is nice overall, the lobby is pretty fancy and it looks like it has some history.On the other hand, the staff was pretty rude and service was slow. The rooms got overbooked and the lady treated it like it was my fault for expecting what I paid for (a view of the river). On that alone I would never come here again or recommend anyone else stay here either. The hallway reeked of pot smoke all night and the next day (but if your room smells like smoke they will charge you $250, of course). The room was comfortable in size and amenities but it was not the most clean place ever. The bath mat was so ragged that if I worked there I would be embarrassed to leave it in the room. The worst part was the ""continental"" breakfast, so crappy was this breakfast that they put a menu to the restaurant on the table. Seriously, there were 4 mini muffins and 2 danish, OJ and coffee. Ugh. We were happy to leave in the morning. Oh forgot to mention in the good to know department, they charge a $50 refundable key deposit for a PLASTIC key. A cheap plastic key. I'm sure they don't know that a key deposit is for an actual key.Me and a big group of friend had a memorable ""get together, eat, drink, go out, come back late and crash"" type of a night in one of the Omni's $450 suites. It was a great experience. The suite was multi-level, with a nice bathroom on the main floor, living space with sofa (pullout bed in it), a TV, and a bar/sink area. Go up the stairs and you have a window view with a loungy circular seating area, along with yet another bathroom and a king size bed and another TV up there. So yes, it felt like having a nice condo, or 1 bedroom apartment in the city for the night. We split the $450 cost among 6-7 of us so the dent in the wallet was minimized.Overall the hotel has great service, and it has an antique European feeling to it. Some would call it outdated, but the olden-style is preserved so well and kept classy enough to be called antique, rather than outdated. Well, the perfectly preserved cordless phone from the 90s was probably more so outdated than antique, but hey, when in Rome! This is a diamond in the rough, bordering on some nearby rough Detroit neighborhoods, but as long as you are navigating yourself wisely, no problem! When my group and I were enjoying music and drinking in the suite, the staff made sure to never bother us and they made sure to leave the neighboring suite empty so that we wouldn't bother anyone else, and for regards to our privacy.Basic single/double occupancy rooms here can be had for sub-$100 rates via Hotwire &amp; Priceline, and the suites are some of the comfiest in the D. They are also very kind to late checkouts at 1PM, which guys like me who party hard on Saturday nights can appreciate on a detox Sunday afternoon. This is a good hotel, and the only reason I feel compelled to take a star away, is because the location is a few blocks further from downtown than I'd like to be, and also the pricing is a tad steep when you go directly through the hotel, the value is FAR better via Hotwire or Priceline.Very nice...no...superb.I must say that I have never had a more accommodating nor helpful hotel staff experience.  The manager was too helpful and the associates were all about giving me great service.  The manager personally helped me unload my suitcases and wouldn't let me do anything with them.  Really?  I have never seen such a thing and was completely amazed.  I did have to move rooms, but I was warned ahead of time that space was sporadic due to several wedding parties and the Halloween weekend.  This did not bother me and I told her to put me where she had space.  I will be returning and I will be staying again.  Yes, it is a little pricey, but you get service that far exceeds the price.Wonderful hotel. I'd absolutely stay here again if I ever head back to the area.I loved the look of the hotel. I read it used to be a brewery, which certainly contributed to it's unique character. The rooms were huge, had a river view (though we booked a standard room), and we're extremely comfortable. The services they provide were first class and well done. I really felt pampered without having to ask for things. The staff was super friendly and genuinely made us feel welcome. The river walk out back is beautiful and sadly underused. The immediate area around the hotel is very nice, safe, and well taken care of, but the main drag (Jefferson, I think) looked to be a bit on the shady side. I'd probably stick to the grounds or convenient hotel provided transportation.One downside; the hotel restaurant was a bit of a disappointment, especially because we booked a room that came with a $40 per day food and beverage credit. The food wasn't horrendous, but it was something along the lines of ""Denny's"" quality. Pretty sub par for an Omni hotel. Also, it's a slight rip off, because if you use your $40 credit for $8 worth of coffee and bagels you don't get any change.That aside...tops for Detroit. Check it out if you are in the area.Arrived around 5 called twice to confirm 1st floor room because I am on crutches.  Assured twice room would be available, no first floor room. Check in lady though friendly could not come up with any excuse. Managed to get me on next floor after telling me the only available was on 4th. Seemed apologetic made sure to confirm shuttle service for 6 arrived in lobby 5 minutes to 6 and shuttle had left, check in lady again apologetic claimed she thought she saw us get on, I was on crutches, I stuck out. Made it a point to get shuttle back on time for us, that was nice. Shuttle driver hilarious and room was very clean. Asked for a cart to carry in luggage, was told matience man was on break, only one to have access, again I'm slightly handicapped my friend had to truck everything in from parking lot. Loved the ambiance, didn't have time to check out bar but would stay again when I don't need specific details fulfilled.This is a great, black-owned, family-run, beautiful old school hotel located right on the river. We had a great conference hosted here, you will be treated wonderfully. Everyone has a smile and asks how you're doin, seems like the whole staff honestly enjoys working there. It's not the Ritz-Carlton in terms of fancy pants, but that's not what this place is about. Free wi-fi, free muffins and coffee in the morning, a beautiful outdoor fire pit area to hang in the summer, wonderful old-fashioned bar and pool table. Can't say enough, this place is great!I stayed here last weekend on the tenth of September with my three closest friends, for my birthday. Upon walking in my room, I was pleasantly surprised by the high ceilings and antique furnishings. We had the most perfect view of th Detroit River and Canada. Buuut this place definitely had its shortcomings as well. Like I said, it was my birthday and the concierge offered to keep my cake in the hotels kitchen refrigerator since a personal one would cost extra. I agreed and thanked him. Later that night, when my friends and I were ready to cut my cake and begin the festivities, the front desk clerk told me the kitchen was locked and that I wouldn't be able to get it that night. Imagine my surprise and dismay! I wasn't happy at all and made sure he knew it. They also don't serve breakfast and for some reason the phones in the room don't work. Whenever we tried to call room service or the front desk, there was a busy signal. I had to physically go down to the front desk every time I needed something. Like I said, its a great- looking establishment with amazing views, but the customer care was quite atrocious.Tucked away off the beaten path, this hotel provides top-notch service.  Our  room was beautiful, and the location is quite soothing, as you have the Riverwalk directly behind the hotel.  The Omni provides free shuttle service to and from downtown, which was super quick and efficient.  The staff here are really second to none,  we saw these guys take care of a totally filled hotel (Frozen Four was in town), and making it look easy.  To me, that's a sign of a well oiled machine.Why did this place close?!?!We chose this hotel because my daughter wanted to get married and in the D. Reservations were made for 10 rooms in January for a July wedding. The sales lady was very nice and accommodating and made lots of promises including a shuttle bus before and after the wedding for our guests. We ultimately booked over 20 rooms and added a morning brunch for 50 guests. Everything went downhill from here. Upon check-in we found the lines long because there was only one lady at the front desk. The carpet was dirty, the elevator didn't work correctly, the rooms were disheveled, parts of the bathtub and sink were broken.  All this was added to the maintenance list, however maintenance never showed up. The parking lot was a joke, gravel with potholes and very small. Valet parking was supposed to be included to our guests however each one of them was charged $7. The next morning several of our guests could not find their cars. The keys were just thrown in a pile at the front desk.   The shuttle bus driver who was also the assistant manager was almost nonexistent. Many of the wedding guests had to hire  their own taxis to return them to the hotel.  I hired the limo for an additional two hours to return the wedding party. The morning after caused problems when the elevator was broken for three and half hours. The brunch for 50 guests was tasty but we had to continually ask for more coffee more eggs more bacon more of everything. The two servers seemed indifferent and we're not accommodating to our needs. I was shocked when I received my bill for the brunch and noticed a 21% gratuity. We ultimately spoke to the sales lady who suggested we write a letter to the assistant vice president. We wrote the letter detailing all the problems and have not received any reply. We followed up several times with no reply. It has now been two monthsFor your own peace of mind go elsewhere, DO NOT frequent  place.I gave it at one star review so I could post this even though it deserved none.I stayed here last weekend with hotwire rate.  The hotel itself looked and felt like a dated holiday inn. I appreciate that it is now independent, but I they need to make the little updates to make it worth staying 2 miles north of downtown.  Maybe I'd feel different with a river view room, but I don't think I'll be trying it out again.DO NOT GO HERE and USE your CREDIT CARD at the BAR!! We recently had a Holiday party here in December 2011 and a fellow co-worker used her credit card to purchase some drinks. The bartender stole the numbers off the credit card and in a matter of minutes  $900 was racked up on the co-workers credit card!!! Luckily her bank called her and canceled the card;she was not responsible for the charges! The FOOD was terrible as well, all dried out and some more co-workers threw-up on their way home after eating at this establishment!!! BEWARE!!Terrible service.. What hotel doesnt change your sheets/towels?First off, it is located wrong on the map here.  Its northeast of downtown along the riverwalk.  There is something about this hotel that is a little creepy.  Former mental hospital?  I don't know.  This place is a ghost town of a hotel.  I never saw one other customer here in two days.  Not in the lobby, restaurant, bar or hallway.  Very strange.  And there were only three staff people from what I saw.  Front Desk, and two in the kitchen.  Decent bar but no one there.  Rooms were nice though, make no mistake.  Very clean and good view of the river.  But just too far from downtown and not enough going on in the building to be self contained.   If you are writing a novel (think Jack Nicholson) and need some solitude, then this is your place.  Otherwise, get in the cab and trek back downtown...Staying in room 123. A/c works great and a view of the river. Lots of high end finishes. Some minor details need addressing, but very nice overall. Easy access out the back door to the river walk. I would come back.","Please DO NOT stay at this hotel. Stayed there over the Labor Day weekend 2012 and the service was EXTREMELY slow. Couldn't check into my room until 6:00 PM. The staff working that day were nice, but that doesn't make up for slow service. Also, one week later, my boyfriend and I learned we contracted bed bugs. We called the hotel to notify them that it had to have come from their hotel as we didn't stay anywhere else and there weren't bed bugs at home.  We each at bites on our arms and backs. The hotel was SUPPOSE to follow up with us and now...one month later...we still haven't heard back. We have left messages with three different managers and still nothing.  Finally, our stay was purchased in advanced on HOTWIRE. The hotel still charged my card and blamed HOTWIRE for not forwarding the credit for the room.  I'm still waiting for the hotel to credit my card back...yes, one month later!I wish I would have paid the additional cost and stayed somewhere else. LESSON LEARNED.   STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND EXPENSE!DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because of the location.  If I could give it a negative rating I would.  They didn't change our linen or empty our trash.  They gave us a broken unopertive hair dryer after not having one in our room.  The latch on the door was broke.  There was no wifi as advertised.  You might as well walk your bags to the room, because you can't use the cart due to the stairs to get through the door.  You'll have a better stay at a roadside motel than staying here.Bistro staff was friendly, but breakfast staff overwhelmed by 3 tables. Front desk checkout staff need training in customer service and how to listen to guests before interrupting -- easy fix but management needs to expect quality and set standards.  Room was clean but needed better maintenance. Phone did not work.  Security latch was torn off. Holes in desk chair fabric and in carpet.  Dust on curtain toppers. Cable reception was fuzzy. Heating/Cooling thermostat battery was broken so could not regulate room temperature effectively. If you get Room 113 take a look before accepting.  As the one night stay wore on we wished we were in a different room.  Not sure we will return.So here's the thing - we got this as a deal on priceline. One of my best friends was in town from NYC and I'm in A2 now and have gotten tired of sleeping on people's couches and of driving home to Ann Arbor at 3 am. And when my girl comes in from New York, we're going out in Detroit. Okay, maybe Hamtramck, but still. So, went on priceline, put in a fairly low price (and just b/c they were so nice at this hotel I won't say exactly how low, but suffice to say equal to or greater than $100). And oh it was SO worth it. First of all - the service. They are fabulously friendly from the moment you valet - and you do have to valet, and it is $18. And you sit down at a little desk while they check you in, no mass torture of waiting in line. And the room itself is fine. It's not glorious. But I've stayed in worse Hilton's that I (or actually my company) has payed close to $300 for. Decent bath products, I forgot which kind. Coffee maker and mini-bar, though you do have to ask for the key (which I did - at 3 am - FYI I think Doritos and peanuts come out to approx $5, which isn't horrible by mini-bar standards).Also, they have this fabulous shuttle service that's FREE! And will take you anywhere within approx 5 mile (basically anywhere in downtown Detroit) and pick you up when you call them until 11 pm. So, while I waited for my friend to be finish up a wedding she was attending, I took the shuttle to Slow's for some BBQ and discussed Detroit with the shuttle drivers.Everyone at the hotel was super-nice. I would never have known about this hotel if it hadn't been for priceline (and this was my first time). It was like a little vacation in Detroit. Perfect.This is a positive review, although it may not seem so at first.I stayed here with a conference of educators from around the U.S.. I'd read reviews that indicated a range of experiences, from fab  to not ready for prime time, so I was ready for some glitches and for the staff to be on the inexperienced side.Our room was very nice, with great beds and comfy pillows. The climate control worked well, and the bath was fine, except for a bit of peeling wallpaper and a missing soap dish in the shower that left a rusty bracket exposed. The room was very clean, except for the phone, which was so dusty it appeared to have been in storage. There were no tissues, no wastebasket in the bath, and the television remote needed batteries. The room next door had a broken electronic lock, so the people assigned there couldn't get in. We'd arrived very late due to a a plane delay, so there was scant staff to help address maintenance issues. The hotel was sold out and the lock repair person wasn't on site, so our colleagues had to wait a long time to get into a room, and then had to share a bed. This was only possible because one person had not made the trip and his room was empty.Since I could see that there were a number of similar issues going on that evening, I made my way to the front desk and asked to pick up the missing wastebasket, tissues and remote batteries, in order to make it easier on the man at the front desk, who suddenly had 275 guests. He was already on his way, although there were no tissues to be had.Early the next morning, the hotel fire alarm began to sound, and kept on for about 45 minutes. That got us all up, even though we would have liked to sleep a bit longer. The staff were a bit late getting the breakfast buffet set up, and only had vacuum pitchers from which to serve coffee, which meant refilling frequently as people lined up waiting. As a result, our conference schedule was set back by 30 minutes or so.Now, this is a lot of teething trouble for a hotel. Had we been a different bunch of people, there might have been quite an uproar and a lot of complaining, demanding guests. However, the conference organizers and hotel staff promptly put their heads together and made adjustments. A hot room with too few chairs was cooled down and used for small breakout groups instead of whole-group meetings. Our conference organizers asked us to help bus our tables so that they could be cleared and reset quickly, to enable us to meet in the large dining space. Everyone on the staff was pleasant, accommodating and helpful, and our three day meeting was a success. We plan to return next year.Overall, it was a wonderful example of how people can come together to ensure that things go smoothly. I don't doubt that the hotel staff had a huge learning experience. Some things need attention. Not everyone got a hot shower in the morning. The shuttle was down. Some phones did not work. If the Riverwalk is full more often, they will likely staff up to meet the demands of a larger guest load. If they are fully booked more, they will have housekeeping examining the rooms more often, and can keep maintenance staff on site.This is a family owned, black owned hotel, and Detroit needs well-run, successful enterprises owned and run by people of color. We all need more independent hotel operators, unless we all want to be at the mercy of huge corporate chains. We were so impressed by how hard the Riverwalk staff worked, and how cheerful and warm they were - they deserve to do well.Some friends and I stayed here for my birthday.  It was a great hotel experience.  The concierge/front desk are extremely friendly and accomidating.  We got a sweet deal for this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> and even recieved a free room upgrade from the front desk for simply inquiring about the nicer rooms.  The room we got had a river front view which was amazing.  The rooms are very nice, and clean for a hotel.  The beds are super comfy too.  Also they gave us extended checkout at no extra charge.  I would absolutely stay here again!What a gem in Detroit...  I have stayed in the rooms once and they were middle of the road, but the surrounding area (riverfront) is special.  I would strongly encourage taking your Boo here and letting yourself go!  The Ron Mimms Day Party only made it an even better destination.This is one of those hotels in Detroit that flies under the radar. This hotel is exquisite. It is beautifully designed, reminding me of the sophistication of a European classic. I surprised my husband with a weekend stay here for his birthday. I absolutely fell in love with the view of the river from the rear of the hotel. Our room was nicely decorated and a nice size. I went all out and got the Governor's Suite. Room service was prompt and front desk check in was easy. The front desk coordinator worked with me because she knew I was planning something special. I definitely recommend this place as a cozy get away for any occasion or just because. You really feel special when you stay here. Feels as if you're miles away from the everyday.Whenever I get a ""boutique"" hotel with a Priceline bid, I'm pretty sure it will be a property with great promise that is past its prime. No surprises here, except the terrific service made up for the musty, outdated furnishings and shady location. The hotel was booked solid for a Detroit Lions game. Mostly drunk, obnoxious football fans (many Canadians) and maybe one wedding party filled the hotel. Check in was a breeze and we were pleasantly surprised by two gigantic rooms (one river view and one parking lot view) for $80 each. The best deal was a free shuttle service to the game, with a promise for a ride back if we called before midnight and met the driver a few blocks from Ford Field. Front desk agent and former cab driver Walter subbed as our entertaining shuttle driver for the evening. He adeptly got us through the city and handled the drunks in our van beautifully. Although the kitchen was closed when we returned from the game, Walter encouraged us to visit the bar and we weren't disappointed. A pool table, piano, a few TVs, plenty of seats and piped in dance music provided a great place to relax with a few drinks. Tasty Michigan craft beers ($4) and strong well drinks ($6) were our choices. Our attentive server (the only one on duty) took care of us well even when the bar filled with late-night patrons. Back in the room, newer bedding (maybe a response to a bedbug complaint?) welcomed us for a good rest in spite of being able to hear noises from throughout the hotel. The lowlight in the morning was a mildewed shower curtain with hair stuck on it from previous guests, a slow-draining shower tub and sparse towels. Our rooms were impressively spacious, but the curtains and carpets need a thorough steaming. All furniture but the beds were pretty run down and should also be spruced up. However, you get what you pay for and because of the great service and convenience to get to and from the game, I feel like this was still a good deal.I recently stayed at the Riverwalk Hotel April 19-22, 2012. I stayed in a suite on the second floor. I was walking barefoot around in my room the evening of check-in and noticed that there were numerous little items all over the carpet - it seemed like it hadn't been swept in days. The next morning in making in-room coffee, one of the coffee cups hadn't been cleaned at the bottom of the cup was someone's old coffee - UGH! In leaving for the day, I notified the front desk of the cup situation and requested that the carpet be swept (that didn't happen until my next day. Also both days upon returning from being out all day I had no maid service, the room was as I'd left it. I had to call down to the front desk both evenings for maid service, both times I'd been given the situation that the hotel was completely booked and they were still cleaning rooms (this was at about 4:00 p.m. each afternoon). On check out I mentioned to the front desk receptionist that I could only assume that when coming up on such situations, they would hire more staff on an on-call basis, they're plenty folks out on the streets who'd love to work.Very distressing for the cost of the rooms, it's not like this is a Motel 6!We knew we were going to have to get a hotel room block for our out of town guests.  Most are not familar with downtown Detroit and to be honest are scared of it, so we did a lot of research to make sure we picked a spot that was safe and close to our venues.  We contacted the Omni and once we took the tour of the building, we knew it would be perfect for our guests.  It is in a quiet, quaint part of Detroit, halfway between our reception and ceremony AND the selling point, they have a shuttle to and from downtown and since we had so many rooms booked, scheduled pick-ups and drop-offs to our reception.  The only complaints we had were that our guests kept running into problems booking under our block once a certain room type was no longer available.  The staff at the 1 800 number we were told to  use were telling them there was no block, so our guests would call us asking what was up.  Once that issue was resolved, it was smooth sailing for reservations.  My other beef was the welcome bags.  They didn't give them to everyone upon check in.  I had to keep asking if they were giving them out.  I know there was another block and wedding that night in the hotel, but they didn't have bags.  I wish they would have been able to put them in people's rooms, but oh well.  Nearly everyone got one, one way or another.  I know people were not crazy about having to valet park their cars and pay for parking everynight, but it is a ""city"" hotel and it is the norm for most hotels in Detroit.Other than that, it was fantastic.  The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff was so nice and accomodating to our guests.  I stayed in a suite the night before the weddding so the girls could all get ready in the room and it was so huge and perfect for us.  Also, Steve and I stayed there the night of the wedding and they gave us a late check out of 2PM.  An added bonus was that we stayed our wedding night for free because we had so many rooms booked!  Woo hoo!I put friends and family up here when they come to visit.  The proximity to the downtown area (and prox. to me), riverwalk, gorgeous rooms, views and patio make this a great choice even if it is a bit under the radar (as another reviewer mentioned.)  The website makes booking and viewing details easy.  And even if your internet connection at home fails and you end up buying the room twice (as I did) the helpful staff will assist your needs, even at 430am.  I have been impressed as have all my guests.This place was odd, not in bad way. The bathroom was huge (along with a phone from the late 90s). The bathroom took up almost 1/4 of the room. The windows were quite small which kept the room pretty dark. The cable went out a few times while I was there. Parking was valet, which is sort of funny considering the parked the car only a few feet from where we pulled in ($18 total so I think it might have come out to 50 cents were feet, not a bad racket). Those were some of the negatives, the positives were the hotel offered a free shuttle downtown (I was there with a group for the Pizza Pizza Bowl). They also offered free pickup until 10:30 which saved us from a cab ride (and the fare). The hotel is right on the river which was one of the few beautiful areas I saw in Detroit. The staff was pretty friendly. The best was the hotel bar which had few customers but was really inviting. The bartender was extremely friendly and give a great pour on my whiskey and cokes. Also ordered some food from the bar and after a day of drinking and football it all really hit the spot, french onion soup and the spinach artichoke dip was great. Not a ton of bars or restaurant's in the neighborhood, but its also slightly outside of downtown. There were a few bars within walking distance that weren't bad (though make sure you walk there in a group) Overall we got this place off priceline for $50 which I would say is just about right. I'd stay here again (as long as I'm getting a priceline discount).",,"['spent', 'weekend', 'hotel', 'lovely', 'time', 'paid', 'standard', 'double', 'incredibly', 'comfortable', 'king', 'sized',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-detroit-downtown-detroit-2,Hilton Garden Inn Detroit Downtown,3.0,$$,41,"I've stayed here multiple times and it continues to be toward the top of my list of places to stay downtown. It seems like the prices of the rooms vary quite a bit depending on what's going on downtown. That being said, the Hilton Garden Inn is generally more reasonable that the casinos or other downtown hotels. I really like the location - walking distance to Greektown, Ford Field/Comerica, The Fillmore, etc. There is a ton to do within a short walk. Corktown and Midtown are short cab/Uber rides away. Really, I just feel like this place is the most bang for your buck when it comes to downtown hotels. As I said before, the rates can vary quite a bit at the downtown hotels depending on which hotel is offering a good deal, but this place is generally where I end up.I didnt actually get a room here, so I cant speak to the conditions or services related to an overnite stay. But I want to thank the staff for allowing me to use the restroom and warm up in the lobby between trying to reprogram a replacement car key (my car was parked in a lot nearby). I was already cold and frustrated, I guess it was written on my face because the desk clerk was really polite, even allowing me to purchase a few snacks. Im sorry I dont remember her name so she can be recognized! I may go back and see if I can catch her, and let her superiors know how nice she was to me, and I wasnt even a customer! It probably didnt seem like much to her but she was truely an angel in disguise :-)I made reservations for me &amp; my sweetheart on Valentine's Day, thinking it'd be a nice place to spend a romantic evening ($182). I was wrong!! I ordered a bottle of champagne (an additional $90) to be delivered &amp; waiting for us upon arrival, but that didn't happen! There wasn't champagne, &amp; the compensation that the manager offered didn't come through either (she offered some dinner coupons). The staff is rude &amp; the place reeked of marijuana. No wonder people don't like coming to Detroit...Hilton continues to be my go-to hotel property, and Detroit is no exception. I found nearly all of the staff to be genuinely friendly, helpful and accomodating.  The property is beautiful and very well kept.  Anything I needed, they were available.  The fitness room, while tiny, is well equipped with med balls, elipticals, treadmills, and a tv that works.  The way they have breakfasts set up is perfect..tons to choose from if you have a minute or an hour.Upon arrival had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get in the parking lot. Valet seemed very overwhelmed as there were alot of people checking in and leaving cars to be parked. Room was ok, nothing special. Upon checkout when we got our car back, had items missing. Filed a complaint with the hotel and valet company, police report also. Turns out I'm the liar valet did nothing wrong and hotel is not responsible. Be very careful what you leave in your vehicle as the ticket stub basically states the valet can take whatever they find and it's your responsibility not theirs!! Hotel management did nothing.There seems to be construction going on judging by the scaffolding setup near the entrance.  The pathway to the entrance was riddled with puddles.  The room I stayed at this hotel is pretty run down.  The bathtub didn't drain well so I had to stand in dirty water.  Ew.  There were a few tiles with cracks on the floor also a crack in the sink hardware.  The wall papers are outdated and the heater was loud.  The lady at the front desk was nice.  If you have gold or diamond status, you can ask for bottled water when you check in.  There's a complimentary business center past the front desk where you can use the printer if needed.   Getting into the room is the half the fun since the card reader doesn't do a very good job at reading the room card.  It's best to put something on a usb drive and stick it into the monitor to have it printed.  I wasn't able to get to any non-hotel websites using the computers in the room.  The convenience store section across from the front desk was well stocked, but some of the items were expired by a month or so.  I guess the tuna snack packs aren't very popular with the guests that stay here.This location is about 10 minutes from Amtrak and is under $10 for a taxi ride there.SummaryThe Good+Convenient store section+Free bottled water for gold/diamond status+24 hour fitness center+Hot Tub+Free Wifi+Free business center+Restaurant inside+Complimentary in-room K-cup coffee and tea+Movie channels+Good location downtownThe Bad-Rooms are old-Puddles obstacles by the entrance-Expired items in the convenient store sectionClean and relatively new hotel.Spent four nights here recently. The room was big enough and had a microwave and refrigerator in it. Also free wifi, which worked fine.The fitness center only had three machines and some dumbbells. The indoor pool looked on the small side and we didn't use it.The business center has two computers and a printer.The lose one star because on two days, when we came back to the room in the early afternoon (say 1:30pm ish), housekeeping had still not arrived to tidy up.I was prepared for a *meh* feeling, but overall this place was ideal. Clean and updated, free wifi, incomparably friendly staff all combined with this awesome location for exploring downtown Detroit make this the best stay imaginable! The Chrome Bar and Grille staff was hardworking and a bit understaffed, struggling with an awkward shared kitchen and no food / snacks behind the bar. Area for improvement. Lobby was neat and updated, and cozy!The Hilton Garden Inn Downtown Detroit is walking distance to both Comerica Park and Ford Field and I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend eating breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The kitchen staff cooks with love and this was one of the best omelets I have had in years.This is one of those case where the hotel chain sets a silly high price and then they don't support the facility to actually deliver any sort of support. The air conditioner just keeps shutting itself off  The shower is clearly sparing water into the wall and maintenance can't really do anything until after we are gone. This is not true. Go grab me some Teflon tape and I'll fix ya right up in a jiffy. The restaurant attached is sub par. Poorly staffed and confused at minimum.I try very hard to stay within the Hilton chain as a Diamond level member the perks are worth the effort and this was the best I could find from Hilton close to where I needed to be for my first time in Detroit. Worked out really well, after exploring around location late on first night ended up coming back to hotel Chrome Grill bar for a drink and snack because it seemed the most welcoming. Second night ate at the  same location and had a really good steak, they serve apothic red wine, well worth s glass.  Not a high class place and busy in mornings around breakfast time, but everyone working hard on service and breakfast is a cooked to order deal instead of tired buffet. Very convenient location for sure.  Going back in August and likely will change my current reserve from the Marriott to this again.I traveled here for a meeting. There is a major disconnect between the parking staff and the hotel staff.  When I first arrived I  noticed several parking spaces open but was told they were completely full.  The attendant stated I could park in one of the two lots behind their lot about 50 feet away.   I pulled into the lot and there was no parking attendant. I was unclear whether the second parking lot was owned by the hotel or not. I went inside to the front desk and asked an employee if I could park there.  He said yes, but I would have to talk to their attendant because it was not the hotel's. I explained that there was no attendant. The employee stated the attendant usually arrives sometime in the morning.  It was 7:30 AM at this time, and I explained I was instructed to park there by their employees.  I was asked if I had been given a parking pass and I hadn't.  I was instructed to obtain a pass from a parking attendant. I asked if they accepted credit cards and was told yes. I went back outside and it took several minutes for the attendant to understand I was only trying to pay for the spot I was parked in.  He instructed me to wait for the attendant in their lot.  He continued by explaining there was a Tigers game today and they were instructed to not let anyone park in their lot.  At that moment, an individual exited to hotel and pulled out of the parking lot. I was asked to move my car there.  I moved it and them attempted to pay with a credit card and the attendant stated he only accepted cash. I went back inside the hotel and withdrew some cash from the ATM.  I spoke with the same employee at front desk and explained the attendant would not accept a credit card.  The employee asked if I received a ticket from the attendant, and I had not.  At this point I'm beyond frustrated and another nice employee at the desk offered to comp my parking ($10).  She gave me a ticket from outside and marked it paid.  She asked me to hand the ticket to the attendant and give the attendant my keys.  After going outside, I hand the ticket and my keys to the attendant. He gives me my keys back telling I'm supposed to keep them. Mass confusion.  I usually stay at Hilton properties and have never had this kind of confusion.Customer Service people are GREAT!The facility is in good shape and the staff takes care of it.  The front desk staff is very helpful and capable.  We enjoyed our stay and will use this hotel again for any downtown visits.  Detroit is an hard city in which to be comfortable, but we felt secure in this place.This place had the worst customer service ever and the breakfast. We had to wait forever to sit down because there was not enough staff to clean the tables. Once we did get seated they were just about out of food and most of my family did not even eat really. We were there for a family reunion. So there was a lot of people who barely ate due to lack of food selection.The restaurant inside the Hilton (American Grill) I love this place omg the little burgers, the breakfast buffet and the entire set up there is perfect. The hotel is the icing on the cake. Some of the best food I ever ate is in that establishment. The staff is nice and cool good job!!!This hotel was GREAT.  We had a suite, and it was wonderful.Great location-- walk to Tigers and Lions games, walk to Casino (unfortunately...), walk to restaurants and bars in Greektown.  We even walked to the Eastern Market Farmers Market.  Never felt unsafe, and we left the casino at 3 am, 2 am and midnight and walked home.We used the pool and hot tub after a sweaty Tigers game.  The pool was great--you know how some indoor pools are like bath tubs with too warm water?  Well, this pool had cool water and was very refreshing.  We had the pool and hot tub to ourselves.The room was nice, comfortable bed, two TVs, we never heard anyone or anything--and we slept late due to the aforementioned casino visits....Housekeeping was satisfactory.But the BEST of all were the people working there.  They were so nice, so kind, and went out of their way to help us out.  Every time we asked where something was, they walked outside with us to show us!  You don't see that ever at most hotels, particularly in large cities....We didn't eat at the restaurant or breakfast at the hotel, so can't comment.Oh yeah--free WiFi which is a big deal to me.Terrible experience.  I stay in Hilton properties 50-75 times a year and this has been my worst experience yet.  I will list what is wrong with this property in the hopes that the company removes their banner from this location or the staff makes a 180.-it is hard to find.  I had to call the front desk for directions as my GPS took me there, yet it is basically in an alley- the staff is sub par and unprofessional.  It was just rude: starting with dropping my car at the valet who called me ""buddy"" twice, to the front desk (staffed by 3) who made made me wait about 5 minutes to check in as they did paperwork, to the person who called me to inform me my pizza arrived with a friendly ""hey boss, you gotta come to the lobby - your pizza is here.""  - hotel elevator requires a key, which is good, but key reader is basically broken in the elevator closest to the front desk.  As I fumbled around for several attempts the only guidance the front desk staff had was to try again.  Thanks.-garbage truck came at 615est.  I could hear it from my room on the 10th floor.  Great wake up call-$22 valet does not even have a number to bring your car around.  You need to walk downstairs and give the valet your ticket, then he will slowly walk through the lot to get your car.  Well worth tipping each time.-didn't even bother to use my diamond voucher for breakfast as every review on here and flyertalk said it as sub par at best.If you are a Hilton person stay at the Doubletree. It is a million times better.  If you don't have a hotel loyalty then avoid this.I would stay here again. Room was clean, nice, and comfortable. Included small fridge and microwave, free wifi. Can't rate pool or parking as I used neither. Very clean bathroom. Room service is a major plus as it offers the best creme brulee! -Say what! Be prepped to drop a dime- Room service for one very plentiful chicken burger, sweet potato fries, lemonade, &amp; creme brulee was like $27. Really personable staff, walking distance from Greektown &amp; it's casino, restaurants, pubs, and the people mover. Easily 4 blocks from Comerica Park (which is also awesome).3 nights came to near $480, but with discounts you can easily get price down.The hotel staff is great! If you are looking to be in downtown close to Greektown this hotel is a decent option. The downside is parking.... It is an outside lot for $22 a night self park, not the best option in winter.Stayed 2 nights. Despite initial room mix up was given great service by front desk. Clean comfortable rooms, ok price.Avoid the strange breakfast cafe situation if you can (food is ok but the way the service/pricing is strange!)","Much like the town in the Mad Max movie, the Hilton in Detroit welcomes you with valet parking and a host of enhanced security. You get used to needing your key card in the elevator and showing your ID. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the pool and hot tub were nice. I am still baffled by the breakfast. It was the strangest dining experience I have had in a long time. It was advertised as a buffet, but most items you could not touch without assistance. To add to the fun, it wasn't clear which items were off limits. The poor quality of buffet food combined with the inconvenience of table service. You could also order items from the menu...but we didn't have menus.This hotel looks lovely. Clean rooms, nice location. Fairly quiet. Nice front desk staff.But the main  restaurant is the most unintelligently run establishment I have ever encountered on Earth. Ever. I was with a group event, so breakfast was included in my prepaid fee. The wait for a pseudo-buffet was often 30 mins to be seated. On my last day, the host, who is somehow unqualified to make decisions on how to put people in chairs, told me this: Even though I was far, far  ahead of the party of 4 on the list whom he seated before me, he could not seat my two kids and me because we were a party of 3. When I noted that there are tables for 2 or 4  or 10, but none specifically for 3, he was irked. I told the manager, who did not seem surprised. The restaurant staff, specifically the host, hotel manager, and one of the two waitresses, is a MAJOR reason not to spend your dollars here. No one can think his or her way out of a paper bag. One wonders why this is OK with Hilton Inc.After being seated, on 2 of 3 days, we waited 40 minutes for the meal to be plated off the kitchen buffet. Are not allowed to serve yourself and the three waitstaff will give your order to any other customer who asks for it. Crazy.Also there was a dish of liquid right on top of the fruit bar to attract the flies swarming about. Patrons see a fly-covered ramekin dish when they approach the food. Not all of the flies liked the ramekin as one bug clung to the fruit in our bowl on our table. A smart thing to do would at lease be to put a barrier or something to hide the flytrap so that it is not so visible. But yuck.As for the rooms: The Jr. Suite is a nice large space. Note that the pullout bed is a SMALL TWIN size, not a double bed as is suggested. The roll-away bed we had to get  is actually about 3 inches wider than the pullout sofa bed. The front desk will try to assure you that the sofa bed is a double bed. Don't buy it.We had little maid service because, though we were gone from 9-3:30, the maid showed up while we were changing for dinner and relaxing. We asked if she could return at 4. No, she was off at 4, was the reply. So we were able to just get our trashcan emptied, but nothing more.The nicest thing about this hotel is that it has a complimentary YMCA membership. The fabulous Y is about 2 blocks away with a huge pool and other fun stuff. Incidentally, the hotel pool, which is small, allowed a group of 4 kids to stay in the pool at night, unattended, even after the pool was supposed to bee closed. After 11 pm, the employee told the kids they could stay but that they door would lock behind them if they left. The oldest of these kids was 15, FYI.The general manager responded to my complaint nicely on Day 2 and offered a cost reduction. Still, the service problems are a deal killer for me to recommend this place. Each day, some aspect of service got worse.With joblessness being so high, I am sure that there are a few people in Detroit who could be better employees.Nothing special to see here. We've got comfy rooms, nice Hilton beds, a decent fridge and microwave in each room, and a reasonable price. It's like every Hampton and HGI you've ever stayed in. We do, however, have the newly popular ""teensy tiny bathroom without a vent fan"" which seems to be all the rage. What blows my mind is that this was obviously a new construction hotel, so why wouldn't it include such things? There are a couple restaurants on the ground floor, neither of which we were able to sample, since they closed by the time we got back to the room, and we didn't have breakfast here. It's definitely convenient to both Comerica Park and Ford Field, plus our chosen venue, the Fillmore. Slightly annoying, and expensive valet parking, though. When you get right down to it, this is just your standard Hilton property.Location was perfect, came down to Detroit for Turkey Trot, parade &amp; football, HGI was great spot for all 3... Room was decent, not bad but not what I would want for the $$. Not sure if it was holiday rates or if it is always that expensive but ouch... Room was clean &amp; had a fridge, microwave &amp; Kcup coffee maker. Furniture was good &amp; they did have adjustable firmness beds but bathroom was a bit small (not in a non-functional way, just in a class of room way) &amp; view was pretty rough. No safe in the room &amp; dresser drawers were too shallow to hold more than like two shirts or pants high. Front desk staff was very friendly!!If I'd paid 1/2 as much as I did (thru a discount travel site no less) I would have given 4 or 5 stars because it was nice, but for $250 a night in Detroit not San Fran or Vegas I expected more.Here's the quick and dirty from a pros/cons perspective:Pros: Service - everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping staff was awesome - wish they had a property that suited their level of serviceCons: Free internet, but incredibly slow - .63Mb/s down <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F825084548.png&amp;s=07fd7b1ca272eb8c81c901db8c2e175bb9a0dea62ab02a53fd12cd6acdaf6775"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/825...</a>-Bed was not comfortable-Odd that they spend the time and money on the property (flat screens, Herman Miller chairs.... etc, but the gym is something out of a 1980's Denise Austin video - moronicThe hotel has all the typical Hilton Garden amenities. The room was decent. Here are some things to make a note of:The location was great. It was only two blocks from the Cadillac Center People Mover. It is only a few minute walk to Comerica Park and the Fox Theatre. Free wi-fi in the roomsParking is $20 a night for hotel guests.The staff was pretty nice and the place clean and comfortable.The ""gym"" fits 3 people max, with a treadmill, a bike and a small weight rack. The ""pool"" is smaller than my kitchen! Not sure if the parking is worth the extra $20 (I didn't drive there though). Conveniently located if whatever brings you to Detroit is downtown.To sum it up, pretty standard for a Hilton. Not luxurious, but nice still. I see that it's classified as a $$$$ but I'd say it's more $$$.Pros: Centrally located. Assortment of complimentary drinks. Excellent complimentary hot breakfast.Cons: $20 a night parking fee for hotel guests. Front desk clerks are inattentive and have relatively limited knowledgeable about the surrounding areas. Maids aren't environmentally conscious since they like to leave all lights on after cleaning the rooms.""Meh"" indeed!We were traveling with our dogs, and found this hotel as accepting of pets (with a $75 fee).  We paid $200/night for a junior suite.  The room was ample-sized, but not worth the price.  The furnishings were out-dated (purple chenile couch and chair?), though they do have flat-screen TVs (not many HD channels, though).  Small fridges and microwaves in every room.The bed was SO uncomfortable!!  Very hard yet unsupportive, and it had a sherpa mattress topper, which sucks if you are a hot sleeper like me.  The sheets were about 200 tc, and rough like sandpaper.  To boot, the air conditioner was completely anemic during a heat wave, and we couldn't cool the room down past 74.They don't give you a self-park option - it's only valet, which is often inconvenient if they are busy.  The restaurants were definitely ""meh"" - you'd be better off walking to find some food.The staff was pretty friendly, and I guess we'd stay here again if we were traveling with our dogs, as they're one of the only places downtown that accepts them!I've stayed here a couple times.  I've been lucky that each time has been on the house via my Hilton Honors points.  If forking over the money myself, I think it's bit overpriced, but it is the city.  The weekend rate was around $200/night + $20 for parking.The biggest perk to this place is the location.  You are literally in the center of the entertainment area of Detroit.  3 blocks in one direction, you are at Comerica Park and Ford Field.  3 blocks in the other direction, you are in Greektown.The room was clean and organized as expected.  The bedding is think is adequate.  I might be bias since I called a Hampton Inn, an equivalent hotel, home for over a year for work and got very acquainted with the bedding.To sum it all up, if you are staying in Detroit, I don't think you can do much better.  Maybe the Marriott at the RenCen or one of the casinos would be nicer options, but the location of this property can't be beat.Clean comfortable newer room in Downtown Detroit, which by the way is not as bad as many people say.Really like the hotel, had a corner room with an extra window (yay) and a high floor looking over the city. The exercise room leaves a little to be desired, but there are lots of things to do within walking distance.The rooms are a little on the small side, but the cleanliness and modern feel more than makes up for it.Location = 5 Bedding = 3 Shower = 2 Elevator = 1 Shared a room with a generous couple of friends over the weekend so I can't rank the hotel on price, but I did touch on 3 areas. The location is phenomenal. We were 2 blocks from Comerica Park / Ford Field, 50 feet from Detroit Pub, 2 blocks from Greektown, and just a few blocks away from numerous other pubs and restaurants. The bedding was average at best, and only 2 pillows. My girlfriend and I often like to have extra pillows but none were to be found. I don't stay in hotels a ton, but if I were to more often I would definitely look for a Marriott. Their bedding is off the chain. The shower drain stunk. Not literally, but it wouldn't drain properly. Maybe this isn't true for all rooms, but it was for mine. I was not a big fan of showering and standing in a slowly rising pool of water. The elevator was a pain in the a$$. Surely a security measure to prevent wild parties and unwanted guests moving throughout the hotel, but the elevator would only operate with your room key. Whichever floor you wanted to visit, you need to put in your room key and select the floor. This would be fine and only a minor inconvenience if it actually worked. For whatever reason it seemed like you could only select one floor at a time instead of selecting all the floors at once. Then there was the issue when the elevator was crowded of passing around keys and trying to get people to get their floor selected. I'm sure it's really easy, and there are simple rules to operating it, but it is just annoying to throw 10 people in a tiny box and then throw some unique element at them...especially (side note) when half of them are drunk hillbillies on their way to see Kid (MF'in) Rock.This hotel can be had for a bargain price via Hotwire &amp; Priceline, which is how I've booked it in the past. It's a great hotel downtown for me and my suburbanite friends when we feel like enjoying a night on the town with cabs as our designated drivers, and want to just crash in the city for cheap. The staff is overall kind of brief but helpful and get the job done. The location is great and accessible to all the sports venues and Greektown (as well as a short drive from other casinos and Windsor). The rooms are accommodating and comfortable. There is a dining establishment on the main floor, but it has limited hours. I have usually had good experiences the few times I have stayed here. Overnight parking has ranged from $5 to $10 to $20 for me. Not really sure why that is or how they figure their calendars, but when it was $20, that certainly didn't rub me the right way. Especially when I had snagged the room for about $50 to begin with!There was one salty situation that I encountered and had to remedy. I had paid $20 for parking one night I stayed there, and I called in a late checkout the next day and left by 1PM as they told me I could. Lo and behold, my credit card statement had an EXTRA $35 charge on it! This is in addition to having paid for the room AND the $20 parking fee. When I called to inquire and dispute this; the staff told me this was because that Sunday I checked out, the parking lot dubbed as Lions game overflow parking at noon. I clearly explained to them that I stayed there for other leisure purposes the night before, and the only reason I left at 1pm, a tad after noon, was due to the late checkout that I called in. They tried arguing initially that they don't have time to call everyone in the hotel and say that it becomes Lions parking at noon, and I responded wisely by saying, ""Listen, this warning was not posted anywhere prominently, and either way when I called to request a late checkout having nothing to do with the Lions game, the staff member I spoke to could have made me aware of this or made sure that I wasn't charged that bogus Lions parking fee in addition to my overnight hotel patron parking fee. Why would I pay a bogus $35 charge for Lions parking that I didn't intend to use when I wouldn't pay that much to even watch the Lions?""After making that logical point, she quickly conceded to reverse the $35 bogus fee. So yes, it was taken care of, but the staff should not have let that happen in the first place. Hopefully, this was a fluke, and not indicative of any regular inconsistencies this hotel may have.Overall, a good hotel that pops up often on Hotwire &amp; Priceline's 3-star tier for bargain buys in the downtown region. At that pricing, and convenient location, along with comfortable rooms - this place is a decent hotel. They are also very kind to late checkouts at 1PM, which guys like me who party hard on Saturday nights can appreciate on a detox Sunday afternoon. Just be cautious that they don't two-time ya on that parkin' fee when ya check out late, ya hear?Signing out, God is Love.This HGI is pretty new and centrally located in downtown Detroit. It is only 2 blocks from Ford Field and Comerica Park stadiums, and within walking distance 5 blocks from the Detroit Redwing's hockey arena, Renaissance Center, the Fox Theater, Greektown Casino, Monroe Street Greek Town restaurants, the People Mover, and plenty of restaurants and pubs in the surrounding couple of blocks. The 10 story building is new construction, and all the furninshing are new and in excellent condition. There is a bar on site, and a restaurant for your breakfast and even room service. The rooms are great for the business traveller, which include a good working desk with one of the better ergonomic chairs I have sat in, a fridge, microwave, and complimentary hi-speed WiFi! The staff is friendly and very efficient. There was an incident here with my group of colleagues that was handled promptly, courteously and professionally., to not let it detract from our stay. That incident had nothing to do with the hotel or staff, they just handled it very well as to not let it bother any of their guests. Although we were attending a trade show and got fantastic room rates, I think even at rack rates this is a good choice.""Bring your own condoms if you're banging hookers"" - this is the first thing I saw when I checked in via 4Square Sunday evening. I must say that this was before I even arrived at the hotel, I was about 2 blocks away. So I cheated a little bit. But once I saw that I wondered ""wtf did I get myself into?"" The driver pulled up into what seemed like an alley and said okay, we're here. I looked around and did not see any entrance. Again, ""wtf did I get myself into?"" It was pouring out but once out of the Metro Cab I did see the entrance which was manned by a guy that I thought that sleeping. I paid the driver and walked in and must say the place looked nice. I checked in, the room was clean, the heat works, the bathroom works, the lights work. Maybe I set myself up with really low expectations, but I would stay here again without issue. The wifi is usable and you can stream stuff on it without much buffering, so I am not complaining one bit, and unlike the GreekTown Casino, I have not been approached by any hookers in the elevator.If you have stayed at a Hilton Garden Inn before, you already know what to expect.  Clean, cozy rooms with sleep-inducing beds and a generally good overall experience.We did not eat at the hotel restaurant because the hotel is too close to so many great places.  Greektown is literally one block away form the hotel.  If the Tigers are in town and playing you can also walk to Comerica Park, it only takes about 5 minutes to get there.  Wanna watch an event at Ford Arena, you can get there in 5 minutes too.The internet is fast and with a little patience, you can even print out your boarding pass.  It costs $20 a night to park in the lot, but it's Valet Service and the Valet that helped us was plenty nice.If you have business in Downtown Detroit, I would say this is a good a pick as any!I haven't even completed my stay yet, but I felt compelled to write this review. I am on the road traveling for work 90% of the time I'm working. My check-in date was 8/9 on a Thursday no rooms were available. I used to work at a hotel and I know that the average time that it takes to clean a room is around 45 minutes. I was 1 of 2 people in the entire lobby waiting to get checked into a room and I tried to make it clean to Jerie and the other lady at the front desk that I needed a room as soon as one was ready. I am an HHonors member and I figured that I was reasonable in my request. They told me one was not ready and I could wait in the lobby and use the business center for work. The problem is that I had a shirt that needed to be ironned and could not show up to meet with a client looking the way I did. I was cold since I still had the clothes on from the warmer climate that I came from. I also needed to shower before meeting with my client. I must have came back to the front desk to ask politely if any room type that I reserved was available for checkin, but was told no. The one other person in the lobby had a child who was making a lot of noise and I was forced to make my conference call with this going on in the background. I noticed that they were making keys for other guests who hadn't arrived yet. I install computer systems and having worked at a few hotels, I know they were preblocking other guests expected to arrive at the hotel. The rooms they were making keys for were more than likeyly vacant and clean, but I do not know for sure. I could tell they were getting annoyed with me by the tone of their voice, and I tried to be as polite as I could. Finally, I asked to speak with the general manager, but was told he was in a meeting and couldn't speak with me. I almost felt discriminated against, and it could have been because of my age or that I was a different ethinicity than both front desk agents. I waited for about 3 hours before I finally got checked in.The Hilton Garden Inn is conveniently located Downtown.  I was able to check in, get the SMART bus for a shopping trip, return to the hotel, and go out to dinner.  The Hard Rock Cafe is within walking distance of the hotel.  Hotel Staff was friendly and accommodating.  A leaky toilet and flooded bathroom floor were taken care of immediately by Housekeeping.  Also, the desk clerk opened the hotel's business center for me on a Sunday night in order to print my airline boarding pass.     I recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Detroit for fans of the Lions and Tigers as well as anyone else who visits the Motor City.When I found out what was paid for this room after checkout I almost sh** a brick!! First off anything in the city of Detroit doesn't have a rite to charge you nearly $200 for a room. Yes it was great to be close to the ballpark &amp; get to drink &amp; walk home but that's it. There were burns on the air conditioner &amp; the buttons were missing. Be warned that you have to turn the air on from the wall, I was about to flip out trying to figure out how to turn it on. Also be warned that there are three sets of curtains &amp; if you don't want the sun (or what passes as sun in Michigan) to wake you pull the drapes behind the sheers. The room was small, the shower curtain was ripped, &amp; the shower head shot water out of the top onto the ceiling where there was mold growing. Now if this room was like $ 100 then it woulda been worth it otherwise.....not at all impressed....PS they double charged my friend for the room &amp; now he gets to jump thro hoops to get his money back.This hotel is very nice! They give a government discount for law enforcement as well, which was nice. It is a block away from Ford Field. I personally stayed here for the last Bears game of the season. All of the employees are very helpful. If I ever go to Detroit again I will be staying here. The city itself isnt all that great but the hotel is.","The property is nice and serves well as it's purpose.  Mine is not to Drink and Drive. When you check in grab 3 things the restaurant guide, city map and a coupon (just ask I got it twice) for comp breakfast in the morning. The hotel is in the middle of everything if you can walk a few blocks. There is also a people mover stop about 4 blocks away across fro Small Plates Tapas Bar and the Detroit Opera House.",,,"['multiple', 'times', 'continues', 'toward', 'top', 'list', 'places',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/inn-on-ferry-street-detroit,Inn On Ferry Street,4.5,$$,49,"The Inn at Ferry Street is a row of 4 buildings set near Wayne State. Each was once a private home to a local Detroit  family, and has the Queen Anne architecture and details that make a nerd like me love climbing 3 flights of stairs (no elevators, what do you think?) to get to my room.It's a little difficult at first to find (it doesn't help they are doing construction on the street) but make sure you go to 84 Ferry Street, as that is where check-in is.I was greeted by a wonderful front desk gentleman, and the valet was great too! They have a charming dining area where the free breakfast is in the mornings, and there is coffee/tea/hot chocolate when you arrive which was perfect for this freezing Californian.This place is old school, so you're given a traditional key to get into your room. But they do have card keys to get into the front door of each building. No elevator so be aware!There is free internet which is great, and the bed was comfortable with soft linens.The shower/bathroom was updated with nice toiletries and towels.This place  is like a high end hotel with the feel of a small bed and breakfast.The building I was in is called the Rhoem House, and I loved seeing the old photographs of brides walking down the staircase I was on with their beautiful gowns. I also loved the stained glass window which adds to the beauty of the building. Plues, they have amazing chocolate chip cookies from Avalon Baker and water in your room.Its a nice area of Detroit, close to Henry Ford Hospital, Wayne State, museums and downtown. I arrived late, but it looks like its a 5 minute walk to a small mall which looked like it had adorable shops.The rates were reasonable given the area and the amenities the place provides. I highly recommend a stay at the Inn on Ferry Street!Really did not enjoy my stay. Here is a real review 1-they don't mention this on reservation but not all the rooms are in the same building as the breakfast, so you have to walk in a sub zero temp to get to  breakfast2-they limit the thermostat in the room to 73, without the little space heater, it was freezing 3-location is surrounded by construction making it impossible to find4-rooms are neither classy nor modern, they are just old and worn out. Old technology and old furniture and old sheets 5-breakfast is a buffet that is seriously lacking, this is no where near a traditional bed and breakfast, the old fashioned way of home cooked breakfast, these were commercial powder eggs and old scones Don't waste your money and time.The Inn on Ferry Street can't be beat!Restored elegance, great breakfast. We will stay here ever time from now on. Wonderful best lodging close to downtown, airport and Grosse Pointe family.I had a very enjoyable stay and will return. This bed and breakfast has been restored wonderfully. It's extremely cozy and comfortable. The bed was difficult to get out of because it was so warm and pleasant.  The staff was amazing. I encountered three  guys who made sure my stay was satisfying.  I also used the Inn""s free van service and the driver was ridiculously nice and accommodating.  I fell sick and let's say the driver looked out for me a lot. I wish I remembered all the staffs name I encountered because they are definitely worth mentioning for this post.  I'm not sure the van service is year round or just seasonal but they take you and pick you up at events in the surrounding area.  The cookies in my room were great. ( of course because they are from Avalon bakery ). They had a menu in the room that was filled with restaurants in the neighborhood that I frequent and enjoy. I had a great experience here.What a charming place.  A row of rehabbed Victorian houses right across from Wayne State University.  The history of these homes is amazing.  Read the book about it in the lobby of the main house.  If this B and B were in any city outside of Detroit, the price would like triple.  It's a wonderful place to stay with your honey.  Nice touches, like pastries and coffee in the morning and treats in the evening too.  This is not a chain, so don't expect everything to be matchy matchy like a Marriott or Westin.  That is what makes this place as charming as it it.  Lovely place to stay for a Fall weekend getaway.  Detroit is lucky to have this gem!I wanted to like it here more than I did.  The buildings are beautiful, and my room was spacious. Positives: Great cookies upon arrival; walking distance to the DIA, other museums, and great restaurants; parking in the back; staff was friendly for the most part. Negatives: There was a new driveway being paved right next to my room for most of my stay (I was on the ground level of the Pungs House - At least they could have warned me!); I found a bug crawling on the carpet (which I caught and placed outside); the woman who checked me in laughed uncontrollably in the back room when I returned to tell them that I couldn't get the electric key for the front door to work (she was friendly aside from that).My husband and I stayed here for our 6 year wedding anniversary this past weekend. It is a beautiful historic home. We stayed in a Queen Deluxe and it was very cozy. Here are my pros and cons: Pros: Perfect location to walk anywhere in midtown. The DIA is literally 5 minutes away. We had dinner at Selden Standard and it took us about 20 minutes. We love walking whenever we get a chance so it was really convenient for us. The Inn provides you with a free shuttle service within a 5 mile radius. They will drop you off and pick you up! The Inn is beautifully maintained and clean. Compared to other major hotels in downtown Detroit, we thought this was affordable. Cons: Because our room was on the main floor (right in the lounge...we didn't know), we could hear people hanging out in the lounge, coming and going...thin walls, I think. The person who checked us in was very nice, but didn't give us any information about the Inn, breakfast times...etc. We are used to better service than what we experienced at this Inn. The Inn does not have any DVDs if you are wanting to watch a movie.This is more of a hotel than a B&amp;B. Again, we are used to better amenities for guests from our other B&amp;B experiences. However, now that we know what to expect, we would go back. Nice rooms, good price, and great location!Great place! We always stay here during the auto show. The place is quaint and located in a quiet neighborhood near Wayne State University. The staff is friendly, the rooms are great, and the breakfast is top-notch. It's located a block away from several museums and restaurants.The staff really goes out of their way to make you comfortable. This last visit the heater stopped working in my room and they not only helped me move my stuff to a new room but also upgraded me for free for the trouble. Great people and great place to stay!I highly recommend the Inn if you're heading to the Motor City. My boyfriend and I, Texans, are over the next few summers visiting all thirty baseball stadiums. Over July 4th weekend we headed for a 3 city trip starting with Detroit. When it came time to check out and head to Cleveland I did NOT want to leave. I booked our two night stay through the AmEx travel site months in advance. The day before we left Houston I called the Inn to confirm our reservation and they'd never heard of me. Uh oh. After about 1.5 hours of calls between me, AmEx, and the Inn we finally got it straightened out. Phew. I'm still not sure whose fault it was but the Inn was super helpful and understanding. When we arrived the next day and I said my name the front desk lady apologized for the inconvenience and was very friendly. Our room in the Pungs house was just beautiful with many windows making it bright and lovely. There were even fresh cookies and bottles water waiting for us! I found the Inn in a travel guide but booked it based on the Yelp reviews and specifically the shuttle service. The shuttle service was AMAZING. Especially for something like the Tigers game. A number of people from the Inn went to the game and we all agreed upon an area outside the Fox Theater for after the game and like clockwork the shuttle was waiting for us. He also gave us a number to call too so you don't have to pre-arrange a pick up, it just worked out for us. The breakfast was incredible too. I'm not sure why anyone is complaining because I thought there were plenty of options. Waffles, eggs, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, granola bars, yogurt...if you can't find a delicious breakfast in there well that's on you. This absolutely gorgeous Inn is centrally located in a great area, has lovely staff, and has a 24 hour shuttle service so if you're going to Detroit you'd just be silly not to book at the Inn.I would highly recommend The Inn on Ferry Street to anyone staying in Detroit. The property consists of four mansions and two carriage houses built in the late 1800's, converted to a B&amp;B. The mansions are well-maintained, and the rooms are quaint and charming. The service was great as well - friendly staff, complimentary Wi-Fi, complimentary buffet breakfast each morning, and a shuttle that picks you up/drops you off for free anywhere within a 5-mile radius of the hotel.Fun place to stay. Stayed here as part of a wedding group. Hotel is comprised of four separate mansions and coach houses built in late 1800s. Knowing what it takes to renovate and maintain buildings of their age, overall very nicely done. Remember these are very old buildings so if you are looking for perfect, stay at a chain hotel. If you want a fun experience with great staff stay here.It is relatively easy for a hotel to receive a positive review when everything goes well, but the true value of an establishment shows in how they deal with issues and problems that may arise during a stay.My husband and I stayed at the Inn on Ferry Street this weekend to enjoy an impromptu get-away sans kids. The price is reasonable, staff is welcoming, rooms are clean, the atmosphere is interesting, and the location (walking distance to the midtown museums) was fantastic. Given that we have two young children at home and I'm pregnant with our third, we were both really looking forward to a restful night. Unfortunately, several other guests staying at the Inn had other ideas. A wedding party decided to bring the raucous celebration back to their rooms in the early morning hours and it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a college frat party. I get the impression this is not something that happens often at at Inn on Ferry, which does not seem like the type of place that would normally attract that kind of guest. I was extremely impressed, however, with the way the front desk handled a difficult situation.We enjoyed our weekend in Detroit immensely - if you go make sure to check out the Detroit Artists Market a few blocks down the street from the DIA. They are a small gallery that features a number of local artists and host some very interesting exhibits.What a find.  It's hard to believe that a place like this exists at all in any large city, not to mention at the incredibly reasonable price that we got through hotels dot com.  The Inn is one centrally administered hotel with four contiguous buildings--large stone Victorian-style homes.  Aesthetically it seems like a bed and breakfast, but the format is a hybrid, 50% boutique hotel, 50% B&amp;B, 100% uniquely delightful.Both the interiors and exteriors were utterly handsome and charming.  The quality of our room (1202 in the Pungs House) was more than satisfactory.  Some aspects of the house clearly showed their age, such as the window and door frames which have been frequently repainted, and much of the furniture seemed antique.  However, that is to expected in homes of this vintage and adds to the atmosphere.  Most of the room fixtures, particularly the entire bathroom, were brand-new and flawless.  The walls themselves had been crisply painted in the very recent past.There is one major perk of staying at the Inn--shuttle service.  The shuttle will pick up and drop off guests anywhere within a five-mile radius of the hotel AROUND THE CLOCK.  I read about this before booking, but I thought that it sounded too good to be true.  It wasn't.  We used it to get to and from Comerica Park around 6pm and 10pm, but the 24-hour service was confirmed by our driver.  I failed to catch his name, which is too bad because he was a great unofficial tour guide and local information source for the two ten-minute drives which we spent with him.Other than that, our service interactions were minimal, but all of the staff seemed courteous and helpful.  Breakfast was served for all guests in the main building.  This is one area for improvement, because although the quality of the breakfast was satisfactory, the logistics are a clusterbleep.  In general, there are two problems:  scattered placement of food in too-close proximity to the tables and chairs; and too many people for the small space.  #2 would not be a problem without #1 and vice versa.By all means, do not let the prospect of a crowded breakfast prevent you from booking this place for your next stay in Detroit.  It is an absolute gem and priced very reasonably.Other details:+  Real drinking glasses+  Strong wifi with no password or login required+  Complimentary bottled water AND locally produced oatmeal-raisin cookies (see photo)+  Free parking in a lighted and guarded lot behind the properties+  Numerous comfortable places to sit outside the room:  on the landing of our floor, on the ground floor of the house, on the grounds outside.  This is a boon for those couples with widely disparate wake-up times.+  Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea inside the room+  A hotel-provided magazine actually worth reading:  Preservation, ""The magazine of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.""  It was so good that I took it home with me.  Who ever heard of such a thing?!+  Breakfast served 7 to 11:30 on the weekends+  Breakfast consisted of:  glorious fresh fruit, pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, blueberries, and giant plump blackberries and raspberries; scrambled eggs with shredded cheese, salsa, and chopped scallions on the side; italian, white, and cinnamon breads; raisin bagels; orange, apple, and cranberry juices; ice water, coffee, and tea; a waffle maker and premixed batter; four dry cereals; instant oatmeal packets; several varieties of yogurt; and a basket of whole apples, bananas, and oranges.+/- Tap water is fine to drink, but does not come out cold+/- Shower is quick to heat up but very slow to drain.  Also, the curtain is so thick that the stall becomes very dark.+/- Electronic key cards for the buildings, but metal keys for the roomsThe buildings are beautiful. The staff is the most hospitable and friendly team I've every experienced. A true Detroit hidden gem. I recommend everyone stay here at least once.I had a vintage Detroit themed wedding and this is where I stayed, which was really perfect for my day.  I spent three days at the Inn On Ferry Street and I cannot wait to come back.  In fact, I am planning my return for our anniversary...  It is quaint, charming, stunning, historical, it is tops in my book.  There are 40 rooms located in the Victorian Homes and Carriages Houses, once owned by DIA.  Each room is different.  I loved the little details from the awesome cds from local musicians i.e. Mayer Hawthorn to the fresh baked cookies from the honored Avalon Bakery.  Every morning fresh breakfast was served which included Great Lakes Coffee, which is roasted in Detroit.  Baked goods from Avalon are free to nibble on throughout the day, enjoy them by the grand piano or roaring fireplace. If you get hungry they have a bevy of Detroit edibles for noshing like McClure's Pickle potato chips and Traverse City Sour Cherries...Rich wood, winding staircases, lead windows set the perfect backdrop for photos.  I think the gazebo under the willow tree, near the carriage house would be a great place for an intimate wedding ceremony.  I totally LOVED the free shuttle...we dropped off our marriage license and hit up Green Dot Stables....PLUS, they took me to my wedding and all of my guests. If you are having a wedding downtown, the Inn gave us a group rate, and we took over an entire house...it was so nice having breakfast with my family and wedding guests.The only thing it lacked was a mini fridge...I hear updates are coming.The Inn on Ferry Street is a gem in Detroit.  It is very close to my heart and I am so thrilled to have cherished memories  forever of the Inn.My department had a few faculty candidates stay at the Inn on Ferry Street.  Beautiful old rooms and they have a nice continental breakfast that when you go you can have a nice little meeting to discuss future plans of hiring or whatever! Check in process appeared to be great - no glitches. The check-out process is also great.  You can also order the prospective employee a Metro Car to return them to DTW.  Inn on Ferry Street caters to their customers as well as to Wayne State University.Perfect place to stay if you are interviewing for a position downtown Detroit! If you arrive after 5:00 you can also order off of their menu from different area restaurants!On my first visit to Detroit this past July, I braced myself for a depressed city.  Time magazine had just done a cover story on the city's bankruptcy and I had flashbacks to ""8 Mile"" which blended into scenes of Clint Eastwood talking about Cadillacs to an empty chair and Kwame Kilpatrick bathing in a tub of dollar bills.  So, not the stuff weekend vacations are made of.We pulled up to the stretch of properties that make up the Inn on Ferry Street and I was a little shocked.  The block is well-maintained and quiet, and the houses themselves would be impressive anywhere, and even more so in the middle of a city.  It reminded me of the motto for my own city : urbs in horto, (""city in a garden"" for those of you too cool for high school Latin).  It was serene and historic and beautiful.  Our room (in Pungs House) was very comfortable: updated, sunny and cozy.  The bathroom was large and my only issue there is that the shower curtain was so thick, it made the shower itself very dark when closed.  Kind of like a blackout curtain to conceal yourself...from your soap.    The breakfast contained a variety of offerings, mostly cold: yogurts, cereals, fruit, pastries, some bread and bagels for toasting.  There were also eggs and I think a waffle iron.  But for me, the berries on the fruit plate were the highlight - they were phenomenal.  I'm not sure if we were there during a busy weekend or if we just hit prime breakfast time, but the dining room was crowded.  And to maximize table space, they've put one in the middle of the back food room, which cannot be pleasant for  the people sitting there.  That  room is more of a galley and the table must be some kind of transgression in feng shui.Along the same lines (wait for it) there are no lines in the parking lot to designate spaces.  That means on full days, you might be out of luck if people were extra sloppy and left too much space between cars.  And if the Evanston-North Whole Foods parking lot has taught me anything, it's that people cannot manage to park even when there *are* lines (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/whole-foods-market-evanston-2?select=GS5P3nSVMe1kMxg6oGkyag#E0utsxfDxFYEmj4NyYixeA"">yelp.com/biz_photos/whol...</a>).But, on the bright side, and it's a very bright side, you may not need to drive once you arrive.  There is a shuttle that will drop off and pick up guests anywhere within a five mile radius, at any time.  We used this service to get to and from a Phillies game (sorry, Tigers game) and it was extremely convenient and prompt.  Furthermore, our driver was a lifelong Detroit resident and provided some color commentary on the current situation (see first paragraph) as well as general hospitality.  So, all things considered, this is a very satisfactory way to experience Detroit.  The buildings are formal but comfortable, and the extras (shuttle, 24 hour security of parking lot) let guests be carefree.  I recommend it and would return, without hesitation.6 Beautiful restored mansion downtown and bed and breakfast. Spent 4 nights for work classes. Free shuttle with very nice and knowledge staff. Night in the D package included 4 course dinner at the Whitney and transportation. The homes are gorgeous and the rooms very well restored and decorated with period Furniture. Great place to stay for the night or a week.I lodged here for during a four day work training. The staff was always so friendly and attentive - no question was ever too much to ask. Each room was absolutely charming with Victorian looks but brand new fixtures and technology. Did I mention their sensational complimentary breakfast buffet? I would stay here again in a heartbeat!A bunch of stayed at the Inn together. My family stayed in the Carriage House, and had the entire place all to ourselves.   It was roomy, charming, and clean.   My kids had their own bedroom and my husband and I had a bedroom and a sitting room.  We shared one bathroom.  My only complaint is that the carpet in the entrance stairway/hallway could've been shampooed (too much soil tracked in from rain and snow?).   The patio in front of the Carriage House would be perfect for a baby shower or a wedding.  I looked at the rooms where my other family members stayed and they were immaculate!!  It was really neat how they converted these old houses into hotel-like rooms.   The details in the architecture was preserved,  there were old fireplaces, crown molding, curved staircases, window benches, balconies, stained glass, etc.The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The shuttle driver took us to the Riverwalk and was fun to chat with.  The breakfast was good in that the fruit was really fresh and there were a lot of choices.If you must have an ice machine, hot tub, room service, or a vending machine, this is not the right place for you (it's a bed and breakfast).  But if you want to experience staying in a historical house in the center of the museum district of Detroit, with a complimentary ride to the attractions of downtown Detroit, definitely book your stay here!","This hotel is a gem. It's essentially a series of mansions converted to guestrooms and common areas. The room we had was immaculate, spacious, comfortable, and quiet.The location is excellent, as well. The Inn is located right on the edge of the museum and university area, and there are several great museums a short walk away. Detroit has a reputation for being depressed right now, but in the vicinity of the Inn that just means a lot of open space and quiet.Public transit in Detroit is a little sketchy, but the main N/S artery of the city (Woodward Avenue) is just west of the Inn, and there is a bus line that can take you downtown and close to the south lakefront and both major sports venues.The breakfast is excellent, and the staff helpful and warm. Even if your business takes you downtown, it might be worth it to stay here and commute the three miles or so. You'll get a great night's sleep and a great start to your day before hailing a cab or taking the adventuresome bus ride.I highly recommend this place, and I'm looking forward to returning.This may be my all-time-favorite hotel/B&amp;B, for its pure coziness, serenity, and beauty. I almost always stay here when I come to Detroit (if rooms are available), which is about once a month. All of the Victorian mansions are absolutely beautiful and the rooms are really comfortable. I'm often put in a room that has a big bedroom, plus a side parlor with a pull out couch. The included breakfast is really nice, with great make-your-own waffles, nice scrambled eggs, and excellent coffee. There's always fresh fruit, coffee, and little chocolates available in the lobby/living room around the clock. I've held many meetings in the upstairs business center and have occasionally hosted larger meetings in the lovely carriage house. The Inn has free Internet, van service that can take you to and pick you up from nearby locations, and free parking in the back parking lot. The cost is typically less than the big downtown hotels. There's also access to a nearby gym, though I've never used it. I would love to bring my family to Detroit for a vacation, partly because I want them to experience this wonderful B&amp;B. That's how much I like this place.4.5 stars!The most comfy and beautiful place I have stayed at. The Victorian style of the houses are to die for. I LOVE it!The staff are really nice and the receptionist is there 24 hours. There is a little living room next to the receptionist where you can just sit and relax. There is a guest room upstairs of the main house where you can print your itinerary and a big wooden table if you need to hold a meeting. There is also a spacious restroom by the ""living room"" that you can use. We got two rooms. They are all different with different sheets and furniture. My dad said that his room didn't have a couch chair or a telephone. I am not sure since I didn't check out his room. There was a few minor issues with my room. The bathroom door was really hard to close. You have to use a lot of force. My bathroom sink dripped and the one window that you can open had to be held in place by a roll of toilet paper. My shower door didn't keep all the water out and it leaked onto the granite. The room itself was well stocked. There is a small closet that housed a fan, heater, extra sheets, hairdryer, iron, iron board, toilet paper, tissues, and extra sheets and pillow. They only give you about five hangers. They slip a  newspaper under your door on the weekdays. I am not sure about Sat as I didn't stay there Sat morning. The Inn offers a complementary water bottle, cookie, tea, coffee, and a breakfast served 7am-11am. I love their breakfast. It is buffet style with scrambled eggs that you can top with shredded cheddar cheese, green peppers, and green onions. You can also make your own waffles and yogurt with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, etc. They offered 6 different types of bread/bagels. I love their sourdough bread! Pound cake, cereal, granola bars, yogurt, fruits. Starbucks coffee, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice, coffee, ice water, tea. I love their breakfast!They also offer a complementary shuttle within 5 miles of the Inn. Both of the drivers we had was very friendly and kind of like a tour guide. There is a couple restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and also a CVS. I would love to stay here again.This place is amazing. The prices are very affordable and the rooms are palatial. I cannot recommend this place strongly enough. Definitely the best place to seduce or be seduced in Detroit.This is a charming place! Staff are all very friendly and helpful, our room was comfortable and the breakfast is very good. The van service saved us cab fare and the driver had some good suggestions for nearby restaurants. In our two-night stay, we had just two minor complaints: our room was very cold (AC blasting) and we didn't have a thermostat to adjust it. When we called the desk, their suggestion was to close the vents, which worked OK. Also, the key card reader to the building where we stayed is very finicky - we encountered several other guests in the same building who had similar issues. But I would stay here again in a heartbeat! A very good value for the money.Charming. Absolutely charming, and in a way people aren't accustomed to anymore. Regal, without all the haughtiness. Yes, charming is the best word to describe the beautiful and historic Inn on Ferry Street. It's as if you've traveled back in time and are experiencing a kind of quiet luxury few of us know today (and most likely, even fewer knew then!). The Inn consists of four Victorian style houses and two carriage houses (check out the Smith Carriage house, you don't see buildings like that anymore). The DIA owned these buildings before they were transformed into what they are today, which gives you an idea of the historical significance of the place. Each building has a different feel, but what they all have in common is beautiful design and elegance that makes you really feel that this could have been your home in another lifetime. There's even a parlor in each house to sit and talk, read, play board games, or get to know the other guests. Much cozier than a lobby! One thing I really appreciated during my stay was the free shuttle service. We were shuttled to and from Roast (yum!) downtown, and we only had to give 20 minutes notice. As for your car, they have a private, gated parking area. The Inn also provides a pretty fabulous (and free) breakfast spread of fresh fruit, coffee, omelets, homemade waffles, and more. Oh, did I mention the homemade cookies at check-in? I truly loved my stay at the Inn. It doesn't just feel like another locale, it feels like another time. Now that's a real vacation! Try the Inn on Ferry Street if you're looking to stay somewhere that feels warmer and friendlier than a hotel. Somewhere with a different, maybe even magical, feel. Life needs a bit of whimsy.This bed and breakfast is incredible. A bit pricey but full of Detroit charm. The breakfast buffet is included though you can also visit if you are a local like me!I wish every city had a B&amp;B like Inn on Ferry Street.  I have to agree with all the glowing reviews, it's really that awesome. The Inn is four houses located on the northern end of the Midtown neighborhood, one block from the Detroit Institute of Arts. We stayed in the Owen House on the first floor. Our room was the size of a regular hotel room, beautifully appointed with very fresh looking, vintage (or vintagey) furniture. The four-poster bed was firm and the sheets were crisp and clean, as were the towels.  EVERYTHING in and outside the room was exceptionally clean, including the bathroom. there was a complementary tea, water, coffee and delicious oatmeal raisin (my favorite!) cookie station next to the bed and a selection of lovely world beat CDs on the nightstand. The sitting area of Owen House reminded me of staying with a fancy aunt.  The furniture was period and pretty, but also comfortable and functional. I sat by the fireplace and knit while my husband read. It was so cozy and quiet. While having a nice, clean, quiet place to stay while we were visiting was a relief, the staff and amenities at the Inn really made our weekend a relaxing and romantic experience.  The free wifi was a treat, as was the expansive breakfast buffet which had a little bit of everything (including a waffle station). But the real deal-maker is the Shuttle service. We didn't want to take a chance of being stranded in a strange part of a strange city, so we drove around like fools the first night led by Apple maps that had going on and off freeways left and right. By the time we left the art opening we attended, we just wanted to be safely home.  The next day we walked to Corktown, to take in the city, but by the time we finished lunch, a walk back seemed so daunting. I called up the front desk to ask if--just possibly--the shuttle could pick us up. The super-pleasant clerk said ""Of course, he'll be right there"" and in 10 minutes he was. I learned that the shuttle could pick us up ANYWHERE w/i 5 miles of the Inn and also could take us to ANYWHERE from the Inn and that it ran 24 hours over the weekend. The driver was super-nice and very helpful with entertainment suggestions.  Needless to say, if you are locomoting yourself around at night, you are doing it wrong. The shuttle service made going out in Detroit a relaxing adventure, not a tense ordeal.Everything at the Inn on Ferry Street was top-notch, and not just ""for Detroit"" or ""for the price."" No joke, every other hotel and B&amp;B should take notes on customer service and maintenance of facilities from the folks at the Inn.Another day, another business trip. I try to find little ways to make one night travel to not-so-exotic locations feel a big more glam and Inn on Ferry Street did just that. I cannot say enough good things about the staff, the hotel and the history.Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful, brought me a toothbrush and fixed my TV even! I was very pleased with the room and loved the attention to detail and efforts to highlight the history of the place. I slept like a drugged baby. THANK YOU.My wife and I enjoyed a one night stay (Nov 30) at the Inn on Ferry Street.   The Inn is a truly unique setting and experience.  Friendly service, charming rooms and overall setting.   Great (included) breakfast.   One tip:  I upgraded to a ""suite"" which put us in one of the carriage houses.  While it was fine, the next time we will stay in a regular room so that we are to be sure to be in one of the main, restored houses.Is there a better and more unique place to stay in Detroit? If there is, please let me know when you find it, but even then I would find it very hard to believe...The Inn on Ferry Street sets a standard that really is nearly impossible to match. The four impeccably restored Victorian mansions and two carriage houses make up the Inn, located in the heart of the Historic District of Midtown Detroit.  The attention to detail is simply amazing, as are the staff who are dedicated to providing ""above and beyond"" customer service. The staff is welcoming, gracious and accommodating from the moment you cross the threshold at the reception, which is located in the Scott House, former residence of renowned architect John Scott. Throughout your stay, you cannot help to notice how friendly all the employees are from the gentleman that mans the free local shuttle to the housekeepers who tidy your room and have no problem helping you out if you ask for extra towels or in my case, an extra coffee packet or two. Really, really honest to goodness good people who always put the customer first. I have had the opportunity to stay at the Inn on Ferry Street twice over the past two years, each time for a week and each time in a different mansion. Both rooms have been well appointed, and are certainly worthy of more than the three stars they are rated at. The price was also very good, I've had best results contacting the Inn directly for a super good rate.Staying in a historic mansion is really cool if you are a history buff at all and it is a delight to find out who built the house and who lived there over the years. I mean where else can you stay in the former mansion of a railroad baron, as I did on my last stay, at such an affordable price? Overall, the amenities that are provided by the Inn on Ferry Street are top notch. Make sure you hit the breakfast each morning as it is not only a great selection of food to fuel your day but a neat gathering place where you can socialize with the other guests in the parlor, if you so desire.  Or you can simply relax with a piping hot cup of fresh Starbucks coffee and read the morning paper. Hey, you might even let go and daydream a bit, and pretend that it is your house that you are sitting in and it is indeed early 1900...The comfort of home is really what the Inn on Ferry Street conveys to me. Well, ""home"" if my house was a mansion built in the late 1800's :)  This is what the large luxury chains strive so hard to provide, but all too often fail to achieve. The Inn on Ferry Street nails it dead on, and I wouldn't stay any other place when visiting Detroit.I was looking for a way to surprise my hubby for Sweetest Day; I wanted to leave the house completely for the day, but no drive hours away.My dear friend Nancy suggested a B&amp;B in Detroit and she raved about the Inn on Ferry Street.  After visiting various B &amp; B sites, the Inn's included, and narrowing it down and talking to the helpful staff at the Inn via phone, I decided to reserve a room.My husband is very picky, so I was hoping and praying it was awesome...and it was!  The location is awesome, just a block from the DIA on a very nice, quant street.  The lawns and chain of old historic homes that make up the Inn, were just gorgeous to look at and walk around in the lovely fall weather!Our 3rd floor room, for about $160, was AWESOME!  Large ceilings, light-giving windows, fresh and vibrant wall colors, 4 poster king sized bed with ultra-comfortable linens---I was in heaven!  2 other selling points:  My husband and I caught a musical at City Theatre.  The Inn provided free shuttle to and from---saving us oodles on FINDING and PAYING for our own parking (there was a concert at The Fox so we would have been in trouble!)  They also provided a scrumptous European FREE breakfast in the morning.  Fresh fruits of all sorts, waffles, eggs, toast, a pound cake my husband couldn't stop eating, Starbucks coffee and a variety of other beverages.CHECK OUT the INN!  Next time we go we plan to check out the Wasabi Restaurant within walking distance.....I think that the Inn on Ferry Street is a very good bed and breakfast type lodging. As for your own assessment, much of it hinges upon whether you would enjoy what the Inn has to offer. I will describe the Inn and my stay there as well as I can in this review.What is called the Inn on Ferry Street is actually a handful of restored Victorian stone houses on a residential block that still has some well maintained buildings from the turn of the century. Guests register, pick up their keys, and so on in the main building, which is one of the smaller two story houses. Thus, you arrive on a very quiet residential block with several other older houses along with the Inn's buildings. Then you ascend into what looks like a restored and impeccably maintained Victorian house to register.This main building, or administrative building, is also where breakfast is served. The first floor is accessible to all guests of the Inn. It contains a lounge with a TV, newspapers, magazines, couches, refreshments at various times of the day (coffee and tea almost always), as well as the registration desk, kitchen, two dining areas and two bathrooms. The second floor is used by housekeeping, for storing linen and various cleaning supplies and equipment.Each building of the Inn is different. Each room in the building is also unique. My room happened to be the front facing room in the house next door. It probably was some kind of living room type area before the building was partitioned into rental rooms. Anyway, my room had two large windows and plenty of light, along with privacy curtains and blackout drapes. My bed was a relatively comfortable, but not exceptional, queen brass bed. The closet and bathroom were obviously added on to the room, not part of the original house floor plan. Overall, my room was comfortable, clean and nice looking, but definitely not luxurious.My building was structurally well restored. The front porch and porch stairs, for example, were clearly high quality restorations. My stay was in the winter, but I imagine that the porch is a great place to enjoy the evening when the weather is nice. Upon entering the building, there is a large common space that is too large and too wide to be called a hall. Doors to the guest rooms were in this ""vestibule"", just as hotel rooms branch out of a hotel hall. There is also an armchair or two, just as you might see in a hotel hallway.Breakfast is in the main building. The food portions are more than adequate. The food is quite good quality, and tastes good. As for service, the Inn on Ferry Street differs somewhat from the typical bed and breakfast. The service is farmed out to professionals and you never see the owners. Breakfast is cooked and served by two kitchen staff. Housekeeping is done by a housekeeping staff. The person in charge of registration, who also takes reservations and answers the phone, is also the only resource corresponding to a concierge. Unlike most B&amp;B's, the Inn has a couple of shuttle vans for the guests. At the time of my stay, the shuttles would make trips to and from the airport for guests who were leaving or arriving. The service part of the Inn is like a hotel model, except that the Inn's staff is much, much smaller than that of a full service hotel. I had a mixture of experiences with service at the Inn, but it was mostly positive. The main building is always available for the guests. It is a good place to enjoy coffee, juice or the cookies and other complimentary treats provided by the Inn. Around breakfast, when other guests are sharing the space, and people are entering and leaving the building, the living room feels a bit like a hotel lobby --- not so comfortable. The Inn on Ferry Street is conveniently located a block or two from Woodward. It is close to Wayne State and several museums, most notably the Detroit Institute of Arts, which is short three block walk from the Inn. (The Institute is the site used by a foreign films group, so it provides evening entertainment as well.) There are no restaurants in walking distance, although Byblos is a reasonable choice for sandwiches. The Inn on Ferry Street provides decent rooms in restored Victorian houses that are on a residential street of similar houses from that period. It provides service that is ok, rather minimal for a hotel, but professional compared with a B&amp;B. It has a good location and provides shuttle service too. The Inn is very good.After I wrote my 3 star review, I did what I thought was the responsible thing and copied it and sent it to the Inn on Ferry Street email on their web page.  I thought I owed them an honest assessment of how our visit went.Within two hours I received a very concerned response from the owner!!  She apologize to us and told us she wanted the opportunity to make it right.  She comped our room for our less than stellar experience, and gave us a gift certificate for their Dining in the D gift package.  We were finally able to make it back for a weekend, and we stayed in a really nice room with a whirlpool/jacuzzi bathtub (also had a shower).  The room had its own thermostat, and the room was a nice size with shower, ironing board, etc.  We had dinner at the Whitney and it was fabulous.  The package includes:  appetizer to split, salad for each, entree for each, dessert and a bottle of wine!!  An excellent deal!  The Inn made our reservation so all we had to do was get there on time.  We were able to tour the entire Whitney and the staff was excellent.At the Inn, we were able to relax and have a romantic evening after dinner.  We really enjoyed the staff and the room!!  Breakfast was absolutely wonderful and the dining room had plenty of space, tables, and the buffet was being restocked at a good pace.  We will definitely be back to this charming and beautiful place.  The owners and staff are committed to their guests having the best stay possible, and I'm glad we were given the chance to really enjoy ourselves!!Went to Detroit for my brothers wedding last week and stayed at the Inn on Ferry Street. I love this little place, rooms were nice, updated and clean. I loved the sitting areas in the house we stayed in and in the main house, it was comfortable and relaxing. Staying at an Inn was a somewhat new experience for me being a hotel man mostly. I found the Inn to be a nice change of pace and a much needed overall experience. In the house we stayed in they had book cases filled with novels and guides to the history of Detroit. They also had CD's with relaxing music to choose from to make they stay more enjoyable. I thought the free wi-fi which was a nice touch for a little place like this as well. In addition they had a wonderful shuttle service that took us wherever we wanted and a concierge service to help us pick a nice restaurant. The continental breakfast was nice, but make sure you check with the front desk the night before to see when they stop serving. This is my only complaint, they driver for the shuttle told us one time the night before but when we came down for breakfast they were already breaking down. So in summary, great place to stay if you want something a little different. They have a few little details they have to work out on their end, but nothing too major.This is my first trip to Detroit and wasn't sure what to expect.  The Inn on Ferry Street is a group of Victorian era Mansions all on one block.  The architecture is of the homes is beautiful.  My room is lovely and charming with lots of attention to detail. The public spaces are just as nice,  I was impressed at the options available for the self-serve breakfast.There is also a complimentary shuttle that will take and pick you up wherever you need to go around the neighborhood, which was super helpful since I was there for a few days.My boyfriend and I stayed in the Pungs House, a mansion with a quaint greystone fascade. Our room was cute, cozy, clean and well maintained. The room didn't feel like an over-sterilized hotel room . . . you know the kind of which I speak. Rather, it was like a very nice guest room in your parent's house.Highlights:-Parking lot behind the Scott House-Congenial, helpful and organized staff-Complimentary cookie (which I learned is baked fresh in the Scott House) and bottle of water in room upon arrival-Complimentary Tazo tea and Starbucks coffee in room-Complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning: individual waffle service, fresh fruit (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, pineapple and more), scrambled/boiled eggs and toppings (cheddar cheese, green pepper and more),  cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, yogurt, 3 types of juice, Starbucks coffee, Tazo tea . . . and maybe more! To be honest, my eyes stopped roaming after noticing the individual waffle service!-Complimentary shuttle service to any place within a 5 mile radius-Complimentary, no fuss WiFi that's fast enough to stream videosThe major negative to this place is that people from the neighborhood come in and out of the Scott House for the free food and beverages. These people probably know the staff or owner in some way, but their comings and goings break the magic and romance of the environment. If and when I stay here again, I will lounge in the parlor of the house I'm staying in rather than the Scott House parlor.I can't say enough great things about this place. I had my wedding there this past June, and everything was amazing! Every one of the Inns' employees were extremely helpful to us, and our familes. Trust me, we have a lot of family.Everyone is so accommodating, and eager to answer any questions. To most people planning a wedding can be stressful. Once we knew we were having the wedding at the Inn everything else fell into place. They have great recommendations for every wedding service. It was so nice to be able to have everyone stay in the same place. I recommend staying there immediately!This was the best stay Ive had in years. I love this quaint little bed and breakfast for the service, kindness and quality guest rooms. Historic setting with modern conveniences.I will be back.In a town that's looking for an identity and ways to revitalize the downtown, Detroit is lucky to have a place like the Inn on Ferry Street.  Knowing nothing about Detroit, we used Yelp reviews to help use decide on the Inn as our base for a weekend to watch our SF Giants take on the Tigers. it was a very lucky choice.The Inn is made up of several gorgeous Victorians along a grass lined street. When you check into the middle house, your told which house you're in and told about the free continental breakfast and the shuttle service. The rooms are comfortable with large beds, clean bathrooms with nice toiletries, and great period furniture. And they have fresh baked cookies in the rooms. The houses are amazing, restored to their original beauty, the public spaces allow for quiet reading and relaxing.  The spaces at the Inn almost require you to relax and slow your pace down.One of the best things about the Inn is the free shuttle service. You just call the front desk, let them know where and when you want to go and a van will take you there and pick you up. During our stay,we really tested this, from the ride to dinner at 11pm when we arrived to the 1am pickup from the ballpark after a long rain delay. Every time we got in the van, the drivers were friendly and provided miniature tours of downtown Detroit. Having this service allowed us to explore the city without having to rent a car or spend a ton of money on cabs.I can't wait to find another excuse to get back to Detroit, just to stay in this Inn again.","We stayed at this Inn for our first wedding anniversary and our experience was just as good as the first time. Despite the fact we'd only stayed there once before, the desk clerk remembered us. It's hard to put a monetary value on that kind of hospitality.  Honestly, I can't imagine staying anyway else in Detroit.When faced with a serious issue, the staff and management took it seriously.  I was impressed, and recommend this inn to anyone traveling to Detroit.  I think the Inn on Ferry Street is a rare find these days.  Detroit should be proud.Since we travel so much, I try to stay in historic hotels whenever possible. This is a lovely place all in all. Our room is one of the largest we've ever stayed in at this price. We chose one of the Inn's packages, so we received tickets to the amazing Detroit Institute of Art, which also came with a nice little popup book about the Diego Rivera exhibit. We were provided with fresh cookies in our room, and they have Starbucks coffee in suite. Definitely can't go wrong with the beautiful bay window, huge jet tub, or classy decor. They offer a free shuttle, which is always nice, plus there's free breakfast and wireless too! Yep. Okay, so I would likely choose a room in one of the other houses because the sounds from the lobby, the breakfast dishes moving about, and the freshly brewed coffee smells wafting up under the older door were the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. We are visiting Detroit for business, yet I would surely choose to stay here if we were to visit again, and I'd love to try out another room. I'm sure it would bring that fifth star! As I understand it they are all decorated a bit differently in each of the houses. The Inn actually owns all of the old houses on this block. Room service comes from Union Street restaurant. We ordered out twice, and everything we tried was very good, with reasonable prices. Hot food was here in less than 30 minutes. The breakfast has been the same every day, yet it's pretty good: make-your-own-waffles; fresh blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, pineapple, cantaloupe, AND watermelon (all delicious and nicely ripe); scrambled eggs with toppings; yogurt selection; apple, cranberry, and orange juice; breakfast bars, and...they serve fresh coffee with pastries all day long. PLUS, they sell other snacks, wine and beer too. I may not have even covered all of the options!I love this place. I stayed her the night before and the night of my wedding. The location is great  - right off Woodward in Midtown. They have a shuttle that will run you anywhere within 5 miles, and a free parking lot behind the main building. There are several buildings - I stayed in the main one which is where reception is and where the daily breakfast is served. The staff was so helpful and nice throughout my stay. They gave me a great room - a huge and super comfortable king bed, jacuzzi tub, and sitting room, for about $150 a night. They also let us use the other buildings for our pictures. The ground are impeccable, the houses are furnished with beautiful antiques and great woodworking, and I love the history there. The breakfast was wonderful - coffee, juice, eggs, pastries, and a make your own waffle station. They also have a hospitality cart in the evenings stocked with water, soda, beer and wine. Just tell the receptionist what you had and they will charge it to your room. They also have a space for private events.My husband and I live in Ann Arbor and stayed at the Inn on Ferry Street on our wedding night almost five years ago---you don't get much more pro-detroit than that!  This place....talk about gorgeous!  Beautifully restored houses with perfectly complimenting and comfortable furniture.  They also had a nice spread for breakfast.  This isn't just someplace to lay your head, it's a place to hide out all day in!I always recommend this B&amp;B to my friends. BEAUTIFUL Victorian homes turned into very personable and charming guest rooms. Just a block north of the DIA, the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Staff is very hospitable, and the shuttle service within 5 miles is complimentary. If you are looking for alternatives to downtown hotels, this is the place to stay!Best place to stay in mid-town Detroit.Even though the facility and staff (not including the front desk staff) were incredibly friendly and helpful, there was a major issue with the beds. Me and my boyfriend slept on a hide a bed in one of the suites, it was incredibly uncomfortable. It felt like were sleeping on springs literally covered in a sheet. For the price we had to pay for the room this situation was unacceptable. He ended up sleeping on the floor the first night and I slept on the couch. We asked the front desk if they could get us another bed or room, the only thing they could do was give us a role away, which they ended up charging us for. The front desk people were very rude and did not seem to care about our needs.Absolutely beautiful! That's the way I feel about the Inn on Ferry Street. This is what true Detroit architecture represents. I have stayed here over night just to change up the scene and have attended events here such as wedding and bridal showers. The staff is extremely helpful and the rooms, hands down, are the best in Detroit. The have managed to turn Victorian style homes into personable rooms without tampering with the character and true details of these homes. Breakfast is delicious too! I recommend this cute little bed and breakfast for those who want to simply relax and get away or those who may have out of town guest who want to stay in the Downtown area.",,,"['inn', 'ferry',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/detroit-marriott-southfield-southfield,Detroit Marriott Southfield,3.0,$$,41,"Attended the Marriott for an all-day meeting which included breakfast and lunch served by Marriott. Upon arrival the front desk staff politely guided me to my location with big smiles on their faces. When a front desk is as energetic and polite as this front desk staff you know you're in the right place, a clear reflection of the leadership that is kept at the management level of the business. The lobby was extremely clean and newly remodeled with a very nice modern layout. The room was well ventilated allowing all the guests to feel very comfortable focused on the lecture.The breakfast was great, and had just about every baked good any guest could possibly ask for, along with coffee and tea to compliment the meal. When lunch came around the same quality and professionalism was offered, chicken breast and salmon paired with a healthy spinach salad your choice of dressing. Great experience, would imagine staying the night would be nothing less than exceptional.Very bad experience. I stayed 2 nights there, the second because of bad weather so I had ended up staying in 2 different roomsBoth rooms smelled bad. It smelled like nothing was clean in there. The furniture was old and looked like they took the scraps from other Marriott's and dumped it here. There was also a large tree that kept clanging against my window my second night and prevented me from sleeping.The last morning I was there I called to get a later checkout but the girl at the front desk wasnt going to let me ask easily. She first said she thought I left already. Then when I asked if I could defer it until 2 she got mad and said the latest she could do was 12:30 or they would start charging me extra. This was all done with an attitude from her.I then decided to try the room service for breakfast the same morning and that was another bad experience. The phone range about 15 times until a lady finally picked up. She had an attitude right from the start. I told her which breakfast I wanted but each breakfast meal choice had various options. For instance you could choose white toast, wheat toast or a muffin as one part. Then you had a choice of different juices, also different fruits and different cereal choices. When I told her I wanted the ""good start breakfast"" she just said ""ok anything else"". I said well I'd like corn flakes for my cereal. She responded "" ok anything else"". Theres 3 more things she needs to ask me before I can place this order but she was too short on the phone to get to it. I felt like I was apologizing while I was placing my order to her. Never experienced a food order like that let alone room service at a Marriott.The lone bright spot was the dinner options were very good and the bartender was nice and had good customer service skills. The lady that checked me in was also friendlyI will be traveling for work to this area one day every other week for at least the next 3 years. I will never stay here again, but I may sneak over from the courtyard for dinner and then go back to the courtyard and sleep in a clean room where the service is nicerI am a little torn about this Marriott. This is the closest one to my office, and is much better than the neighboring Courtyard. The Marriott has gone through a nice renovation of the lobby, restaurant and bar areas. However, the guest rooms have and haven't (in progress). I think I was in a renovated room. However, it was rather dark even with all of the lights on. The bathroom is a tad on the small side.Getting in late, I didn't want to eat in the dining room (just wanted a quick bite). I ordered room service and got the standard Marriott burger. It was good! The service was quick.The concierge lounge is on the 6th floor. Breakfast is the standard Marriott fare but I feel that the scrambled eggs were the kind that are served at Fairfield Inns (made from a powder bs egg liquid). The lounge is small as well.I would stay here again but I hope the rooms get brightened up.Brand new renovation. But you can still only polish a turd so much. I travel 10 nights a month and this place is just bad. The furniture is so stained I wouldn't let my cat sleep on it. Bring slippers or you'll have to lay towels on floor to walk around it the room. It's just disgusting. I'll post some picturesFirst time staying here and will not be back. This Marriott is nasty. Very dirty not clean at all. I understand they are going through a renovation but not in the rooms and they were just not clean. Stains on the floor and all over the comforter I have attached a picture of the stained bed. The staff was friendly but only goes so far if the room is a mess. The bar and restaurant is not bad the usual Marriott food. Marriott this place needs to be cleaned up bad!Best customer service and hospitality. The people working there were genuinely hospitable and willing to make the accommodations more enjoyable. From room service to repair men, they had the nicest staff.The staff is second to none, concierge lounge is amazing, beds are very comfortable. My complaints are that the internet did not work (would come on for a few minutes then go away). I had to speak with tech support twice--the first one was able to make it function for a bit then it went away. The second one told me that I must be wrong and that it was definitely working. It very much was not  The second complaint was the ac did not function well. It was set to 66 but we sweated all night long :( I called front desk at 9am and they said engineering would be right up. When I left at 11:30, they had not arrived. The front desk offered a partial refund of our points, but for a Plat Elite member, I'm not crazy about that compensation.I couldn't believe how comfortable the bed was! SO COMFORTABLE! 5 stars for the bed!Friendly staff. My only request would be a complimentary breakfast in the morning. I would stay here again!It seems the longer you stay the worse the service is.  I may have written that last review to hasty.  During my second week there there were several days my room was not cleaned.  It wasn't a huge deal, I wasn't soiling the sheets or anything.  It just wasn't very professional.  The service at the restaurant went down hill as well.  It became very slow with mix ups on orders and even burnt food.I stay here a few times a year because my work's corporate office is in Southfield. I have to say this is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in large part because of the staff. The restaurant staff remembers my name every time I come back to town and what I drink and that I like a to go coffee! That's pretty outstanding! Love this hotel!I was here 21 days, and therefore feel I really got to know the staff and hotel. The ""new lobby"" concept means that whenever the Bistro cafe is busier than reception the reception staff help out in the cafe. This is a great example of the teamwork concept. And it works very well most of the time. Only once did a receptionist turn-up her nose at helping the guests have wonderful stay, (she would Not get a highchair for a family group, because that was a resturant staff task) But the housekeeping staffer who had been standing next to her did go get the chair. When asked the housekeeper explained the non-team-player was having a Bad Day. Otherwise the whole staff are trying their best to make your stay effortless and wonderful. Three wants: 1. more frequent restocking of the food supplies, they ran out of my favorites at least twice. 2. More dessert/ice cream options that Do Not contain Chocolate.  And 3. Need to stock an Non-alcoholic beer. Other than that the food in the Bistro was good, in particular the Slab of ribs are huge, tender and tasty. They also have a nice selection of Healthy options. And the roll-in shower in our room was very nice and easy to use.I'm only a Marriott Rewards Gold level member, but Shannon gave me a giant suite upgrade for my 5 day work week stay. This place is awesome.Staff was friendly and tried to provide great service but they were busy with what appeared to be a large family reunion. We checked in around 3:30 and they had very few rooms clean. I settled for a first floor room that had a musty odor and a couple black flies. We ate the bar. Ok beer selection (1 local option) and the Ruben was good. More black flies at the bar.This hotel should be ashamed to be called a Marriott. It is old, outdated and most of the staff you have contact with could care less. Elevators are so slow you may as well use the stairs. Programs at the hotel are poorly run and wifi constantly disconnects. Do yourself a favor and stay at a better hotel. I am an elite member and stay exclusively at Marriott.I have very little complaints about this hotel. Checking in took awhile, because of a crazy woman demanding things holding up everyone else, so I won't blame that on the hotel. As far as the room, it was clean &amp; small, but I wasn't planning on spending much time there anyways. I'm not sure about the other reviewers, but I did have free coffee and free wifi access, I just had to call to the front desk to get the log on info. I was given a handicap room so my bathroom was a little more spacious than others seem to be describing, and it was a little hard to find the towels (they were at the top of a closet but I'm short &amp; couldn't see them -_-). The bed itself was comfy, but the pillows were a little too soft for my liking. The AC worked great, didn't try that TV so I'm not sure about the selection there. Checking out was a breeze, the manager took our key cards and wished us on our way. I would stay at this hotel again, just bring your own pillows!Only reviewing their restaurant. Overpriced drinks and mediocre food. Also the service is not the best...MustyThe bed was comfy.. The room service is decent whenever they do finally pick up to take your order. The ice machine doesn't work. I will stay again but they def need an upgrade and a few repairsI use Marriott for work all of the time throughout the U.S., with that said, I had a few issues at this one. Let me also note, I am a low maintenance guy. When I arrived the staff was sterile and felt like they were going through the motion (pre-canned welcome). When I attempted to get the company rate I got some mumbo-jumbo about how many rooms are set aside for company rates. I decided to let it pass and fight it on another day. Upon staying there it turns out breakfast was a seperate charge which was different than what I was originally told. On night ""2"" of my stay the fire alarm went off at 3 am. While we waited for the unresponsive fire department to show up, the staff appeared to have no interest in communicating any information to the guests. The upside is the room was clean and modern. On checkout I asked about the room rate on my bill, same ""mumbo-jumbo"" again, asked to review it with the GM who in turn adjusted the bill accordingly. For that I give the hotel a ""3"" star review.The hotel was great, and I stayed here for about a week.Room service and customer service was really hit or miss.Front desk said the first night that I couldn't claim credit for my stay,  but I got credit after following up.Room service was weird.  They kept on changing my towels despite me electing to be green.  Also, they would never refill my toiletries and water everyday.  One of those days, I got a water bottle that was not sealed...=/","Been sitting at the lobby bar for 15 minutes and nobody has come around.....  Also, water pressure sucks in the shower coupled with the shower head not being adjustable to accommodate me (I'm 6-1).Great business hotel. The room is pretty big. They have a table you can use, they have decent internet connection and its pretty good for business travel. They provide a nice TV with almost all the channels you would usually want.They have a fitness center, swimming pool and a Jacuzzi.The property is at a very nice location right by the highway, making it easy for you to get to places. The service is amazing and everybody at the reception are very professional the way the handle things.Like going on a blind date: you never know what you might get. In my case it was a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a>. deal to the Marriott for a ""stay-cation"" aka I need to get away without the heavy bills. Happy surprises: Customer service was AMAZING! I was kind of shocked that everyone was so pleasant. They are rated as a 3 1/2 star hotel and I would give them 5 starts for customer service. Check in took less than 3 minutes and I was addressed professionally. The room was spotless and the bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of bed the next morning. The not so good:( TOO MANY UNSUPERVISED KIDS!!!! I could have sworn I was on a school field trip with the number of kids roaming the halls &amp; taking over the swimming pool and hot tub. It was well after 9pm when we went to the pool and we walked in and I wanted to turn around. I didn't think that on a Saturday night I was find kids doing laps and backstroking across the pool. It's not even that big to start with. Besides that the water was a bit ummm murky. I really wanted to get in the hot tub (jacuzzi if you call it that) but there was an couple engaging in heavy PDA (should have taken that to the room. Lol) &amp; a group of teenagers ready to hop in to get warm since the entire place was frigid as heck. We couldn't leave yet because: THERE WERE NO TOWELS!!! After going out in the lobby in a 2 piece soaking wet &amp; cold we finally got some towels. The 24 hour fitness room actually closes at 11pm on the weekends (yes, that struck me as strange, since most people go to hotels on the weekend). Overall this was okay for the price we paid, but rack rates are roughly $75. I didn't go to the bar as it closed at 11pm and we didn't visit the restaurant that is there. *If you go and really need a drink or a late meal there is a TGIFridays on 11 Mile/Evergreen that closes at 2am (kitchen closes at 12 or 1am)*The hotel is beginning a much needed renovation.  My room smelled so bad, I had to be moved.  The pool is under construction, half the lights are hanging out of the ceiling in the workout room, and they lost one of my shirts being laundered.  I would avoid this property......don't plan on actually getting in the pool, it was disgusting. it looked like someones filthy bath water. The room? PERFECT...decor, the bed was a dream, quiet, clean and great location. Again, the pool was the ONLY letdown. I booked hotel mainly because it boasted its pool and my children love to swim...they were so disgusted, as well as everyone else that entered the pool area with the hopes of swimming. I'm laying here in this very comfy bed quite stunned at the conditions of such a great amenity!! Clean your pool, keep the rest as it is!When it comes to travel, I prefer paying as little as possible for a many-starred hotel. Call me a cheapskate or just frugal. I don't see the point in throwing down two hundred dollars on where I rest my head when that could go into attractions, restaurants, or buying some splendiferous knick-knack my loved ones will be appalled by later. On the other hand, staying in a cockroach nest has never been my style and I left the days of EconoInn and Motel Cheap behind me aeons ago. Fortunately that's where Priceline and Hotwire come in.Southfield Marriott shows up in the Priceline list and I managed to snag three days in this hotel last year before I moved to the D for a phenomenal price. I rolled up into the parking garage, eyes gritty from the road trip from Chicago and feet aching from the constant brake-accelerate pattern of people dodging all the M-39 closures wanting nothing more than a place to sleep. O sweet Marriott, how fondly do I recall you. This place is ranked 3.5 stars, but it definitely has a finer finish than that. The slick surfaces and tidy clientele made me feel quite awkward, and I must have mumbled my way into a higher floor room down a quiet corridor. Maybe the staff took pity on me, or perhaps that is where I was assigned. Nonetheless, I was not in the least disappointed. The room was beautiful and the king-sized bed sang Lorelei's song to my weary ears, absorbing my body weight as I collapsed face-first into the softest mattress ever. Almost ever.Now I'm a princess when it comes to beds, and the slightest twinge, pea, rock, or nodule keeps me tossing and turning all night long. This super soft mattress and wonderfully snuggly blanket were enough to make me crow the praises of the Marriott all day and night. Staff ran up extra pillows for me in the flash of an eye (yay!) and I had little trouble organizing my things in preparation for a conference. Everything was clean and tidy, and amenities can be supplied for free if you forgot a razor, shoe polishing cloth, and the rest. I didn't make use of the fitness room despite my best efforts or the pool, given it was a little better than the dead of winter. While other residents may have been enjoying themselves, I heard nary a sound or peep. The restaurant was far too expensive to bother with and I grabbed breakfasts at Tim Horton's down the street, navigating my way into my conference. Free parking, easy access, and a great big TV are all great features that you could definitely appreciate. All in all, though, the hotel was well worth the money and I enjoyed my stay. I just wouldn't pay market rate to stay there.The front desk staff is awesome. I can't say the same for the management. I had a rowdy room next door and called to have it taken care of. I peered through the peep hole and did see management walk by, but they didn't even stop to tell the neighbors to be respectful and quiet down.The AC units are too loud. The bed was comfortable, but you need all three pillows to get a decent night's sleep.I'm pretty sure house keeping merely rinsed a glass I used and turned it back over once dry. I could see the wine residue still left over and where my lips had touched the night before.Didn't get to try the food but I heard it was good.Paper thin walls.The elevators were ungodly slow, not that this really factors in to the rating. Budget hotels are better than this.Luckily I was here on business and won't have to return anytime soon. I wish it was a better experience since I stay almost exclusively at Marriott.Disappointing for a Marriott. The lobby is great, but the room really felt unclean. First, when we got there, they said that our room wasn't clean yet (we got there at 6:30 pm). When I said we needed the room immediately, they said there was a carpet stain that they needed to clean. The front desk person asked one of the staff if he had cleaned it yet and the staff member said he hadn't gotten around to it. If he hadn't gotten around to cleaning such an obvious (and large stain), I don't want to know what hard to see things they never get around to cleaning. The room was large and had the typical Marriott amenities, although the bathroom was very small. Most of the staff was nice, but  I'd rather go somewhere else next time.I stayed here two nights &amp; wish I could stay twenty more. The beds are so comfortable 5 star level. The pool is the best! Indoor heated and big enough to get a workout. There is also a jacuzzi, that and the pool are both kept at very high standards by a seriously professional pool guy who checks the condition 2x a day! seriously! I learned that the pool holds Fourteen thousand gallons of water, yes we chatted.I also chatted with Jonathon the concierge who was at my beck and call, Barbara who works at the front desk who was such a peach, Dorthy the pool lady who noticed I had not drank any water for quite awhile and brought me a bottle! :) And Jay the bartender who makes killer shots!I love this hotel and I felt so comfortable and welcomed! I will be going out of my way to return here.Oh and nice homemade veggie burgers.I was very impressed with the friendliness of the staff at this Marriott.  Every time I passed the front desk I was greeted with a huge smile and a ""hello""... great way to win me over.  As a frequent hotel visitor, I really appreciate the hospitality.The hotel was also very well kept.  The grounds were groomed and the room was thoroughly cleaned each day.  I would definitely return.I cannot say enough about how friendly the staff is. The rooms are clean but you can tell it's a older hotel taken over by Marriott.Stayed here for a business trip.  The price is quite affordable for Marriott.  The rooms are similar to Courtyard Marriott's, I've seen better but not a biggie.  Staff here is super friendly. Even when I checked in at midnight, they staff was so nice and helpful.  Even the restaurant staff was great in the morning.I did have breakfast here but it was meh.  If you have car, go somewhere else to eat.  Overall a nice place to stay.Stayed at the hotel for 11 nights wile I was doing some business in Detroit area. I got the room with good discounts. It is a nice fitness and pool area. The breakfast is good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi is working perfect. If I came back I would definitely book this hotel again.One of my go-to hotels when I go to visit Detroit (which is often, since my S.O. lives here...the other is the Westin in Southfield). It's a nice hotel, no frills or anything. Parking is free, and the beds are WONDERFUL. One visit, we spend 2 nights in Chicago in a 4-star hotel and didn't sleep comfortably one night. The next night we came here, and it was like sleeping on a cloud! And not just because the previous nights at the other hotel were horrible, the beds are just really nice. lolOne thing though, it seems like this place is a hot spot on the weekends at night....there always seems to be a lot of people hanging around here. Never any problems or anything--we're just always so amused that it seems to liven up (particularly in the parking lot) on the weekends.Hotel's in a pretty accessible location--lots of food around and stuff. Breakfast is nice, but not always free. Nice stay here.MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT &amp; I WILL NEVER GO BACK!I decided to surprise my fiancee with a 2 night stay since I hadn't seen him for 2 months and he was in town for a few days.  The reviews on this hotel were pretty good and at such a reasonable price, I booked it.  We got to our room which seemed pretty clean. Got settled in and the TV WAS MESSED UP - not the best reception, fuzzy picture, channels not coming in so we could only watch a certain number of channels.  The room was pretty warm and we went to put the AC on only to find out IT DIDN'T WORK! We called the front desk and Elshon (sp) was really nice and was able to move us to another room.  He even gave us some complimentary cards for either a free movie, free drink, or free breakfast.  We got up and left the next morning around 10am and as were leaving, I noticed 2 glasses on the floor in front of the room across from us.  9+ hours later we come back and I noticed those same 2 glasses still on the floor in front of the door - immediately I thought, I bet our room never got cleaned.  We walk in, and NOTHING was cleaned! Housekeeping never came, bed was still a mess, no new towels or anything.  We were completely dumbfounded! My fiancee called the front desk and explained to them that we were upset that our room was never cleaned. We said we'd come downstairs so that housekeeping could come upstairs.  We got to the lobby and told Crystal at the front desk we wanted housekeeping to quickly clean our room while we sat at the bar for a half hour but didn't want to waste any more time since they had 9 hours to do it.  She called on the walkie and we went to go sit down. 35 minutes later, we go back upstairs and NOTHING WAS CLEANED!!! Now we were just completely livid!  We call the front desk again demanding housekeeping and a manager come up.  10 minutes later housekeeping finally shows up - no manager.  My fiancee demands a manager come up so she calls on the walkie for management.  Apparently the housekeeper said the AM housekeeper checked off that our room was cleaned and that's why no one went to check on it.  BUT at this point, that's completely irrelevant and doesn't matter because for the half hour we were gone, how come our room still wasn't cleaned!?!?!?  The manager comes up and my fiancee goes off on how horrible our experience has been from day 1 - she has little to say.  My fiancee just tells her we're leaving and will never come back to the hotel and expect compensation.  Down to the front desk we go and talk to Crystal and she calls in for another supervisor to handle our situation. We tell Sharon what has happened during the duration of our stay and she's pretty disgusted with the lack of customer service and the quality of work ethic, or again lack thereof.  Sharon is completely helpful and offers our money back, however, it completely ruined our experience of Marriott hotels.  My fiancee was only in for a few days and we lost 2 hours of time we could have spent together.  It was a horrible experience and says a A LOT about this Southfield location and its staff.Corporate traveler meet your swanky accommodations! Nice hotel with modern amenities and some of the most polite staff I have ever encountered. The room was spic and span. If you're looking to rub elbows with other corporate transients, the bar was humming with laughs and beer flowing from the tap. Nothing too rowdy - mind you - this is the corporate crowd. The breakfast was a pretty good spread of the usual and the staff in the breakfast bar were friendlier than a Waffle House waitress. My only complaint would be the restaurant for dinner. The California burger was greasy and flavorless. Definitely would recommend staying again.Nice enough.Checked in on Sunday, 09/18/2011, and I will be here till Saturday on a business trip.I was greeted by the front desk as soon as I walked into the hotel. The staff was very friendly and nice. I was checked in within 3 minutes. The room could be bigger but it was nice.The bed was comfortable.I am very happy with this hotel so far, I will be here for another 5 nights. If I have anything new I will update this review.The facility is a bit dated but the staff is so helpful and has such a great attitude it made the staff terrific.  I'd definitely stay there again.Honestly i think the hotel deserve more stars than 3. But the heating system is worth less than 1 so that evens it out. The hotel is nice, the concierge food very standard, the bar is welcoming and the employees are all very friendly. THE HEAT SYSTEM IS FREAKING LOUD. There i said it. Freeze and sleep or be warm and get awaken every 15 min.","Staying at hotel for business for 2 nights.  Greeted by friendly front desk staff and was off to my room.  Room is your typical Courtyard Marriott and no frills, but clean and a big flat screen TV.  Front desk called me about 30 min after I got to my room to make sure all was well and I asked them if there was a refrigerator (there is not) and they were kind enough to offer to bring one.  So far, so good.",,,"['attended', 'day', 'meeting', 'included', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'served', 'upon', 'arrival', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'politely', 'guided', 'location', 'big', 'smiles', 'faces',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/atheneum-suite-hotel-detroit,Atheneum Suite Hotel,3.5,$$,77,"I love this hotel. I try to talk my husband into a night here each time we're in Detroit. Its a great location in Greektown, we can walk to everything, but I don't have to deal with the casino or smokers. Although, if you want to save money on parking, you can park at the casino for free and just cut through the casino to the hotel.The rooms here are huge and I love the layout, especially with the sunken bedroom. Its not the fanciest place we've stayed for the money, but for some reason I just love it there.The only downside to our stay there this weekend was our room was literally between the elevator shafts. It wasn't too bad until about 8am when people started being very active. Most of the noise could only be heard from our bedroom, but the constant elevator dings rang nice &amp; loud all the way to our bed. As did a lot of conversations of people waiting for the elevators. I didn't realize when we checked in that it would be so loud in the morning, so I didn't ask to be moved, but definitely will if it happens again in the future. Given we stayed in the most expensive king suite option, it was disappointing to deal with the noise when I wanted to sleep in after a late night on the town!Stayed here for the weekend, in town for the Raiders game. The hotel is walking distance from everything you'd ever need. The rooms are so big and spacious, loved them. Not much lighting in the rooms, kind of annoying at night. Also, some of the floors, especially by the stairs, are so thin that you feel like you're going to fall right through them. You also hear everyone else going up and down the stairs in their own rooms. If you can get past the constant ""boom boom boom boom"", you'll be ok. Parking is hard to find but they comped our parking which turned out to be great. If I ever go back to Detroit (doubt it), would definitely be staying here again.I stood at this hotel for a a few short days. I was in Detroit on business. It's a good location because you're right in Greek town. There's a casino, a few restaurants and bars. The folks that work at the Atheneum were very nice. The room was okay but the bed was very uncomfortable for me. It was a bit too firm and I had a hard time sleeping my first night there. Not sure what else is available in Detroit as far as hotels but someone told me that is the go-to hotel for celebs and business folks from out of town.We stayed here for Valentine's day, and overall it was disappointing.  For the price I expected better.We got here about 4:00 PM and were told our room wasn't ready yet, despite check-in being at 3:00.  To their credit, the front desk staff was apologetic about it and gave us a couple of coupons for a free drink at Fishbones.  We sat down and had a drink and our room was finally ready about 5:00.The room was pretty large, and it was nicely furnished.  It wasn't all that well maintained though.  There was a huge crack in the ceiling above our bed, and the floor tiles in the bathroom were cracked and dirty.  The tub/shower was cheap plastic that creaked when you stepped into it.The view was pretty bad.  We were on the second floor, looking across the dirty street at a titty bar.  The worst part of the stay was that the walls are paper thin.  We could hear literally everything happening within about a 100 yard radius.  We could hear the music from inside the titty bar.  We could hear people slamming their doors and shouting down in the lobby.  And we could hear loud R&amp;B music and very enthusiastic outcries from a woman in the room next to ours.  My sleep is less interrupted than this at home with a baby.  I've stayed in a number of other hotels in downtown Detroit, and none of them had the same problem.I stayed here on Valentine's Day, pardon the overpricing that occurs on this day, but it was an overall great experience. We pulled in and valet took care of the car for us instead of us heading to the parking lot ourselves, plus it was cold as balls outside, which made the $25 valet fee even more enticing. The suite was spacious and pretty great. The bed was super comfortable with big fluffy pillows and awesome bedding. 2 flat screen TV's, a sunken-in tub, mini fridge, and a separate living area completed this scenario. The only issue we had with the room was the couple of steps that led down to the bedroom. My boyfriend tripped down them in the middle of the night forgetting that there were steps there and pretty much took down a lamp with him during the fall. I will add that there is a tiny speck of light shining on them to alert you, but alas. Fishbone's is connected to the hotel so we didn't have to venture outside to find somewhere to eat and the Greektown Casino was directly across the street so 2 skips and a hop and we were hanging out in there the rest of the night. I would definitely come back here again for a special occasion.It was my first time in Detroit and I didn't know much about the city. I had to stay for two days after attending a meeting and I wanted to take advantage of the trip so I could see what the city had to offer.  Their guest service person was on point and she gave me great recommendations. We took a long walk on the River Walk which is a great place to to run by the water. We went for lunch to the Fountain Bistro which is located two blocks from the hotel in a very nice park with beach chairs and a water fountain.  We also visited Pegasus and Santorini which are around the block from the hotel and they offered amazing seafood options for very reasonable prices. Overall. The rooms are very spacious and up to date with al amenities. Nice TVs, clean bathrooms, big windows with lovely views and a good room service menu with plenty of options. They also offer a shuttle to the airport and transportation for big groups. Overall ot was a here at experience and I can't wait to go back to Detroit so I can visit the museums next timeThe only positive about this hotel is the location. Other than that, my stay was subpar at best. There was a constant smell of drugs throughout the hotel, which when notified to hotel staff, they seemed put out. Also, there was a huge fight on one of the floors at around 1am on one of the nights. Cops were called and people were arrested. After calling down twice to the front desk thinking people were going to come crashing through my door, the response I received was ""it's being taken care of."" Word of advice, if you stay here, pack your flak jacket.I just stayed here over the weekend because a friend and I were going to a show just around the block. We came in from Chicago, six hours on a Greyhound bus, and when I arrived, I was told by a man working the front desk that my room wasn't ready with it only being 1:30 (check in was at 3:00). I asked if I could be switched to another similar room, because that's what happens at other hotels, and I've never had an issue or been denied. However, here, I was told no, and to come back at 3:00, which I found absolutely awful after traveling for so long and having to wait outside in line for our show. When I came back at 3:30 to check in, I was helped out by a different employee working the front desk. I told her that I was checking in, and she asked me for my ID and a card to ""secure the deposit with."" I asked what the deposit was, because when I booked my room, nothing was said about a deposit. She explained that there was a required $50 deposit when booking a room in case something ends up damaged or missing. At this point, that was strike two, because, as you may know, most hotels only keep track of your card number in case something happens, and if it does, they THEN proceed to charge you. This left me with a weird feeling, especially being low on money and being states away.Strike three came when only AFTER my card info was taken, I was asked if there was anyone staying with me who was 21. Once again, this has never been a concern before, and I travel for shows frequently. I said there was, and I was told then that they needed to check in with me. So I had to call my friend who was saving our spots in the queue and ask her to walk over with ALL of her luggage just to check in with me. As for the hotel's features, it's pretty at the very least. The rooms are spacious and big. However, some of the room's furniture was disheveled. There were stains on one of the bed's comforters. A lampshade was bent and crooked, and I was left with the suspicion that they'd charge me for damaging it. Seriously. The free ""continental breakfast"" is this: a 'buffet' set up on the bar counter which is made up of a small fridge containing cartons of orange juice/milk and small bottles of water, a rack of pastries wrapped in plastic, and that's it. No hot food, no plain toast, even. Additionally, we came down to check out the breakfast in our socks, and got scolded for that. Seriously. Bottom line, wouldn't come back here again. Their competition looks much more promising.The rooms were clean and well appointed, bathrooms to die for!The decor was kitschy and very urban Greek chic.  What makes this place great was the staffs.  Everyone was so appreciative and well mannered.  THIS is how you run a hotel!Amazing location that was in the heart of greektown with a very short walk to the Tigers game.  Check in was prompt, and they even gave me a free room upgrade.  I was able to pay for my overnight valet upon checkin.  The room wasn't pristine clean and the whirlpool didn't have much power but those were my only cons.Currently at the Athenium and having such a miserable time I decided to write about it right now.The staff is friendly and the rooms are spacious. The tub is also a winning element. Besides that, I'm over it. When I first checked in they gave me a room on the 9th floor. I opened the door and to my surprise there were workers in there fixing a damaged ceiling. Awkward. And the staff offered no compensation for my troubles. The AC is miserable and can't decide if it wants to be hot or cold. If I want any sort of relief I need to sleep in the bed closest to the AC and dance with the sheets all night as it turns on and off and I go from freezing to sweating. Even though I'm on the 9th floor, the sound from the casino across the street is agonizing. Like I said, the only relief came from sleeping in the bed by the AC but that also happens to be the bed next to the window!.. I have an early flight and would really like to get some sleep... There's awful DJ music playing, continuous streams of sirens, people screaming, engines revving and I know it won't end for another few hours. Worst part is I can't even drown them out with the television because no channel will come in correctly and clean. Everything skips including audio, and the picture won't come in properly. I'm stuck awake checking emails because it's pointless to get dressed and move everything to a new room just to leave in a few hours (probably exhausted). You have no option but to valet your car and the woman at the front desk told me she'd give me a discount from $25 to $20 a night but from reading other reviews, they typically charge $20 a night anyway so... When I called the valet for my car it rang and rang until an operator picked up and told me they were too busy helping other customers and hung up on me. So I went down there to discover the valet team standing around talking to each other.The only reason for the two stars is the awesome tub and the room service- quick and yummy. Really not worth staying here and I'm disappointed my booking agent chose this place for my business trip. Now back to checking emails.ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!  We made our reservations, called in to ask questions and were yelled at by the women when asking if there were other rooms available for our friends or if the couch had a fold out for them. It was the strangest phone conversation ever because there was absolutely no reason for her to be so upset with us. We decided to cancel our reservation and have STILL not been able to cancel... I've called 6 times and they won't put me through to a real person to cancel!  I just keep getting sent to a voicemail with no return calls. I've even emailed. I'm calling my bank next to notify them so if/when they try to charge my card it won't go through. This is ridiculous. Don't book here!*** Atheneum Suite Hotel  ...  An Affair to Remember. ***When Atheneum originally opened about 20 years ago, I had to stay overnight bsince I heard so many great things about it: palatial, exposed brick walls, cement pillars, soaking tubs etc.  It was quite lovely.  I would have given Atheneum 5-stars then.Now last month I returned to stay here for a couple of nights.  It was like rekindling an old love - it may not be as glamorous as it was in the beginning but it remains just as lovely as ever.  A solid 4-stars since it is conveniently located near freeways, Greektown casino, bars, restaurants and it's affordably priced.  My king suite felt like an apt.  It was spacious and comfortable.  I will return and hopefully this love will withstand the test of time.*** Atheneum Suite Hotel  ...  An Affair to Remember. ***I have a soft spot for Detroit and hotels like the Atheneum is one of the reasons why.  For less than $150 you get a large, super clean sweet, with a comfy beds, luxury linens, a kick-ass bathroom and right out their back door you are in Detroit's little Greek Town!  What's not love?  Not to mention, they have free shuttle service with one of the nicest men I've ever met as the driver.  The people mover is also right outside your door and on-site is the restaurant Fishbones, a cajun inspired seafood restie that also serves breakfast and a Sunday brunch.  I'd skip this place and hit up Greek Town but it's nice to have a full-service restaurant on-site.  There is also a convenience store on site.  While in Detroit, I went for a walk outside of Greek Town and met a hooker with two missing teeth, wearing a purple bra outside of her tank top with her pimp and they asked me if I wanted to party!  How cool is that?!!!Great Room. The air conditioner broke, but they fixed it right away. The room was beautiful and the parking attendants were very helpful. All around great experience!Husband and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this hotel and have stayed here multiple times.  It is close to everything we like about downtown Detroit. Everything is in walking distance from the hotel, including 3 of our favorite restaurants (red smoke, fish ones, and Pappy's). We also love the local bars in the area (the Detroiter, Jacoby's, and old shililaigh). Everyone we have encountered within the hotel has been simply amazing. The only downside is that the walls are thin and you can hear a little bit of noise. However, add in a cocktail or two and you sleep like a baby!On the plus side, the rooms are large and unique: nice big soaking tub, decent beds, interesting floorplan. On the minus side the whole place feels dated and in my room the heating unit buzzed all night. That's the reason for the one star. I need to sleep! Staff was mixed: check-in front desk was nice, check-out less so.Breakfast starts at seven - most places that's 6:30.  Too late for me.  When it did open, it wasn't worth waiting for. Coffee ,prepackage rolls. milk, juice - that's it.This hotel is a diamond in the rough and the location is prime but there are a few things I would expect to be standard for a $200+ room. The staff at the hotel is very friendly however booking a room or talking to anyone on the phone is terrible. I called a few times to get some additional details (parking and such) and every time I spoke to someone they were completely ghetto and rude. I have never called a hotel and talked to someone that didn't possess the basic conversational etiquette that should be required to work the phones. Anyways, the hotel seems very nice from a distance but under the microscope the shortcuts begin to unfold. The room was dirty with some sort of sludge on the wall, holes in the ceiling, stains on the furniture, and the AC panel was falling off. Like I said, the place is nice for the most part but it is clear that the hotel needs some extra TLC with the details and the booking department.If I could give 0 stars I would. I never write bad reviews but I had to warn others. This establishment charged my card twice for a one night stay. When I called and asked them about fixing it, they said they wouldn't do anything for 10 business days. Meanwhile, I am out an extra $310 while I wait.  The bed had hairs all over the blanket and the bathroom floor was filthy. Skip this hotel and go to Greektown.We stayed at the Atheneum for a girls' night out. There is no way that I was about to spend over $300 for a very basic hotel room at one of the casino hotels, especially Greek Town Casino. I've seen their rooms. It was clean, but very standard and not worth the money. The Atheneum was a little more than 1/2 the price for more than twice the size. We had a Deluxe Suite with 2 queen beds. Checking in was super easy. Reservation staff was very helpful regarding all of our questions. The only thing I didn't like is that the old bellman lied to us &amp; pretty much everyone else. He told everyone that Lil' Wayne was staying at the hotel for extra tips. Of course, we believed him. (so dumb) Our room was very nice. It had a living room area with a pull-out couch, big flat screen TV, mini bar and small desk. There were about 3 steps down that led to the sleeping area. That was also fairly roomy. The view wasn't great, but we weren't expecting it. The bathroom was pretty standard with a jacuzzi tub. I think the beds were fine. It was quite a night, so I'm not really sure it mattered. I had no problem sleeping though. I love that they offer a free shuttle to any place within a 5 mile radius and they will pick you up. It takes about 15-20 minutes, and it was a very busy night with 2 concerts and a Lion's game. We took a little visit to the 10th floor and hung out in one of the bigger suites they offer. They are really nice! It had 2 bedrooms, a nice dining room area, big couch and a flat screen TV. It was pretty awesome! I would definitely stay here again!","Room was large and comfortable. Staff wasn't particularly friendly (except for one fantastic woman at the valet). They told me offered a free shuttle to the airport, but when we arrived at the terminal I was told I owed them $55. Awkward, embarrassing, and completely unacceptable. Breakfast buffet is a sad attempt. Satisfactory for a night or two, but wouldn't be my first choice.Excellent staff across the board, HUGE suites, large soaking tub, great room service (non greasy hashbrowns- always a plus!). Only ""complaint"" was the loudness of room 205. Could hear the people in the lobby below, the elevator ding, people on the street AND the people mover! But the dark curtains and king size bed with fresh smelling linens, cleanliness of the room, etc.- still impressed me. Greektown in general has come a long way since we left MI 8 years ago!Best rooms in the city hands down. Service is always great. Rooms are always clean. Room service from Fishbones is the best!I stay here quite often and will definitely be back!I really enjoyed my stay at the Atheneum.  The best part of this hotel is one of the bellman Andre - what a hospitable, friendly, caring employee and a great asset to the hotel.  My room was huge and very clean.  I do think the hotel could use a few upgrades but overall I have really enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back to this property if I was in the Detroit area.  There is a complimentary shuttle and free wi-fi which is also very convenient!Just want to say we had a great stay.  Beautiful hotel and the room was large spacious and looked brand new.  Mostly the staff was super friendly.  Corey and Captain Tony were kind enough to take us to Corktown and Indian Village.  What nice, fun and great ambassadors they are for the Atheneum and Detroit!Ive never wrote a bad review even though ive had bad experiences before...atheneum suites just took the cake.. called twice to get a room reserved and when we showed up we still didn't have a room held...thank god we still were able to get a room.. the BIGGEST problem is the thieves they employ that park your car..after I unpacked at home I noticed two pairs of new shoes id bought on the way to detroit missing out of the trunk..boxes still there but shoes gone. .you pay a bs parking fee just to get your stuff stolen. ..dont let these bloodsuckers steal your stuff too..We stayed here the night before an event and really enjoyed our stay.  The room was really spacious, the staff helpful and friendly, and the location couldn't be beat.  We valet parked our cars and they were returned to us upon check out right away.The hotel is in the Greektown neighborhood of Detroit, so there is really good food and entertainment right outside your door - but Fishbone's restaurant is in the same building as your hotel, so you don't even have to step outside to get a good meal.  There is a hotel bar also, but we didn't visit there.We travel a lot, and there are a couple things that could be improved upon to bump this to a five star for me.  The television was nice, but we couldn't get hi-def channels.  The pillows weren't great, although the bed was really comfortable.  There was no conditioner, just shampoo, lotion and body wash available.  And the in room blow dryer was really weak, even for a hotel one.  Except for the pillows, these are really just minor details.That said, the price was amazing - 139 a night for a great room in an outstanding location with really good service.  We'd definitely stay here again and would recommend it to out of town visitors.We arrived very late last night and received a warm welcome and great service from the hotel personnel. The doorman/security guy helped us find a place for our truck and trailer on the street. We ended up booking a junior suite (about $130+tax and $50 deposit) which included a mini bar area, HUGE bathroom (which was immaculate btw) King size bed in a sunken area a few steps down from the bathroom and a large desk/vanity area with a flat screen tv. We were impressed with the attention to detail like the lighted vanity mirror in the bathroom, and super soft throw blanket and nice quality sheets and down comforter on the bed. You can even get 24 hr room service here, though we didn't partake. Overall we had a great stay and would stay again!The staff was incredibly nice! The beds and pillows are terrible, you should bring your own pillow! The valet service was fantastic. We stayed on a Saturday night and the hotel had a package for the Lions game that included a voucher for 40 dollars off of your dinner and shuttle to the game for free! They will also hold your bags and car until return from the game! If the beds and pillows were nicer I would give five stars.The valet parking was on point and although the cost is $20/night, the convenience was worth the price for almost the same as you would pay anywhere in Downtown Detroit. I was greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff member who quickly checked me in and sent me up to my beautiful double suite. We had a great view of the Greektown casino and the room was clean and fresh. Very spacious and accommodating for our pre-concert needs. Greektown was right there and very convenient to hit up Pizza Papali's and The Old Shilelegh before heading to The Joe for the concert. The People Mover brought us right back to Greektown by our hotel and a great night was had by all.I stayed here for one night while in Detroit for a job interview. Overall the hotel is clean but rather dated. The rooms were definitely originally designed in the 1980's but have been updated since then. On arrival we valeted the car, which was very convenient. They will add the valet charge (approx $20/night) to the room fee when you check in. The check in was smooth and friendly. The room was quite large, but was an awkward design. Think of a very long rectangle with a front room, then bathroom, then the bedroom all lined in along a hallway. There were 2 flat screens but they did not provide a very good quality picture. The bed was large and comfortable. The room was clean and void of any weird smells (a big plus). There is free wifi with the room. Overall the room was pretty quiet, but when it was late there were definitely some revelers from the Greektown casino outside that woke us up. There is a ""complimentary breakfast"" which is one of the saddest I have ever witnessed. Literally only cereal and a few sad wrapped up muffins and pastries were laid out. We went to the hotel restaurant ""Fishbones"" for a decent meal. We couldn't find a waitress to seat us, so we almost walked out. The food was fine there and decently priced. Another big plus is the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service around detroit. We used it to go out to dinner. You call when you are ready to be picked up (took about 30mins to pick us back up from calling time). Very nice service for people who are not familiar with the area. Overall, if you're in Detroit (my apologies if that is the case) then this is a solid placed to spend the night.It's clear that this hotel really cares about it's customers. They are always extremely helpful and polite, from the front desk to the porter to the shuttle driver. Oh, and the free shuttle to anywhere within 5 miles is worth it in itself! It saves you from fighting with Detroit cabs who are drunk/trying to rip you off. Also, the rooms are large and clean and the housekeeping is unobtrusive. We forgot to lock our safe one day and even left valuables out on the desk without anything moving a centimeter. Good people!!I had the BEST customer service today! Faith took care of my reservation. The servers were down when I called and she made sure to return my call promptly to  complete the booking process.  She was extremely personable, professional, accomodating and truly put some sunshine in my day with her sweet spirit!  I already know the hotel and suites are beautiful, but having wonderful people taking care of you, is what truly puts The Atheneum over the top.  Highly recommend this place for a lovely experience.  :)Friendly staff and the room was nice, but dated. The little things are why I only gave it a three star. After a two hour drive all I wanted was a beer. I opened the mini fridge to get one and it only had Bud light. It was almost a year out of date. When I called to get a replacement they informed me that I only could get a warm beer. They couldn't get one from the bar. It took over a half hr to get it. They are nice big rooms with two TVs. But you cannot hook up a computer to them. So your only chose is to watch whatever is on. The picture quality was horrible. We placed our room service order the night before and it still was 49 minutes late. We asked for 9 and it arrived at 9:40. I wouldn't call that rush hr for breakfast.  The order was missing a side of bacon. I asked the girl to please bring it up and it never arrived. At check/out we wanted to make sure it was not in the bill, so the manager got the girl and she said she brought it up. My wife and I  let them know we didn't get it. She said she gave it to a women.  We explained we were the only two in the room and we didn't get it. It was a headache and something that ended our stay on a bad note. We will not be staying here again. We like consistence to much.Beautiful and NOISY roomI stayed here the night before the 2013 Free Press Marathon, hoping to get a nice relaxing night of sleep and avoid the hassles of early morning parking.Valet parking and check in were a piece of cake. Nice people at the front of the hotel and behind the desk.Beautiful deluxe suite. I believe it was room 411.We checked in and got all cozy in the awesome hot tub.knock knock knock( thought it was somebody rapping at the door) got up to check. Nobody there.knock knock knockgot up again. Nobody there.We finally figured out that about every few minutes the pipes would rattle. I don't know if it was every time a toilet was flushed on a floor above us or what caused it but every few minutes a rapping/knocking sound which sounds exactly like a loud knock at the door , would happen.Once we realized what it was, no problem. A minor annoyance but certainly not reason enough to request a new room,as I figured with the marathon going the place was probably fullPut on the tigers -red sox game and settled down for a quiet night.Then around 10-1030 I start to hear music. boom boom boom doons doons doons, etcI think its a car stereo down on lafayette. But it keeps on goingI then see this MASSIVE night club occupying a large section of the building across on Lafayette ( I don't know the name of the club, but the taco Loco mexican restaurant and the bouzouki topless joint are on the ground floor of this building)This shitty super loud house music was blasting into my room. ( along with screaming DJ's ) by now the tigers game is about over and it's midnight and I am just sort of accepting that I am going to get a crappy night of sleep before my race.IT WAS LOUD!I   frankly didn't want to go through the hassle of packing up all my stuff and trying to change rooms that late at night.I was sleepy the next morning but PR'd my race so I was happy. Thanks to perfect weather, but no thanks to this noisy room till at least 2 AM.This is a 4 star hotel and the noise is really out of their control ( though the windows were drafty. I am not sure if windows can be noise proofed to cut down on street and club noise but it would help ) but a 2 star experience if you get a room bordering lafayette ( double check the street, it's the one with the bouzouki lounge) If I wanted to party all night I might consider returning since the room was great BUT if I want to sleep I will probably just go to the Marriott Ren Cen and get a room on the 47th floor and enjoy the silence and the viewMake sure to try and get a room that does not border Lafayette Avenue!!I stayed here for 3 weeks in January, 2014 and the room was a great size--split between a decent sized living room space and bedroom space that was down a short flight of stairs. The staff was friendly and I would especially like to give a quick shout out to Curtis at the Bell Desk who shuttled me to work on multiple days. He was extremely friendly, had a lot of stories about the area and was generally extremely helpful. My stay was generally pretty good but he was great.The hotel isn't in bad shape and the rooms were nice, however, I was robbed while we were out at hockey game.  The security man says that he did an investigation and couldn't do anything about it.  Pretty pathetic that this could happen at a fairly nice place.  Wouldn't advise going there.The annual USMC Birthday Ball was held here this year, so we got to see the level of service for a big event, as well as regular service.Check-in (and valet parking) was quick and efficient, and when I asked if there were refrigerators in the rooms and was told no, but they could have one sent up...she was already dialing the phone to order one before I could stop her to say we didn't really need one. That's service.The rooms were really quite nice. Though I'm not sure exactly what level room we had (since it was an event deal, we got what we got for a certain price with no choice), there was a decent-sized living room with a couch (though very uncomfortable), a side chair, a coffee table, a flat panel TV, and the mini-bar in an entertainment console. Through the door, there was a tiny hallway with a mirrored closet on one side and the bathroom on the other. The bathroom was very decent sized, with a deep tub (though no jets) and a well-lit counter. Unfortunately, our toilet wouldn't flush, so we had to call the front desk. The maintenance guy was there within five minutes and had it fixed within another five (at most). Impressive. I wanted a snack before the events started, and the sushi sounded good (a bit expensive but not super crazy) but we only had an hour before we had to leave, so I called to first ask how long it would take, and asked if an hour was enough time. The guy laughed and said it would be less than half an hour. Cool. It was there in TEN MINUTES. Impressive. The sushi itself wasn't anything to write home about. *Note that gratuity is automatically added. I forgot to tell hubby, so when he signed for it, he tipped. EEK. So we had extra-expensive sushi on accident.I went to get ice and the one on our floor was out of order. I tried another floor and that one had no sign but wasn't working, so I stopped a housekeeper who was walking by to let her know, and by the time I walked away, I heard her calling it in. Impressive. So, what wasn't as impressive? 1) The steps down to get to the sleeping area. Cool idea, but overall I'd rather not have them. Both of us tripped on them at one time or another (and we hadn't even had a drink!). 2) The glass blocks as the bathroom wall. Again, cool idea, but another fail in my opinion--if you turn on either bathroom light in the middle of the night it lights up the entire sleeping area. 3) The A/C was crappy and loud. It was set to 65 when we walked in but it didn't feel like any 65 I know. We turned it down to 62 to try and get some cool air going....and came back to room after 3 hours...still not cool. I called the front desk and long story short they said their rooms don't get cool like that. Huh? Their solution was to shut the door between the two rooms to try and keep the cool air in the bedroom area. Not a great solution as far as I was concerned. Anyway, we like it cool to sleep so left it on...set at 65 and the damn thing was SO noisy that it woke me up every 10-15 minutes all night as it cycled on. In other words, a nightmare. 4) The walls are thin! I heard a bunch of marines coming down the hall at 3am and heard someone's cell phone alarm (in the neighboring room) at 5am. 5) The bed was mostly comfortable and the pillows were okay but neither was anything to write home about.Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night.As far as the convention/event aspect, everything was spot on. The bartenders were great and remembered your drink of choice (a feat, with 150 people in attendance), the servers were efficient and very nice, the food was actually tasty, and additional requests were handled well. Checkout and valet went smoothly, and when we were asked about our stay, I commented on the noisy A/C and saw her write a note about it. So, I'm divided on this review, and must use actual math. 1) Employees (very nice) *****2) Service (quick and efficient) *****3) Event ""stuff"" ****4) Hotel room **5) Room service sushi **18 stars / 5 categories is 3.5, rounded down to 3 because I only got maybe an hour of sleep the whole night.I booked this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fskyauction.com&amp;s=72d01d13c832c1f6da2636e832e60d55dc53ac11659ccc4a6b8d64cfb272c8ff"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">skyauction.com</a> for $270 for two nights (Friday/Saturday) and was happy with my purchase. I know, some of you will complain about the $20 a day charge for valet parking....come out to Seattle and that will double...quit whining...The hotel is located in Greektown...where the action is in Detroit as far as I could see. A short walk to Ford Field or CommericA Park or to the Transit Station to Windsor...all the places I needed to go.The rooms were HUGE, the staff was friendly and helpful. I got a late checkout on a Sunday....a big plus. I liked this hotel. A little more room than I needed, but when I return to Detroit, I will return here!Me and my friends have booked rooms in this all-suite hotel on several occasions. I have enjoyed a few downtown birthdays here as well. This is an awesome hotel. Very much in the heart of the lively Greektown neighborhood, so the casino and tons of restaurants are in walking range of here. There's even a mediocre and low-profile, low-mileage gentleman's club called Bouzouki's across the street. For the family friendly, don't let that deter you from this great hotel, because it's hard to see and only attracts legitimate patrons.This hotel's lobby is spacious, grand, and adorned with plenty of Greek paintings, statues, and architecture. It's not over the top, but it's enough to let a brother know he in Greektown. The suites are awesome! The most square footage for the buck in the D! It's an all-suite hotel, but let me warn you, when you get your room - inspect the size - because due to the floor layout, some rooms in the SAME tier still have less floor space than others!Rooms have 2 TVs, one in the bedroom area and one in the living room area. Bathrooms are huge. Rooms are up to date and clean. Plenty of space to move about! The fact that suites here can be had for discounted rates of well under $200 is great value. Suites at the boutique/antique Omni in the outskirts of downtown are more than twice this cost, and that for a worse location in my opinion.Staff is kind, there's a bar/grill on the main floor, and the hotel is connected to Detroit's popular Fishbone's restaurant! I hear that Fishbone's does the room service as well (which is nice because pricing off of the restaurant menu will be more economy friendly than via inflated in-house hotel dining). All in all, I have had great experiences here. They are also very kind to late checkouts at 1PM, which guys like me who party hard on Saturday nights can appreciate on a detox Sunday afternoon. My girlfriend once forgot her laptop and iPod in her room, and with some repeated calls and probing, was able to recover it from their vast lost and found (which looked like a garage sale of valuables). It was just nice to see that having left those valuables behind in a Detroit hotel did not equate to them being stolen. If you want a comfortable up to date suite, in a fresh up to date hotel, with awesome location in the best and safest part of downtown Detroit - all for sub-$200/night, this is definitely the hotel for you! In recent times, I have been booking $50 3-star rooms via Hotwire &amp; Priceline, but for a special occasion, and when I need more space for more guests, I will surely come back here!","I stayed at the Atheneum Suite Hotel for a family wedding, and paid $139.00 a night during my 3 day stay.The hotel is in an older building, but the interior is quite modern.The room was nice and clean, but was noisy due to being right next to the elevators as well as nearby slamming of neighboring room's doors.  The daytime temperature were in the high 90's, but my room was pleasingly cool, although I heard other's complain their rooms were warm.  I was also finding myself trying to find a working ice machine as the one on my floor, as well as others, were inoperative.  Once notified, the staff was quick to make the necessary repairs.I think the hotel's greatest asset is their employees as they were all cheerful and helpful.The free wifi was nice as was the available computer/printer in a room just off the lobby.The hotel is within walking distance to Ford Field as well Comerica Park, or you can just use the free shuttles of nearby bars.Despite the noted problems, I would stay here again if the price was right when compared to nearby competitors.My first visit was exceptional - stayed here on business in Detroit.  So I decided to return for another business trip.  Both stays were excellent.- Valet parking- Downtown-  Mr. Tony Tone the shuttle driver is off the hook - he will take you to anywhere form hotel door -- within five mile radius - I always go to ROAST restaurant and back - but that is me- The lobby bar is a beauty - and the bartender is top notch - I always have a Bombay Sapphire martini here- Room is spacious and cozy at the same time- Last two rooms on eight floor were church mouse quiet - at least in NovemberI inspected all bed sheets and linens - as I am a particular guy - all good.Booking another stay as we speak.My fiance and I stayed there last night for our fourth anniversary, and for the price we were not disappointed. They only have valet parking, so we parked at Greektown (free) and walked the two blocks over to the hotel. The staff was nice enough.Our suite was on the 9th floor on the east side of the building. Right above a club, it was sort of noisy until around 2 a.m., but what else do you expect being Downtown?There are many places to eat within walking distance, which is great because room service seemed a little pricey and they add 18% gratuity. The King size bed was spacious and so comfortable I almost didn't want to leave for dinner! Back to the hotel, I enjoyed a soak in their deep tub, then relaxed on the soft bed.Since our anniversary was on a Friday, this was less expensive than staying at the casinos, and well worth the money we did pay. This being our first time staying anywhere together, we may consider this again next year!What a terrrific little gem this place is in the middle of Greek Town in downtown Detroit.  The staff was friendly and very informative.  It took next to no time for them to get to know me by name and offer up suggestions for stuff to do in the area.  I was there for NAIAS week so they were able to steer me to things that wouldn't be so crowded.The free shuttle service within 5 miles of the hotel is an awesome perk., especially when one is without a car while staying there like I was.  That 5 miles will get you right to the Motown Museum and back in no time.  Very friendly driver.I was impressed with the rooms.  Nicely appointed and certainly a value for the money.  I liked the big screen TV, even though one of the remotes didn't work.  They are well insulated from noise from the outside.  The beds were among the best I've ever had in a hotel, no back ache in the morning is a good thing!I do have a few niggles about the place.  They were enough to keep me from giving it a 5 star rating.  The clock radio wouldn't set, but the friendly staff did do a prompt wake up call as I had requested.  The remote for the TV in the bedroom was barely functioning and one had to manually turn on/off the TV.  My biggest peeve is when in a boutique hotel as nice as this one, why do they insist on using single ply toilet paper?  The stuff is rough and falls apart during useage which is pure grossness.I wasn't on the side of the hotel facing the strip club so noise was not an issue for me.  I do have friends who were staying same time as I who did note that there was some noise they would hear from the club as well as drunks coming out of the casino at night.The Atheneum is our favorite hotel when we visit downtown Detroit to play at the Greektown Casino. We always book the Deluxe Suite - two-room suite with a parlor area and sleeping room with a king or two queen-size beds. Well-appointed rooms with contemporary furniture and design in earth tones. Beds are comfortable and bathrooms are spacious with a soaking tub. If there is one criticism I have for this hotel, it is the service at the Front Desk. Every time we check in, we do not get that welcome feeling from the staff (they seem in a rush to check you in they don't really engage in conversation)... always made me wonder. But, it is still a nice hotel and you can't beat the location!WARNING...One of my colleagues at work rented the Presidential suite the day before Thanksgiving 2012. Someone broke into their room WHILE THEY slept and robbed them.  You are putting your life and property at risk staying at this hotel.My husband and I stayed here last night and were underwhelmed. I'm a very detail orientated person and noticed a lot of little flaws. The walls in the hallways had water damage and/or cheap plaster and repair work. The caulking in the bathroom was done very poorly. The grout between the tiles was no existent in some places. The railings in the hallway on the 9th floor no less were wobbly. Our check-in seems to take forever. There was a crack in the glass door to our closet. There was a stain in the carpet... I could go on.A much more obvious blunder was the paper thin walls. We could hear garbage trucks outside at 6am and could hear hotel doors slamming shut and people talking in the halls all night.A few good notes: the shuttle service is free and fast (used it to go to dinner), the location is good and the valet service was efficient.Next time we decide to stay overnight downtown we'll be staying at the Greektown hotel or splurge at the Westin Book Cadillac. Also, I'm really shocked that this hotel is a four-diamond AAA rated hotel. I've stayed at true four-diamond hotels before and this hotel doesn't even compare to them.During my stay the wireless internet was down for over a day. Shady neighborhood. Rooms are spacious and clean, but could use some updating.I have had the pleasure of staying at a few hotels in Detroit... MotorCity Casino being a really good hotel, surrounded by a wasteland of pretty much everything. You are kind of stuck in the hotel/casino... the Atheneum was suggested to me by a coworker and I went. The one ting that stood out for me was the proximity of the BOUZOUKI strip club to the really contemporary hotel. Walking in you are greeted by two large scale Greek Gods on the walls.The rooms were really nice, they actually had stairs down to the bedroom. The one thing that bothered me though was the bathtub, it was huge, but stepping into the tub took a bit of effort. The half shower curtain from the 70's was cool.I gave it a 5 for the fact that I was not stuck in the hotel. I got to experience the only civilized area in Detroit, being Greektown. if the city of Detroit were more like this two and half block section of city. I may enjoy it more. Food was excellent in almost every place I went. The people did not look like they were going to rob me at every moment. There were sounds of laughter, talking, no gun fire, nobody screaming that they just got stabbed. It was nice.I will stay here again when I go back, hopefully not for another couple of years....3.5 stars rounded up.Stayed 4 nights.  I love the huge suites.  Not that I use a living room on business trips but I was thoroughly impressed.  The king sized bed was just how I like it, king sized :) with lots of layers of blankets and a thick comforter (down-like) not that weird polyester crap that you get at most joints.  The tub was also huge, didn't get the jets but always good to be able to take a bath here and there and stretch out.Friendly lady when we checked in at near 3am and speedy and kind valets.  But man, Detroit parking is still $20 a night?  That's comparable to other bigger cities, doesn't make sense to me since property value is so low, is this accounting for ""security""? Perhaps.... Bellhops are also friendly but I guess everyone is working for a tip, I handed out plenty of that.Really the sleep was the best part which is hard to come by on business trips.  The hotel is located in a great part of town, and on the weekend, it was even bustling.  They included breakfast, which was pretty subpar, so there is a half a point docked for that.  I would just rather not have it included at all than be disappointed.  All in all, a hotel I would have no reservations returning to, and one I could even recommend to others.Stayed here to attend the Green Bay/Detroit Thanksgiving Day game, and I couldn't find much that wasn't to my liking.  All of the staff members were exceedingly friendly and efficient, and the room was quite nice.  It's located in a prime location to some great attractions downtown. I did notice the music from the strip club late in the night, but it didn't bother me that much (I can sleep through most anything).Love the rooms and the location. 24hr room service, flat screen tv's, modern and clean. All must haves for me. Having a casino right there is cool but having to pay for drinks is re-dic. Prob my favorite hotel for Detroit.I've stayed in an Antheneum suite twice and enjoyed it. I like that the suites have a large bath tub. It's also in a great location in downtown Detroit thats just about walking distance from anything you'd wanna see or do downtown. Room service is provided by 3 different restaurants in the area. The price was great. I'd give the beds a B+ rating. However there is one issue with ALL the rooms there that makes staying at the Antheneum a pain. THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN! I've heard an entire conversation of the ppl staying next to me and they weren't yelling. Makes sleeping kinda hard.Here for business meeting, so not sure of the prices but I am sure we can find those online. The suite was expansive with a front room that included couch and tv. Large bathroom. Great location to many downtown activities and locations.I have stayed at their Jacuzzi Suite few times and I really like it here.  I do recommend this place for out of towners to stay because the location is awesome and it's probably one of the better Hotels in the heart of the city.My Suite had like an upper tier are for the Jacuzzi which is wide open in the room.  The Jacuzzi tub isn't the biggest but it's good enough.  The upper tier has a TV and couch also.  The lower tier is the Bed and it's own TV and both tier is open so it just feels like a one big room.  The room service is excellent and they give you free news paper in the morning.The prices are decent and the customer service is always fabulous.The location is the key for this Hotel.  It's connected to a great restaurant Fishbone's and you can walk to the Greektown Casino without going outside. (except to cross the street between two buidlings).  It's a block away from Greektown itself and few blocks away from Comerica Park and Ford Field to watch the Tigers or the Lions.  About 4 blocks away from Renaissance Center and Hart Plaza.If you're coming into town and need a place to stay, I would recommend Atheneum.  It's even good for a night for locals to enjoy Detroit without having to drive home late night.Love this hotel, $120 - shared a room with my friend, we had a blast, very spacious, comfy beds and large bathroom.  The previous occupant had filled most of the mini bar bottles with water, the manager came up and comped us some free vodka and wine - this was above and beyond - and went great with our oysters and shrimp while we worked.  Frankly we felt like rock stars the whole time we were there.  Great location in Greek Town near food and casino.Beautiful and comfortable rooms, but the walls are thin.  The people in the rooms next to us woke us up both nights of our stay.  We even heard the traffic and the people mover despite being on the 5th floor.  The location of the hotel was also very good.This was a great hotel! My cousin had her wedding here, so I stayed here for 2 nights, and it was wonderful! The suites are quite large, and very clean. Service was great and beds were very comfortable! The hall where the wedding was held was great! Big space and the service there was phenomenal! It's a beautiful hotel and rich in history! I loved my stay here, and I can't wait to come back whenever I need somewhere to stay in Detroit.Large rooms and comfortable bed are the major pros for this place. The other being its location in greektown and all the attractions that offers. A few things really annoyed me about this hotel. The Wifi is terrible! I wouldn't even call it highspeed. If you are planning on doing any web browsing beyond checking email prepare for a frustratingly slow experience. Actually impossible to watch any video such as a movie trailer.  Someone mentioned the A/C being terrible. I stayed in winter and noticed the heat was not great either. Had to turn it up to 80 to get some level of comfort. My wife and I both noticed the smell of smoke even though it is supposed to be a non-smoking room. They have a fascist mini-bar policy that apparently weighs anything you put in and take out so you can't actually use the fridge to keep your left over food cold. If you can get past all that you will have a comfortable place to stay with friendly staff in a nice neighborhood which is why I am giving it three stars.I have had better service at MOTEL 6....lol They were out of ICE all night (we got there at 5:00pm), housekeeping was closed also?? so no extra nothing!! The staff was unconcerned and a bit nasty acting. I will be staying at MOTOR CITY next time!! THIS PLACE SUCKS (we had the Penthouse $800) never again!!","All of the times I've stayed at the Atheneum, I've hoped for more. I think I'll have to look elsewhere after this time, because apparently some things don't change.This last stay, I booked a premium suite, thinking it would be nice to take a soak in a whirlpool tub after dinner. The total charge (before room service) was $228.85.... A price I didn't mind paying until I saw what I actually got. First of all, how is valet parking not included for this price?!?! $20 dollars a day? For a sometimes very slow experience?!? No thanks, I'll walk the two blocks for free parking, I think.The marble counter tops and border around the whirlpool tub we all discolored and water stained. Has this place not heard of a good sealant? The carpet was a bit bubbly and warped on the opposite side of the hot tub, making me think that perhaps someone got a bit overzealous with  the water levels, or that there had been a leak at some point. The wall paper was discolored and small peel-y spots could be seen throughout the room. The flat screen tv's look nice, but the reception on almost every channel was fuzzy and grainy. I tried adjusting the cords, thinking maybe something had come loose, but it was to no avail. The complimentary wi-fi was nice (and with what your paying, it SHOULD be complimentary) but slow, slow, slow. I opened the bedside table to find a pen and paper and found (what was clearly given away by the smell and residue) a ""Guest Survey"" form folded up with remnants of weed all over it. Once I opened that drawer and let the smell out, the whole room reeked for an hour.( I'm not against those that do indulge, btw. It's just not for me. And for housekeeping not to clean the room thoroughly at such a ""reputable"" hotel, that's just disappointing. )The bed was actually the worst part. It has to be the least comfortable bed I've slept in ever. I woke up feeling like the day after you've been in a car accident; stiff and sore. The walls also seem incredibly thin. All night long, I kept hearing laughing and talking from the room next to mine, along with any and all conversation from people going down the hall.The neighborhood isn't bad at all (It cracks me up when people say it is!) though, admittedly, there were some questionable-looking people hanging around out front. Room service was remarkably quick, though it's a bit pricey for what you're actually getting. Funnily enough, I ended up staying at the Embassy Suites off of 275 not terribly long after my last visit to the Atheneum, and got a cleaner, nicer room for almost half the price with a FULL COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST including an omelete station, fresh fruit bar, coffee, soft drinks, cereal, donuts, etc.I recently stayed at the Atheneum for one night. That was all the time necessary for me to know that I was in... a convention hotel.The hotel was recently remodeled (in the last 5 years I think) and the rooms are very nice. My room had a living room with flat-panel TV right when you walk in, and then a large bathroom with soaking tub. Down some steps (within the room) was the bedroom with two queen beds and another flat-panel TV. The view out the floor-to-ceiling windows was nice, but remember that you're in Detroit. Its not some architectural marvel.The real issue I faced with giving this hotel a better rating was the cleanliness. While in the hotel, every ledge and surface seemed to have a thick layer of dust on it. As I took the glass elevator up, I could see the edge of each floor as I went up, and every one of the ledges had a thick layer of dust. If they were paying any attention to detail at all, they should have caught this. Additionally, the windows in the room had fingerprints all over them which tells me the housekeeping hadn't cleaned the windows between guests.I don't think many people stay at the Atheneum for the hotel itself. I got the distinct impression that people stayed there for class reunions and small conferences. One more thing, the ""continental breakfast"" included all of the following: Orange Juice, Apple Juice, Coffee, Tea, one type of muffin, and a tiny plate of pineapple chunks. A joke, to be honest.The reviewers who gave this hotel 3 stars or fewer have an accurate assessment of the hotel environment.  Let me outline the positives and negatives about the hotel.Negatives:1. The noise.  THE NOISE.  This is not a hotel where someone can experience a romantic getaway or experience calm surroundings.  Our room was positioned on Lafayette Street which is an incredibly noisy area of the hotel.  There is a adult entertainment bar on Lafayette Street on the second floor that plays very loud music into the wee hours of the night.  It is constant and throbbing.  There is no escape.In addition to the outside noise, I could not escape the noise from fellow guests.  It seemed to me that most of the people I encountered in the halls were interested in this hotel because they wanted suites in which to party.  On either side of us we had very large groups of people in rooms and the people were screaming and squealing throughout the night.  I was awakened in the middle of the night by one room of young women who were really loud.In my opinion, the noise issue is so bad that the hotel is unsuitable.2. While the decor and furniture has been updated, there is obvious wear and tear on the building itself.  There are streak marks on the walls, the grout, tile, wall paint and hot tub fixtures look worn.  In the size suite we stayed in, the hot tub was in the central living area, and not enclosed in the bathroom, which seems like an odd structural choice and definitely lacks privacy if those staying do not all want to go in the hot tub together.3. The staff were all polite, but except for one person, were not friendly at all.  I have stayed in all kinds of hotels from Motel 6s to Westins in Chicago, and at almost all of these places, the staff, upon checking out, ask me if I enjoyed my stay.  Not here.  The room service person was rumpled and unkempt.  It is true (like others have noted) that the ice machines are not fully stocked.  I had to go to multiple floors to attempt to get ice.4. Although there is room service (from the restaurant in the same building), there isn't a gift shop, and the convenience store near the restaurant is opened limited hours.5. The wifi is poor.  My phone and computer kept dropping the connection and I had to login frequently.  In addition, the wifi connection was slow.  I turned off wifi on my phone and used my 3G data plan because it was quicker for me to do so for anything more data intensive than web surfing.  So the wifi along with the gift shop aren't deal breakers, but they just add to the negative experiences.Positives:1. I did like the updated furniture and bed linens2. The valet service was prompt so we could get the heck out of thereGiven the amount of money this hotel costs, I think there likely are other, more competitive options in Downtown Detroit that would end up being quieter and having better, more friendly staff.  If I go to downtown Detroit again, I will not stay here.What a lovely hotel. We were in Detroit for a US Fencing tournament and we decided to stay at the Atheneum because it was by the people mover (an elevated train that goes to spots downtown, including the convention center).  We loved the large suite and the great tub and nice large bathroom. The hotel was very clean and the staff was extremely nice. Brenda was especially nice when we checked in and even remembered us the next day! She took time to ask my son how he did at the tournament!  The restaurant is good in the hotel but Greektown was great. My only complaint about Detroit is that cabs are difficult to find outside of the main downtown.I just returned home from a stay in very chilly Detroit. The high point of this trip was this hotel. My company had booked to hold an evening reception here thus we stayed here for two nights. Our rooms were $249 per night and were gigantic suites with large sitting area, marble bath with soaking tub, 2 flat screen TVs and comfy beds.The staff here is the most unbelievably friendly and amazing I have ever experienced as ANY price point. I have travelled all over the world and logged hundreds of nights in hotel rooms. Never have I had such unbelievably excellent service from EVERYONE - the valet, registration, security, concierge, housekeeping and the catering staff. No request was too much and all were fulfilled in less than a fraction of the time I would have expected.The location is also great - right on the people mover - easy access to Cobo Hall, Joe Louis Arena and the stadiums. It also s across the street from one of the casinos and smack dab in the middle of Greektown - a wonderful neighborhood of great restaurants and bars.Take my advice - don't stay anywhere else!This is Detroit's only 4-star hotel.  Considering this hotel is located in the middle of a sad, dumpy area, that's not saying much about Detroit.I had to stay here overnight for a business trip and I cannot imagine why they suggested this place for 2 young women to stay at (our meetings were an hour north of the city).   The location is seedy.  I'm no suburban princess or anything, heck I don't bat in eye in SE D.C. or even in downtown Baltimore, but this place was no joke.  I didn't leave the hotel alone at night.The upsides:  The room was really nice.  I got a junior King suite, which had a nice huge TV and a really nice bathroom with soaking tub.  The continental breakfast was actually decent, aside from the coffee and juice, there was fresh pineapple and strawberries, muffins, and a good assortment of pastries.   The pastries weren't fresh or anything, but they were good enough.Stayed here with my family while in town for a Wings game and trip to the Ford Museum.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Anything we needed, they were all over it.  We had a deluxe suite and it was very spacious for us.  Beds were nice but we were under the impression the living room had a sofa sleeper, and it was just sofa (pretty stiff and not too comfy).  You can request a mini fridge when you check in.  Walls are a bit thin, can get loud at night and outside.  Good size bathroom with big shower.  No overnight parking in the area that we could find, so had to pay $20 to valet.  The shuttle was a great amenity, but we did have a rough time finding the shuttle after the game.  There really wasn't a designated spot and it was a blizzard outside, after calling about 7 times we managed to find it (no help from the direction of the driver) - just got lucky. Fishbones restaurant is downstairs so that's nice/convenient.  Overall, good stay and reasonably priced.We got a great price for this hotel on Priceline. However, I don't think I'd recommend staying here, especially if you are paying full price. Both nights we stayed were super noisy. I am all for having events at a hotel but someone needs to make sure that the party in the lobby can't be heard on the 3rd floor.  Checking in took forever. The valet costs $20 a day and it sometimes took a really long time to retrieve our car. I liked the location and that it's connected to Fishbones but I think there are probably better options downtown.Clean joint. Spacious sweets. Comfortable beds. I say yes.We stayed here for DEMF weekend.   We'd originally booked a double suite, but upon arrival, the manager was summoned by the front desk clerk and we were then told that there were some kids in that room the night prior that ""were partying too hard and trashed the room.""  She offered us a room w/ a king bed and pull out couch.  We conjured that she was afraid we would be those kids and trash the room, so she offered us a downgrade.  I guess I don't blame her given it was the weekend of DEMF, however, we didn't have glow sticks in hand, raver pants on, or pacifiers in our mouths.  on to the room!  It was a smoking room...w/ no windows that could be opened or vents either!  Not even an exhaust fan in the bathroom.  How could something like this happen, you ask??  B/c we were in detroit, that's how!!!  The sound transfer between rooms was very good...this being a BAD thing.  We could hear the couple next to us fighting and we even heard a glass being thrown.  Apparently, from what we've heard, the Atheneum is one of the nicer hotels in Detroit.   yikes!!!!Those that come to Atheneum must understand upfront that it is always busy with something. This is one of the hotels in Detroit that hosts a lot of patrons for various annual events, as well as high school homecomings and proms. Therefore, I suggest checking with the reservation staff before booking your room, if you wanted to perhaps have a quiet weekend. The Atheneum is actually a nice hotel and appears to be getting better with upcoming renovations. It is right in the heart of the city (located across from the Casino), so you are definitely in walking distance to fun activities.Hotel overbooked, so we were moved to a smaller suite. It still was nice and they compensated me nicely. Only complaints are not enough towels in the bathroom and the bathroom wasn't as clean as it should've been. Pay in advance and room will be under $150.This was surprisingly a decent hotel?  They let us check in a couple hours early (as we were camping out in the business center).  The rooms were pretty big suites, clean, and comfortable.  I think the bathroom was bigger than my first NYC apartment.  I have no complaints.  It's in a bit of a random location but I didn't feel unsafe or far from where I needed to be (a few blocks away).  For $129/night I thought it was very good value.I cannot say enough about my time at Atheneum. It honestly was my best experience at hotel, ever. I stayed here the weekend of June 19th for my wedding. They were unbelievably accommodating. I had already enjoyed my first night in a deluxe suite by taking a bath in their  amazing bathtub and relaxing with friends in the spacious living room area. The next day I needed to be moved into the Premium suite I'd booked for my honeymoon night with my husband, early, so I didn't have to worry about how long I took getting ready for my wedding. Not only did they allow me to check in early but they upgraded me to a Senators suite that impressed everyone that was helping me get ready for my wedding that day! The room, or should I say apartment, was amazing! Curtis, the concierge there told me and a bridesmaid were we could get a great deal on beautiful flowers for my bouquet as well as the bouquets for my bridesmaids. Andre, another concierge was always there to help as well.  Valet, the front desk, and management were beyond reproach! I felt well taking care of and valued as a customer! By the time I left I felt like I knew everyone and they knew my husband and I. I highly recommend the Atheneum for your special occasion!It appeared to be an older hotel with modern decor. The walls were a bit thin. I had a hard time sleeping because there is a night club next to it and I could hear the loud music till about 3am or so. This is the one thing that made me never want to go back. It wasn't worth the money, but the rooms were decorated nicely and were quite large.for the money not a bad deal.  wifi, coffee maker, flat screen tv's.  clean, clean, clean!!!  i will definitely be returning to this place in the future.I had a wonderful experience at the Atheneum Suite Hotel. I stayed there just to get away one weekend. My room had a jacuzzi per my request. I didn't have a major event or any thing like that happening so I wasn't rushing around or in a panic. Room service when ordered was timely, check in was swift and my time spent in the bar and restaurant were enjoyable. My room was also clean and the concierge was hospitable. Overall, I had the weekend I needed.",,"['love', 'hotel', 'try', 'talk', 'husband', 'night', 'time', 'great', 'location', 'walk', 'everything', 'deal', 'casino', 'smokers', 'although', 'save',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-book-cadillac-detroit-detroit,The Westin Book Cadillac Detroit,4.0,$$$,165,"This is my go to for a hotel in downtown Detroit! You can never go wrong with a Westin but the Book Cadillac is everything you want out of a downtown hotel. The rooms are quiet and clean. The service is attentive and helpful. The lounge area and roast are my favorite.Got a room for New Year's Eve to hang downtown and have a blast, decided on the Book Cadillac, and we all stayed there...I want to say there were six rooms, if I recall correctly.Lobby's great, valet service while dropping my car off was fast and attentive, check in was smooth and easy, and the bar on the 2nd floor was the perfect place for the guys to hang and have a few drinks while we were waiting for the ladies to finish getting ready for the night.Bed was super comfy......okay, look, here's the negative.  Upon throwing open the drapes the next morning (hey, 11am is still morning...lol...), discovering that housekeeping had somehow managed to miss the half-eaten bag of pita bread and open thing of hummus sitting on the window ledge kinda skeeved me out a bit and made me question their housekeeping practices...which made me worry about what was lurking in that super comfy bed and....:shudder:I'd probably go back....but I'll definitely check the window ledges as soon as I get in the room :)This Westin is fantastic.  Staying here for the marathon it was super close to the start and the amenities are fantastic.  I forgot my running shorts and thank god they have a gear rental program because it saved my race!  I suppose I could have run in my boxers but I would probably end up accidentally flashing the border guards and end up in federal prison.  Being a Starwood member I was placed on the top floor which was great because at 23 floors you're above the street noise down below.  The gym is nicely appointed and their pool looked tempting but I forgot my swimming trunks.  Really enjoyed the executive lounge and the rooms themselves were great.  Super spacious. comfortable linens (although probably overboard with the amount of sheets/blankets.  The shower was nice with the rain shower head.I'll stay at this Westin again if I'm ever in Detroit again that's for sure.Beautiful hotel that located in a 1924 ItalianRenaissance style high rise. Located in a great area in Downtown Detroit.  This place comes with great views, indoor pool, whirlpools tubs, and fine dining. We stayed here during the Movement festival Memorial day weekend.  Best experience ever. I will come back anytime I am in Detroit.I have stayed here a couple times and always had good service. This time however, the room my girl and I were given was dirty and had cheerios on the chair. It was also extremely small with a wonderful view of a building wall. The person who checked us in even asked us if we would like a view and of course we said yes...who wouldn't? Not a great start to our Valentine's weekend together.Nicest Westin I've ever stayed at!  And I'm pretty loyal to Starwood, so that says a lot.The hotel is gorgeous, large spacious lobbies, hallways, elevators, and rooms.  The building itself was the prettiest on the block.From the moment we pulled up, service was superb:  3 bellmen descended to help with bags, check-in was easy, arranging for ""green choice"" and late checkout was easy, getting to / from the room (bellman showed up quickly), in/out privileges with self-park was seamlessly validated, and everyone was smiling!Location was perfect for a downtown stay.  You can easily walk to all the tourist attractions without an trouble or need for public transportation.  Great coffee option two blocks away:  urban bean company!I've heard great things about the steakhouse at the restaurant but did not have a chance to try it - saving it for next time!I had wanted to stay at the Book Cadillac for years!  I finally got the chance to make a reservation when we booked a room for the night of the Zac Brown Band concert.  The hotel is in a great area with a lot of restaurants/people movers near by and valet parking as well as a parking structure available.Despite the hotel being busy with the ZBB concert, the Motorhead concert, and a wedding reception in the hotel, the front desk staff quickly greeted us and checked us in.The hotel is pretty big and has a couple of restaurants (Roast and 24 Grille), a coffee shop, spa and gift shop.  If you are lucky enough to stay in the top floors of the hotel and get to use the VIP suite, you can partake in wonderful appetizers in the evening.  At the time of this review they offered caprese salad, field greens, custard with blackberries, cheeses and meats, grilled veggies, and olives.  Breakfast on Sunday consisted of bacon, egg dishes fruit, breads, yogurt, fresh ground coffee, etc. Not to mention a wonderful view!The beds were really comfy.  The bathrooms were spacious with wonderful soaps, shampoos, etc.  The water pressure was great.  If you like to work out, they offer the option of renting work out clothing....It's in close proximity to Ford Field, Comerica Park, The Joe, The Fox Theatre, The Fillmore, The Detroit Opera House, The People Movers, and more.... I highly reccomend!This place met all expectations-- clean, prompt service, the joint is really, really nice.Having said that, five stars are reserved for perhaps exceeding expectations, and there're only two small facets that stood out to prevent a superlative rating:1. The crew runnin' cars and bags out front were on point and aware of the needs of folks around them, but when folks ain't in need, they were talkin' about some beef simmerin' in the ranks with so-and-so who did something messed up and everyone should say something about it.  It's just always weird to have the curtain drawn back, you know, even though we know every spot has that mild drama.2. No hooks or towel racks on the bathroom walls. One on the door.  None on the walls. Tha's just weird, yo.I'd stay here again, though, no questions asked.Having planned ahead, my boyfriend booked a room through Expedia for Valentine's Day weekend in an effort to do something special this Halmark holiday. He was very happy about the deal he received. Upon arrival and check in, we were asked if we wanted a room with a view...um yeah, then asked if we wanted to upgrade to a suite for $50 more dollars, no thank you. So we were sent to room 1406. We've stayed in this hotel before, so when we walked in and saw the size, we knew we were getting jipped. This room was about a third smaller than any other standard room we've ever stayed in here, and the view he specifically asked us about consisted of the theee stone walls of the connected condos where we could see right in, ""Hi Gro6ege, Hi Weezy!"" Within moments we both saw the smooshed cheerios in the chair and on the floor near the bed. Right there in plain sight! It was obvious this room was not cleaned properly. We called the front desk and they moved us to a clean, larger sized room on a differnt floor. Not a great start to our romantic night...Negative reviews about Detroit usually come from people who have never been here. That being said, I listened to all the outsiders tell me how ""dangerous"" Detroit is. My grandpa was from Detroit, but that was probably before Detroit took a wrong turn, so even though I heard great stories of Detroit's past, I am a visitor in 2015, and I don't want to take any chances. I booked the Westin because I believed that at $300 a night, the least I would get is safety. What I didn't expect was the ""snobbery."" I'm sorry to say but I did not feel welcome ONE BIT at this hotel. I am a HUGE Detroit sports fan, so I showed up wearing my Lions jacket and was looked at as if I wandered in to use the bathroom. After I checked in (the most uncomfortable check-in of my life), I wandered over to fumble with the elevator. Thank God another guest was there to help me. I didn't learn anything about any amenities in this hotel. Not one employee told me anything. Anyways, later that night I was dressed in Tigers gear to go to the baseball game and an employee actually looked at me and laughed!I will be honest, I hate this hotel. I stayed here because I love history and I heard it was really old (refurbished now), and a friend of mine had stayed here with his family and he thought it was nice. I thought it would be safer than the Holiday Inn a block away, but after this experience, I would take my chances on a bench outside the Riverwalk (no offence)!I love Detroit, but the one thing that Detroit does not need is snobs! And this hotel is full of them! I gave crackers to a homeless lady, and a valet guy yelled to me, ""What are you selling out of that bag?"" Seriously? I'm giving a lady some food, you big dorf! If you are in Detroit just to sleep then stay here because the bed was comfortable. Also, if you are afraid to interact with real people then you might like it here. This hotel is ""so L.A."" which is exactly what I didn't want. Shame.Valet &amp; security when we were leaving..very rude...no customer service skills! Westin is paying valet &amp; security guy to just chat it up while the customer just waits!Wow. Where do I even begin? At the beginning I suppose...I had such high hopes for this stay. So many wonderful reviews, such a beautiful building in the city I love most. Check in was problem free. The gentlemen who checked us in was polite, professional and friendly. Then we entered our room. This is where the stay went to hell in a hand basket. The carpet had not been vacuumed well at all. There was a huge piece of wallpaper coming off the wall under the window. Hair all over the bathroom floor. The toilet leaked. My heart sank. I opened to dresser to put some items away and there as a very long dark hair in it...my heart broke. For such an upscale and expensive hotel it felt like a Motel 6. The room itself was large and nicely decorated. The shower was heavenly, after we rinsed the long black hair out of it. We went for a late night drink at the Grill. For all of the Westin's flaws, the staff we encountered wasn't one of them. Top notch, above and beyond from the doorman to the bartender. Great drinks, tasty nosh. I'll go back the Grill. After drinks we headed to the elevator to turn in for the evening only to encounter an overflowing trash with someone's braid hanging out of it!!! For the love of cleanliness Westin, WTH is going on with your housekeeping???Needless to say. I'll not be back. The Atheneum has earned my trust after several stays there I've never had an unpleasant experience.Dammit Westin. You're a bummer.We were very happy with our stay here.  We didn't take advantage of many of the amenities, but it served us well for our 1 night stay.  The location was great, plenty of places are walkable from there.  The view from our room was very nice, we could see the Detroit River and lots of interesting downtown buildings.  The room itself was beautiful and roomy, including the nice spacious bathroom and shower.  Drinks at the Grille 47 Bar were very good and we had good service.  The bed was comfy but I must say the layers upon layers of soft comfy sheets and comforters was a little annoying to me, but my boyfriend loved them.  My only ""would-be complaint"" is that I thought there would be a Bar in the room with little liquor bottles and snacks.  There is a locked fridge, and I had to call downstairs for a key to open it, and to my surprise it was empty, just a fridge!  So we did put it to use with our water bottles, and I'm actually glad there wasn't a bar in the room because otherwise we might not have got out and about when we did. The restaurant menus are a bit pricey but there is a lot of variety in the price points with the bar menus to choose from too, and so much within walking distance.  In the morning they opened a Coffee/Danish shop in the Lobby where we got ourselves some nice Starbucks Coffees.  The staff, particularly Ann Marie I believe her name is, was very professional and helpful and friendly.  We would definitely go back here!This is an update to my previous review of the Westin Book Cadillac in Detroit from 12/6/2015.I came back for the 49er-Lions game.Westin Book Cadillac gets 5 Stars for the quick check in - I was 6th in line, served very fast and was placed in a great room.The Westin is NOT the problem.The problem is the 24 Grill restaurant downstairs in the Westin Book Cadillac.Hostess seated me promptly. Station attendant brought a menu, water and had the bartender bring me a beer.I sat there for 20 minutes waiting for a server to come take my order. The station attendant apologized. I waved my hands, waved the menu and tried to get the attention of the restaurant staff that was congregated at the bar area.After watching and listening an additional 7 minutes of the laughter and talking without being helped, I decided to leave.I asked for the bill to pay for my beer. The bill never came. As I walked over to the hostess station to ask if I could pay the bill, I heard one of the waiters ask her peers if I was going to pay for my beer. Well, of course I was going to pay for my beer. The staff didn't show concern for me when I sat there, but was very concerned when I was walking out. The bill appeared, I paid in full and left.I recommend staying at the Westin Book Cadillac, but stay away from the 24 Grill located on the 1st floor. There are too many other places to eat in the vicinity. I was dressed nicely, I was polite. The reason I was given for not being attended to was a ""Shift Change."" (Not likely, others around me were being assisted).Clean hotel. Has everything you need. Awesome historical building. Nice staff members.The worst hotel experience in the history of hotels. At different points people (staff?) entered my room, used my bed (yep, for that) and used the shower. Happened to another in my group too. Also they lost my luggage, laptop (at different times). And the staff and mamagement don't really care.I travel a lot and host meetings in my work. This is the worst experience ever. Don't do it.This hotel was amazing. When checking in the front desk asked what my plans were this weekend. I told her it was my birthday. She upgraded everything for free! She insisted on giving us a room with view. 22 floors up and we enter the room which was stunning. The hotel room was very spacious. The view was perfect. You could see the bridge and the river. The bathroom was huge. The shower was like a waterfall. The room was extra clean, no hairs anywhere.  The room was stocked with a mini bar which we didn't touch! The front desk gave us free Continental breakfast card at The Boulevard. You get your typical continental breakfast but you can upgrade for $5.00 and get anything off the menu.The staff here is very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be staying here again.It's such a shame nobody goes to Detroit ever anymore because this hotel is beautiful. I travel frequently for work and this is the nicest place I've gotten to stay (we usually stay at Marriotts or Starwoods). Interestingly enough, it was also one of the cheapest - so if you're in Detroit take advantage of the unfortunate times and snag a room at this wonderful spot!The lobby is gorgeous and the regular rooms are pleasant. I was actually upgraded to at typically $1,500 per night suite with a living room and giant bathroom which was super exciting! The restaurant, Roast, is fantastic. I generally prefer to venture outside my hotel to eat but Roast is just as good as any other top restaurant. The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is very elegant. Oh, elegant! I just thought of the perfect word to describe the hotel as a whole 3/4 through my review! The Westin Cadillac is quite elegant!Yeah, it's in Detroit, so the once thriving neighborhood looks a little post apocalyptic. Fortunately, the valet service is very efficient so you don't have to walk through the empty streets to find your car. Let's hope the city recovers soon so that more people are inclined to enjoy this great hotel.It pains me to write this review but it needs to be written.A lot can go into a bad review that othersise tarnishes a good establishment and this is the case with this reviewCheck in staff-- 5 starsRoom - 3 ( minus 1 for the view and minus 1 for the broken safe) late night Room service food and service--4.5 starsBar staff at Roast--5+ starsBar staff and cocktails at the lobby bar near check in--5 starsThis disaster of a stay began just after 4 AM with a fire alarm. After several minutes we emerged from our stupor and joined dozens of other confused sleepy people making our way down the stairs. Some dressed in robes, and various mismatched outfits thrown together last minute.Eventually without any sort of assistance  we made our way out of the hotel. On the way out down the stairs we encountered   several elderly patrons who were really struggling down the stairs. Fortunately they were being assisted by other guests who were functioning as good samaritans. At no point did we encounter staff either to assist us with directions or to see if anybody needed help.Out in the street it was chaos and people just hanging about. Some sleeping in the street. Again zero communication from hotel staff. We were camped out right in front of the doors sniffing fire truck exhaust. Some people chose to leave and check into the holiday inn.After about an hour the unofficial word hit the masses that it was OK to repopulate the hotel. Again zero communication.The rumor mill was in full effect. Many folks headed for the nonfunctioning elevators and piled in. Others milled about dazed and confused. . Some elected to try the stairs, but the rumor mill again in effect said that the doors would not open from the stairs. We were on 17 and chose not to walk 17 floors at 6 AM only to be denied access.The elevators still would not work, which a senior fireman randomly told us was  because the hotel could not reset their alarm and also because there was perhaps smoke in the basement and they (the hotel) needed to ""get some fans"" to blow it out ( where they were going to just get fans at 6 AM on a Sunday?? seemed to be the question most of us asked)A single elevator, like a lifeboat from a sinking ship somehow departed, but went to floor 13 and moved no further as if stuck on 13.....for 2 then 5 then 10 minutes. THe rumor mill assumed the worst, but soon chimed in that the doors would indeed allow egress from the stairs. Several in our elevator chose to depart. It really was surreal. A few of us remarked that this was what it must have felt like to be on the Titanic where the wrong choice could be disastrous!The 4 or 5 of us remaining in the elevator were soon saved by a maint. man of about 20 years old who got in and said with his magical elevator key he could reset the lockdown feature Floor by floor and ferry us to our floor, resetting the system each time. And this is what he did. We were the first and as far as I know only folks that got an elevator out of the chaos.We arrived at our door only to find this poor unfortunate soul staying at the room across from ours inserting his now non functioning key into and out of his door....again and again and again. Stranded with a bad key and knowing full well there was no way down and up to remedy the situation.We later saw him just sleeping in front of his door. Poor chap.Fortunately our key worked and we somehow managed to  fall asleep for a few hours.Upon awakening we found a letter slipped under the door inviting us to a complementary buffet breakfast. . I found the tone of the letter to be apologetic but not really apologetic. It was an apology for inconvenience while not apologizing for making safety their priority. SAFETY WAS NOT THEIR PRIORITY  AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE LACK OF  PERFORMANCE OF THEIR STAFFSorry,  having an automatic fire alarm self-direct hundreds of people on their own evacuation with no assistance at all from staff , and then figure out, on their own, how to make it back to their rooms does not show me that SAFETY WAS YOUR PRIORITY. You were just cluelessWe woke up and  waited 20 minutes for an elevator ( just 2  were working  ) and hit every floor on the way down only to be met by sleepy and frustrated people stranded waiting for an elevator  but unable to board below floor 14 since by then ours was full.Fires happen, and evacuations happen and inconveniences happen and I do not fault a hotel for that.What I do fault them for was being a completely rudderless ship, absolutely devoid of leadership and communication to their guests. Nobody was out and about as far as we could see, at least if they were they were silent and without a plan of action or commiunication towards the guests.I would hate to see it had there been a real emergency. Serious simulation on emergencies is required by members of this staff. This is not only a customer service issue, this is a safety issue. I will never ever stay at this hotel againVery disappointed in the staff at this hotel.  At 4am the fire alarm went off in the entire hotel.  Everyone in the entire building had to evacuate.  My sisters were staying in a handicap room.  Their alarm and flashing lights went off 30 minutes before everyone else.  They went to the front desk to tell them about it.  The woman at the desk told them to go back to their room and that everything was fine.  They couldn't go back to their room because of the loud alarm and flashing lights.  They decided to wait in the lobby. That's when the entire building went off and everyone evacuated. Everyone was standing outside for over an hour and a half.  Four fire trucks finally came along after a half hour into the waiting.  They checked the building and it was safe to go inside.  There was no one on the hotel staff to come outside and tell everyone about the incident.  They didn't organize anything or help with the evacuation.  THEY WERE USELESS. My handicapped sisters go back to their room to find the flashing lights and alarm still going off in their room.  They couldn't sleep there obviously, so they came to my bedroom.  My fiance had to sleep on the floor while my sisters and I crammed into one bed together.  The hotel did not comp their room for the night, but instead offered complimentary breakfast.  The next day when we got to the return car rental parking lot, we told the attendant about the incident and how we were so tired.  The parking attendant said, ""Oh yeah, we've heard about that.  It's happened a few times before.""  The fact that the hotel has dealt with the fire alarm going off and still didn't know how to handle it... blows my mind!!!!I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED BY THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT AND STAFF.  I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN.","This beautiful hotel should be (if it's not already) a Detroit landmark, the exterior is a beautiful reminder of Detroit's yesteryear automobile hay-day. The interior is modern and cozy and everything I've come to expect from a Westin. The rooms are larger than most downtown Westins I've stayed in, and they are completely up-to-date with new TVs, irons, hairdryers, blackout curtains and freshly pressed robes. These are the things I care about in hotel rooms, and The Westin knocks it out of the park every time. Robes trump views... they just do. If you're doing things in downtown like taking in a sporting event, hitting a rad Yelp party or chowing down on coney dog after coney dog, this spot is very centrally located, and likely your best bet.I arrived at 4pm and had to wait for my room to be cleaned! They made me wait for over an hour!Warning .. The Cadillac hotel car valet is not managed by the Westin...Spent 40  minutes waiting for car.  Westin management did nothing to rectify the situation. :-(This hotel is hard to review. On one hand it is a nice hotel. On the other, there are a few too many elements of cheapness to make it really good.First, the good: the rooms are quite big, the bed comfortable, the lounge chair nice. The desk is large and well laid-out and the desk chair is more comfortable than most. The bathroom is big, though I could do without the fancy rainfall-type showerhead because it doesn't have much pressure. The food - especially the restaurant Roast - is excellent, including the room service. If everything else was consistent with this I'd give it 4 stars easy.Now for the cheap: my biggest problem is the doors which are not only an industrial-looking gunmetal grey but go BANG! anytime one of your neighbors lets their go of their door without closing it gently. Seriously, it about knocks the fillings out of your teeth and forget trying to sleep in the mornings or evenings when people are coming and going. I cannot over-emphasize how freakin' loud the CRASH!! is every time a door is closed by letting go of it. It's like the person deliberately tried slamming it off its hinges. BOO for this!Then there's the HVAC system. It has only one control - the temperature - with no control for the fan (auto, high, low). And it blows directly onto the bed - I tried changing the direction things but it did nothing - so if you like a little air movement while you sleep, you're going to get a LOT of air movement and it's all going to directly on you.I've already mentioned the slower. Low water pressure stinks.Finally...$30 for valet parking? In Detroit?? Apparently they think it's New York. Come on, folks, that's just silly.Would I stay here again? I suppose, though I wouldn't be thrilled about it. The location is good and it's quality. But I wish they'd do something about the doors and upgrade the HVAC system.Where do I begin? I suppose with the good.We stayed here for just one night on a quick trip to Detroit to see my sister-in-law. The hotel was beautiful! We were really happy with our room. The bed was super comfy and the giant rainfall shower head was the best!I really didn't think it was going to matter where we stayed as I knew we would spend very little time in the room. We were out until around 2am and wanted to be up before 8am to start our day.On arrival, we put our card on the account, however my SIL was paying for our stay and came by later to put her card on it. We double checked the account before we left for the evening that day and verified that her card was on file, not our own. Come time to check out and my husbands debit card was charged despite our efforts to ensure that didn't happen. The manager came and told us that in fact his card was not charged, but the money was taken out as a hold. Funny that it happened at check out and not when we put the card on as a reserve for incidentals. So hopefully that charge will be falling off in the next few days. I don't know about you all, but I don't just have a couple hundred dollars laying around so this really is a pretty big deal for us. The manager didn't make it out to be a big deal to her, of course not...it wasn't her money!Then the dreaded night. In their defense, it isn't completely their fault. There was a legitimate fire alarm that sounded around 4:30am. So we had to trek down 20 flights of stairs and were then ushered outside. During this entire time, no one from the staff came to check on anyone that I saw. Most people (including myself) were in their pajamas. It was chilly. It would have been nice to have been offered a blanket or something along those lines. After an hour we were allowed back in. They were directing some people to the stairs but I couldn't walk up 20 flights of stairs so we opted to wait for the elevators. Good thing, because we were later told that the doors in the stairs are locked from that side so no one could have gotten to their floor anyhow.They attempted to get people in the elevators (which are tiny!) but with the fire alarm still engaged (though silenced) the elevators wouldn't work properly until the smoke was cleared from the basement. They tried to use the manual override to make them work but someone with a key would need to travel in each car and reset the elevator each floor it stopped on. We were fortunate to get in the 2nd elevator that went up, but I can't even tell you how many people were waiting behind us. In total we were out of our rooms for 1.5 hours.The staff seemed completely unable to deal with the situation at hand. They definitely need more disaster training and perhaps more than 1 person with a key to the elevators. Thankfully this didn't seem to be too bad of a fire.The next morning we received a letter from the hotel management apologizing for the inconvenience the alarm caused. They offered everyone free breakfast. Great, I guess? We already had made brunch plans so we didn't partake. Then it took us a good 20-30 minutes to get downstairs to meet our family because only 2 of the 5 elevators were ""working"". I would use the term working lightly there, though. They stopped on every single floor going up and down. And of course, this was around the time most people were checking out so the elevators were extra busy. We had chosen a late check out so we didn't need to go then, thankfully.After a few trips up and down the rest of the morning, I was extremely happy to be leaving...until the fiasco with the room being charged to the wrong card. It was a very stressful night. I loved the hotel....but there were just too many things that went wrong. I don't know that we would ever stay there again.Beautiful spot for drinks!  Nice Jazz in the background!  Quick staff!  Good drink prices!  Flights are nice!  Elegant!I've live in Detroit FOREVER and this is the first time i've been here - It's very beautiful inside and i was greeted at the entrance.  Even though i wasn't staying and mainly using their stairs for practice (ALA stair climb) - everything was clean and straighten.The only thing reason i knocked off a star was due to there Valet team - I'm pretty sure they were great but staging the vehicle in the middle of street can cause an issue.  I would hate if I used valet and came back with an missing mirror.  (smh!)Booked a king room on the executive level, which includes executive lounge access. Would highly recommend getting an executive room! The lounge has breakfast which is basic but nice. In the afternoon and evening there are nice snacks, and the lounge is open throughout the day for chips, water bottles, sodas, TVs, and a free printer. The lobby is currently being renovated, but it's not that invasive. Overall looks nice. The executive King is a rather large room. The bathroom is also nice, and ours had a window. For about $150/night, definitely better value than the casinos.Pinch me!  No, not hard enought.  Pinch me harder!  This is what I said about my stay at the this Westin.  I thought I dreamt that I stayed in a five star resort in some hipster location.Nope, I stayed at the Westin Book Cadillac in downtown Detroit!  A M A Z I N G    H O T E L!The staff is wonderful...professional, helpful and engaging.For certain groups, they offer free shuttle service.  Nice perk!We loved the on-site restaurant and I typically shy away from hotel eateries.  I would come back to the restaurant without staying at the hotel.  It was that good.As other have said and I agree, the rooms are large, spacious, clean and the bathrooms...oh the bathrooms are a liitle piece of heaven.Detroit is lucky to have this gem of a hotel!Good and bad. I miss the speakman heavenly shower. My room:3 bad light bulbs. One even had a note from a previous user to replace the bulb. Stains and a burn mark in the carpet. No idea why but the minibar is locked. The heater kept raising the temperature in the room. I kept lowering the thermostat but kept heating up. I finally called the staff and this was corrected within 30 minutes. Pros:Westin staff are always 115% Very positiveVery professionalMake them the best hotel chainThe beds are still perfectLight tight rooms ease the morning after a long night out. Room rate was super reasonable for a non holiday or special event stay.I have been here 2x now not to stay but to drink and hang out with friends.  The service is very slow in the lounge and bar area.  The seating is spaced out so its hard to get a spot sometimes.  I would not be come here again for drinks.  The only reason for the 2 stars was they have good house wine.Date night! Excellent hotel, we'll be back, this is our go-to hotel going forward.The Pros: - Spacious room- Great bathroom- Everything appeared to be exceptionally clean- Very professional and courteous staff (very)The Cons:- Took longer than expected to get our luggage from the valet/doorman up to our room (we were in a time-crunch, so it made it a little more of an anxious experience than normal), they told us 5-10 minutes at check-in, but I had to call the front desk twice to get a status - it wound up taking about 20 minutes.- Check-in took a long time; the staff was great, it's just that the process seemed very slow (could actually be attributed to how helpful the staff was being with the customers...). - Wifi was not free. - The bathroom was a little chilly and difficult to get warm (But those bath robes though! Nice!)The location is perfect - about 10 minutes from most good things (the river, casinos, Fox, Masonic, etc). I remember someone else mentioning the People Mover proximity - we didn't hear it at all (15th floor), wasn't an issue.We stayed at the Ren Cen a month ago - it pales in comparison. For the price range ($250-ish), the Ren Cen room was about (...or felt about...) half the size with half the intangibles. However....the Ren Cen room was 40 floors up with a riverside view. Hard to beat that (...it did though).We didn't get a chance to try any of the amenities (bar, restaurant, gym, etc.), maybe next trip.I had an issue with another patron that caused me to lose sleep. I am writing this review because they handled the problem and I am leaving happy. I look forward to coming back. Room 922 5/23/15The woman on the phone around 9am was very helpful, thanks.Had to spend 18 days there, for business, and enjoyed every day.  Great hotel.  Great beds.  Great service.  Indoor pool and hot tub.  Great workout room.  Roast, in the lobby, is one of the best restaurants in town.  Two big thumbs up.They say they've renovated, but I was very underwhelmed by the room. And the air/heat was so noisy. Mediocre.Planned to stay at the Westin for a work trip, but it was canceled at the last minute. Nevertheless, I experienced really helpful and accommodating customer service from the hotel management which I think is worth mentioning even though I cannot directly comment on the rooms themselves.We had an amazing stay here. The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful, even treating us to champagne and strawberries for a special occasion! Loved how close we were to the people mover and how easy it was to get in and out. The hot tub was closed for repair but that was alright. The restaurants and coffee shops were wonderful and we will return again when staying in Detroit!Good rooms. Completely fell apart with a fire incident though. They couldn't get their elevators working properly the whole day after. They also managed to charge the wrong card for my stay. They need more disaster practice. Did not make me feel safe it felt more like they had no idea what to doBeautiful hotel in a great location. Also, coming from NYC, it seems like a great value! Stayed here for a conference and thought the food/drinks were fantastic. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was nice. My only complaint was that there was no hot water for one night/one morning during my stay--seems like it took a long time to correct the problem. Guessing this was a freak occurrence, though.This is a great hotel. If you're visiting Detroit, get yourself a room here. You can thank me later.The experience starts when you pull up in front of the hotel. The valets are right there, ready to help - Can I help you with your bags? How is your day? - friendly and polite. It almost seems like they enjoy parking other people's cars all day, which maybe they do, or maybe they hire out-of-work actors who are just really good at pretending. Whatever the secret, it's incredible. You walk into a marvelous, beautiful building. More smiling faces. Check in was a breeze - and again, it was like the woman actually enjoyed her job. I needed laundry done, so I threw it in a bag and sent it down. The laundry is a little ridiculously expensive, and they starched my underwear (bizarre), but then they hung the stuff up in the closet and it was there when I got home from work, so whatever. Can I have this for always?The overhead light was burnt out, so I called the desk, and the woman I spoke with kept apologizing (lightbulbs burn out, calm down) and had it fixed right away. Where do they find these people?My room was beautiful. Huge. Great views of the city. Comfortable, relaxing, wonderful. I felt like royalty. I love the Book Cadillac, and you will too.The not-free WiFi is a little stupid, though. This is 2014. Let's get with it.","Overall (architecture, amenities and restaurant) this place is fantastic. However, on our last visit we found torn streamers, balloon remnants and a used condom in our room. Gross! We complained to the manager a the front desk, but she only offered us rapidly embarrassed blinking reactions. Awkward and still gross.We stayed here for our anniversary. They gave us a corner room which is bigger, complientary wine in our room too! Beuatiful and clean room. Quiet. Great service. I will come back. Had dinner at Roast in the hotel. Very good.This is my second time staying here. Both times the hotel has been very clean and uneventful.  The staff is professional. The rooms are modern and decorated nicely with nice views of the lake. I would absolutely recommend and look forward to returning.The rooms were outstanding. Super comfy bed too and the shower and bathroom is the best!! So roomy. The brunch we had on Sunday as an event was amazing. Love the omelet station.  Friendly bartenders at the hotel bar. Highly recommend this hotel. Slightly pricey though.Great hotel location in the heart of Detroit. We stayed there for two nights and had a large room on the 22 floor with views of the city. The hotel is extremely well located, has a spa, two great restaurants, a bar and nice staff. We stayed two nights there and really enjoyed the place. Our only disappointment was the breakfast on the executive room : though the view is nice, you get the regular non appealing selection of eggs, oatmeal, non tasty fruits, highly sugary drinks, blend bacon and sausages... This is not happening only in Detroit but still, it is always so disappointing. Apart from this and the $5 coffee downstairs, everything is great.I arrived on Wednesday 7/30/14 at 4:45 p.m. at which time I was told my room was not ready. I was told it should only be about 30 to 45 minutes wait and that I would not have to stand in line again I could just pick up the key. We were asked if the room billing needed to be split in half my reply was no just one bill please. I got separate bills. When our room was ready the person who checked us in was no longer at the front desk so we waited in line another 15 minutes to receive a key. We were not offered a key to the mini bar or even told where the elevators were located. We dropped our bags in the room and went to have dinner in your restaurant. I can not even begin to express how bad the service was. I ordered a $78.00 bottle of wine and had to ask three times when it was coming. The appetizer arrived after 30 minutes unfortunately no one had given us silverware or napkins, we were still waiting on the wine. Our server handed us unfolded napkins and lose silverware he grabbed from somewhere. When the food arrived the carrots were raw and the mashed potatoes were cold and the chicken was dry from being over cooked.. We asked to speak to the manager who offered no apologies just said he would remove the meal from the bill. Which was the least he could do since none of it was eaten. We actually went to the bar to get an appetizer since dinner was uneatable. The server there was the only good point of our visit. The next morning when I got up I went to put the comforter back on the bed. Please see the attached pictures! Both comforters were stained. Not only were they stained but the were not old stains they appeared to be untreated. I am a business women who travels frequently, I just joined Westin  and was more than disappointed. I was in Detroit for a trade show and did not have time to go to the front desk to complain. I have contact management several times and have not been satisfied with a resolution.Took great care of us, despite having multiple weddings and a convention. Never noticed the activity.As usual with Westin, the bed was great. We had a nice sized king room with a great view of tiger stadium.One complaint, and this is the case with all upper end hotels - why do I need to pay for wifi when I am shelling out hundreds for the room???? Aloft gives free wifi to Starwood members - why doesn't Westin (The Ritz and 4 Seasons are no different). It makes no sense...This hotel is beautiful. Very snazzy and classy, looked like there were plenty of activities one could partake in.But alas, the one part of my stay that was not luxurious was my bed. I like a firm yet soft bed. Like a firm pillow top would have been perfect. I apparently got the handicapped Klingon room. The bed was firm but that is about it. Maybe a little softer than the wood plank I felt like i had laid on. I love it when they put me in one of these handicapped rooms as I am 6'6"" and many hand operated switches/ buttons etc are placed low.Anyway - if you want a ""pinky up"" nice swanky hotel, this is your hotel. Hipster will like this too as it is in an old hotel building with a lot of history.We had a wonderful experience minus one front desk lady who was really rude.  Hotel is in a wonderful location and beautifully done.  It has all the amenities you need.  We were on the top floor and the club is very nice for breakfast.  Rooms are quite nice with a clean feel and high quality materials used for decor and building.  Prices are usually pretty pricey but in this case they gave a great wedding deal for the block of rooms... Valet is quick, easy, and accessible.My favorite place to stay in Detroit. Very plush for the price. Good location for downtown work, night spots, and sporting events.This hotel was absolutely beautiful. I was amazed. Spacious, gorgeous, comfortable!The bathroom was really big, there were two shower heads in the shower, I loved the soap they had, and the robes were so cushy!I had a great sleep that night.There was a fun bar just down the road which the staff advised us of. Bonus.I would 100% go back to this hotel.They even rent gym clothes! Shoes, socks, tops, and shorts. I've never seen that before!Classic hotel that's both historic and modern, both elegant and friendly. Only complaint is the parking, which is right next door but there's no hotel entrance on the parking garage side, and during many hours there isn't one on the other two sides of the hotel, either. So you have to trek all the way around the entire hotel to go back and forth to your car.I solved it by renting a bike and leaving the car mostly in the garage. I was worried about where I'd lock the bike safely, but the doorman just smiled and said ""take it up to the room"". Right answer! And the rooms are plenty big so even adding a bike or two didn't cramp us.I am in the hospitality industry and I stay in a lot of hotels across the US. This hotel exceeded my expectations the moment I walked in the door. The door staff was pleasant and accommodating, but not overbearing. The front desk agent was super friendly. I was upgraded to the concierge floor - and my room was extra large with plenty of bedside outlets, great amenities, a spacious closet with plenty of hangers, great views of Detroit - and great linens. The bathroom had a window (always a plus), And the bed was super comfortable. The hotel service levels all 4 nights did not disappoint. One night a colleague was leaving late after dinner and two valet's walked her to her hotel 3 blocks away after I jokingly asked that she be escorted because it was so late. The only reason I did not give this hotel 5 starts is because one of my pieces of dry cleaning was clearly only pressed and not dry cleaned as I requested and as I was charged. And a long distance phone was was charged to my folio after I checked out - time stamped hours after I left the hotel (no one uses hotel phones - that charge was bogus and I had it removed). Other than those two hiccups, the hotel did a great job. Helpful hint***the gift shop in the hotel sells RedBull for $4.99 each and the Starbucks in the hotel sells them for $1 less. Too bad I figured that out on day 3.Friendly helpful check in. Nice large room. Conveniently located to lake front. Iron Chef Michael Symon's restaurant Roast located in the hotel.This is one of my top hotel choices when I come to Detroit.  It is very nice with a decent size gym and pool.   The staff is friendly and restaurants ""Roast"" is attached to this!   I enjoyed my last two visits here.  No complains! :)It's a great hotel rated 4 stars but the room I was given had a problem with the heat. It stayed at 60F or below. The temp outside was 34 F and the room was cold. Called the front desk and she called the engineer . Tried fixing it remotely and then came to my room at midnight to check it with his tool kit! The guy tried hard but nothing worked . It was between using more sheets to cover myself and sleeping or moving to another room well past midnight . All this at The Westin!!! Is it my sheer luck or coz they are trying to sell some bad rooms cheap on Hotwire !!While they did upgrade me and offered to move my bags , since I was visiting for business and staying only for a night the upgrade didn't seem a huge bonus or comp compared to the inconvenience caused, my lost sleep and having to move rooms at 1am in my pj's!  Not something you expect at a big brand hotel like this. Are they not expected to check the A/C - heat etc when they get the room ready for a guest ???  Upgrade to a luxury suite in my circumstance didn't seem the most appropriate compensation! At least the engineer operator and Manager were apologetic and courteous thus the three stars !We stayed here for a week and had a very enjoyable time.  Great central location close to Comerica park and Ford Field.Helpful check-in staff.Room was kept clean. A few things occasionally forgotten during housekeeping but very quickly corrected when requested. Plenty of restaurants on site. Roast and 24 Grill both good.If you need transport, use Uber. These guys are everywhere downtown and great value.Definitely would stay here again.We had a great experience at the Westin Book Cadillac. Our room was very clean and spacious, there was free (and very good) Starbucks coffee in the room, and our floor was very quiet. We did the self-park and it was easy to do, as well as cheap. Don't forget to validate your ticket before you leave the garage in order to get the unlimited in and out privileges. I subtracted a star because we had to stand in line to check in and because the Westin (like most) charges for wireless. The room wireless does cover multiple devices, though. We were able to use 2 laptops and 2 iphones after registering once even though the website acted like we would get charged every time.love this hotel.  have been to Roast plenty of times and have always wanted to stay at this hotel.  We decided to just that while we were able to enjoy all of Detroit.  The hotel and room is beautiful, spacious and classic.   The staff - from valet to customer service - was very professional and knowledgeable. Our view from our room was lovely to see during the day and when Detroit lit up.   We will be return again for another stay.This hotel experience was fabulous from start to finish.  We were originally scheduled to stay only a Friday, but had to leave Toronto early due to an impending snowpocalypse.  I called ahead, they said they had rooms and to just come on in.We were greeted promptly at reception and because I had mentioned on the reservation it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday present, we got UPGRADED.  They also honoured my pre-paid room rate for the extra day.  Which was $129...for a 5 star hotel experience.  Amazing.The customer service was great.  Everyone was just so friendly and helpful.  I had a massage at the spa and have to give a huge shout out to Melvin!  He was amazing and gave me the best deep tissue I've had in years AND I chatted with him the entire time because he was so nice and fun to talk to, it was totally relaxing.  We had good experience at the restaurants in the building and it was in walking distance of Joe Louis Arena (we were there for the hockey game).  Now here's where the hotel gets the 5 star: it is the hotel that most visiting hockey teams stay at.  We were there to see the Oilers and not only bumped into a bunch of them, but also ate breakfast in the Boulevard Room with the coach just feet away!  It was an awesome experience. When we left, I was nothing but happy except for ONE THING: two 45 second phone calls to Ann Arbor cost us $15.  I figured they'd be expensive but we had to try and get in touch with our American friends for the hockey game.  That was the only disappointing aspect of our experience. Overall, I had a wonderful time and will be back again next time I'm in Detroit for sure!","This hotel definitely lives up to the Westin standard by which all Westins strive. A nice, extremely well-kept hotel near Downtown. Rooms are well-appointed and, as all hotels continue to upgrade, plenty of outlets available for your electronics and a nice, 42-inch flat-screen TV to enjoy.Rooms and bathrooms are kept meticulously clean, always so important to see!In this particular room, they have replaced the 'heavenly shower', a shower that has 2 shower heads, with a large 'rain' type of head installed on the ceiling, with a hand-wand spray adjunct. This would be a potential disaster except for the water pressure, which is excellent, so you do end up getting suitably drenched! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, another fine example of their realization of how important good customer service is. Of all the hotels I've stayed in Detroit, this is by far my favorite so far.Hotel is beautiful rooms were great. Service awful. Front desk wait time was a nightmare. Valet and bellmen were great and helpful.We booked a block of rooms at the Westin Book Cadillac for our wedding and we hosted a brunch at the hotel the day after for all our out of town guests. We were really disappointed with the customer service. Many repeated errors were made in the reservations and rooms were blocked for people that weren't' even our guests. We had to correct reservations multiple times. Their follow-up with us was terrible and we went weeks without getting a response after multiple voice messages. Additionally, the food for the brunch was terrible and the bagels were rock hard. For the price we paid we were truly disappointed. Also the valet service was really slow and disorganized with back ups and a police incident one day. Terrible customer service all the way around.OK, first a trip down memory lane.   My folks would bring us to Detroit when I was young.  It was a great and vibrant city at the time.  Relatives owned a big (7 story) shoe store on Grand Circle called Fyfes.  Uncle worked as an underwriter for  an insurance company whose office was in Washington a block away from the Book Cadillac.  What a hotel that was.And what a hotel it's become!  Valet parking was a breeze---people were on the spot and very nice.  Check in is on the second floor.  People at the front desk were outstanding.  Pleasant, informative and a pleasure to deal with.The room was much bigger than I expected.  It has standard Westin appointments with a surprise.  The shower has a rain feature--which I normally don't like--BUT this one is adjustable with an added feature of a uniques hand held to boot.Had a cocktail and appetizers in the lobby bar--very good.  The sports bar was very good...one of the best burgers I have ever had---plus the house made to order chips were great.  Very good service here, too.This is a great hotel, not only for Detroit, it would be great anywhere.  Highly recommended.One of the nicest Westin hotel in the Midwest.  Excellent staff service, rooms are well appointed and the valet service is very reasonable.  All amenities you can expect from Westin!Impressive and much more than I expected!I have stayed at other Westin properties and thought this was going to be a mediocre experience. I was absolutely wrong.Valet was fast, friendly, and hassle free. Check in is on second floor. Customer service at the reception desk was friendly and helpful for recommendations in the surrounding area.Room was bigger than I imagined and very quiet. Didn't hear any noise throughout the nights of our stay.The Roast restaurant is phenomenal! A must try for fine diners. Reservations are a must and usually booked way in advance. If you are unable to obtain a table and don't mind dining at the bar; I highly recommend tasting the wonderfully fused foods!My overall experience was superb and I would definitely stay at this property again. Highly recommended!I don't know where to start. My experience at the Weston Book has not been favorable. Small things like food underneath the dresser in plan site, that hadn't been vacuumed up. Being woken up at 8:30 in the morning by a maid, who has the subtleties of Sherman tank.The room looks inward onto a roof top with A/C units, which by the way are on all day and night. Yes you can hear them. Small and petty is may next issue, Wifi is 7 bucks a day. Are you kidding me! The room cost close to $200 a night and you can't provide free Wi-Fi. I can afford the seven dollars a day, it's just the general idea of having all these little extra charges. It's almost seems like they're not satisfied with me choosing there hotel, so they need to constantly let me know that they want more money. If you want more money you just add the extra seven dollars a day to the price of the room. Why 7 dollars? There must be at least 100 guest within a week at  this hotel. If everyone paid seven dollars for one days use that's like two years of Wi-Fi. I'm only here for three days.I'm almost afraid to go down to the lobby because I have no idea how my ""incidental"" charges will be affected.I have no doubt that when I booked my reservation through the travel site, hidden in one of these contracts or agreements there is a Wi-Fi clause. I'll just have to make sure that I have produce of all of my documentation and contracts so when I show up at the front desk I can present my case as a guest of the Westin.Next time I come I will try another place. It's no big deal. Your hotel looks amazing and i love the beds, but really it is just so so.I just arrived home from a trip to Detroit with my husband. I must write to say what a wonderful stay we had at this hotel. The staff blew us away on their professionalism. From the front desk to the coffee shop and the 24 Grill staff we were treated with such great care. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.Thank you once at again Westin Book Cadilac for allowing the crew at Events To Remember Event Production and Design, LLC to set up a wonderful wedding at your facility this Sunday.  As usual your staff there was outstanding!  Jeremy the banquet houseman made sure that each and every one of our needs where met during set up.  We were required to flip the ceremony space into a reception space in 45 minutes and it went flawlessly due to the team effort between our staff and yours! We were done within 35 minutes!  Way to go!   Apryl , Mohammed and the bartender Wesley were so awesome to work with, very pleasant and kind people as well as the security staff on the dock. We thank you all so very much and can't wait for the chance to work with you all again!I stayed at other so called ""High End Hotels"" in Detroit, they're noisy and slightly unprofessional, If you're looking for first class hotel that treats you right, come here and only here!I booked this place for my anniversary, first off check in was pleasant, we told them it was our anniversary and they bumped our room up to a nicer room, (no extra charge) we went swimming and came back to a complementary bottle of champagne, and fruit. Cant tell you how much we appreciated that!The room was large and spacious, the bathroom had two  separate showers and rain spout overhead. beautiful tile work throughout. It was so quiet in our room, i didn't hear a peep. Things could not be better. Thanks Westin Book Cadillac, you have a fan for life.We stayed at the Book Cadillac for one night. We were in the Detroit area visiting family and were catching a game at Comerica Park our first night. The hotel is very swanky and beautiful. Our check in was easy and the front desk staff was very friendly. BDK is a Starwood member so our room was on the 21st floor, but when we got there, He thought he smelled residual smoke so he called the front desk and we were moved to a new room....and this time it was a suite on the same floor. The room was nice and spacious and we had a view of the ballpark from our bathroom window. This was a huge deal for me as I am a HUGE baseball fan. We were traveling with a 4 year old and we called for a rollaway bed which arrived promptly and appeared to be very comfortable. My favorite part of the room was the bed. Oh my goodness that bed! The linens were nice, the pillows were comfy, and the mattress was the right mix of firm and soft....sounds like a contradiction. The bathroom was very large: tub and a separate glassed in shower with a rainwater shower head. The only negative was that the vanity was very small.  We only stayed one night so it wasn't a huge deal. But for a longer stay it would be problematic as I tend to travel with quite a few toiletries. The location could not be beat! We were able to walk to Comerica and the following day we walked down to the river walk. One more thing, the doorman when we arrived was very friendly and very helpful with directions. As for value, I can't say. We got the room on Starwood points.We've stayed at just about every moderate to upscale hotel downtown and this was the cleanest, quietest, and best maintained hotel by far. Truly a luxury bathroom for the ladies. They've done a beautiful job of restoring this historic building.After eating at Michael Symon's Roast restaurant for dinner, I now can't stay there is any better romantic getaway downtown. The bed really is heavenly as advertised.The Book Cadillac is the nicest hotel in Detroit.  It has a great gym with a lap pool, a beautiful lobby bar and an elegant entrance.  That doesn't really tell the story...The Book Cadillac was the largest luxury hotel in downtown Detroit, until it fell to the forces that brought down many of Detroit's great buildings.  In this case the building was saved via a truly stunning renovation.  From the history display in the lobby, they took the building all the way down to the cement/rebar supports and rebuilt everything.  Its amazing to see.  If you just look at it as a nice Westin, you're missing how impressive this building really is.The rooms are spacious and everything about them is comfortable and well laid out.  But its far more amazing when you consider that at one point the first floor was under water from the roof.Downtown for a wedding here and overnight stay. I remember this hotel from when I worked downtown in 1982 and would come for lunch. The redo is spectacular! We had a lovely room on the 21st floor with peeks of the river and bridge from the window. Room was expansive, bathroom is large with a European style shower, beds were warm and comfy with lots of pillows to suit your preference. The wedding in the Crystal Ballroom was beautiful, the dinner and desserts (and late night pizza) tasty and filling. Breakfast this morning in the Boulevard Room was also fresh and special: Egg White omelette filled with Turkey, Cheese and Arugula with a side salad of Arugula, Avocado, the most finely diced Tomato on earth, and a delicious hollandaise slightly sweetened with OJ (try it for sure!) . Hands down and easily five start without hesitation. Well done Detroit!Great experience staying here.  I was in town for a conference for a few days and stayed at the Weston.  It's a in a great location, just a short walk from the Cobo, as well as Greektown, Mexicantown, and Corktown.  The amenities are great too.  My room was spacious and had a huge bathroom.  It's a classy joint, and if I'm in town again, I'd definitely consider staying there again.This hotel is very, very nice. To put it in perspective when my taxi driver drove up to drop me off he let out a low whistle and told me, ""Dang girl! These are some nice digs!"" If only I had such a way with words.The beds are so soft I could have slept for days without leaving. Or maybe that was because of the blackout curtains? I don't know for sure. What I do know for sure is that the bathroom was so big you could have fit at least a dozen of Santa's Little Helpers (yes, I'm talking elves) in there comfortable for a disco dance party. And with the dual shower head two of them could have even taken a shower at the same time. Luckily I didn't have to share and the double water flow was all mine.Room service was friendly and prompt. There is both a restaurant and a coffee shop attached to the hotel. And a cab stand is right out front. If you find yourself in need of a hotel in Downtown Detroit I doubt you could do better for yourself. Scouts honor.Probably the nicest hotel in Detroit and conveniently located to the numerous seedy downtown hot spots.  The rooms at the Book Cadillac are nice and seem to average a little over $200 per night.  Each night that you choose to sleep in your own filth and not have your room cleaned will earn you a $5 coupon.  This is enough to cover a large coffee and pastry or egg sandwich at the WBC coffee place located within the hotel.  Perhaps the biggest draw, though, is the hotel's history.  JFK and Harry Truman stayed at the Book (not together, I don't think) as did Babe Ruth.  It's the place where an ill Lou Gerhig told his manager that he could not play anymore.  The hotel, which opened in 1924, was as vacant as the Book Tower across the street for many years until it received an extensive rehab and reopened in 2008.  Unfortunately, the grand staircase and lobby did not survive the renovation, but at least two ballrooms were recreated to appear as they originally did.The Book does have a few downsides, though.  The post-renovation lobby is sterile and small: don't expect the Palmer House.  Also, they charge nearly $8 a day for Internet: what's next, $3 a day for air? If you don't want to pay for Internet, it is free in 30 minute blocks in the lobby, but don't drink there, as a martini will run about $13.50.The Hotel itself is clean and accommodating.  Appears to be very popular and with it comes a potential long wait at Check-in, which by the way is on the 2nd floor. Only 1 small sign indicating.  Valet personnel could have said something as we arrived.  Which by the way is the main reason the only get 2 stars.  Called 10 minutes prior to check out, got outside and had to wait another 20 minutes while others walked out handed their slip to the attendee and got their vehicle within 5 minutes.  Kept asking, they just said its on the way.  No apologies and seemed upset when I didn't tip.  Change your Valet company!I ordered room service and the steak tasted like leather. I have a food allergy, so I requested a small side salad instead of the fries- I received a small, sad looking bowl of lettuce and dressing and they charged me an additional $13.50. The bathtub had a curly black hair in it- I have blonde hair, so it most certainly did not belong to me. The fire alarm went off at 7:00 AM EST (I am from the West Coast, so this was a rude awakening that set me up for a rough day), I then got locked in the stairwell and ended up outside in my PJ's in negative temperatures. To top it off, I went to print a document for my meeting in the business center and the printer ""wasn't working."" The beds were comfortable, but not comfortable enough to make me endure this hotel again- I won't be back.On my very first business trip, my firm sent me to Detroit.  I was hoping for NYC or Chicago if I had to jet to the East Coast (in the winter!) but was nevertheless excited to travel for work.  I would've become a flight attendant if I didn't care about making the minimum wage or mind modern-day slavery.  Trial lawyer, it is.Anyway, I stayed at the Westin for two nights in December.  Let me just say that I completely forgot 1) I was in Detroit; 2) there's nothing to do (except work, of course); and 3) the downtown is scary even though I grew up in a ghetto.  This is the best hotel in Motor City.  It offers everything you could possibly want, including a bed for a king, a gym and spa, antibiotic cream in the middle of the night, and the best restaurant in the city (Roast).I haven't experienced many luxury hotels--unless you count wandering through the seven-star hotel in Milano--but the Westin was perfect for business.  Let it be known that I'm happy to visit Detroit anytime, as long as I can eat at Roast while I'm there.My only complaints are that the water pressure was terrible and the service in the breakfast area made me wonder why I didn't run to an egg mcmuffin at McDonald's instead.  Other than that, it's worth every penny my firm paid.","One of my favorite hotels in the world. They did a wonderful job bringing the building back to life. Convenient to Comerica Park - the main reason I go to Detroit - and other bars and restaurants nearby.  Hang out in the Motor Bar during baseball season. You're likely to bump into players from the opposing team, and all the bartenders are friendly and awesome. Well appointed rooms and they'll give you an upgrade if they can, just ask. The corner rooms on the upper floors are gigantic and have wonderful views along with double shower heads. Beautiful indoor pool area downstairs. The staff is always helpful and happy to cater to your every whim.Stayed here May 17-18 2014 and would totally go back again.Pros:Super cleanComfy bedHuge suite (1 king bed with small seating area, desk area and large bathroom)Ordered room service; had steak frites, and it was very quickly delivered and tastyConvenient Starbucks in lobby, when in-room coffee isn't enoughValet service was easy and fast to retrieve my car when checking outStaff signed me up for SPG so I could get the free wi-fiSuper close walking to the waterfront and Greektown and I walked up to the DIA and Cass corridor too. A bit of a hike but easy to get around.Staff; doorperson, valet attendant and check in desk staff were all very polite and professionalCons:Check in time was a little long, but no major complaints. Arrived the same time as a large family attending a function so about 10 parties ahead of me, no big dealWithout being an SPG members you have to pay for wi-fi, which I think is ridiculous this day in ageAte at Roast, one of the restaurants in the hotel, and despite rave reviews it's only okay. I suspect, after eating other places around town, it might actually be one of the fancier places.I didn't like the shampoo/soap, too dryingMotor bar was pretty quiet and boring but would be okay to get a quick drinkAs a result of my stay here I'm booking into another Westin for my next out of town weekend.Enjoyed my stay here, they put me in a room next to the elevator but when I requested a different room they upgraded me to a suite which was very nice. Also, they have a concierge lounge (with eggs for breakfast!) which isn't a given at Westin properties. Location is decent but dodgy at night. Much nicer and newer than the Marriott Ren Cen though.I stayed here for a night this past weekend after a less than stellar experience the night before at another establishment in the city.  While I doubt that I'll be adding anything new to the discussion of this place, I really can't say enough about the Hotel. This was my second time staying here and it's just an all around amazing property.  The rooms themselves are the best I've seen at any Westin and are also extremely spacious as well as sleek.  The cost is pretty reasonable for what I'd say is the nicest hotel in the City as well.  You really can't beat the location either, as this is about as centrally located as you can get in the City of Detroit.  Staying at the Book Cadillac also offers the most painless experience regarding catching a cab in the City (which in my experience is not always easy in Detroit) as they're generally waiting right out in front of the Hotel. My only minor gripe would be the additional charges for internet access (even in the lobby!).  However, this seems to be par for the course for any Westin property that I've stayed at in the past as, so it wasn't entirely surprising.  Regardless, I will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in Detroit.Very Comfortable, and pet friendly...I stayed there for one night with my family and we brought a medium sized dog with us. And was delighted when the Hotel was willing to accommodate all of us, (for a fee, understandably). They provided a nice little dog bed for our pet, which was very nice of them.We only stayed there for one night, so we didn't get to experience all of the amenities of the hotel, however, the beds were comfortable and the room was clean, which was all we needed. The Hotel is located at a very nice area, right in front there was a small park were we could walk our dog, and the People Mover station is also across the street, so there is no need to bother the Valet Parking attendants whenever you want to move through Downtown Detroit.Overall, it was a great experience.If this hotel were anywhere else but on a seriously dead street in the middle of Detroit, it would definitely get 5 stars.While it's super nice and clean, and our junior suite was ENORMOUS had 2 tvs and an OUT of this world bathroom, there were a couple of things that just knocked the stars off.First) the parking....we had to valet and the valets took a little while to get the car...just an inconvenience more than anything else.2nd) When we asked about where to find a breakfast place in walking distance, the valet sent us on a wild goose chase to a dive in the middle of a particularly dodgy part of Detroit(across from the Bus depot.)  My PIC and I could only be described as WASPy so being led that far astray was really bothersome.Good restaurants and bars inside (we had  a Matthew Stafford sighting) but I think there is some room for improvement with the staff.Great room, comfy bed, clean interior, but the worst valet service experienced in a long time... 45 min for a van, in the morning... Lucky we didn't have a flight to catch or else we (10+ people) would all have been looking to rebook... Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the people who work in valet at this hotel... I'm just blaming the system or the process of which they pull up vehicles... I would definitely try to call valet from your room and see if they can start to pull up your car... I mean, 45 mins in cold weather isn't fun (yes, we all could have waited inside, but again with all our luggage already outside; we didn't expect to wait 45 minutes)Quite comfy and well appointed.  There is a strange tension between being fancy and attempting ""go green"" here.  For example, they have double shower heads, with a note showing how to turn one off to save water.The restaurant, Roast, is not your normal hotel fare; worth a visit!Ok, so...if you need to stay Downtown Detroit, THIS is your place. No need to look further, promise. Snag a rate on one of the booking engines, rack up those SPG points and have yourself a little roll in the (extra comfy plush) hay. Beats Ren Cen by a MILE. *The digs be straight-up plush...and NOT just because this is Detroit. This is one of the nicest Westins in all the land. Clean, contemporary, well-appointed. Large bathrooms, room to breathe. And sleep. And...well, whatever you'd like to do!*Staff (from doormen to checkout) were kind, courteous and helpful. The concierge even ""tweeted"" at me when I checked in via Yelp to make sure I was taken care of if I need anything. Well, hello social media wizards, indeed. *Rate was reasonable: King Standard Room, $179 + taxes. *Complimentary bottle of water and Starbucks coffee in room. *Attached to hotel: WBC coffee bar (yayyyy!), Roast Restaurant, gift shop and parking structure. *Cab stand DIRECTLY out the front door, with plentiful cabs ready to whisk you where ever you might need to go. Obviously, Westins are known for their comfyass beds, and this did not disappoint. Despite only utilizing 10 percent of the King bed, it was comforting JUST to know that I could sleep in any direction I saw fit. Or add 16 friends. But ok, it was just me...but I slept like a rock. Flawless hotel stay. I'll be back.Old world class rarely survives in a downtown's hurried, slick climate. The Westin Book Cadillac is a glamorous gem Detroit deservedly is proud of, standing testament to a genteel time when men held doors open for ladies, going out for dinner called for gloves, and everyone swanned around in black tie formal after 4PM.Hard to believe four foot snowdrifts had the interior to themselves just a few years ago. Harder still to believe Detroiters aren't reclaiming more of their iconic downtown buildings and renovating them into splendid palaces of the old and new. But I dream...Truly the Book Cadillac is something special. I attended a wedding for friends here held in the Boulevard Room but neglected to stay at the hotel due to financial constraints. How I wish I had. Nonetheless, I had the pleasure of enjoying the interior, the services, and heavenly Roast. At first surprised they arranged for the ceremony in the hotel, arriving in the atrium answered my tacit questions in one go. Some hotels are flashy and California luxurious. The Westin simmers with quiet sophistication that awes, but never isolates or overwhelms. Polished floors and wooden accents surround the common rooms, and intense, unobtrusive service from the staff never intrudes upon the event or your stay. The kitchen and events group produced all the aperitifs and beverages beautifully, managing the dishes and exchanging bottles without interfering in mingling conversations. The Toronto Maple Leafs and the Pittsburgh Penguins both stayed at the hotel during the wedding, but you would barely know it other than riding up with members of the organizations in the elevators or escalators. I caught a glimpse of some notable names, not saying who. Discretion still ruled the day and we all felt like kings for the attention received. Drawbacks for the events occurred with miscommunication or problems at the reception at Roast and the hotel reducing number of reserved rooms in the hotel block for the wedding guests and party. Arranging to expand the block in a sold out hotel was a logistics headache capable of leveling an aurochs (MOO) but we had a hard-headed, determined planner who bulled her way through until the issue was grudgingly reconciled.   Parking in the adjacent garage was fine, but a pain in the winter, I'm sure. Not a great deal is down here but other Yelpers, note that Lafayette and American Coney Islands -- two of the most infamous coneys in the city with a near Hatfield-McCoy relationship due to a family feud -- deserve to be visited!Great hotel with great amenities and very friendly staff. Walking to Comerica Park. Walked to and from the Tigers baseball game with several others. Staff was accommodating and helpful. Walking distance to The Ham Shoppe where we had omlettes. Toast and grits for $5. Would definitely stay there again if ever in Detroit.If you are visiting Detroit, stay here !!  The hotel is a beautiful historic building that offers modern amenities throughout.  The rooms are perfect for a business trip or a family vacation.The location is perfect for nearby Tigers Stadium.   Michael Symon Roast is one of the food choices within the hotel, and ironically enough Roast was the best meal I had while visiting Detroit.I will be staying at this hotel every time I visit Detroit, complete no brainer.Awesome hotel in a pretty awesome town. Stayed here for a week and I have to say, this is a great hotel. Very cool, great location and a pretty decent bar. The fitness center is really nice as well!spacious, well appointed rooms.  the downtown location is perfect if you're heading to detroit for a baseball or football game.  ""lafayette coney island"" (a local sit-down, fast food institution)  is practically across the street.  got a great rate off priceline and will definitely be back.  skip the retooled &amp; overpriced starbuck's clone (""wbc coffee"") in the lobby and walk a few blocks to ""the roasting company"" for a MUCH BETTER cup of coffee.rooms feature large lcd tvs, complimentary bottled water &amp; in-room starbuck's coffee.  top notch accommodations, VERY nice showers and super comfy beds.  staff was extremely friendly &amp; helpful.  i ate elsewhere, but i'm told that the restaurant (""roast"") has great local food, along with impressive wine, beer and spirits selections.  really a good stay!!!The only hotel I stay in when in Detroit.Gotta say this was one of the worst ""Westin"" experiences I've ever had.  NO, let's say it was THE worst.  Never stayed at a Westin that wouldn't be a 5-star review from me.  Should have known at 4:30 p.m. the check-in line had over 20 people waiting.  Slow check-in services.  People were waiting up to 2 hours for their rooms. Heard another couple yelling at front desk because they were waiting over 45 minutes for their luggage to be deliverd.  With all that said,  loved my room.  Loved the bed, etc. - but this place HAS to start living up to the whole ""Westin"" experience.  Then after assuring me the night before, how easy it was to get a taxicab when i'd be leaving, there was not ONE in site that morning.  Such a perfect ending.  Don't think i'll be back to this place.  Ever.Got my reservation wrong and wouldn't do anything for me to make up. Room was small, unlike the pictures.This was a very beautiful hotel when i stayed several years ago, the room i stayed in was $250 a night and it was very spacious and it had a large queen size bed with a huge 42"" flat screen inch television and plenty of outlets available to enjoy your electronics..this is a 5-star hotel and i ordered room service when i got their and it was great the staff is very attentive to all your needs!The Westin Book Cadillac was not my hotel of choice, as I'm used to staying at the MGM Grand. The WBC is 3 blocks away from Cobo though, so it saves you the time of waiting for a cab, as you can walk it if the weather permits.The building is beautiful, and when you walk in, you're on the ground floor (Level 1) which holds the Roast Restaurant (separate review). Take the escalators or elevators up to Level 2 for front desk/registration. Service was really friendly. I was in a King Suite with a full living room, desk, couch, coffee table. The bedroom and bathroom were a good size. Things I loved: - You can forgo housekeeping and get a $5 credit each night or 500 Starwood points to your account. Go green!- Comfy bed.- They have a separate trash can for recycling!- Two shower heads, one is turned off to save water, but you can turn it on yourself (if you're over 5'1"" - I couldn't reach!)- Room service was always early or right on time, and good!- Large LG plasma in bedroom and living room. You can set it as an alarm so you can wake up to your TV, instead of an annoying alarm.- Nice, roomy gym with treadmills, ellipticals, weights and weight machines, all the latest and greatest with individual TVs. 24 hour key card access!- Everyone was really nice.Things that could use improvement:- My desk lamp didn't work.- WiFi is expensive, starts at like $10/24 hours.- No liquid soap. Shampoo and conditioner, but only bar soap.- A/C unit was loud when it turned on and off. I just left the heater in the bedroom on and cranked up the one in the living room and left my bedroom door open.- Hotel was a bit confusing. Registration on 2nd floor, gym on 1st.- Not cheap, but super close, 3-block walking distance from Cobo Center.I spend more than a third of my life in hotels, and this is one of my favorites. Perfect location, very nice rooms, friendly service, Roast on-site, a weekday club lounge with good breakfast, and consistently great treatment of SPG Platinum members make the Book stand out from other Westin properties. The only downside is the Boulevard Room restaurant, which is the only breakfast option on weekends (or if you aren't on the club floor). But the Boulevard Room's consistently and appallingly slow service can't detract from this otherwise great property.","['hotel', 'downtown', 'never', 'wrong', 'book', 'everything', 'downtown',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/mgm-grand-detroit-detroit,MGM Grand Detroit,3.5,$$$,149,"I've said for awhile that casinos match the personality of the people that go to it. MGM can be seen as 'the classy one' or 'the snooty one' depending on your view. Inside it's nice and spacious. Plenty of room for the games and slots. Bars and restaurants litter the outside (bring back The blue room!) and the main bar/entertainment area is in the middle of it all.  This part is the newest addition/renovation and in all truth needs more space. Even on the slower days there's never really a good spot to be, even the one spot always roped off for VIPs isn't something to brag about.The restaurants are all nice in their own way. Tap room is okay for sports watchers but there are better options in the downtown area. Buffet is pretty good from what I remember and Wolfgang Steak is a great place to be.Upstairs, there's a poker room and a nightclub/ sushi bar which both are fine for its purpose. The fire pits in the nightclub can get insanely hot and most of the seats are right along it. Maybe not the best decision (or maybe the increase of drink sales is GENIUS!) could go either way.I'm not much of a gambler (read: tightwad) but they seem to have a good selection of games here. I can't speak on payouts, but my friends have mostly come away in the black so I guess that's good.Having tried the other two on earlier visits to Michigan (and when I used to live in the area), I found them a bit dingy and smokey.  Sometimes I'm into that sort of thing.  But others, I want a casino that makes me feel classy.  Walking into the MGM in Detroit, it felt like a casino that is trying for something better (because MGM does their casinos right in my experience).  This is the swanky casino in Detroit.  I'm glad I finally found it! First of all, they have a dedicated non-smoking room.  While I did not choose to use it (and ended up smelling like, well, a casino from using the blackjack tables), this was definitely a great perk.But the main reason I love this place is that they have a party pit with $1 blackjack on weekends.  It has the usual .25 cent surcharge a hand for that sort of thing (though I found this a handy hand counter) but it was an amazing way to spend a lot of time at a blackjack table with a friendly and knowledgeable dealer.  The weird thing about this is that most people were betting the regular minimum ($15 when I was there) to avoid the charge.  I was betting $5 a hand and finished about $20 (instead of $25 without the surcharge) ahead.Since I am waiting for the freebies for signing up at the new MGM near Washington D.C. when it opens this year as a ""new"" player, I did not get a player card.  But they are tied into the mLife network across the world.  So if you ever find yourself with an occasion to visit this casino, do it!  Ignore the Detroit in the name if you have to since this place is a clean and shiny MGM casino all the way!This review will be on the hotel, casino, and spa only. Restaurants are reviewed separately. I stayed here for several nights in November 2015 for a conference. Pros: the place is CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!  The rooms are large and spacious and the beds soft and comfy. Housekeeping is wonderful and the attention to detail is noted! A nice perk is that they offer free newspapers, water, and coffee bar for all guests. The spa is wonderful! Nice clean gym and spa with sauna, vapor bath with steam, and pool (shallow) not good for laps. I loved the gym and spa so much I went every day instead of the casino.The casino: FYI I am not a casino gambler. However- It would be more appealing if the cigarette smoke was less. The have 1 small nonsmoking room with slots only. I am sensitive to smoke and I could not even watch others play poker because the smoke was so bad. Location: I understand this place was built in an area to revitalize an area of down town Detroit. However I walked around every day and  there was not much close outside the hotel to see or do within walking distance, There is the ""people mover"" rail a short walk which one can assess. The staff are all very nice and friendly and accommodating in every way. Nice hotel.I came here for a 3 day conference that hosted about 100 attendees. This hotel and casino is very spacious. In speaking with some of the staff it was newly built in 2009 and great attention to detail. I stayed in a Luxury King room on the 15th floor, clean and spacious. Beds were luxuriously soft as were the pillows. They offer a turn down service as well. Everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The marble bathrooms were pristine, along with a TV in the bathroom, and Bose speakers. I did appreciate that they did not sacrifice on lower end acoustics! I did notice is that the clock radio and room radio was not upgraded to accommodate an iPhone 5 port, really not an issue, I just happened to notice it. The only other thing that was a little off to me is that there was not coffee maker in the room, you had to go down to the lobby where there was a full coffee/bar self service area. Again, a non issue to me, I got my coffee after I left the gym/spa. I do have to say it was a good regular cup of coffee! Every morning I did indulge in the pool/spa/fitness area. The fitness area is the best hotel gym I have been to. Roomy and all equipment is present, including mats to do floor work. I was able to get in a pilates workout in by watching it on my phone. The infinity pool is a huge saltwater pool (a little cool for my liking) The women's area is heavenly as well, there is a large Jacuzzi as well as a sauna that has eucalyptus aromatherapy pumped in. I actually showered in the showers there because I like the scent of the shampoo and conditioner better that what was provided in the rooms. The hotel service was impeccable, very professional and friendly. We were fed by the hotel for most of our meals including a Gala dinner, the food was well prepared and fresh! My coworkers and I walked the Casino a few times, it was also neat and clean, but like all casinos too smokey. We ate at a couple of places in the casino, I'll review those as well! Overall I had a pleasant stay at the MGM Grand, and if my travels bring me to Detroit again, I would make this my choice hotel.One of the only places in Detroit that I enjoy.  I love the hotel rooms and the bars. I do not like that the casino has indoor smoking.  I would have given them 5 stars if they were a non-smoking casino.  I do like that it is not too far from Windsor, Ontario, Canada.I'm a casino lover. Not a big gambler, but there's something about the lights, sounds, and energy in the air. The parking is very easy with an attached parking structure or there is the option to valet. I feel like a lot of casinos have similar aspects.What sets this place apart is that they have an amazing buffet (called Palette), which you can pay for with comps. It's around 40 per person, but it has something for everyone. I didn't even notice the smoke smell in the eating areas - they keep it well ventilated.Another bonus is that they have a Starbucks inside so you can get your caffeine fix then start bidding high! Right across from Starbucks they have The Clear, which is the smoke free gambling section. It's walled off with glass, but guests have a tendency to cut through it rather than walk around. I find that distracting and bothersome.Overall the casino is relatively clean and there is something for everyone. From food options and clubs to live music. It's a great night out.Very spacious and holds the brand name well with different selections to play, but from the lackluster security guards to the somewhat unimpressive games this casino didn't exactly jump out at me.Played for about 30 minutes and left to go explore downtown and Windsor; perhaps I am used to a bit more finess and class when it comes to casinos.This is about the casino, not hotel.Went at 3 p.m. on a Sunday and it was just lovely! Not crowded or smoky, plenty of available slot machines, and after 3 hours I left down about $10 - can't beat that for a day of slots! The bathrooms were not the cleanest although they were modern looking. I have been in the evening when it's much more crowded and not at all the same lovely experience as during the day, guess I will become a day gambler ;)Every local we asked suggested the MGM Casino, so we followed the local's advice.  We walked out with just a little more cash than we walked in with and had fun.I am on my way out of state and forgot to cash the paper ticket before I left a week ago. I went to the security desk and told him I just needed the ticket machine to cash out. One of the guards walked me to it and walked me back to the exit because he knew I was in a hurry. Way better service than any other casino in this area!I'm not down to clown at the MGM Grand.THE GOOD: I like to start things out positive out there, I'm no hater. This facility is my favorite casino in Detroit. It's the no bullshit, no theme, no crazy scents being pumped in (motor city), modern building (unlike Greektown), with great ventilations (I'm non smoker). The Casino floor is great, and is very exciting on the weekend. I've been to this casino several times, and dropped some great coin here. They are poopy on the comps compared to greektown. After losing a few hundred bones, I don't even have enough to comp my ass a cheese burger at the Breeze. THE BAD:Lemme tell you about tonight. I've been a little weary of the MGM Detroit, as a blackjack player. I've had way better luck at Greektown and even Motor City. But at MGM Detroit, I just can't make a dollar. Tonight, I decided to try the ""party pit."" The party pit is a nice feature, where you can play black jack at any level up to $1.00 under the table minimum for a .25 cent commission. It's great in that it lets you play a while, have a beer, talk to other gambling addicts, etc. Unfortunately, the other people at these tables will NEVER know how to play blackjack even remotely. I'm not being a stickler, but if you don't know not to give 17 against a  dealer 5, theres a problem. The dealers at the ""party pit"" suck nuts too. They are either the new dealers learning the game, or they are the dealers that are so poor, they are about to get fired, and have to prove themselves by dealer to people playing for a dollar. Tonight, our dealer ""Yao"" took 35 minutes to shuffle/count the cards prior to playing-- whatever, it's their process. But after that, their stupid auto-shufflers didn't work so I had to watch this poor bastard shuffle his cards thirty ways to sunday by hand taking more time. I probably watched this guy play with the cards for 45 minutes before I even got to bet. By the time the game finally started, I didn't even want to be at the casino anymore. Furthermore, this dealer didn't even know the game. It is sad when the entire table has to tell the dealer when he hits/doesn't, pays/doesn't because he is not understanding of the rules. I ended up leaving with a loss of $40.00. That's nothing, chunk change. I'm not mad about the money I lost, but I'm disappointed I didn't have a good time. I'd rather lose four times that at Greektown but have a good time in the process. This is not the first negative experience I've had at this place. I'll probably be back because TAPS is pretty cool, and I have a gambling problem and like to switch up where I play every now and then. Hopefully while on the way back to MGM i get hit by lightning or something that will otherwise remind me of this bad experience. Just not a good time. Would rather have put that $40.00 towards my buddy Scotty's home made adult toy collection and have something to show for it.This was the first time I've been to this Casino in Detroit.  I've been to Las Vegas, and also other casinos in Michigan, so I am aware of the huge differences.We got a corner suite on the 16th floor in the hotel.  It was a very beautiful room!  I loved the layout... Two bathrooms, a beautiful sofa, amazing and modern furniture, and the view of Detroit was nothing short of breathtaking.  The bathroom had the deepest tub I've ever seen in a hotel.  I love tubs! :). The shampoos and soaps were lovely, and we had plenty of towels.The bed....as amazing as it looked, was horrible!  When I laid down, it felt like I was in a bowl.  My feet were actually higher up than the rest of my body, and I sunk down in the center.  Not cool.  Maybe I'm totally spoiled by my own bed?  I don't know, but for the price of the suite, it should have had a comfy bed.  The room was very clean, and in room breakfast was delicious!  The casino was surprisingly smokey.  I understand you can smoke, but for all the money they put into the hotel, they should have had a better ventilation system. The servers were scarce, so having a drink while gambling was impossible, but there were a lot of tables and slots.  I won a bit, so that was fun :)This hotel was a lot closer to a hotel in Vegas than what the norm is in Michigan.  I really enjoyed it there and will be back.I was in town for a hockey game. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the arena. You hear a lot of things about Detroit, but I have to say that I really enjoyed my visit. The hotel room was very nice, and clean. The staff is friendly and very courteous - felt like a VIP for the weekend. The central bar has a good cigar collection at reasonable prices.How to celebrate a birthday/anniversary/accomplishment/anythingcool in the cold winter of Detroit: Step 1: Pull up to MGM hotel's free valet area and pretend like you are staying at the hotel.  Everyone does this.  Just act cool.  Leave your coats in the car b/c you'll be inside the whole night!  Step 2: Depending on how nice of an experience you are looking for, start the night off fancy with a steak dinner at Wolfgang Puck or sushi at Ignite, or a casual dinner at Tap. Step 3: Hang out in the casno.  Let the food digest in your stomach as you people-watch.  Step 4: Party at V Nightclub.  If it's just a couple or a few of you, then get in line and pay a $10-$20 cover.  If there are 10-20 of you, call a week beforehand and make a reservation for bottle service.  It's worth it because your party won't have to pay cover.  Just make sure if you want everyone to chip in, COMMUNICATE that to people in your party.  Ends up being around $40-$50 per person, including gratuity.  Step 5: PAR-TAY. Step 6: Do you have a designated driver?  If yes, have the hotel valet pull your car around, tip 'em, and be on your merry way home after a fun night.  If no, then consider getting a room at MGM hotel for the night.I have been here mostly for work related events, and have always had a good time.I'm not a big gambler, but there's plenty of stuff going, and the rooms were nice.I would go back.I'm not some famous rich person like Mick Jagger, but this was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.  The rooms are huge, with probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on.  The elevator was always there within a few seconds.  The room was absolutely spotless as well.  The coffee machine down on the first floor was also the coolest coffee / espresso machine I've ever seen in my life.  Great coffee and espresso at the touch of a button.  The staff was also incredibly service oriented, every one of them.  So why not five stars? So why will I never return even though I visit Detroit regularly?  First, I was told by the front desk staff that using the valet service was mandatory because the casino would not allow me to bring my luggage through the gaming area, which is the only way to the hotel from the regular parking deck.  Valet service is a hassle because you need to remove the things from your car you prefer not to have stolen before handing your keys over.  Next, I want my coffee in the room so I don't have to go get dressed first.  If I was dressed the way I normally am dressed when I fetch my coffee, I'd certainly be arrested by the vice squad right in front of their wonderful Java machine for disturbing the peace for excessive frumpiness and stupid looking boxers on parade for all to see.  It's a damn shame because I love this hotel, but no coffee in the room is a deal breaker for me.  Calling room service for coffee is absurd as well.  I don't want to see another human being before I have my coffee and I don't want to pay $20 including room service charges and tip for room service coffee.  Next time I visit Detroit, I'll go to a Quality Inn or Super 8 because they have coffee in the room and I don't need to worry about someone calling the police on me for how I'm dressed when I pour and drink my coffee.Not as nice as the MGM in Vegas. Lacks the class.Good:1: Quite big.2: High ceilings.3: Friendly staff.4: Self park close to casino.Bad:1: Signage could be better: hard to find you way around.2: Bathrooms not cleaned well / often enough.by far the worse casino ever! money stealers ! i've been going to this casino for so long, me and my friends, and since last year we swore not to ever go again and we haven't. motor city pays out so much more and makes it worth your while!It's not as great as I remember, and I don't think I've been since my last review.  Two good things:  It is pretty well ventilated, so the smoke from smokers isn't too annoying.  There is a tiny smoke-free playing area, but only for slots.  Parking is free, and there is a huge garage, although Tiger fans have discovered this free parking.  Fortunately we arrived on a Wednesday night after an afternoon Tiger game let out.  Plus, it helps when you come with your mom in her SUV with the handicap plate.  We actually found a non-handicap spot across from the door, even though if we would of drove around the bend would have nabbed the handicap spot right next to the door.As always, new players get a $10 credit, but the promo they had last week was ""Bring a new friend and you both get a $10 credit"".  My sister and I got that deal alright.  Needless to say I blew their money pretty quickly, and some of my own.I couldn't find any machines that I play at other casinos (One is a cool Jaws penny slots).  I came with my entire family (minus one sister) to celebrate my mom's 80th.  Go Mom!  We dined at Tap first, which I don't think was here the last time I came.  Not quite the cuisine you'll find at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant, but there is nothing wrong with bar food and beer.","We stayed at the MGM Detroit while visiting for a wedding.  Being from Vegas, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. Happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong. We were greeted with a smile and check in went smoothly.  Our room was on the 17th floor which is the Concierge Level. Rooms on this level include access to the lounge. The lounge serves continental breakfast, light snacks during the day and some heavier snacks in the evening.  The lemon cake was super tasty!Our room was very clean, cutely decorated, and had a nice city view. The bathroom was great but it was missing a bathtub if that is important to you. The shower was huge with standard and rain shower head.  It was extremely quiet (almost too quiet for me - but then I like to sleep with a little white noise). Maids were a little loud during early AM hours but nothing too terrible.  The great thing about this room is that, if you didn't know it, you would not be able to tell that you were sharing a building with a casino. There is very little noise and, best of all, no cigarette smell!!!! We didn't have much time but we couldn't help but to tour the Casino.  It is huge!  Tons of slots. It is clean but very smokey. There were many food options including a Food Court with several different quick dining restaurants.  In addition there is a Buffet and Tavern, as well as, a couple nicer restaurants including two Wolfgang Puck places (Steak and a Pizzeria). The middle was blocked off and I was told it was being remodeled into a restaurant lounge with live entertainment. The High limit room was gorgeous.  It offered our tour a much needed respite from the smoke. This area was very large (almost double the size of most that I've seen).  There were a couple other things that surprised me about the casino. There is a complimentary, self-serve soda fountain and coffee bar on the casino floor which seems like a great idea for thirsty players. Finally, there was a very large non-smoking lounge which featured some reel slots and video poker machines.  All in all, this was a great place to stay and I would definitely book here again when traveling to Detroit.I decided to take my daughter out for an afternoon and she forgot to print off her ID,because she's not 21 yet.We went the into the hotel and then we ask the security guard if we can print off the paper that she needed or See on the phone that she had proper ID to get in that she was 21. I couldn't do that and then I proceeded to ask if he knew were there was a print shop so we can print up her ID so she can get in. We walked away we  didn't yell we didn't do anything that was inappropriate we accept that we couldn't go in and as we were exiting the elevators over the over thm system you can hear this man's saying two women describing me and my daughter was trying to get in to MGM with fake ID to make sure that we left the premesis I find that rude and a inpulse of he wasn't so beastly and fat. Be sure to have proper identification,  or face profiling. So maybe some sensitity training, hospitality training and an attitude readjustment for your security staff is really in order. I will glady take my time and money to greektown or Motorcity from now on. This left such a disgust in my mouth. Yours truly, Someone working in a hospitality field and one POed momma.This is the worst casino I have ever been to. I do not frequent casinos but I do go to casinos once every year or two. Not only is this the worst casino that I have ever been to but it has horrible smoke pilfering through all of the building. Including the non-smoking parts of it as I did work their ballrooms for three days coughing and hacking. I asked eight employees how they felt about the smoking they said it's the worst part of their job.The service from the car attendant, front desk, bell hop, waitress to the casino staff was excellent and made us feel very special.  The grill was excellent.  Our room was very special and oh so comfortable.  Only the slots were naughty!  Without hesitation I highly recommend this establishment.I don't gamble, and service at the bars are super slow and mostly crowded. And don't want to forget to mention that their drinks are overpriced.  I do have fun watching my friends play and get into it with them and always trying to convince them to cash out when they are winning. People that work there spare very nice, and the drink girls that bring the drinks to the gamblers are super slow. And drinks are not good, well maybe because they are free.Worst casino ever first I came all the way from my vacation house in Florida and got in my helicopter and then took my black and red McLaren P1 GTR to the casino hotel. the valet was very bossy and my penthouse suite was so dirty the maid service sucked! and everyone is so bossy and then when I got the casino everyone start staring at me and bar service is horrible they didn't even have my crystal champagne that I pre ordered. Then I demanded a refund and I didn't get one! Then the valet brought the wrong car up and I had to go find my 3.3 million dollar car myself very disappointed and never coming backWe had a terrible experience here. From the moment you pull in, it is a mess. The valet people have no idea what they are doing- there are 4 lanes and all are blocked off totally inefficiently with no notable system (this was a huge issue every time we had to leave or come back). The valet is so overstaffed but no one does anything. How can you have 4 lanes all jammed up and no dedicated lane to drop-offs or departures? We had to reverse maneuver between 3 lanes and 10 cars just to pull out. Once we came to check in, it is overwhelming how smoky it is. This place must have zero ventilation. The stench of cigarettes wafts throughout the entire hotel (including on all the floors, elevators, and ROOMS. This is a NONSMOKING HOTEL. All of my clothes smelled and I felt nauseous the whole time. It seeps into everything and disturbs sleep). During checkin, the reception lady was very pushy about the MGM card, which I found to be inappropriate. This was a horrible start and the tone remained the same- smoky hotel, staff lacks manners entirely, and it was very trashy.Got a quote on a block of rooms for a wedding one day.  Called back three days later to have a letter of agreement sent offer.  Salesperson was excited and said she would send it right over.  Never heard back from her.... Sales manager calls me a few days later and says oh we misquoted.  It's always nice when a bride gets upset because hotel staff doesn't know how to do their jobs.Won't be back.  Thanks for nothing MGMMake sure you have your ID in hand and purse open! men, Take off your hat they don't want you smuggling any contraband up in there! You are not at Motor City Casino so no free night stays and less comps but it is a cleaner more maintained casino in my opinion. Stay away, FAR AWAY from the free pop and coffee! If your at the casino chances are you have a few bucks in your pocket to order a Starbucks (They have one there). Don't be cheap. Just get the Starbucks! I give 4 stars for the rude people in there but if I could kick them out myself they deserve 5.After posting my review I had the opportunity to contact management and speak directly with them regarding my experience at the hotel. They were kind and apologetic which is great to hear after such a bad first impression. We will stay again and see what our next experience is like. I'm hopeful that it will be much better,My favorite of the three Detroit casinos. It has an elegant, Vegas feel to it. There are plenty of slot machines to choose from in all denominations.  There are several areas just dedicated to table gaming.  The buffet is good, not the best I've ever had, but very good. Wolfgang Puck's is inside MGM and the food there is excellent. Try the warm spinach salad and thank me later!  They also have a sports bar called Tap and it's very good as well. They have a decent selection of craft beer and all your standard bar drinks. I had a pasta dish that was very tasty and my friend said her burger was delicious. Any of the restaurants can get busy with the wait up to an hour in the evening for dining.  MGM Grand Detroit is a nice afternoon or evening get away without having to fly to Vegas.Hit the MGM Casino last night and left a winner!!!! Up $13.00....This place is beautiful....everything you could wish for and more.This review is for the hotel only. We had a good deal on a room for a batchelorette party. So this review is based more on the room than the price.First, there is free valet, well free not including tip. If you are anti-tipping there is also a free garage. There is a staff member checking keys in order to enter the hotel lounge. The lounge itself is very nice and includes a self serve coffee station which several of our group appreciated the next morning. The room is a standard size, simple decor. The bathroom was a good size and had a separate door for the toilet. When you have a group of women, these things are important. Which brings me to the most imporant aspect of the room: the bed. MGMs are fluffy and comfortable. While not special or unique experience, it covered everything we needed.This is the best casino in Detroit. My husband took me here last night for my birthday and I won $1200 playing the $1 wheel of fortune!  It was great:). Happy bday to me!My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary in September. We were surprised at how nice the rooms are and the view.  We're staying in the luxury room again.  I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The staff is always very nice and courteous . Will be making this a weekend getaway more often.   Love this place.The hotel reservation was a mess... When we checked in it took them about 30 minutes to get everything straightened out. The girl had to ask for a manager stating that there was an issue mind you I had confirmed the reservation a couple of days ahead of time. I was then told that the hotel had over booked and that they were trying to find me a room. They did find a comparable room that was handicapped which was fine. However the presentation of the room the rep made it sound like I was lucky to be getting it. I had booked a couple if months in advance so I didn't feel I was lucky to be getting it. How was it my fault the hotel overbooked doe the night? What else was I supposed to do?? The customer service was lacking for sure. This encounter  didn't create an overall good feeling of the overall experience. Showing up for a bachelorette party to be presented with we are overbooked was stressful! I used the valet parking the night before so on check out when they brought my car up I noticed there was what appeared to be ashes on my seat. Being a non smoker and the car only being a few months old I was quite perplexed with the findings in my car. There was more of these ash like findings on the rubber located on driver side window inside the car. Gave the appearance that my car was smoked in! Not an overall good experience in either of these areas!I must preface by saying I am not a gambler, or smoker.  I am writing this review for those who have not been to a Detroit casino and are deciding which one to choose.  I say MGM.  I think he restaurant and bar choices are better than Motorcity (the only other one I have been to).  The workers were all professional and helpful and I felt like the Casino itself was clean and well run.  However, it is still smoky.  I had dinner at Tap (see separate review).  Definitely sign up for the players club card, you get a minimum $5.00 free play by spin in a wheel, max $25.00, certainly worth signing up, and card can be used at all MGM properties.I chose this hotel for myself, my husband, and a friend for a trip to a concert at Ford Field because I travel to Vegas a lot and am a Platinum Mlife member. Boy was I surprised at how much different this is from ANY Vegas hotel or 4+ star hotel I've stayed anywhere else- and in a very bad way!First, we arrived at 4:40 and were told that no queen bed rooms were ready despite the check in time of 3 PM (the front desk agent attributed it to ""being sold out last night,"" but that seems like something a 4.5 star hotel should be able to prepare for without penalizing guests!) I was told I could have a $50 food and beverage credit or access to the concierge level while we waited, but we had dinner reservations and needed to start getting ready. Since they were having trouble getting the queen rooms cleaned, I asked if we could be upgraded (which is a standard practice for platinum members when available,) and she said no... they would only consider that if the room was STILL not available when we came BACK down to check again at 5 PM and an upgrade WAS available. Fortunately, while I was trying to negotiate a better option, the room we booked opened up. The front desk agent let us keep the f&amp;b credit for all of the trouble, and I was happy... Then we got to our room. As soon as we opened the door, we were BLASTED in the face with the smell of marijuana smoke. The door closed behind us and we realized we couldn't even breathe because it was so bad. We were so confused as to how a freshly cleaned room that just became available could smell this way- then we found the ashes on TOP of the freshly made white bedding... on BOTH beds. Let me add that we are not strangers to this smell and are very pro-legalization... however, the smell was so strong that it was sickening, and that's just not something I expect to have to deal with at a 4.5 star hotel. So I called the front desk and let them know, and their only offer was to send housekeeping back to the room to ""freshen"" it. Uh, no thanks... trust me when I say the room was PERMEATED with the smell of pot. I'm not sure what ""freshening"" could even entail! Since there were no more queen bed rooms, I agreed to be moved to a suite with one bed and a sofa, because my husband offered to sleep on the sofa. They sent a bellman up to deliver the keys to the new room, and when he arrived, he said ""whoa, I knew why you were moving as soon as you opened the door!"" As we were walking away, a woman on the housekeeping staff came out of the housekeeping supply room and asked why we were being moved. The bellman said ""the smell,"" and she said ""ohhh... ok,"" and didn't even ask what kind- like she already knew! We got to the corner suite, which was beautiful, and realized that even though the a/c was turned down to 65, the room was still pretty warm. We didn't have time to address that, and we ended up missing our dinner reservations and just using our $50 credit to eat at the casino dining court, which was super gross. The desserts were pretty good, but the pizza was like a huge piece of greasy bread with toppings.We got a cab to Ford Field in front of the hotel, and it was a quick drive and cost $15 (the driver had his meter off.) The trip back was the same deal, and we hailed the cab right outside of the venue after the concert, which worked out perfectly. Once we arrived back at around 10:45 PM, I asked for a rollaway bed because the sofa ended up being really uncomfortable and there were no spare blankets or anything. I was told that, even though we ended up in that room as a result of their inability to provide the one we booked, we would have to pay $20 for the rollaway. The front desk agent told me I'd need to talk to a manager to have that waived, and I was fine with waiting until morning to do so because we were all tired. He said it'd be 20 minutes. At almost midnight, I finally called the front desk to see what was taking so long and was told they'd ""send one right up"" (no explanation- like it was never even requested!) It arrived 20 minutes later and we were FINALLY able to try to sleep...Unfortunately, sleeping was interrupted every 30 seconds or so by the a/c kicking on and off VERY loudly. We ended up having to use the earplugs we bought for the concert just to get some sleep. This was really the last straw. Oh yeah, and I'm pretty sure the elevators had ashes on the floor and they also reeked of marijuana smoke, and the doorman and other employees smelled strongly of it, too. Maybe they could get the rooms cleaned and deliver rollaway beds on time if they weren't BAKED OUT OF THEIR MINDS! The free coffee in the lobby was actually pretty good, and it was very pretty with the fireplace along the back wall going. However, I will never, ever, stay at MGM Grand Detroit again. I have no idea why a hotel this beautiful would have such terrible service, but it's definitely NOT 4.5 stars. It could be if they'd hire the right people and give half of a damn!I've only been to the casino, and haven't stayed in the hotel rooms at all.The parking at this casino is probably the best of the Detroit casinos. Greektown is a crazy helix of spinning, and Motor City is just... weird.The ceilings seem higher at this casino and I feel like it gives off a nicer ambiance because of it. Even if you go to the small nonsmoking area to gamble, you'll still reek of smoke and smell it. I've had better luck with the machines at this casino than other casinos, and I like the food options much better (Breeze/Buffet). The raspberry gelato and the turkey burgers are delicious!If I could put no stars I would. I never make reviews. This is one you should read before booking. I went here for my 21st birthday weekend and what was suppose to be an easy fun time ended up being the most complicated experience I've ever had at a hotel. For starters, a week before check in I asked to view the rooms Bc I wanted to upgrade and compare prices with the rooms. I was treated like they were doing me a favor for showing me the rooms and that I was asking for them to give me their blood. The woman at the front desk was so rude. You'd think for 500 dollars a night you'd get treated decent and not scolded for asking to see what you're paying for. I had been greeted by one woman behind the front desk and was conversing with her about having the concierge show me different room options. There was another woman next to her who was listening in on our conversation and offered to get the concierge for me. I thanked her while she walked away but never got a chance to make eye contact. Minutes later a woman walked out from the back and Asked me if I had been helped. Because I hadn't really had a look at the previous woman's face I laughed and told the woman ""oh you just confused me I thought u were the same person who just went back to help get the concierge"" .. big mistake. This woman and her partner behind the desk started mocking me and saying ""you thought they were the same person? , no resemblance not even close"" then the woman who I unintentionally insulted told me ""the only similarities between us two is that we African American"" as she walked into the back. I was in shock and didn't even have the opportunity to respond the right way because i was so taken back. They basically accused me of being racist. As insulted as she felt, I can't even begin to explain how livid this made and has made me. I think they have poor customer service and if you aren't willing to check out the girls behind the desk you are accused of being a racist. It's insulting and degrading. This was just the beginning of my horrible experience. My list gets worse and worse. Upon arrival for checkin I was informed of an extra 200 deposit fee I was never warned about over the phone. Their answer was ""this isn't something new it's always been like this"" But it would be nice of them to mention it to their NEW first time guest, which I told them. Upon checkin I got into it with the same woman who accused me of being racist bc I handed the phone to the manager and asked him to speak to my mom in regards to payment for the deposit. She laughed at me. I asked why that was funny to her and she bit my head off and said ""I don't know you why are you talking to me? I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing at him"" -and pointed to an imaginary person in the lobby-. I told her I knew her and remembered her from the last time she was rude to me so that should tell her something. This all happened in front of the manager who didn't apologize and didn't say anything to his extra rude employee who was getting ready to jump over the counter. Honestly biggest waste of money and horrible spot for my 21st. They made everything inconvenient, every guest I had come to my room I had to physically go down and get them. Instead of just accept it through a phone call. Overall waste of money, inconvenient rude staff who complicate things. I spent a total of 800 dollars and was reimbursed 200 . for my money spent I should've had an easy and great experience and that just was not the case. I hope I save someone from doing an event here I don't know if it's bc my age but I was just treated horribly. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.","So, I was down here for a yelp event and had some time to kill between work and the party.  I decided to come straight here since the driving outside was poor with the snow, and it was easier to hang out then drive home and have to get back into the car again.I liked the attached parking garage, and the facility itself is really big. Tons of slot machines, blackjack tables, a small but nice variety of food options and much more.  Staff here was friendly and helpful, but after spending a little time here, I noticed a few things.There aren't a whole lot of bathrooms. One on each side of the casino, with one being a singles bathroom.  What does that mean? Its a toilet with a sink and nothing more. No mens or womens, just a bathroom.  If you want stalls, (or more then one toilet because its in use) you have to trek across the casino to use it.  Secondly, the staff here is professional, but they seem to be really tight on security.  I don't mind it, but I took a wrong turn somewhere and was asked where I was going.  Um, I don't know? I'm lost? seriously.They do have a nice lounge/living room area that I sat in for a while that I found to be extremely relaxing.  Couches, fireplace and free of noise. I loved it!  Also the poker rooms upstairs in a separate quiet area. I went up there to check it out and watch a few games. Unless your playing, GET OUT!  They don't want people who aren't interested in throwing some money down. Players also seemed extremely serious and not interested in any lollygagging. I understand people take their poker seriously, but loosen up folks!Anyways, I would consider coming back in the future, but I'm not overly impressed. They have valet parking here, and an attached hotel which seems pretty cool to stay in if need be.  Lots of places to bet, drink and just hang out.Very disappointed in the way the hotel is handling check in. We having been waiting for 45 to get into our room. Mind you check in is at 3pm and it is now 7:05pm. The staff are not only void of all help they won't even let us in the lobby area of the hotel so we can sit with our luggage while we wait. We have dinner reservations at 7:30 which we are going to miss. The hotel has been here long enough to know how to properly manage these types of situations but seems completely ill prepared for what should be an easy fix.... Shame on you mgm!!!First of all, I should say that I am NOT a casino person, so my opinion might not be worth as much as that of an established gambler.During a trip to see downtown Detroit, my friend spied the casino and wanted to go and so, despite being ""green as all get out"", I turned toward it. Look out--we needed instructions on everything from parking, to getting in to the casino, to how to get a ""card"", to how to play. LOL, they saw us coming.Thanks to the security guard who helped us and the guy who eventually got us our cards (apparently, you can't simply drop cash into the machine), we were given $16 each for dinner. I think they could tell we were clueless. It worked out okay, though. My friend put exactly $1 into a penny slot machine, won $19.99, and deemed herself done for the night, after less than a five-minute investment at that machine. I spent maybe ten minutes (five of which was getting a verbose explanation from the guy on the machine next to me) and $5...er, I actually LOST five bucks and then gave up, since I work too hard for my living to pump it all into the equivalent of a money-sucking video game.Anyway, we had a good time and a nice, free dinner. It wasn't as smoky as I had expected, either.It's a typical Casino. I've been to plenty of these and my primary down side here is that I guess I'm used to being non-smoking everywhere I go (bars, clubs, and restaurants).  This Casino is NOT smoke free, you will walk in, and walk out smelling of other people's cigarettes. It just feels out of place for me to walk through clouds of smoke in a Casino, I must be used to the way Casino's work in Canada, smoke free and fresh.This is by far the best gambler's casino in Detroit. As a regular player I have found MGM Grand Detroit has the best comp program in the area. I earn Freeplay &amp; comp dollars quicker here than at the competing casinos. They also have the best High Limit slot room in Detroit. It can get smoky, it's not always spotless &amp; there isn't always a waitress at my beckon call with a free coke but that's not why I'm there. I came to gamble. At MGM Grand Detroit you will find a good selection of loose slots, a fair rewards program and overall the best gambler's experience in the Motor City.I used the valet and the attendant basically was asking for a tip when I dropped off my car. I think it's commonplace to tip when you're picking up the car, not also when dropping off.. He let me know that he may not be there when I come back..sheesh!! They also have a parking garage. Both are free..This casino wasn't nearly as smoky and another one in town, thank heaven. It could be because there was a crazy snowstorm earlier that day and wasn't that busy, I don't know.. I found there to be a variety of slots - my two favorites being Sex and the City and Clue.. I saw a plethora of black jack tables, craps, etc.. Perhaps one day I'll get up the nerve to play one of the many table games they have.. The casino is easy to navigate and everything is well labeled. The players club desk was well staffed so there wasn't much of a wait. The ladies room was modern and clean. There are a few restaurants to choose from and bars.. I recommend Wolfgang Pucks - excellent service and a delicious menu to please the palate.. Go for the Perfect Martini!! I'm actually interested in going back soon and staying in the hotel, why not make an entire night of it and not worry about driving home??.. MGM, I'm open to receive comps!! lol!!I had a great time. It's a casino. It's small so some of the games I wanted to play always had someone on the machine and this was a Monday night so I couldn't imagine the weekend it seems like it would be impossibly to play many of the games. The bar and set up is cool they had a live band in the middle restaurant that starting playing which improved the atmosphere. Expanding would help this play a lot by adding more machines and restaurants. I would def come back it's fun when your able to get on the machines you want.FREE VALETLove MGM get a players card called M Life use it while playing earn comps.  Non alcoholic beverages are free except Red Bull ;-( the servers will bring you a drink while your playing or you can go to the serve yourself conssesion for beverages.  There is a small smoke free slots playing area located next to Starbucks (yummy) cash in your comps for a coffee n snack or go to one of the four restaurants. We win most of the time we go here.  N if ur a lil short on food comps go to customer service they will more than likely give u a lil extra do you can get a meal at the casino and continue playing.I am writing this update because I gave it another chance since a representative wrote back to my previous yelp review. I was hesitant, and decided to go with my wife. We went to the Wolfgang Steak House inside... Great, just great. Service, management, everything was perfect, couldnt ask for better food. We went to lose some money afterwards, nothing big, about 300. Great timer overall. Only thing I would have to say that keeps me from the 5th star is the table interaction, some employees are very touchy if you dont know your next move, dont give you time to think, which is understandable because of the other people at the table, but if youre going to take my money, just give me a min to part with it :D. Great place to eat however, 5 stars for food and service.The hotel was snazzy!  I don't know how much it was for the night because I was there  for a conference.  The room was spacious, the mattress was delightful.  There are two shower heads in the bathroom which is nice...  I don't know it was just really nice.My minibar had a 1/2 drank coke in it and the casino is super smokey so I took off one star because it seemed kinda grody.Came in to the MGM today after going to Mark Snyder's after 5 event. It was my first time and the casino had a definite high quality feel. The outside is an imposing steel frame that makes it look heavy and a bit industrial but certainly refined. The inside floor is a sprawling array of slot, dice and card games. I have not had the chance to dine or go to the clubs here yet but the restaurants looks promising, especially Tap which caters to beer aficionados and sports watchers. I'll update after I have a chance to check this place out more but my initial $25 win has got me excited!Love mgm detroit.  Spacious well venilated  si the nasty smoke isnt t9 bad.  Friendly  staff great  machines.  This is always our casino of choice.This is the better of the 3 casinos downtown. It's a really nice place to kick back and play some slots or get a bite to eat. I haven't stayed in the hotel yet but I've heard nothing but good things. I love the family guy slot machine they have there. The food at the buffet is really good and not a bad price at all. If you want a place to go, check this casino out.Has to be my favorite casino in Detroit.   No bums , best buffet, nice crowd and the cleanest of the 3 "" I judge by the consistent conditions of the restroom"".  I'm not sure why but this time, the buffet was just ok, they fell short this time, they  were out for a lot of items. Even the Chinese area was short on noodles actually had none at all. But the shrimp, they had all you needed.This review is about the casino.It is MASSIVE. Easily the largest casino in Detroit. There are so many gaming options, ranging to an endless array of slots to Double Exposure Blackjack (don't play that -- all ties go to the house).My new favorite game here is Spanish 21. It's like blackjack, but they remove all 10 cards but keep the king, queen, and jack. As a result, the dealer busts less frequently and blackjacks are less common. They have a bet called Match the Dealer which is the best bet in the casino, in my opinion. If one of your cards matches the dealer's up card, you win.I dig the free parking. My home casino charges a lot for parking. Even if you have a player's card and play the 30 minutes, the house edge means you're paying a lot for parking unless you're lucky.Best of all, it feels like you're in Vegas. But once it sets in that you're in Detroit, the armpit of America, that nostalgia goes away quickly.It felt like the dealers were unpersonable and did not give a fuck what happened to you. I love talkative dealers who at least act like they want you to win. Here it felt like they were just going with the flow.Overall, a very nice casino.I suspect foul play in the casino.  The hotel itself had superb service, high end suite. Very accommodating staff.However, I had 45 minutes to kill before my car arrived so I sat at the black jack table.I was there for less than thirty minutes and the dealer made three errors of quickly removing chips on winning hands, two times with the player to my left and once with me.  I assumed she was having a bad day, or just not very bright.  Then when I went to cash in my chips the cashier made another error in trying to short me $10 - and i had lost at the table, so we're not talking a lot of money she was dealing with!  All were ""accidents"" but the employees didn't catch any of the mistakes themselves. Both seemed very slick. I had to point out mine to both the dealer and the cashier, and the player to my left had to point out the two other errors to the dealer.  Also, the floor boss came over and asked if I was ""Terry."" I said, excuse me?  She said are you Terry?  And then she realized I wasn't the apparent QC person she thought I was.  Seemed awfully fishy to me.Rooms are nice but too expensive. Hot tubs are filthy, as are the women's restrooms. Save your money and go to Greektown, or spend around the same and get a business suite at MotorCity. 14 dollars for chicken strips? Kiss my ass. This casino needs new management, stat.My first stop in Detroit was to the MGM Grand to check into a hotel room and hit the casino for a very short bit.Hotel room:- Good Lord, that bed was comfy.  So soft, including the sheets.  I slept that hangover away with no problem in that bed.- Decent sized bathroom with hair dryer, makeup mirror, and even a travel sewing kit.- Concierge level had snacks and drinks in the ""lobby"" area near the elevators.  Happy hour time even got some meats/cheeses/olives as well as usual snack mix.  Sadly, the only drinks were non-alcoholic.  At breakfast expect the usual spread you would find at most places.Casino:Never been to a casino where you have to buy drinks despite the fact that you are gambling soooo that was weird.  Looks to have all the usual stuff a casino has including tables and slot machines.  Once you are inside there it will take you back in your memory to any visit to Las Vegas as the sounds, the dim lighting, the lack of windows, and the lack of time-keeping are just like it.  I'm not much of a gambler so the casino seemed fine to me.  Plus I won $25 on the penny slots sooooo I was definitely a FAN of that.Restaurants:We did a late night stop at the food court.  The Chinese was just edible, nothing special at all.  Looks like they had a pub and a fancier restaurant too, but they tend to be closed at 2AM.Quite surprised to find casinos in Detroit, but definitely recommend for an evening of fun if you are looking for that type of fun.pretty smokeyMy rating for the hotel - 2 stars: We stayed a night here a few months ago and normally I would rate the MGM hotel 4 stars, I was not as pleased this time.  My main complaint was that the lovely pool area was closed!  There was no warning or anything.  I walked to the spa area in my swimsuit and robe, and the employee at the spa said ""I hope you're not coming for the pool, it's closed.""  Thanks.  When I politely asked the front desk when the pool would reopen, thinking it was a maintenance issue, they said it wouldn't be for a few weeks.  If I would have known that when I booked the room, I would have rescheduled!  Even if they would have given a day pass to the pool for a later date, I would have been satisfied, but nothing.  The rooms are also starting to show their age.  The room we stayed in had visible wear patterns on the carpet, worn upholstery on the couch and cracks in the grout on the tile floor of the shower.  The bed and linens, however, were top notch.  They make the bed in such a way here that any way you hop into bed, you are immediately hugged by mounds of soft, downy blankets and pillows.  Based on my last experience, I would be hesitant to book another room here and I would certainly do my due diligence to make sure that all facilities are functioning and open at the time of my stay.My rating for the casino floor - 4 stars:  I enjoy the variety of slot machines and the non smoking area called ""The Clear.""  There are lots of table games for the players that are fonder of them.  I like the plentiful and easy parking, free pop and coffee and the well staffed floor.  In some other casinos, I have had people come up to me panhandling inside the casino.  That has never happened here and I believe that is due to the large amount of security staff and employees on the floor, which I appreciate.The overall MGM experience is 3 stars for me, but by casino standards here in Detroit, that's pretty decent.  MGM is definitely my preferred local casino.","Decent hotel with very nice rooms. Not a Vegas casino by any means. No free alcohol while gambling, smoking is allowed, and not many people having fun. Seeems more like people are spending their paycheck, trying to grind it out. Okay if you are in town and want to gamble like i do, but not a great experience. Wolfgang steakhouse was good.Casino - Pros - Super friendly dealers, pit bosses and other workers. Large variety of slots that pay pretty well. Nice music piped through.Cons - A few of the waitresses on the floor acted annoyed when asked for a drink. Cannot pay for drinks with chips (though I think this is a MI thing), Not enough Texas Hold'em tables for weekend crowd and they do not pay well at all. High minimum bets at tables even early in the mornings. More than a few trashy patrons.Hotel - Pros - Awesome, helpful, polite, friendly staff. Really, really awesome. Rooms are clean and nice and the shower is Really nice. Overall, the hotel is great, but the staff is superior. I drove from the hotel to Dearborn (not taking the interstate) and was soooooo depressed to see the decay in Detroit. I would be so sad if that happened to my hometown, but the staff here rise above the blight they see everyday and are so kind and helpful. I don't think I have ever been as impressed by a staff as a whole anywhere!Cons - Windows do not open in rooms. No personal fridges, only ""bar"" fridge, and being so close to Dearborn (with it's plethora of delicious food), I really needed a fridge. When you drop so much money in the casino, though, you don't feel it's right to pay for a fridge in the room.This review is for the hotel only as I didn't really venture over to the casino side. So this hotel really blew me away. I'm from the Detroit area and based on the experiences I've had staying at other hotels downtown and Detroit in general (apologies for being a hater - the city's had a rough go), I came in with pretty low expectations. That said, the MGM changed all of that within minutes of my arrival.I want to start by complimenting the service. Starting with the valet (which is free by the way) - they were prompt, courteous, and said they'd send all of our bags up to the room upon check-in. Did they? Yes. Easy. The woman at the front desk asked if we wanted a late check out - no charge. Why not? We ordered room service the next day and even though it was past eleven and I wanted breakfast, they bent the rules and made me an omelet. I've stayed at other nice hotels and waited a ridiculous amount of time for room service only to get cold food. Not here. It was delivered within 20 minutes and it was delicious!The rooms: good job on the bed guys. Wow. Perfect. I was super impressed too by the tv/mirror in the bathroom. I stayed on election night and loved being able to watch the returns while getting ready. The shower was a dream. It's bigger than my bathroom at home. It's one of those rain shower situations which I loved. Felt like I was in a fancy spa. At the end of the day, you can't really ask for much more. This hotel is a 5 star gem in a city that really needs it. I hope it sets the service standard for other developments that pop up.stayed here for the Detroit Tigers opening day. The rooms were nice the hotel is great. lots of good places to eat. Nice TV in the room. If your coming to Detroit. You really need to stay at this hotel. Its worth the money. If you like poker they have a nice poker room. you will think your in Vegas. Stayed April 2011my husband and I had gotten married on 01/03/14 and we went to MGM afterwards to celebrate with some friends. My husband serves in the USAF and we were doing a rushed wedding so it was very small. I was wearing my dress the whole night and I felt like a celebrity. Everyone kept telling me how beautiful I was, including the staff, and we had a beautiful room. When leaving the following day I had packed up EVERYTHING. I am usually very good with this kind of stuff because I hate hotels and I'm one of those people who goes through a checklist 3 times to make sure we have everything. We rechecked our bags in at the front and decided to grab some coffee and play the slots one more time. When I got home it was then I realized my dress and my lacey boxer shorts (I dont do lingerie) was missing. To this day I am still heartbroken that someone wouldnt turn it in (if left), had stolen it or whatever may have happened. I called up there a few days later because I thought maybe I left it in my husbands bag which was dropped off at my husbands parents house. Nope. So I called up and they said they had not seen anything but will return the call if they find anything. Never heard anything. You have ruined my experience and a memory I will never get to share with my children one day. Words cannot explain how my heart feels even to this day and lord knows when or if we'll be able to redo our vows due to the nature of my husbands job and money. Great ambiance just don't trust the staff with your items.-Broken BrideOk, here is my update:First and foremost I would visit again if only to have dinner at Wolfgang Puck steak. The food is sublime. The service was impeccable, but you pay for what you get. Dinner for 3 without drinks was 300.00 dollars. If you go make sure to get the tater tots, they are to die for.Had reservations at Immerse spa, the experience was very good. It would be nice to see the attendants more often. The massage service was very good and the amenities were in line with what you pay. They have a sauna, and a whirlpool that is very large. They ambience is soothing and the facility is first class. A 50 minute massage is 130.00. They tell you the gratuity is 20%, but you can tip what you want. I tipped 20% because I was extremely pleased with my service. Oh, I almost forgot, after getting to my room I found that the tv wouldn't come on. Called the front desk and they sent an engineer right away who was able to fix the problem immediately.  I'm not changing my rating because I feel the hotels response was insufficient, but I believe that I've given a fair review.Went on a Saturday afternoon. Went straight into poker lounge. Only available option was 1-2 NL table. Only 4 tables were open. people seemed to know each other really well by name including the dealer. looks like a small poker community in the city where everyone knows about each other. played for closed to 2 hours. made some money. Signed out. now to the regular area 70% are slots,never really bother about that. lost a quick 20 on wheel of fortune. made back in half an hour in a 10$ minimum for Spanish blackjack. didn't try the buffet and never in the 4 hour period was asked for drinks. So although I made money and its a huge place with various games I will limit my rating for the drink less night.MGM Grand Detroit was fantastic!  Everyone was very helpful and super friendly.  Our room was fantastic- executive corner suite.  Super clean- we ate at Tap- it was game day and service didn't slide at all- food was good- we had sliders and the artichoke dip.  Saturday night music was great- we met so many great people. Definitely would go back!I like this place.  Wide and open, and spacy.  That means even though lots of people are smoking, it filters enough that you aren't choked out.  I don't mind casinos smelling like smoke... but I want to be able to breathe a bit... and here you certainly can do that.  Plus it's a beautiful place!You forget you're in Detroit when you step into this casino.  Pretty clean and spacious, looks fairly modern.  Free parking in the garage.  The waitress never came to take my drink order while I was at the slots, but there was a free pop machine that I appreciated having around.  Bathrooms were clean and well stocked.  The cigarette smoke smell is pretty heavy but that's to be expected.  Great restaurants on the floor for when you need to refuel plus multiple bars and a nightclub that looked pretty slick.  Had a fun time!The parking lot here was like a roller coaster.  LITERALLY! Each level was like going up a hill. I found it entertaining, and drove up to the roof just for the laughs and kicks.It was kinda fun, but god forbid I'm here on a day where a bunch of cars are coming in and out.-2 stars for how poorly MGM post signs.  Took me a while circling around before I found this place.  Getting lost around the area seemed a little scary on a rainy Friday night...=/I went to the casino on a weeknight and was surprised at how busy it was.I am a fan of casinos and love to go and check them out when I travel.  This one did not disappoint and I have to say, for me, it was as close to going to Vegas as I can get this year.  I am a fan of the MGM in Vegas, so I was happy to see an MGM in the area when I was looking for casinos.I used the self-parking lot for free and found it to be very well lit and I felt safe in there by myself. There were so many people going in and out. I also found I could leave my coat in the car and run inside. They do have a coat check available by the front door if you don't want to do that.They have plenty of ATMs around as well as machines to cash out your vouchers. Sometimes there would be a line when I walked by, but it moved fast.Plenty of bathrooms, all of them were clean and no lines.I did not see any machine attendants around (but I also didn't see more than one machine out of service the whole night). I saw one hostess bringing drinks during the 3 hours I was there. I only saw 2 security guards by the door to the garage.  I saw a lot of staff cleaning and pushing in chairs constantly.  The casino is very clean.  They have a free soda station that you can get drinks from yourself.The non-smoking room is very small and disappointing in the options you have in there. I did bite the bullet and used the machines in the smoking area.I liked the mix of machines and there were ample 1 cent and 2 cent machines.As for the food inside, I ate at Wolfgang Puck's Cucina and had pizza (my favorite thing to get at MGM in Vegas). All in all, it was a very nice evening and I would definitely go back again.Still my fav out of all the Detroit casinos. But the only machine that pays out at this place is the damn ATM machine!I do not gamble at all!  I do not know how, I do not wish to know how, I'd rather spend my money on ME!!  I have to say that I am not a fan of Casinos ANYWHERE other than Las Vegas.  In Vegas, that's what it's all about...anywhere else I find them DEPRESSING!  All you see are people with cigarettes drooping out of their mouths, dragging their oxygen tanks behind them - wrinkles on faces so deep you could lose yourself in them,  slowly lumping their over grown muffin flop tops to the buffet, then shackling their handicapped family member up in front of a machine...the whole scene is funereal, I could not wait to leave!Ack. I completely abhor casinos. They are the worst.That said, my stay at the MGM in Detroit (rock city) was exceptionally pleasant.The bed: pretty much the best.The shower: two heads and the size of my entire bathroom at home. You can fit many friends in there if that is your plan.Nice comfy couch and chair.Only issue was I had a heck of a time connecting to wifi - to the point that I gave up.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a car so I had no valet concerns. I also didn't eat or buy anything so I'm not riled up about the price of anything. Also, the lobby had a hint of cigarette smoke, but that wasn't an issue once you are in the hotel area.I had an issue which I brought up to the front desk.  They charged me the wrong rate for the second time.  The fact that they would not correct the rate was beside the point.  They were flat out rude.  They told me to talk to Jenni Titterington the next day to resolve the issue.  I asked for her the next day.  They said we will get her and then 2 seconds later ""oh she left for the day"".  I found her office the next day but she refused to talk to me.  This place is nice, but the customer service sucks.  This place looks world class, with bad attitudes.  The management obviously is over their heads.  I'm pulling for Detroit but this will keep Detroit in a hole.  The housekeeping staff gets it though.  They were very pleasant.Very classy casino.  Lot's of slot machine and a good amount of table games. The only negative is the smoking laws don't cover the casino floor.  I guess the toxic fumes don't apply here!  Other than that, it's my favorite casino in the D...Place is great and awesome people!Obviously its the cleanest casino in Detroit!  The slots are better; also better tables.  I feel safer here when out late in their parking structure; I park by the casino entrance regardless.  I don't understand why a draft beer is so dang expensive or alcohol for that matter?  If I have to choose a casino out of the three in Detroit I always choose MGM; you should too.I was pleasantly surprised but this casino.  I had no expectations, but when you are in there you totally feel like you are in Vegas... which is cool, but strange.  Get a room and have a mini vacation in the 'D'.","I have faith in Detroit. I have faith that it can rebuild and be a great American city with the likes of Chicago, San Francisco, etc, but the way to greatness is NOT a casino. I wish I had more time to spend in Detroit as this was just quick stop before I got to the airport, but best believe next time I'll be spending my money at a museum or something that will help revitalize the city.When I go to a hotel the bed is the most important thing to me besides customer service. I want to sleep in a bed that is comfortable with lots of fat fluffy pillows and a soft mattress. MGM didn't disappoint. The bed was like sleeping on my own bed with 8 pillows and a thick white comforter instead of those scratchy fake comforters and a couple of flat pillows. The room was great and the service was excellent. Good job MGM Grand.Don't get me wrong I sometimes enjoy the casino but I hate losing money.  Too many told me... ""In order to win big, you must SPEND BIG!""  I think I'm spending big when I blow off $20 bucks -- Lol! that's usually my max.   ATMs are located inside the casino but the fee is $3.The casino has it clubbers, gamblers, and drinker all packed in one.  Unfortunately, I just can't tolerate the smoking most of the time -- if I'm going with a friend then I'll stay until that person is ready to go but I'll never go solo and stay long.I'm more of  a people watcher!!!  (That's right -- I'm not a gambler!)Also forget to tell you... JUICE is free!!!  (yummy!) Most everyone knows you can get free coffee and pop.We went to MGM Grand (Casino only) in Oct 2012.... Very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff! As for the games... They had a fairly average selection if machines. Could use more $1.00 slots... And perhaps some of the newer/latest machines... All in all had a perfectly good time and enjoyed the buffet as well. One suggestion to visitors is I would recommend venturing outside the casino to some of the other local attraction while your in the area while youre there... Greektown, Hart Plaza etc... Makes a fun day!This hotel is the absolute very best in the Detroit area.Exceptional valet when you arrive. Bellhops who deliver your luggage. Great great great.You open the door to your room and the lights come up gently to welcome you. You first notice the incredible bathroom, which is a gem. I hopped in the shower and wanted to stand there forever whilst draining the Detroit River.You could actually stand there for quite long because there's a TV in the bathroom mirror, allowing you to shower and watch TV simultaneously.The room is marvelous. The staff are incredible. Helpful, friendly, a joy to talk with. I was having a few people over for a spot of wine, so I called and asked for more wine glasses. They were there in a second.Room service was speedy and delicious. I ordered the reuben and it was delivered hot and delicious. Really, really, good.The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. I really did not want to get out of it in the morning.The hotel is a little pricey. They deserve every penny, but it puts this hotel out of reach for regular visits into Detroit. But for special occasions...this place is the absolute best.I have only been to motor city and MGM as of last night. I wasn't that impressed when I stepped in as much as I was impressed with the exterior of the casino. It is very clean inside and the casino every once in a while is a good time. I wasn't impressed with the food either. If I go back to a casino I'll have to check out Greektown and compare the three, as of now I do think that MGM is better than motor city. I'd say it is between a 3-4 but closer to a 3.I agree with Liz that being childless definitely has it's advantages, especially in the later hours.So after a nice dinner my group decided to head over to MGM because none of us had been there before and we weren't ready to call it a night.  Total spur of the moment decision.We pulled into the parking garage and although it was pretty tough to find a spot, we eventually found one and couldn't complain about the fact that it's free.   It's pretty easy to navigate your way in and find your way around to the casino.When we walked in we were all impressed.   This seemed more like a Vegas casino than the other ones in town.  It was much more upscale and you could tell a lot of money went into it.  I was extremely impressed by the caliber of restaurants.   The atmosphere is very clean, very modern, and very crisp.After dropping a hefty amount of money in a record 2 1/2 minutes on the slots, we decided to grab a drink, sit at the bar and play some video poker. There were 2 female bartenders and man they hated each other!!   One was making the other one cry, and they were both yelling at each other.  Wow, what a turnoff.   It made the whole scene very awkward and tense and we finished up our games and got outta there.I was also amazed at the amount of slots they have here.  Rows, and rows, and rows.  And just when you think you hit the blackjack table, more rows of slots.   It doesn't bother me, just a mere observation.I think I would have given it more stars if I wasn't caught in the middle of the sharks and jets war.  MGM, use better judgement when hiring please.Whoa pricey!  I mean....  What?   I have to pay $7 for a small bottle of coke?  Haters don't hate.  I know i'm in a Casino.  I also know that I am in a high class hotel - however there are just some things that are too expensive for what it's worth.    You're in Detroit..... unfortunately a dying city - and if you want to attract more people, you have to lower the cost of the trip!  Now let me start off by stating that when i parked my car I left $XXXX amount of money out in the open.   After 4 days of in and out valet parking my car, not a single bill was missing.... and we're not talking a few hundred dollars.    So with that - I immediately have trust and respect for the hotel staff.  The rooms were great.   No complaints there.   The bathroom is modern with duel frosted glass walls separating the shower from the lavatory - and the ""mirror"" TV is always a nice touch to any modern bathroom.  I was unable to experience the Saturday night crowd due to my business meeting lasting into late in the night - however, after seeing the crowd before they had their fun - then seeing the many smiling and tipsy faces after the night was over (while being in the lobby for a snack) it looked like they had a great time. The smell of smoke is intense. Having gone years now with this smoking ban, the taste of fresh air is one I cherish - so having to breath in an ashtray of air with each breath is disturbing.... to each is own. So cliff notes: Excellent  =   Trustworthy and welcoming staff. Good =  Selection of food, night life entertainment Poor = Price. (of everything)My husband and I have stayed here 5 times, all because my father in law won a little over a million  dollars on the wheel of fortune progressive machine, so he gets comps and we get to bargain from them, each time we stayed in a corner suite and they also got us a massage, By far this hotel is the best, the massages were excellent, if your lucky enough to go, ask for Lisa, not me, or Alicia, they are amazing, the rooms are amazing, clean, well stocked and we had nothing but great service each and every time we were there, definately worth it.Downtown Detroit is an unusual sight to behold, here we are the richest country in the world, yet in our heartland we have a major city full of abandoned and burned out homes and buildings. It looks like a war was fought not long ago and I guess in some sense that is true, as the big three automakers have fallen they've taken Detroit down with them.So you're the mayor of a struggling D-Town what do you do to ignite the urban development flames? Bring in the casinos of course! Enter MGM. Did it work? Time will tell, but to MGM's credit they spared no expense in building out the property (I hear it was an 800M investment) and unlike most gambling venues outside of Vegas this hotel is actually Vegas quality. The lobby and room furnishings were stylish (as good or better than any W)), there are a number of destination restaurants within the complex and a hot little nightclub to boot.The staff throughout the hotel was extremely friendly, but the check-in process needs improvement (it took me 30 minutes to check in once I got to the front desk and the line was long behind me). While I'd agree friendly banter with guests at check-in is a great plus, I'd rather the hotel optimize its peeps for speed.Each night was about $249 for a room with two queen beds. The bathroom is generously sized and the shower has two heads, awesome. Bottom line: the hotel is a nice and potentially important add to a desperate downtown. I do worry for the surrounding community. Will they lose what little they have left to the cold cha-ching of a slot machine? My pocket ended up a lot lighter so I can only imagine what would happen if I lived nearby... let's hope for the best, good luck Motown.This review is largely based on my hotel room. I stayed in the Deluxe Corner Suite. for one night. Check in was at 3pm and check out was at 11am which kinda sucks but they allowed me late check out at 1pm. The room was by far the nicest room I've ever stayed in. The bed was a queen and I was expecting a king but it was still very comfortable. The room had a huge tub and the shower was great. It had about 6 different settings for where I wanted to water to come from. The room had 1 full bath and also a half bath.The service at the hotel was second to none. I made a few requests to the front dest and also to random bellmen and every request that I made was tended to immediately. The room came with complimentary wi-fi access but I was not able to connect to it all weekend. not a big deal to me. The hotel offers a complimentary fitness center which includes access to the hot tub, wet and dry sauna. The bathroom attendent in the fitness center went out of his way to answer all my questions and make me feel at home. There are some great restaurants inside the MGM but the really good ones are only open for dinner.This was one of the very best hotel experiences I've ever had. I would surely recommend the MGM to anyone and I definitely look forward to staying with them on my next trip to Detroit.This review is regarding the hotel banquet facilities. I attended an <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FAutotrader.com&amp;s=3cddaaf6132b1b374ee12592e172fce94a9163b062302e832d3506f7cf542442"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Autotrader.com</a> traning seminar (I work for a dealership) in one of the banquet rooms at the hotel portion yesterday. I was really impressed with the overall building, ambiance, professionalism of the staff and the food/drinks provided. The place is beautiful; clean, modern, fresh yet comfortable. The room we had was smaller (there was only about 20 people in our meeting) but it was nicely decorated and had nice, high-tech sound for the projectors and microphones. Breakfast and lunch were provided, as was beverage service which included coffee, tea, bottled Coke products, iced teas and water. The coffee was top-notch and the hot tea selection was to die for (if you're into that). The meals were essentially a buffet. Breakfast was an egg, asparagus and potato fritatta, turkey sausage and an assortment of muffings, cereals, yogurts and fruit. The lunch was outstanding! Two kinds of salads; spinach with walnuts and orange wedges, butter lettuce with fontina cheese and cherry tomatoes (which looked heirloomish) - two choices of dressings. There was a potato salad with salame as well as a hot onion soup. The entrees included gruyere crusted chicken, grilled salmon and something else (I don't remember), roasted fingerling potatoes, glazed carrots &amp; brocolli and fresh bread with an herb butter. It was really impressive. The staff was attentive, quiet and professional. Quick to refresh the beverages in the stations, and quick to clear plates, glasses, etc out of our way. I would really recommend this for any banquet or large-group event in the future!I stayed here for a friend's bachelorette party. We were in one of the corner suites (can't remember if it was the executive or luxury). I personally would never pay over $500 a night for a room especially in the city, but that's up to the traveler to decide. I think it is overpriced, but many people who stay at MGM are using comps (I'm not made, I would use them too if I gambled) so the rooms are cheaper. Regular rooms are closer to $250-300/night including valet, Internet, and a fitness center. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is immaculate. The shower jets are amazing and I love the decor. Very clean and comfortable. However room service was very slow (Saturday after midnight). The food is priced pretty high, but the burgers were phenomenal. If you are on a business trip, this is a nice place to stay. If you are just looking to stay at a hotel while gambling try booking with a discounted search engine (if you can find a deal).Actually 2.5 stars, rounded up.  As mentioned, the rooms themselves are nice enough.  I'm from Vegas, and I've seen a lot of great hotels, including the Skyloft rooms at the MGM in Vegas.  There were some service issues, including the staff being unaware that one of their major customers, indeed, has a corporate account with them.  The bed sheet had a hole in it (about the circumference of a cigarette head).  A security guard at the entrance to the casino was grilling me about why I was there if I had a Nevada ID (do they never have out-of-towners? I was there for business).  Food court was gross, as was the ($28) buffet.  The worst point was the cheap cologne fragrance that was pumped throughout the entire hotel.  I mean it is the smell of that cheap cologne that I've smelled a couple times before--once when riding the city bus in a low-income area; once in a drugstore where teens were spraying the cheap fragrance offerings; etc.  Someone was having a party at night and the noise was coming through the vent in my room.  I ended up needing to change rooms as I was working, which was a hassle to do in the middle of work, and since security should have taken care of the noisy party and not made me move.  The pool at the spa had loudly screaming kids.  A fellow patron told me that she was not able to enjoy her (expensive) massage because she heard the kids screaming in the pool the whole time.  Casino is so smoky that my freshly cleaned hair smelled like an ashtray upon spending 10 minutes down in the casino to get a snack to bring back to my room.  And, of course, much of the clientele...This hotel and casino definitely has potential, as the infrastructure is sound. There are just some bad decisions being made on a site-management level.I'm not a fan.  My experience was probably tarnished as a result of it being a Friday and the first of the month.  My S.O. and I went with the intention of picking up our MLife cards prior to a trip to Vegas and have an evening out without the kids.  I found the casino dirty and the reeking of smoke so badly I was choking, and I'm a smoker.  It's hard to find machines because there are not overhead signs you can look at to seek out your favorites.  I know it's not Vegas and free drinks, but I couldn't believe a Heineken costs $6.  The table mins were ridiculous and the slots tights. The clientele all looked desperate like winning a jackpot stood between them and that month's rent.  My first impression was not a good one, and I wrote management explaining why.  My reply was a generic, ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you'll give us another chance.""One advantage of being childless is holidays are more casual and you can kind of do what you want.Last night after a huge feast I went gambling over at MGM with some grownups. I have to say I definitely like this vibe best of the casino offerings in Detroit. It is a bit more upscale and for a casino, classy-ish.The bonus was the lounge. They have a deal on bottled cheapie domestics for 2 bucks until 11 on weeknights and they were showing the late game Giants vs Broncos which my husband wanted to see anyway. As he is not a gambler much this kept him amused with a friend. They have comfy chairs and a series of big screens, so good views from all areas.He played a bit of blackjack and liked the setup then settled into the lounge. I went hopping to the penny machines. Woohoo, flashing lights and loud noises, I am a shining example of Pavlov's theories in action. Cheap thrills and happiness. I stuck to freebie diet cokes and was happy as a clam.I don't think any of us had much luck but none of us lost much either. The machines are fun and the setup is nice. You don't feel hugely crowded. I wish there were non smoking areas, well actually I wish the whole place was non smoking but I can deal.Security was on, I got help when needed at my machine when my wrinkly money was not taken (meanie machine) and they have self serve drink stations. The ladies came around periodically but I never seemed to have tip money handy, next time I will take some dollars with me or remember to go to one of the handy change makers before I sit down to play.I liked the handy kiosks for money redemption and change making, the fact that even though I never go there I got a free ten dollar credit emailed to me to come play and just the general feeling there.All in all tops for gaming downtown.I've been to the casino at MGM but never had the chance to stay the night at the hotel. When I had the opportunity to stay the night here I could not pass it up. I have heard so many great things about the hotel so I wanted to check it out. When you check in it's nothing but a five star treatment. The staff are friendly and helpful. When you go towards the doors that will take you to the elevators to your room someone will hold them open for you. They have complementary coffee in the lobby anytime you want it. The views from my room are awesome. Looking at the Ambassador Bridge and where the old Tiger Stadium used to be. The views at night are amazing. It is pricy but you do get what you pay for and it's nothing but a FIVE STAR experience.Smells like an ashtray after spending about 2 hours in the Casino. The number and varieties of slots machines is huge but they have limited number of table games.  This place is better than Motorcity Casino as I like the single floorplan as Motorcity is divided into 2 floors of casino facility. The downside is that it is full of smokers.I decided to book a room here to celebrate my graduation from Wayne State. I wanted to be somewhere where all of the entertainment and dining was right there, and if I needed to pass out (which I did!), I could just head up to my room.First off, I got a deal on a double queen room, about $295 including fees, and this was on December 9. The room was BEAUTIFUL. I mean, a TV was in the bathroom mirror. How's that for classy? Word to the wise: DON'T EVEN OPEN THE MINI-BAR! Not even to browse! They start charging you just for opening the door and removing items. There's some sort of sensor. Fortunately, if you catch yourself and call concierge, they won't charge you. The stuff is ridiculously expensive, which is to be expected. Also, valet is free, which I didn't know about, so take advantage.Check-in went smoothly, concierge was excellent, and free newspapers in the morning!On to the entertainment: My guests and I hit the food court (I think it's called Breeze?), and I tried the Mexican food, it was ""eh"", not bad, not great. My guests had the burgers and Asian food, which they said was decent.We didn't play any slots or tables, but I have here before, and it's just your typical casino. *shrugs*We went to Club V later that night, so check out my review on their Yelp page.Overall, the hotel was beautiful and although I feel it was a bit expensive, I think you get a great value for your money.I've edited this review because they removed the charges (see OP below). after all the bs one goes through in Detroit you don't expect to hustled another time by a place like MGM(that was kinda the only bad thing and being woken up twice during my late checkout by housekeping.): i'm currently disputing $1100 in bogus charges as I booked thru expedia and all should have been paid for.  with the exception of in room charges, incidentals etc. i've had to leave a message to credit card issue department (convenient you can't speak directly to them.).... and now a second time! cause they have charged my card for mini bar usage which we did not use!","['said', 'awhile', 'casinos', 'match', 'personality', 'people', 'seen', 'classy', 'snooty', 'depending', 'view', 'inside', 'nice', 'spacious', 'plenty', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/motorcity-casino-hotel-detroit,MotorCity Casino Hotel,3.5,$$$,99,"I've been here several times to gamble over the years and have always thought it is ok.  Nothing special.  My girlfriend and I each had a free room voucher - Sunday-Thursday.  Anyone can get one for gambling for an hour - even penny slots.We booked both rooms with the intent of giving one to our friend who lives in Lansing.  Unfortunately he didn't show and there is a 50 dollar late cancel fee, so we decided to book both rooms.  When we go to the counter, we told the receptionist our situation and she said ""great! We are sold out and can use the room.  We will cancel your fee, and why don't we upgrade your room and give you access to the concierge lounge on the 15 floor"".  What????? Amazing.  We hurried up to the lounge before it closed and they had chicken, large chilled shrimp, and a ton of other things.  No alcohol but who cares it is awesome.  We then went to our room which was clean, had a large bathroom with separate shower, tub and toilet, and our view overlooks the city.  The gambling experience is different when staying, we had fun playing penny slots and just relaxing for a bit.  I did have to leave early on Monday for work but I would love to have stayed and extra day so we could go to the seafood buffet, where the crab legs are massive and very tasty.Based on this one time, I really like this place a great deal.You can still smoke cigarettes and cigars in here, so that's a plus for late-night (or all-night) gamblers.  I'm sure that's a deal-breaker for a lot of people, but smoking and gambling seem to go hand-in-hand so it's nice to still find a place that allows it indoors.  Otherwise, this was a pretty decent casino.  The layout was a bit bizarre since they have multiple levels but the employees were friendly and knowledgeable when we asked about specific table games.  They had a Pai Gow table (YES!) which is basically the only game I play in casinos (aside from the occasional slot machine).  Not a lot of casinos (outside Vegas) offer Pai Gow and even fewer offer them offer the game all night.  I spent a good amount of time at the table and ended even at the end of the night.Lamest part of this place: they stop serving drinks at 1:30 a.m.  I'm assuming this has to do with general liquor laws in Detroit and/or Michigan but C'MON.  This is an establishment that is open for gambling ALL NIGHT but they stop serving liquor earlier than some bars.  The end of the liquor service is what prompted us to leave.  I honestly would have stayed longer had they kept serving.  Lame.Parking seems miles away so try to get a spot close to the garage entrance.My stay at the MotorCity Casino Hotel wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but book through Kayak!  They'll give you the best price on hotel rooms... OR if you're interviewing at Detroit Mercy for the dental program, you can call in and tell them that and they'll give you a special rate.  I paid about $160/night for my room.Went down to the casino with a few other interviewees that I met that night and had a blast gambling away.  They had a buffet downstairs with a wide array of American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese foods, but it was nothing special and quite pricey.. but again, when you're not a local, just stay where you are and be safe!  Especially since you're in Detroit.  The casino reeked of smokers, so by the time I got back to my room, my clothes were soaked with the stench of tobacco smoke.  There were bars all around, slot machines, tables, etc.  It was pretty fun running around with a bunch of other pre-dental students just gambling, but don't fall prey to gambler's fallacy!  I lost $20 before I called it quits.The cleaning lady nearly gave me a heart attack when she opened my door randomly, but I had the door bolt in place and I was changing.. definitely did not appreciate that.The room itself is actually really nice with complimentary Wi-Fi, but there was nothing mindblowing about my stay.  However, IF YOU ARE A PRE-DENTAL STUDENT NOT FROM THE AREA, I RECOMMEND STAYING HERE.  This is a 4-star hotel, and if you're alone, just stay here since the surrounding area is kind of shady.  A majority of the pre-dental students usually stay at the hotel since it's very close to the school (only 10 minutes away if you Lyft).  Definitely meet up with others if you're interviewing at Detroit Mercy to build a sense of camaraderie with your future colleagues, but also to relieve your sense of fear you have while you're in Detroit.I actually had a really nice stay at the MotorCity Casino Hotel...but there were a few things that just made the visit to Detroit, not the best. This will be a good review to read for a Canuck taking a quick visit across the river.The rooms were really nice. We were all impressed with this. Big bathroom, huge bathtub, separate shower, separate toilet, lots of toiletries. We were upgraded to a higher floor (13....they had a 13th floor.....) which had a great view. We got access to the concierge lounge and helped ourselves to some h'orderves. They are really good! No place to sit though so that was annoying. There were a few tables and a bar to sit at but one person took up an entire table and the people at the bar spread themselves out so our group couldn't squeeze in. We ate at the counter. We took a stroll through the casino. Ah, the smoking. Forgot about that one. In Vegas it is manageable with all of the AC. Get the heat pumping? Stifling and insufferable. We had to leave. They have 2 small rooms for non-smokers if you are interested. Didn't see table games in there. I did like how they measured their slots based on longer playtime vs bigger jackpots.This hotel is fairly out of the way. When we looked out the window we saw a few warehouses, and houses. It's a quiet spot here in Midtown. Maybe we are used to the hustle and bustle of Toronto but my goodness, there is nothing around! We decided to take a cab and be prepared to be swindled. Firmly request that they start the meter.  I wish the casino worked with a specific company that would make their guests feel safe. Each ride was sketchier than the last. As a female in my late 20's, other than children, we were probably some of the youngest people in the place. If you are looking for a party, head downtown. I probably wont stay here again simply because of the location. If there was more going on around there it would be different because the rooms and hospitality were fantastic. Free valet was cool but it took about 10 minutes to get our car when the wait time said 0.Stayed here for valentines day..was very nice..had a great time!   Everyone was nice..great staff..friendly people...good entertainment...I've been here many times...but first time staying in the hotel...I'll definitely come back!!!I was here in 2013 and enjoyed it. If I am ever in Detroit again, this would be exactly where I would want to stay again. I was surprisingly impressed with this casino/hotel. It was tad on the expensive side, at $400 a night, but thankfully I was able to split this with a group.Overall, I'm rating this on the hotel room itself. This was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The beds were very comfortable. All of the staff was also amazing and super friendly. It's only losing a star because of price, which I though was a little much for the area. The casino itself was hopping. I felt like there was a bar around every corner in the casino, so I never went dry. Great entertainment until 2am and I truly felt like I was in Motown.Wonderful hotel. Staff is very friendly and the rooms are very spacious and clean.  The dining choices are pretty good and there is a good variety of different choices,  The beds are very comfortable and they use wonderful linens.  I highly recommend staying here if you ever can, its will be a very nice treat to yourself.For the most part, my stay at Motor City has been pleasant. There are some very wonderful employees here, most notably Bev, Bill, Brandi, Melvin, Reginald.Amazing rooms, amazing staff! The room are very clean and very nice! The bed is the best part! Once you get in the bed you'll never want to get out! I absolutely love their rooms! I also love the fact that you have to have a key to show to get to the elevators to go your room! Top notch security! Also FREE valet parking!While I don't frequent hotels, I have been around long enough to have been too many different hotels around the country, and Motor City Hotel is one of Detroit's finest. Location is paramount, and the Motor City Hotel is close to many of the best spots this city has to offer. Plus, being connected to a casino can't hurt. If nothing else, there is no shortage of interesting people. There's also many food and bar options in the hotel as well. What else can a chubby dude want?The rooms are very nice as well. I have OCD and it is not easy for me to go to hotels, or stay anywhere overnight for that matter. This, cleanliness is paramount. The two times I've come here, the rooms were cleaned very well, and the decor was legit. The view was pretty chill as well. Again, there may be nicer or fancier hotels in Detroit, but for overall appeal - night life, food, amenities, etc. - I'd put my money down on a room at Motor City.Very nice hotel with spacious rooms that come fully equipped with a minibar (moet included), bathtub and shower. They even had one of those clock radios that plays iPods and iPhones.Security here is on point as they are pretty strict about not letting people upstairs who do not have a key card. Elevators were funny acting as they sometimes didn't want to work in certain instances. Their is a 5th floor lounge here that gives you free appetizers, beverages (non-alcoholic) and pastries in the afternoon which is cool. I wish the lobby restaurant was as on point as everything else as the selection was quite meh...Little Caesars is there for late nite consumption...FYI. There is a bar that is cool with cool peeps working there. Wi-fi &amp; parking is free here. Good place to stay to be in the mix of the actionVery nice place with friendly staff. I'd love to go back. Clean comfortable safe place with modern rooms.Great time, good casino, super nice hotelGreat hotel, very clean and looks beautiful. A few issues I have are the room we stayed in. The mattress was pretty stiff and uncomfortable. We woke up with back pain. Also when I first called about the room, the lady on the phone told me the bath tub had jets in the room we wanted to book. That was one of the highlights and I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately when we got to the room the tub had no jets. Not that big of a deal, but still was a bit of an annoyance.It is a Detroit themed casino in Detroit and it does it pretty well.  The second best casino in the Detroit area overall, and it is probably the nicest looking Casino in Detroit from the outside.  I am a big fan of view and food available at Iridescence.  Gambling wise, I have personally never done well there, but I have a friend who is a professional poker player who says it is by the best for Texas Hold'em in the area.  If you are sensitive to smoke be aware that the ventilation system at MCC is pretty weak.  I am a former smoker and I even found the intensity of the smoke hard to take.  Finally, Soundboard is a very unique venue to watch show or go to an event.  It has an ample dance floor with three bars on the first floor and bleacher style seats on the second floor.  Overall, if you are visiting town or just looking for a fun evening, MCC is worth a visit.I spent little time in the room and even less time in the Casino but I really liked this hotel. The room was clean and modern with plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom had a separate room for the toilet, a shower, a separate tub, and some other nice amenities like a robe, a digital scale and a magnified mirror for the ladies. The view from the room was cool, and booking on Hotwire, this room came in cheaper than the cost of a junior suite I recently booked at the Courtyard. I'm already looking forward to coming back.First of all, great location. Stayed here for two nights a few weeks ago, and it's close to most things in downtown Detroit, as well as right near the freeway for easy access. Yes, there are some abandoned things nearby, but you won't go exploring those, right? Rooms were much nicer than I expected, especially for a casino. You can actually charge your phone and have it within arms reach at night, which isn't a given in many hotels. Obviously, you're connected to the casino and the events facilities inside. Room didn't smell of smoke either, which is a plus for a casino hotel. Only downside is that you can hear the rooms near yours, even when they're in the shower. My neighbors weren't bad at all, but I'd imagine this would become a major problem if they were. I didn't pay, but I think the price was also above $200, which seems steep considering.Nothing fancy, but a decent hotel. I wouldn't mind staying here again, but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to do so unless I wanted super convenient casino access.I travel for work and I am constantly calling hotels home. I occasionally order room service and never have i ever experienced pancakes delivered to me completely burnt. There is also a constant stream of noise and smoke in the hallways. I hope to never see this place again.We booked a night at the Motor City Casino Hotel via Hotwire, at a ""secret rate"" deal.  The free parking, free WiFi, and being close to everything made this hotel a fantastic bargain.  Once I saw the photos on the website of the hotel exterior lit in rainbow lights, I knew I was going to love this hotel.The rooms are spacious, and the bed was comfortable.  I slept soundly.  There is a free shuttle service to Detroit Tigers games, but the catch is that you have to sign up for Club Metro (a players/rewards) card in their casino.  The card is free, sign-up is free, there are no disclaimers or gimmicks with it.  You don't even have to use the card.  As soon as I printed my ticket for the shuttle, I threw the card in the trash.My only dislikes about this place were the extremely long check-in, which could have been fixed with one more person at the desk, and the lack of a mini-fridge in the room.  Since we were driving, we had snacks and drinks we would have like to have kept cold.We did not spend any time in the casino, but this hotel is worthy of 5 stars considering the deal we got.We love visiting the MotorCity Casino and we recently received free rooms for gambling for an hour.  The room was excellent.  VERY clean, though some of the dressers has scratches and scuffs - this is to be expected when using dark woods though.Each room had a coffee brewer and Starbucks coffee in them.  Sweet!Be careful taking stuff out of the fridge to put leftovers in there.  They use the pressure system on the fridge so anything that is taken out gets charged to the room.  The guy at checkout was nice enough to take the items off, but be forewarned about that.The food selection at MotorCity is great.  We enjoyed the Lodge Diner in the MotorCity Casino.  The portions were large for the price we paid.  Plus we had some comps to use, which made it even better.","From the moment of check in,  Rodderick made sure I was taken care of, his staff was very professional. The room is fantastic. Verners on tap,  the Lil Caesar even had riblet side dish.It is not a very nice Casino I feel that the other Casinos in the area are better and cleaner. Way to many people, tables and slots are always crowded, drinks and food are not that great,  and the people are not very nice either. stick to the other casinos in the area they are a lot nicer in my opinion.I've only stayed at the Motor City Casino Hotel for free comp nights after joining their Club Metro. I've stayed there four or five times and each experience has been okay.The rooms are kinda swanky. There's a nice tub, the toiletries smell wonderful. Half of the time, my bathroom has been missing the hair dryer though.The view is... not so great. Most of the rooms face the parking lot for the hotel and Detroit/Windsor doesn't really have pretty skylines.Check in and check out is very easy. The robe provided is not as luxurious as you would hope, and it's pretty amusing that they offer it for $100. I've seen nicer robes at TJ Maxx for $15.If you ever want to spend a night in Detroit to unwind, I definitely recommend taking a bath at this hotel. Hotel has free wifi which is a perk! Parking is kind of weird, you can do the 'free' valet (or tippig), or you can park on the roof of the hotel parking garage by turning left before the valet. You can also park in the casino parking, but it'll be a further walk to check-in.Fantastic bathroom; a shower and a great tub. Plus enclosed toilet with its own door. Bed was very comfortable. Downside, lot of tacky locals trolling around having loud conversations.  Would recommend if your in the D.the butthole of detroit casinos. this place is so tacky and so gross. it smells like your grandma who smokes three packs of cigs a day's morning breath. the best part is being herded into metal detectors. yay! oh and you cannot breathe in here. seriously. it is impossible.they have crappy slot machines too. love, justonThis place is a must visit 5 star every thing rooms r really nice bathrooms r to die for they hav a marble walk n shower like plus a bath tub deep enough for 2 n u can't enter the hotel without security check in u out. The food is also good frm the deli sandwiches to the buffet style restaurant. And the casino who don't like to gamble lol fun fun fun is all ima sayThe most egregious problem we encountered was with the bellman, who put his hands on a member of our party and spoke to us very disrespectfully. We filed a complaint with security. Other than that, rude rude rude and ridiculous rules. We weren't able to have outside food brought up to our room (cake).  I had to speak with the manager to get a refrigerator for a medical necessity; the front desk woman insisted it would be a $20 charge. It turned out that I had to use the minibar fridge because the manager admitted they didn't have any fridges they could provide me. I spoke with 2 managers over the course of our one night stay and they were pleasant but did not go over and above to address the issues we were having. It was clear that they have no regard for customer service. There are lots of security measures in place, which is understandable for a casino hotel, but it is a little unsettling. They could stand to make their atmosphere more welcoming instead of like a lockdown environment. You pay them pretty well to be treated (in our case, physically reprimanded) like children. The room itself showed signs of wear. We were comfortable in the room and slept well but we will not be staying here again.I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this place, because I thought the hotel was wonderful! Very luxurious, and at an affordable price! I can't get over how incredible the bathroom area was...that deep tub is to die for! We stayed using the Stay&amp;Play package after the Chippendales show...so glad we made that decision! The Sound Board is an awesome venue as well! I will absolutely be staying at this hotel again AND seeing more shows at the Sound Board. Well done, Motor City!Nice Hotel!!! Front Desk Staff are very much so helpful... However, I'm here during the week a stay cation I would say ( my Bday)...I have to work in the morning (work downtown) so I'm here for the rest definitely... I literally cannot sleep I hear everything every conversation, every door knock, every shower door close... even the toilet flush!!! This was cheaply made not a sound proof room!!!!If you need to lay up during a weekend this is the place....We won a room with their ""play for an hour"" deal. Since the room was free, I was expecting something pretty basic. Thankfully that wasn't the case.While we didn't get our preferred view of downtown, the room was lovely. I specially enjoyed the soaker tub (too bad it wasn't jetted). Another disappointment was the lack of a small fridge. Since it was just overnite,  it wasn't a HUGE deal. Next visit I will definitely bring a small cooler. Check in took 20+ minutes but went smooth once it was our turn.We were on the 12 th floor but it didn't feel like 12 stories up (lol).It's our anniversary and we decided to come to the ""dirty city casino"" we requested a high floor room and was placed on the third floor. Went back to the desk and asked to have a higher floor and was place on the fourth floor room 423. When we walked in room 423 it smelled like a dirty gym! The curtains was dirty, floor dirty! I immediately called the front desk and was told that someone would come up. After waiting for awhile we decided to walk back dow. We was half ass greeted by the ""manager keith""! We told him the room med nasty and the curtains and floor was nasty! HE said he would go check it out. He went up and came back to say he didn't smell a thing and he wasn't changing our room again! I said again????? He said yes your original room was 318 and we changed it to 423. I said we never went to room 318! HE proceeded to be argumentative with us and stated you guys are not getting a different room and your key cards Wil be at the front desk!  My husband said well just give us our money back and we will leave!!!!!!! Keith said no because you paid through Expedia! !! First of all it was through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and it was a total of $140.00 THAT WE PAID AT THE HOTEL KEITH FYI!!!! WE ASK TO SPEAK TO A HIGHER MANAGER AND HE SAID HE'S THE HIGHER MANAGER!! HE said he will send the housekeeping manager up to spray the room but he will not be changing our room! Well guess what the housekeeping manager did meet us back up to room 423 and said the room smells like a coney island and body order! But prior to that I knocked on room 415 and ask them to Please come with me and smell our room!!!:well he did and he said it smells like a nasty gym. He also went on to say that this happen to him to and they came up and sprayed the room. The house keeping manager Hunter was very nice and he switched our room to room 430 which was better but not worth $140 maybe motel 6 price or cheaper.  Hunter said we should at least be comp for a meal or something and to call keith to see if he would comp us. My husband called back down to the front desk and spoke with keith and Keith say  NO comp because he didn't smell a thing and he's sorry for us that he didn't smell nothing and that's the best apology he can give and goodbye! !! Keith need a class in customer service asap!! Keith FYI you shouldn't make your paying guest feel like crap on their important day!! Take time out and listen and try to make it right! ! I almost allowed you to totally ruin my day but thanks to one of the security staff being helpful and also smelling the room and said it smelled like sex and body order I knew I wasn't crazy!  IF I could give this nasty hotel a negative 3 stars I would  and Keith would be the main reason why! Oh and also when we arrived in our room 430 the Pringle was eaten by the past guest! I immediately found one of the staff members and told them and they came in the room and called the front desk to notify them. We also had long hair on the toilet seat. People this is not the place to stay for any reason!!!!! Today is Thursday April 23rd and I can't wait to check the fu@k out of here! One of the front desk staff members did give me the name of the top manager and it wasn't keith! Buyer beware of keith is working the day to want to come run to mgm!!!! WE did read a prior post that keith was involved in that didn't turn out well! So please read the reviews and call the hotel and  ask them how did they deal with prior past bad reviews...I will be contacting higher up to discuss my issues and suggest better ways with dealing with unhappy guest!! I have seen keith name a numerous times and I wish I had truly did my research before wasting our time at this dirty hotel with awful customer service. I was told to speak with Fred Isaiah.  I believe that's how you spell his last name. The people at the front desk including keith would not give me corporate number. Happy anniversary to the Weathers next time we will definitely go out of state or back to the gran hotel in Traverse city great front desk, manager and customer service!!!!I always come to the motor city casino when I come home on leave  and on this particular occasion, I learned that at the Motor City Casino Hotel,the employee is always right rather than the customer.  My husband and I visited last night and from beginning to end ,I felt that we were being disrespected and as far as profiled.  The original clerk was rude and gave us room keys that did not work. We came back down to get them replaced and there was no one at the counter.  I took a seat and my husband waited patiently.  He even asked the security guard to call someone and his attempt failed. My husband continued to wait and other people approaches the desk and began to wait as well. When someone finally came to the desk, she walked past my husband.  He continued to wait until she finally asked if he had been helped and he told her that he hadn't and that he had actually been waiting longer than the other people. She shrugged and said,  ""well i didnt know"". After a few more minutes, she asked what he needed and when he said he'd prefer if someone else helped him,she became more rude and obnoxious and told him there was no one else that could help him.  When he mentioned a gentleman we saw earlier she told him that he was new and wouldn't know how to help him, and then she walked away. When she returned minutes later she asked if he wanted her help and when he said no she shrugged and he cursed at her. As soon as he did, there was all of a sudden an entire crew of people out there to help.  The guy who allegedly was new and incapable of helping us turned out to be the manager. I hate people who use race as an excuse for everything, but when this white male spoke to me,he spoke condescendingly, told me he didn't care what happened and that all that mattered was that his employee was disrespected.  He told the security that we were irate and needed to leave. His name was Keith and when i asked the females name,she flipped her name tag and Keith told me her name didnt matter.  when i threatened to call corporate he told me he didnt care as long as I left.  When I called the next morning, they told me that Keith made a note saying that we were irate and that security got involved, even though the security got involved because we asked the security for help.  We returned the next day for an entirely different reservation and Matt nicely escorted us to security to have THEM tell us they we are not to return ever again. They told us that their cameras have no audio and that they can't prove what was said, which is BS from an establishment that makes so much money. We feel disrespected and feel as if we were profiled and I won't stop until someone has even attempted to hear our side.Motor City revoked my reservation and ruined my first year wedding anniversary. Terrible experience.Love the rooms, unique and classy. Great customer service. I asked where the closest dry cleaners was and they offered to clean and fold/hang my laundry for me. Definitely my favorite casino/hotel to stay at in Detroit.Maybe the ceilings were too low but I felt claustrophobic there. There was no flow when walking around the casino floor. Just did not have a good casino feeling with high ceilings so the smoke is not too much, where you can actually walk completely around the casino without having to backtrack because you walked into a dead end.If that does not bother you, you may enjoy it.For the price of the room and drinks (in casino) I expected good service...sadly no.Some reasons why we won't be going back:Dirty room. Someone's wig/weave tangles were stuck to the shower wall, the soap dish was not only dirty but moldy, the room was dusty in general and two of the lamps in the room were broken. Sheets smelled like chemicals and were really uncomfortable. The towels were all falling apart at the edges. Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto.Poor service. Only two staff at the check in, line was very long. Someone dropped a large bottle of red wine near the elevators and the staff member activating key cards was dealing with that mess while trying to assist customers. He was flustered and acted as if we were an inconvenience for key activation.I explained the room conditions upon check out and staff was indifferent stating "" OK I'll let the housekeepers know."" This was more of a management issue if you ask me...dissatisfied customers should be attended to by management and reassured it won't happen next time. We won't be staying downtown at Motor City again.UPDATE: Called hotel to speak with manager who stated he would let housekeeping management know about the unsanitary conditions of the room. Was told x3 during phone call that I should have said something right away about the room conditions. They Don't Care. It is now very clear that expectation IS NOT that the room be clean upon your arrival, but rather that if you have an issue it is your responsibility to correct it.I had gotten a free room for playing for an hour at the casino.. Awesome Awesome Room!! On the 10th floor.. The room was beautiful, my favorite part was the bathtub! It was so deep and refreshing!! I will definitely return.. Restaurant wise.. Went to Little Caesars expecting the same food from outside of here.. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The Italian Cheese Bread.. Nothing Italian About That!! Room Service.. SuperDuperPricey!!Its the A.M. And the housekeeping staff is soooooo noisy..Overrall this visit gets a 10!!!Disclaimer - this review for MCH is just for the hotel portion.The lobby and entrance are both very elegant and welcoming to visitors. The check in process was very quick. The hotel room exceeded my expectations. The King sized bed and pillows were super comfortable, and I love that the large bathroom was clean, well lit, and has a separate tub and walk-in shower. I decided to get a room for me and me only, in order to ""fall off the grid"" from the rest of the world, so I bought a package that includes money to spend at the restaurants. The beautiful thing is that you can spend the money on room service as well, and you can order room service using your TV/remote. That was so cool! Guess who has 2 thumbs and was watching the World Series while dining on a NY Strip with veggies and mashed potatoes, drinking wine, and sitting on the King Size bed 3 feet away from the TV? (Me!!) Of course, you do get what you pay for. Since I paid so little and got so much, my view from the hotel room was the top floor of the parking structure. For my purposes, it was a non-issue. Valet parking is complimentary and super convenient. There's a kiosk inside the hotel on the way out towards the parking structure where you can scan your ticket and your car will be brought to you. The valet staff is very friendly and very efficient. I look forward to ""falling off the grid"" at the MCH again, perhaps even making it into an annual tradition.The hotel itself is very nice.  I really liked the bathroom, and the provided toiletries were really high quality and smelled fantastic. Also a plus?  The free shuttle to the Tigers game. You only have to sign up for Club Metro and swipe your card at a kiosk.The surrounding neighborhood is less than desirable.  The casino's motto is something like ""keeping what's outside out"". Literally. The ""outside"" is burnt out buildings and liquor stores. Desolate.There is security everywhere.God help you if you forget your room key, you won't make it anywhere near the elevator bank. Make sure you get everyone's name on the room so they can go to to front desk to get a replacement.  (No, having the same last name is not good enough)Ate at the buffet for breakfast,  I recommend the motor city fried chicken, and there was a ton of fresh fruit. $14 was pretty reasonable,  and our server Jason was really friendly.If you bid for a 4.5 star property on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a>,  this is more than likely the property you will get. It was worth the $113.About a month ago, I played an hour in the casino for the ""Play an Hour, Stay a Night"" promo. I was very skeptical about it, because it seemed almost too good to be true. I stayed on one slot pretty much the whole time, and actually managed to win most of my money back. So the room cost a grand total of $1.02.Almost every weekend we tried to reserve was booked, so we decided to go in the middle of the week. We had the deluxe king room on the 6th floor. It was a pretty nice view, and the room was surprisingly very nice and luxurious.I was surprised that there was no kitchen, not even a refrigerator in the room. That was our biggest complaint, but since we were only there for a night, it didn't affect us too much.The bathroom was really nice, with a spacious shower and deep bathtub. I'm all about going green and saving the environment, but the sign noting that they don't wash all of their towels unless you leave them on the counter or floor kind of made me a little uncomfortable. How easy would it be for someone to just refold a dirty towel and put it back? Ew.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. The TV was great, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the pillows were very soft. I would definitely go back!","Home run.  This place was inexpensive, the room was very nice and the staff were either exceptionally kind, helpful, hilarious or all three.  Free parking and everything else you might need.  Close to everything downtown.  Highly recommend.My husband and I had an amazing experience! The room was clean, big and very modern. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. We had dinner at the Assembly Line and everything tasted great and was hot. But most importantly all of the staff we encountered was very friendly, from the check in desk, to the restaurant, to the casino floor and bell hops! When we booked online we said the reason we were staying was for my husband's birthday and there was a cupcake and a happy birthday note waiting for him when we got to the room. We went to a Tigers game and the stadium was in walking distance. This will be our new go to hotel when staying in Detroit! Worth every penny!I have stayed at the hotel multiple times this year and it has progressively been getting worse and worse. Stayed there last night. Carpet was filthy. Walls were dirty. Both bathrooms and the shower had clumps of long hair left in them.  The towel rack was broken. Towels were filthy and ripped. I would expect this at a motel 6, but not at a 4 star hotel. There was an earing left in the closet. Just overall disappointing.  And it was not a comp room or anything like that. This room was paid for.I was very impressed with the MotorCity Casino Hotel accommodations. The attention to detail for the room/lobby details is incredible--they are very high end.  Very sophisticated touches of marble, modern wood finishes, and  contemporary light fixtures-the interior design is very well done across the board.I absolutely loved the very large bathroom area and toiletry offerings in the room as well.  I would absolutely love to come back for a relaxing weekend get away.This is a great stay. The personel are friendly, hotel isclean, and a fun place to stay at with a number of choices of food and bars. The only bad thing is their lg tv that we have in the room it's a little difficult to work.No no no no no nooooooo terrible service! Dont come here to stay. Just don't! The customer service was a joke! And looked very trashy! Not helpful and bad attitudes!Our room wasn't ready at the 4pm check in.. so we ended up in a double suite instead of the king suite we booked. The room was dirty. The sound board was a nice venue.. with terrible beer selection. I'll never stay there again.The upgraded review is because the management apologized profusely the next morning and comped me for one night's stay.  It didn't return the lost night's sleep but it helped to diminish my ire somewhat.I haven't even been down to the casino, but room is comfortable and beautiful.  The bathtub is long enough to stretch out and deep enough to soak.  I'm in love with this tub.  The bed was comfortable and the floor we were on was very quiet.  I've enjoyed my stay and will be coming back.One of these days I may be try the restaurants and casino.Just an additional note, I received a note from their staff about sharing my comments with their engineering and room service departments. It was good customer service of them to respond and pass along my comments.This is a real Detroit operation.  It took 15 minutes to talk to a check-in clerk, even though I was next in line.  Upon being met by a clerk, an angry lunatic in the back of the line yelled that I'd cut in front of her.  Oy.  Anyhow, they had no record of my name, and it took 15 more minutes to get my room keys.  The room itself was quite nice.  I had such a wonderful, albeit short, sleep on the king sized bed.  The shower was great (perfect shower-singing acoustics).  The bathtub, which I didn't use, didn't look clean.  The view of the Ambassador bridge was lovely.  Additionally, since the room was a comp, it was a hell of a value.Valet was quick and professional, and the staff, despite their slowness were nice.  As for the casino portion, it is smokey and depressing, except for the music stage, where they were playing funk music with lots of booty shaking.  That's my new hangout.Living so close to Atlantic city casinos, we decided to stay here because of their casino. The rooms were nice and a decent price, and the bathrooms were great. We loved the Iridescence restaurant, it was one of the better meals we have had. Unfortunately, we didn't enjoy the casino much because there isn't a smoking section, and for someone who doesn't, it's hard to breathe. The whole casino was a cloud of smoke.. We would have enjoyed everything if they made a specific location for smokers.Stayed here for a conference in April and was pretty happy with the experience. It was a regional chef conference, so it was upon the casino to serve some discerning palates and for the most part, they really succeeded. Honestly, the worst meal was our final night ""gala."" The sides and salads were good, but the steak served as the main dish was pretty awful. Their head pastry chef coaches the US Olympic food competition team and is rather great, so make sure you take advantage and order dessert whenever you're here. The rooms were big and cozy, but the hotel overall was loud. The doors to every room slam rather loudly, so if you're in a room next to a late night couple, as we were, you'll be hearing that over and over. The entry and bathroom are fully tiled floor to ceiling, so if the people next to you spend time there being loud and drunk, like we did, you'll hear every word with no problem. We also heard a lot of noise from the hallway. I guess I was just surprised that the rooms weren't a bit more sound proof. I literally could have joined my neighbor's conversation, that's how well the sound traveled. And they really, really need to find a way to dampen the doors. There's no reason for them to be able to slam that loud in a hotel. Poor, poor service to your customer, there. The only fridge in the room is stocked with mini bar items which are on a sensor and if you even move one, you'll be charged. You can rent an additional fridge, but I think it was $25 a day. A hotel of this magnitude should be offering an in-room fridge without charging for it. If the Comfort Suites can do it, so can you. I'm certainly paying enough for it. There also were no electrical outlets in the bathroom. They provided a hair dryer, but I had to go out into the room and use it. It was really inconvenient. I don't need a mirror to dry my hair, but if you were using a straightener or curling iron, you'd be doing it blind. Very, very strange. That being said, I wanted to steal the bathroom and take it home with me. Gorgeous, giant bath tub. Separate walk-in shower. Beautiful. Iridescence, the bar on the top floor, was pretty cool and gives you amazing views of the city. Drinks were really interesting and prices in line with what you'd pay for a top martini. The casino itself was just ok for me. I'm not a huge gambler and therefore don't spend a lot of money. There were no table games less than $15 a hand the whole time we were there. I asked if they ever went down and they told me I could come down and check around 5 am on Sunday and there might be lower minimums - no thanks! There was a wide selection of slots, from the standard old-school to the more computer-generated, interactive ones. The location was also nice. We had an event at Tiger Stadium and went to dinner off-site two times and none of those drives was more than a few minutes. Parking was free for guests. One odd parking quirk - if you don't valet you park up a flight and there's no elevator. If you're trying to move suitcases, that can be an issue. Once we figured it out we just brought the car down and loaded it in the valet area, but it did seem like they really wanted to force you into valet.Love Motor City Best comps of the three casinos in Detroit.  Not mention locally owned.  Love Mike IllitchI've been to a lot of casinos this one is by far the worst. The staff is very unprofessional especially if you play craps. they hold conversations while dealing and constantly miss payouts, they also don't mind cursing you out when you let them know they missed your bet and the pit boss just sit there like a idiot. most weekend nights is gonna be rowdy and fights. I've been here a few times and it's always the same. greektown is much better or mgm. if you don't believe me just go by the time you make it the security line you will think of this review.Disappointed, we were never able to use our comped room. We called several weekends in a row ( until expiration) and there were never any ""available"" rooms. We have stayed at this casino previously and thought that the rooms were clean and roomy.this local casino has a fabulous buffet.  check the specials to see when it's priced on special.  the casino is a casino.  the entertainment is good if you know who you're going to see. check the schedule and get there early to get a good seat if you like to be upfront.Overall we had a great experience at Motor City Casino.  The rooms are modern and the views of Detroit city highline are spectacular!  Each room has a huge soaking tub, separate shower and toilet. (which is nice when you are sharing a room)   Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint was the food.  It was all just okay, 3 stars at best.  It seems like they just use the same ingredients for all the restaurants so there is very little variety, and minimal vegetarian selections.   One thing I thought was awesome was in the bar you can order a signature drink and get a souvenir item for just a few bucks more. For example, I ordered an old fashioned and got a Motor City Casino flask for $5.  Pretty sweet! I'm looking forward to coming back in a couple weeks.Review of the HOTEL only.My first stay here was when I got a ""free"" room from the players' club.  Room looked nice if you didn't get too close to anything, but it was dirty!!!  White stain on the bed throw, dirty throw pillow stacked right on top of the pillows you actually sleep on, white stains on the fabric-covered chairs, everything was STICKY.  The drawers and cupboards all have these handles shaped like upturned cups, and they are all sticky and filled with crud and hair.  I stuffed a tissue down in each one rather then touch them.  The handle on the minifridge was particularly sticky and gross.  There were greasy smudges on the window, marks all over the walls, dust caked on the bulkhead above the bed where the blower hits it, smudges and stains on the headboard that were kinda gross.  The bathroom was very clean, except for the door to the toilet room was splashed with something brown and gross.  The pillowcases were tattered at the edges.  Tiles in the bathroom floor were broken.  Every corner everywhere except in the bathroom was caked with dust.  Bed was very comfortable, but it was hard to relax amongst all the stains and filth.I was sure they meant to do better, so I made a list of all the issues and asked the front desk staff to give it to the head of housekeeping.  They asked me to give them another chance, and I said if I got another ""free"" night from the players' club, I would, but I would not pay their crazy price to stay there based on this experience. So a few months later, I got another ""free"" room coupon.  I thought I'd give it another try.  This room had many of the same problems, suggesting systemic breakdown in housekeeping.  Again, there were stains and stickiness everywhere (walls, floor, window, drawer handles).  My friend stepped on a wet spot on the carpet in his socks and was quite grossed out.  Same tattered pillowcases.  Some previous occupant had left an open package of lunch meat and yogurt in the minifridge (so I guess they don't check it daily like the guest information book says).  There was something gross and brown caked onto the tile floor in the entryway and the bathroom.  Again, the door to the toilet room was splashed with some brown grossness.  There was no garbage can in the bathroom, which was inconvenient.  I called and asked for an ice bucket to chill our bottles because there wasn't one in the room.  Half an hour later, someone finally brought one, but it had obvious sticky grossness on the lid.  He handed it to me and I pointed out that it was dirty, and he just walked away.  And they had already opened the plastic bag liner and put some dirty sticky ice tongs in it, so there was nothing sanitary to use to line the ice bucket.  Just bothered me that the guy didn't notice the whole way upstairs that the bucket was dirty, but I noticed right away. He must not have cared enough to look. I didn't even bother telling the front desk this time.  The first dirty room wasn't a fluke.  They aren't concerned about maintaining standards.  The place looks nice and swanky from a distance, but no one there can be bothered to give a damn about cleanliness and quality guest service.  The place needs a serious cleaning, and the housekeeping supervisors need to have their staff follow a strict checklist for cleaning and check up on them to make sure they are doing it thoroughly.  Apparently, extreme laziness and doing the bare minimum is the default modus operandi.  Maybe they need to pay more to attract better staff.  Time to wash the windows and walls and get some new garbage cans that aren't all bent to heck.  In short, this could be a fancy and luxurious place to stay, but it's painfully obvious that no one cares about cleaning and maintenance.  Before you pay to stay, go to any cheap chain hotel for a cleaner room, fewer bodily fluids smeared about, and better service.This is a ghetto hotel. If you don't mind being treated like you are a ghetto person, then this hotel will suit you fine. Check in was not very friendly.  The lady made no eye contact until she completed asking if we had stayed there before.  Only then did she look up and say 'Welcome to .....""  It was like taking a number at the Secretary of State office.  You get your key which you have to show to the security guy EVERY TIME you want to enter the hotel elevators (ghetto). Linens on the bed were very wrinkly. Aside from that the room was decent-bed was comfy. Somebody actually knocked on the door to stock the mini bar.  The robes looked like they'd been hanging in the bathroom forever.  The view was the view, nothing special just alot of cars, the Ambassador Bridge, and MGM (sigh).  The saddest part is that aside from free wi-fi(didn't really use it) this hotel offers no special hospitality perks especially to guests who aren't staying in ""executive"" rooms. You can not get bath salt or complimentary continental breakfast if you are a ""regular"" guest.  The elevator will lock and will not let you onto the ""breakfast floor"", but I saw some executive guests get locked out of the breakfast floor as well.  The meanest part was the non allowance of a late check out.  Really??  Remember that $50 deposit?  Well they can keep that if you want to check out at 1pm instead of 11am.  Gee thanks Motor City, guess I'll check out on time.  I called close to 11am to let the desk know we were on our way down to check out.  Most other hotel front desk employees have a smile in their voices.  There was just a long pause like ""OK whatever bye"".   Then onto the check out welfare line which was so long the security hotel guy had to tell us to stand by the wall.  I would probably try another hotel before coming back here or just get the executive room and keep my expectations low. Update 07/2015- I upgraded to 4 stars.  Something about staying here using the comps and the incredible bath and body products.  I have really started to like this place.  The beds are nice and soft, the tub is like a mini pool, and the food here is really good.  Also, the upper levels offer free continental breakfast with a selection of newspapers.  The rooms are super comfortable.","This hotel is 15 years old and shows its age,carpet are stained and very worn out in the hallways. Very surprised that the Ilitch family would let this hotel get to this point. Casino area is very smokey.  Most of the staff was very polite and courteous. Buffet was a 28.00 and the food was average. Our company paid for the room so I personally would not spend the high price of staying here until it was updated.DOG OWNERS BEWARE!!! MotorCity charges a $125 per night pet FEE for each dog which is NON-REFUNDABLE! NEVER  have I paid that much!I would have to say just ""ok"" overall.  Room was pretty nice, but a few things really bugged me.  The shower smelled like urine for one, and the king mattress did not have a mattress pad or a fitted sheet-- only a flat sheet draped over it.  The layout of the room and furniture were very nice, and the bathroom ( other than the initial shower smell ) was one of the better I've been in.  Awesome tub and separate shower, and toilet room.  Really nice and unique fixtures.  The staff seemed professional, and the casino was what you would expect.Very very nice Hotel. We went to a tigers game the shuttle bus driver was full of fun. The hotel was clean staff so friendly and lots of smiles. The casino had an atmosphere like no other casino you do have to be careful in there only complaint as it is Detroit. Staff in Casino so very helpful as well as hotel. Did not see any big wins. But a very fun place to go..great music worth every dollar..we loved the place.Went for the best of metro times 2010 party. That was awesome. The casino itself meh! Ive expierenced way better just across the road at MGM.The layout of the casino is confusing anf the ceilings are so low you could not see over anything to know where anything was.Granted the valet and greeter at the hotel itself was super.The dining choices were odd.I guess I'm just spoiled by MGM. I was just not impressed.There are good points and bad points about this casino.  Four of us stayed here for two nights.  Checking in was a breeze. Super easy, hassle free.  The gentleman who showed us the amenities of the room, Mike Carter, was amazing!!! He really paid attention to detail, got us ice, made us feel like celebrities, not tired cranky football fans.  The rooms are spectacular, the quality exceeds most rooms in Vegas. The beds are very comfortable, like sleeping on a fluffy cloud, but TINY.  For spending $210.00 a night I would rather have a bigger bed and a less majestic bathroom.  If you are sharing the bed, my advice is make sure you are in love.  I would like to take the bathroom home with me, it's really nice, but the water pressure is terrible, one comment that was made, "" the water pressure is awful, even after rinsing off for ten minutes I still feel scuzzy.""  Who says scuzzy??? I like the idea of the parking sensors, but there were a lot of green (park here, it's empty!) lights, that definitely were malfunctioning...unless I am seeing cars that don't exist.  My advice look for lots of green lights clustered together in the parking garages.  There is also no clear traffic pattern in the parking garages but I am a woman and you know what they say about woman drivers...  I didn't go to the casino, not because I think gambling is sinful, but because I heard its not that great.  I can't comment on it from my own experience but the couple we went with was unimpressed. They didn't like it and they are one major gambling loss away from joining Gamblers Anonymous.  They know their way around a good casino, this apparently wasn't one of them.Let's talk turkey...they had it at the Assembly Line Buffet. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Yes! My friend ate his weight in shrimp.  Not little tiny shrimp, decent sized, meaty shrimp. The buffet costs $26.00. You can get sushi, pasta, pizza, turkey, roast beef, stir fry, salad, soup and its all delicious!  I am telling you they make these popover brioche rolls that melt in your mouth.  I will dream about these rolls. The mashed potatoes are real.  We all loved the food. The dessert station assaults you first so you remember to save room for it.  That is pretty much where my positive food review ends.  The overpriced mediocre food is why I gave this place three stars.   You are kind of stuck with the food options here unless you want to venture out.  The Lodge Diner open 24 hours has a small menu, you can get an omelet for $12.00, WHAT A DEAL, not really. The $8.00 pancakes were pretty delicious. The oj was watered down so much it was like drinking orange colored water. I ordered a side of scrambled eggs, they were tasteless and slimy. We tried to order breakfast from the little pastry kiosk that said on the menu they had bagels and breakfast sandwiches...which they didn't have.  We were trying to order breakfast on a Sunday at 9am.  I doubt the gambling crowd was up that early and they ran out. Coffee and cupcakes for breakfast, anyone? Come on seriously???They have a deli here too! Would you like to pay $12.00 for a turkey and cheese sandwich?  You get your choice of bread! Not me.  So we went to Little Caesars across the hall. There you will pay $14.00 for a pizza barely one step above frozen pizza.  We happened to have taken our sweet time getting around to eating the pizza, when we did open it, it was the wrong kind. I took it back, they gave me a hot pizza but what really disturbed me is, the lady working the counter, took my wrong pizza, which I had in my possession for at least 5 minutes and put it on another tray to give to someone else!!! Are you kidding me? You just gave my lukewarm pizza that I could have done ANYTHING to, spit on it, sprinkled broken glass on if I was a crazy psycho and they just gave it to another customer??? Gross!!!!! You can bet your sweet bippy (once you figure out what a bippy is) I will be writing to the manager about that!This hotel also has this amazing feature, you control everything in your room through the tv!! The housekeeping, the do not disturb, the temperature, wake up calls, I mean everything! And the coolest thing (I would assume) is a pillow library. Yes. There are 13 different kinds of pillows you can order! We tried to take advantage of this feature, but we either suck at life or the hotel only has one of each pillow, because both nights they had no pillows available. Here are my suggestions: Dear Motor City Casino, buy more pillows to satisfactorily meet your guests dreamy time needs OR put us on a waiting list, so if we order a pillow and its not available at the time we order it, we will get one once one gets turned in. Sincerely, Sleepless in a Small Bed with Ordinary Pillows in Detroit.My boyfriend and I stayed here last weekend for a mini getaway, and I'm glad we chose MCC. The valet and hotel staff were friendly, welcoming, professional, and efficient. Initially, parking for the hotel can be confusing. You don't expect valet for the hotel to be on the 2nd floor of a parking structure so it's a tad counter intuitive. I got a good deal from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, so we booked a deluxe double (the only rooms available at the time) for two nights. The beds were a little small, but totally fine for the purpose they served. The room was nice -- clean, modern, kept up well. The bathroom was beautiful, large soaking tub, nice rain shower, and cool fixtures. The view we had wasn't as great as I imagined, we looked out over the parking lot and beyond onto the expressway and Detroit, but it was still nice. Actually, the view of the parking lot became one of my favorite parts of the room, as it allowed for some spectacular people watching. Neither of us are gamblers but the casino was packed all weekend. If you don't like noise, bright lights, smoke, a few crazies, and large groups of people, gamble elsewhere. Otherwise, if you're not bothered by it (we weren't) it's a decent place to spend some time. The casino/hotel are separated nicely, so there isn't any carry over of gamblers who aren't hotel guests. You need a room key checked before entering the elevator corridor and there are will directed signs to help direct the flow of people to their desired area.The restaurants in the casino are ok. After some drinks we ate at The Lodge Diner which was basic, but again, served its purpose. The room service we ordered for some breakfast in bed was really good. Try the Cap'n Crunch french toast! For the price, MCC is a good deal. You can stay at hotels closer to the heart of downtown but the price difference is drastically higher. I'll definitely stay there again.This is the best of the three casinos in Detroit.  No smoke smell in the hotel at all.  Beautiful rooms.  Great service.I stay here about once a month, the hotel rooms are very nice, I love the Superior king corner.  There are some some very minor imperfections in the rooms, the TV's in the room have burn in (which is partially the casinos fault for having them default to a static message when they turn on) Workmanship can be spotty (poor grout, doors off alignment) The guest room doors are also surprisingly heavy but if someone is outside the room talking you can here them.  Beyond that the front desk staff is always polite.  The casino staff is also nice.  They move their machines around very often and consistently add new games. The players club is ok, they portray it as having great flexibility, but in reality it can be a bit rigid, for example every month I receive a free hotel room. While I appreciate the offer a free room is not necessarily what I want. The room has an estimated value of $89 (to clean,service, etc.)  However I'd love to get a free pass or two to the buffet (SRP - $29/40) so they are essentially losing money by offering a perk that is somewhat expensive. I live in Clinton Township staying in the hotel is not a huge perk, as from an amenities stand point, there is no theater with shows on a daily basis, no pool, it's just a casino/hotel.  If you want a great hotel to come relax, and gamble this is a perfect place to visit. From the moment I park (They have this amazing parking system that has a very accurate space monitor that goes from red (occupied) to green (space open) to when I leave I have a great time. Side note - I have horrible ATT cell phone reception in here.  It pushes me onto the Canadian side of the service often.first time around found it amazing would have given 4 stars at least.stayed 2nd time around and was disappointed.the bathroom was clean but when entered the room there was a kleenex on the bed.and it needed a good vacumming in the corners.the carpet in the hallway was very stained.first time 3rd floor where we got our 2 free rooms2nd time 5th floor not so goodguess 2nd time is not a charmI dont understand why people are hating on Motor City. Its not in that bad of an area. Youre only scared because your a scared person. Nothings ever happened to you personally, youre writing a review so youre obviously alive, if only brain dead.I stayed here 2 days 1 night. Its clean, the staff is friendly, free valet. I wish they had less slots and more tables but whatever works for them. Its not too smokey, youre just too sensitive. Its loud, its bright ITS A CASINO! It doesnt smell like guido, the rooms are totally comfortable and clean. The buffet and restaurant on top floor are great. Theres not many people on the floors to help but maybe you should realize youre in a casino and figure stuff out yourself. Cant help the helpless.I had an awesome time. Dont let these fools fool you. Ill be back, I have been back, and Ill keep going back.This is a nice hotel. But it is impossible to get a good night's sleep here if you do not have/cannot wear earplugs. The doors do not close, they slam. And the sound echoes down the entire hallway. Since the hotel caters to a 24 hour crowd, this happens approximately every five minutes all night long.  It's ultimately a design flaw (due in part to tiled entries), so there's not much that can be done about it. Frankly, it doesn't matter how pretty the room is, its basic function is to provide sleeping quarters, so the door situation is an utter failure.  The echo problem, of course, also applies to hallway conversation, which will generally interrupt your efforts to sleep until sometime between 2-4 am. Other than that... The good: Rooms are spacious and nicely appointed. The panoramic view of the city from the room is great. The fitness room is modern and welcoming.  The self-parking is secure, free, and super convenient.   The bad: Service at the front desk and concierge were lackluster. There should be more attention to housekeeping (dust, fingerprints). I thought this hotel was fairly new, but it is wearing quickly. Specifically, the mattress is sagging and uncomfortable. I was embarrassed for the spa employee who had to tell us that there is a $25 fee per person to use the whirlpool/sauna and that it is separated by gender. What a joke!   While we chose this hotel in Detroit for its modern amenities, we would never return. We need to sleep on our precious few weekends away.The rooms here are AMAZING! It was even a relatively good deal.  As far as the casino goes, its alright. Nothing special.  I didn't find the club scene, so I can't speak for that either.  I wish they gave you free drinks here like they do at Indian casinos, but you can't win them all.The rooms were wonderful!  We did not have any noise problems, the bed was very comfortable, and the modern amenities were nice.  The free Wifi worked well (although you have to constantly approve their user agreement anytime you momentarily disconnect - annoying on an iPhone or iPad).  You can even control the temperature of your room from the TV, and set the DND light from your TV as well (handy for the extra lazy).  Room service was affordable in comparison to other hotels of this caliber.    The wireless phone that works anywhere in the building was handy.  Finally, the shower and deep bathtub were worth giving a try.Now, I am not a big fan of the city of Detroit, but I have to go there every so often for work. This was the first time that I had the chance to stay downtown since our company headquarters moved downtown.My first 5 choices were all booked, so the last choice on my list was the Motor City Casino/Hotel.The only reason I do not give it a 5 star rating is that it is not exactly in the most wonderful area of Detroit. If anything it was in a section of town that I would be found dead in if I walked at night. That being said, if I can say there is a jewel in the middle of a waste heap, the motor city casino is it. The minute I finally got off the road and entered the establishment ( and that was no easy feat as I had problems finding the entrance way). It was clean, it was not crowded, everything looked nice and I felt safe, which being in Detroit is not an easy thing.The room was possibly larger than my condo in CA, the bed was possibly the softest bed I ever slept in, the room was just amazing. They had a full fledged bathtub and a separate shower, with a very nice and comfortable robe they threw in for my stay.Being stuck in the casino for dinner and sometimes lunch, I found the prices to be a little bit out of site, the food court area had a little sleazers in there. In SD I can get a large Pepperoni for $5, in the casino, for a large pepperoni it was $14... the buffet was slightly above mediocre at best, but decent.If I had to stay there again, it would not be a total loss, though I did have to pay $7 to get to the office every morning via cab. I would not mind staying there again, but only if I had no other option.The spa was nice too.. yes, the thunder went to the spa and got his feet scrubbed down pretty good. I also had a bubble bath every day, I pampered myself while I was there.SMOKE GALORE. ghost-town service. almost hypnotic sound/light environment.The place needs a serious ventilation revamping. It's deathly in there. The slots are fun, but I'm a small-time roller, so don't know what the other games are like. I played 6 bucks on slots and lost it all in 4 minutes... it was entertaining i suppose.The restaurant/bar on the main floor had a great looking menu, but after our server brought waters, we never saw him again. 20 minutes we sat, and then left for the bar instead. Drinks, while pricey, were tasty and not skimpy on the booze. That was a plus.The sheer cacophony of sound and visual overload is almost mesmerizing and deserves a full 4 or 5 minutes of your focussed attention. When you really start isolating the sounds and visual stimuli, the chaos takes on an entirely rational autonomy, the way the random bumbling of ants appears somewhat structured if you stare at them long enough... this in itself was maybe the best part about being in Motor City.My man and I spent a weekend here to go to a lions game. The rooms were great. There was a large comfortable bed, great tub, large bathroom and a nice television. The casino was typical of most others I've seen. The weekend buffet looked nice but the food and service in the buffetbwere very sub par. Overall the room and casino were great but I would definitely skip the buffet.My boyfriend and I made reservations a few weeks ago in one of the deluxe rooms for Valentine's Day.  With both of us living back at home with the family and having zero private time for ourselves we agreed we deserved it.  We priced out a room here, MGM Grand, and Greektown.  We ended up picking a room here because it was the better deal for the price.  Not to mention MGM's room rates were almost double the price for less (boo MGM!).  In the end, and I know this is sad, I wanted the MotorCity Casino's Hotel because at night it lights up pink, purple, and teal.  All three some of my favorite colors. :-) I'd also like to note this was our first time going to any of the casinos in Detroit.Friday night we went here for the 95.5 Single Mingle.  Gordon and I felt we made the right hotel choice because of how nice and clean the interior of the building seemed.  Not to mention the free parking.  It's hard to come by that here in Detroit so that already made me like the place.The club, Amnesia, is very nice on the inside.  Even the security they have are friendly.  The only downside are their drink prices are expensive.  I had only one Amaretto Sour the entire night because that drink alone was $8.00.  Ouch. :-\Valentine's Day we came to check in at 3:00 pm.  There was a huge line to check in but I was impressed at how fast the line moved.  They also had every spot filled at the check-in desk.  I was pleased to see this because nothing angers me more and will make me dock stars faster than to see a business not opening every register, so to speak.  It took us about 15 minute to finally get to the front of the line.  When we did we were told that we were selected for a free complimentary room upgrade.  We must have asked them 5 or 6 times if we were going to be charged the executive suite price because we were worried about it since we could not afford a penny more.  We had the nicest check in guy who kept assuring us that because they were getting more people than they anticipated they had to open up more rooms for other people.  I almost hugged the check in guy.  Honestly, my boyfriend and I have had 6 months straight of bad luck so for us to luck out with the upgrade made our Valentine's Day.The room was absolutely beautiful!!!  The downside is the inflated prices for the in-room fridge service.  $5.00 for a bag of peanut M&amp;M's?  $8.00 for little one shot liquor bottles?  But honestly, we got an executive suite for free so we weren't complaining.  The room and bathrooms were so clean and well taken care of that we loved it.  In fact, before we checked out this afternoon we made sure to try and make cleaning up easy for the maid by keeping everything together.Apparently, when you get an executive suite free hot hors' dourves were served from 5-7 pm and a free breakfast the next morning from 6-10 am was served.  Unfortunately, we did not wake up in time to take advantage of breakfast but we checked out the 5-7 pm food.  They did an amazing job and had a great spread.  It was exciting to try one of everything because we'd never had most of that kind of food before.  It was great!We checked out the casino.  We didn't really spend time there because we're not huge gamblers.  Because it was our first time ever being in a casino we did try the slot machines.  I always wanted to pull a slot-machine lever! :-)  On my boyfriends first time ever he put a dollar bill in and we got $9.00 back.  This was pretty exciting because, as I said, we have had terrible lucky recently.  So thank you well-known rigged computerized slot machines for making us feel slightly lucky today!All in all the experience was amazing.  I would recommend this be the hotel of choice of anyone coming to Detroit.  The staff is very friendly. and their rooms are clean and lavish.  Thank you Motor City and I hope the next time I come we luck out and get an executive suite again!!!  I'd love to be prepared for it next time and have money to spend in the casino.  We all know I love my Hold'em! :-DWe stayed here in a suite to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday. We had a suite on the 15th floor, and on top of being a beautiful view and room, the bed was wicked comfortable! I seriously took note of the bed manufacturer and pillow companies in hopes that I could replicate the same sleep I had at Motorcity.We also made a pit stop at the spa, where we had an amazing massage.I didn't do so well on the slots, and my boyfriend didn't do great at Blackjack or Poker, but the hotel part was comfortable and relaxing, which is what I had been hoping for. The nightclub at Motorcity, Amnesia, had a line waiting to go upstairs via the elevator (16th floor), and they have a decent restaurant selection (expensive/mid priced/fast food).An interesting location as it is really not convenient to much. The rooms were fantastic but the service was poor.  Valet parking was a disaster as it took too long to be parked and get your car.  Check in was nice and the lobby was very nice; what you would expect from a Vegas style casino.  Meals were just OK. The experience at the dining on the 16 th floor was nice but not good enough for the high price.Just seemed like the service was very poor for a location which, because of it's glamorous outside, made you think you were entering a 5 star hotel. I would not run to go back and would only go back if I received a significant discount to the rate.","Had a real good night 100.00 per bet on roulette table. It was a real good night! I also like the atmosphere in the Strut bar. Comfy chairs and real laid back. I could be a regular here.One of my biggest goals since I was a wii-ling young one was to go to Michigan. I did a report on it when I was in 4th grade and this past weekend I was fortunate enough to have that goal achieved at the Motor City Casino &amp; Hotel!This place was super nice. A group of about 12 went and got 3 rooms in the hotel over a weekend. We got an added bonus of $50 in food/drinks per night per room. That pretty much paid for our dinner &amp; breakfast for 4 in each room. The casino itself was pretty big. They had an awesome Pussy Cat Dolls look alike group that played top 40 songs in the Lounge. Let me tell ya we got our groove on for sure. The drinks were decently priced. There was a big assortment of table games, but because it was a Saturday night, they were all quite full. The food court area offers a number of types of meals, from higher scale sit down, buffet, and burger/pizza take out. They even had a espresso stand to keep you betting out on the casino floor!The rooms were beautiful - the bathroom was HUGE (as Paris Hilton would say). Only crappy thing was that they stopped serving alcohol at 2am (boo!). Hard for Chicago-folk to be okay with that considering we have bars that stay open until 5am.Overall - I would definitely return to the swanky place.The nicest building in Detroit?The Motor City Casino was the last stop of the Rental Car Rally from NYC to Detroit.  We got a group rate of $225, which was not bad considering it was split between the 4 of us.Upon entry the entire hotel staff was super friendly and helpful with any questions and directions that you may have / need.  After a 22 hour drive, this is just the kind of service you need.After throwing down the bags we headed straight to the one place a casino is known for - THE BUFFET.  Eat we shall, and eat we did.The selection was huge.  Everything from steak, to pizza, to soups to Chinese food, to more desert than a bakery in NYC.It was definitely a bargain to have so much selection at such a reasonable rate.  In fact, we had such a great time, you can imagine where we went right after we checked out.Straight back to the Buffer for lunch!My boyfriend LOVES to gamble, so for his birthday I booked a night at the Motor City Casino Hotel so he could play video blackjack to all hours of the night without having to worry about driving home afterward (even though we live only about 20 minutes away). I don't spend much time in hotels, and definitely not ones of this caliber, so I may be a bit biased... but everything about our stay was perfect. The staff was friendly, the room was beautiful and clean, and it was definitely worth the money. I am not the biggest casino fan and I even enjoyed the evening there. Motor City offered the best deal out of the other two Detroit casinos, and I can't imagine that Greektown or MGM would have been any better than what we got.Clean room. Comfortable bed. Check out at 11 is too early especially for a casino.... But other than that it's decentWe don't really gamble but I took my husband here for his birthday last weekend. We got a king-size room and it had what I like a hotel room to have: BIG bathroom and room to spread out a little. Each room also had two complimentary bath robes, slippers, q-tips, cotton balls, mini shower gel/lotion/etc....decent view, comfortable bed, lots of linens, LOTS of room to store your clothing if you're there for a longer stay (hanging and in drawers).I liked the modern design of the room and it was clean. We were on the 3rd floor. The mini fridge has no room to store anything you might get for takeout though ~ and there is a warning that if you remove any of the items from the mini bar or other offerings area for more than 45 seconds, it will automatically be charged to your room bill. Are there sensors in there or something? I wasn't going to pay $8 for a little bag of yogurt pretzels...the prices for the stuff were outrageous.We ate at Flames in the hotel, not currently listed on Yelp yet. Good steak and good service. Spent about $100 + tip for 2 steaks, 1 potato side, 1 app, and 1 bottle of wine. We wanted to try the Assembly Line buffet but the line had about 30 people in it before it even opened. Then when it was open and we walked by, the line was wrapped all around. No thanks. I've heard the buffet is good but I wasn't waiting an hour for it.I liked this hotel and what they had to offer...would stay there again. Friendly staff and usually other things /entertainment going on if you don't gamble. Saw a show in the concert room too - nice room for concerts, seating about 1,600 they said.nice clean rooms, I walked around in the complimentary robe like i owned the place lol!i hate it and like it the same way..Hate: Smoking, Slow workers, comps take forever to get for every 100 in slot play you might get $3.00 in comps back :( also the hotel cost to much!!!Love: food, games and hotelIn celebration of the end of my unemployment, my husband and I decided to investigate the packages available and pricing at all three casino/hotels, for an elaborate date night. Motor City definitely had the most bang for your buck, so we booked the Motor City Package (deluxe accommodations, complimentary valet and a $30 credit at any of the eateries) for $199.00 on a Friday.THE HOTEL:  The room was nice, with quite a few amenities, including:  free Wi-Fi, 42"" flat screen (not HD, though), HBO and Showtime, a fully-stocked (outrageously expensive) mini bar ($8 for a short stack of Pringles and $5 for a regular size bag of peanut M&amp;M's!), hair dryer, bath stuff from Molton Brown, two free little bottles of water, a cell phone that you could take with you and use on the grounds of the property, and 24-hour room service, just off the top of my head.  The shower pressure was pretty lame, but other than that, the bathroom was lovely.  The tub was crazy deep and the way the water came out was surprising and fancy.  Generally, it was very modern and clean, but for the price, I expected nothing less.  The sheets, which were supposedly 300 thread count, were like paper, so not so great.  The bed was also too soft.  The turn down service was nice.  We came back from our adventures and found a tiny little corner of the comforter turned down, with a bottle of water and 4 Dean &amp; Deluca chocolates on a tray, and our ice bucket full and next to the bed.THE CASINO:  We then headed to the casino and prepared to part with some cash.  The casino was pretty smokey.  I didn't get the sense that oxygen was being constantly pumped into the room, like I do at MGM.  Also, the casino part is on two floors and it's just huge AND packed AND overwhelming.  There are a bazillion slot machines, placed with no rhyme or reason that I could distinguish, and an oddly disproportionate handful of card tables, craps and roulette in just a few areas.  We played some slots and won some money, and then lost it.  We ended up breaking even in the end when I sat down at a random 2-cent machine, put in $3 to kill some time, spun the reels twice and then the machine gave me a bunch of free spins and just went off by itself like it was possessed, ultimately dishing out $70 when it finally stopped.  There was a live cover band playing earlier in the evening that was okay.  When we came back later on in the evening, there was a really good Motown/funk cover band that really had people excited.  This provided the most excellent people watching, with the dancing and general happiness.  I was really surprised how amazingly packed the place was.  You'd never know you were in a town that's been ravaged by the economic downturn.  We watched some Black Jack, respectfully declining the invites to play ($15 minimum at night), and by 11:00p we were hungry.   THE FOOD:   There are a million food options on the property, including the 24-hour room service that looked amazing, but at $20 for two eggs, meat and potatoes, not a very cost-friendly option.  In fact, there's pretty much a premium on everything you come across.  The only reasonably priced thing we found was at a little souvenir shop on our way out of the casino, where we got a bottle of water for $1.50, a steal compared to the $5 bottle of Fuji Water in our mini bar.  We started the evening at Iridescence (luckily, our adventure coincided with Detroit Restaurant Week and our package included that $30 food credit) and had an absolutely amazing 5-star meal, which will be detailed in a different review.  Our late night munchies landed us at one of the many eateries in the food corridor, Grand River Deli.  Our corned beef sandwich and soups were tasty, but we, not surprisingly, immediately regretted this decision and had to walk it off a bit.  You will definitely not go hungry here.  I'd love to go back just for the seafood buffet at Assembly Line (Fridays only), which must be amazing because there were probably 50 people in line for it at 11:00p and it's $32 a person!  It is also worth mentioning that he coffee we got the next morning from High Octane was really good.THE SERVICE:  Every single service person we came in contact with was amazing.  From the check-in, to the restaurants, to the valets, to the people that you just passed in your travels, every single person was helpful, chatty and lovely.  In summary, if you want a quick, somewhat fancy, getaway in our fair city, I'd highly recommend a trip to the Motor City Casino and Hotel.  I totally felt like I'd escaped for the night and there's plenty to occupy your time for one night, so you don't really even have to leave once you park your car and get in there.  They even offer Tigers, Wings, DIA, and concert packages that include transportation, as well as spa packages (pricey!), so if you're not into gambling, there's that too.My boyfriend and I went to Motor City a few weekends ago for some much needed down time. I picked Motor City based on the reviews I'd read here and other sites, and the fact that I wanted a nice getaway that was cheaper than MGM Grand. I live in the suburbs but I'm a big Detroit supporter. I wouldn't say our experience was unpleasant, I just expected a lot more based on the ads of Motor City Casino being a ""luxury getaway."" I don't really gamble so I would probably never stay here again unless the price was more reasonable. $320 a night can go a long way in many major cities, even NYC, with a better experience. Motor City is in an area where you can't really walk outside and do anything, so you're relying on them for your full entertainment value. The hotel itself is beautiful, the room was great but definitely starting to show a little wear and tear -- eg, magazines on table were beat up and had beverage stains. Toilet paper was cheap and the hotel robes were really stiff. (But you could buy one in the gift shop for $100!) The casino is the basement and seemed sad -- lots of people spending their disability / retirement at slot machines and table games were hard to find. Way too smoky, even in the non-smoking areas. All the staff of Motor City wears these cheap, ill fitting grey suits...a nice tailored blazer would look so much better. I know these are little things but for someone who appreciates and expects to get the value of their money, as I expect a lot of people on this site are, they go a long way. Iridescence was nice- beautiful room and view. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Hostesses (again wearing those cheap grey suits) were, ahem, not exactly professional looking. The food was excellent, definitely American type fare but I totally get that for a Casino crowd. Wine was good and priced decently. Bottom line,  if Motor City wants to bill itself as luxury getaway, it still has a long way to go. Next time we'll probably stay at Greektown or the Westin Book Cadillac for a better Detroit experience.I'm surprised to read the other reviews and see that no one has mentioned the smell in the lobby of the hotel. After a day of dealing with runny noses and itchy throats (almost our entire group had them), we asked the front desk and had our suspicions confirmed. They pipe in perfume through the air vents. And not a light mist to freshen up the place, it's more like having samples sprayed continually at your face as you walk through a department store fragrance section. And if I'm going to stay in a fragrance factory, I'd rather stay in a department store, since the lighting would be so much better than the dark, dark rooms that we had. We searched every time we came back to the room for a light switch or three that we simply must have missed, but never found them. If you want a place that constantly challenges one of your senses, then this is it. Motorcity Casino......It's Dark and Smells Funny Here.The Motor City Hotel is new, but it won't be for long. It's not very old, but is already lacking basic maintenance and housekeeping to keep it nice. All-in-all my room was okay except for the food stuck to the curtains. In fact, it was quite nice, just not as clean as I would have liked it to be. If didn't know better I'd think they didn't change the sheets. ICK! Having traveled a lot, I can't see staying here again.The neighborhood around this place was scary, run down and I wouldn't go anywhere alone.  I was here less than an hour and was already annoyed with this place.  We arrived at 12:30pm to be told that check in wasn't until 3pm - which is alright however we had a conference at 1pm.  Upon proceeding to check us in, we had to call our travel planner out of his conference to come show them the credit card on file!  Then they said they will call us when the hotel room is ready.  After rearranging my briefcase to check my baggage in (I didn't want my jewelry, ipod, computer and other misc. items to be checked in behind the desk), I proceeded to the casino to waste some time, only to be told that I couldn't bring in my soft sided briefcase because it was too big and the man guarding the casino suggested I check it with the front desk.  I told him I didn't feel secure in leaving some of my items there.  He assured me it was ""pretty safe"" (is that why hotel rooms have safes???).  I showed him it was only slightly bigger than my handbag and he referred me to the security office next door.  The woman there explained that since ""nine-one-one"" no bags are allowed and again she suggested I check it at the front desk.  I offered her the same reasons and I again stated it was only slightly bigger than my handbag.  She again recited ""nine-one-one"" saying it's been this way for a while.  I asked her 3 times if it was hotel policy or if it was a law?  She seemed annoyed and either could not or would not answer the question.  She was about to say you can speak to my manager when he appeared and said there is no law.  I said that was all I want to know. All that said, it appears that I can check into the hotel with as many bags as I want but I cannot go into the casino with a briefcase?  Does that mean they only care about the money - not what one might do with the briefcase while in the hotel or while it is parked at the front desk? I proceeded back to the lobby to wait and the ""room"" where they checked my luggage has employees in and out constantly as it is behind the front desk and perhaps offices or a break room.  Employees pass through the hotel lobby constantly giving their shout outs to one another.  There was a girl waiting next to me and she and her friend got check in.  I decided to wait it out to see just how long it would take.  I watched others come and get checked in but no call. I was checked into my room and settled when I got a call i could check in (at 3:45).As much as the hotel tries to give a great lobby appearance, something is just not right about it.  There is a guard to make sure you are a guest of the hotel before you can proceed to rooms.  However, I did notice 3 obviously seedily dressed girls that walked right by, mumbled something and went on up.  I sat in the lobby for 2 hours waiting to be able to check in.  Employees frequently walked by and gave each other hoots and hollers and high fives sometimes loud and obnoxiously.The room was nice except our toilet plugged up.  The cleaning crew in the halls seem to forget there are guests in the hotel and shout up and down the halls to one another.  The slots in the casino were very tight.  All in all it gives you the feel of something TRYING to shine in a dust storm.Great casino. Very great buffet. Good price for all you can eat crab legs on Friday night. The hotel is also very classy.I recently went to the hotel and it was REALLY nice. Absolutely gorgeous and everyone was extremely hospitable. I KNEW I loved Motor City for a reason!My husband and I actually got married at the Motor City Casino Hotel.  The whole day was put together by the event coordinator, Irene Lignos.  She was amazing.  The wedding was outstandingly beautiful and every need of ours was taken care of at little or no extra cost.  The event designer was a gentleman named Michael and he was also outstanding.  From the food to decor to the rooms, all of our friends and guests stayed at the hotel and were blown away.  It is truly a wonderful hotel.  Molten Brown products in the bathrooms, turn down service, quick room service - literally, nothing to complain about!!!Nice casino with beautiful rooms. A couple minor issues. No tissue in the room and only one wine glass. A large ketchup stain on the carpet. Minor details that really should not be missed. This hotel can expect to be filled with folks from around the world for the auto show. It would be nice to showcase Detroit and this hotel as a first class place to stay. I hope management takes care of these minor issues.Motor City Casino is the perfect place to hang out and have a good time.  Whether your with your significant other or with a group of 20 friends.  I have to say it's a little nicer than the other two casinos. The suite was awesome!  The main room which had a full wet bar and 42"" plasma, was completely separated by a hallway from the bedroom and bathroom.  I was thinking... this is a hotel room?  The bathroom was fully equipped with robes, slippers and everything else you might need.  Both rooms were outfitted with this really dark cherry wood, ultra modern furniture.  I haven't tried any of the restaurants here, only because I must eat at the Parthenon every time I'm downtown.  Most restaurants in the downtown area accept comps from the 3 casino's.  I have been told the restaurants are great though.  I love their electronic roulette table, I must have spent about an 1 1/2 on the thing. There's an actual spinning wheel, but you place your bets at your own station.  No more leaning in and elbowing the person next to you.  Its nice!  I'm sure the other casino's have them but the only time I've used it was here.  They have $5 minimum poker tables!!   A definite plus. Parking was surprisingly extremely easy coming in.  Leaving... not so much.  I had a hell of a time finding my car after all the shenanigan's that night.  But once I found it (after 10 min,) I was out in seconds.  What topped the night off for me the last time I was here was, I was able to catch the Mayweather/ Marquez fight on about 20 different plasma screens.  I will definitely be here to watch the Pacquiao/ Cotto fight too.  Great atmosphere to watch the fight.  It sure beats going to a sports bar and trying to look over people's shoulders to watch it on 1 screen!   Although Motor city is the furthest out from the immediate downtown area, it is definitely the one that is most like a true casino.  Motor city has a couple bad ass night clubs that I've been to.  But you won't really notice them unless that's what your there for.  It's a perfect balance!!  MGM seems to put ALL emphasis on the night clubs.  At MGM the clubs are almost right smack dab in the middle of the casino.  Motor city offers great stay and play packages. So if you want a quick, cheap weekend stay-cation give MC a try.Have stayed in many a hotel, and as far as room size this takes the cake.  Rooms are extra spacious, TV's are all LCD's, and the bathroom is mostly marble and nicely done.  There was a hotel employee checking to make sure people had hotel cards to make sure no people were coming up from the casino.  The staff were all super friendly, I had a good stay on Final Four weekend, the only knock i have is that its on the outskirts of the nice Detriot area, so you have to cab it there, but the upside is that there is free parking in the adjoining garage.","['several', 'times', 'gamble', 'years', 'always', 'thought', 'nothing', 'special', 'girlfriend', 'free', 'room', 'voucher', 'anyone', 'gambling',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-southfield-detroit-southfield,The Westin Southfield Detroit,3.0,$$,86,"Now this review is based off the total package. I was here for a wedding in Atrium. I stayed here one night. The hotel room was nice. I wasn't a fan of the lighting but the room was nice, spacious, the jacuzzi was awesome, showers were good, and the bed was comfy. Not a bad Hotel at all. The location is  good 30 minutes from Somerset mall and the lodge freeway is right there which takes you straight to downtown Detroit. For a wedding Venue this was much better than what I was expecting. They have this whole jungle/cave/nature set up. The seating worked out great, lighting was awesome, the mics were a little off but overall this was a great venue. Tables set all around two different floor levels making for great views. Tons of space was available for all the catering and whatever company they used to do the Desserts it was beautiful. It just put everyone is a social joyus mood! Also had tons of space to socialize and take pictures on nice backdrops etc etc. Oh forgot to add the Bride and Groom looked stunning, the camera doesn't do justice for the colors of the venue!Lets say if you are going to have a ceremony in Michigan, you should definitely take a look into this place.My first impression of the Westin was an overall positive one-the staff was friendly, there was a pleasant smell, overall a great start to my weekend. But upon checking into my room, the whole weekend turned sour. I reserved a junior suite, which I was located on the same floor as the pool, and immediately adjacent to the staff room who woke me and my significant other up frequently-as early as 6am. There is rust on the top of the shower rod, there is rust stains on the inside of the shower heads, the wallpaper is peeling, the seal between the outer shower wall and the interior of the wall is outset by an inch, and the walls and ceilings are incredibly thin. Do not spend any extra money here, thinking you will get a better experience-go somewhere else instead. ***UPDATE*** I was promised 7,000 SPG points (as an existing SPG rewards member) but, as of 1/18/2016 (4 days after checkout) I still have not been awarded any points, let alone the promised amount. I do not know if that is standard for SPG hotels, but I expected much more. Such a let down and I would have gotten much more for my dollar at a motel, or the hotel across the street...**********This is my second time staying at this property, the first time was in July. Since I'm SPG Gold and this location is within 10 minutes of my in-laws this location is the most ideal.Our flight, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, landed at 7:45am. We figured it wouldn't hurt to call the hotel to see if we could check in earlier. They told us we could come at 10:00am. Perfect!We checked in with no wait, they acknowledged my SPG status and said we had been upgraded to a corner room on the top floor. I looked around for my usual welcome amenity or at least a handwritten note, nothing. Figured maybe we'd arrived too early.Our room was spacious. It was one large room with a king-sized bed and a living area with a love seat, desk, and chest that housed the TV and a mini-fridge. It seemed the room hadn't been used in a while because the heat took a long time to come on and the coffee table was dusty.When we left the room around 1:00pm to go visit family, we noticed our neighbor across the hall had left their room service tray in front of our door. Tacky, right?When we returned that evening around 10:30pm, the tray and all the food was still there. I immediately called to ask someone to remove it. That night, in front of the building we could hear a loud hissing sound. As we got closer it smelled of natural gas. We immediately alerted the front desk who informed us they already knew about the issue. Strange it took 2 days for someone to finally come out and turn off the valve. Glad no one was outside smoking. Nice to see they were concerned with our safety.The next morning, we spotted the housekeeper and next to her cart was a huge pile of towels and sheets. Again, we came back to the hotel after 10:00pm to see not one, but two huge piles of towels in the same place since the morning. The room itself was nice and the front desk staff were very accommodating. Too bad they don't pride themselves on keeping the communal areas clean. We may end up staying here again but it definitely won't be my first choice.It's okay.  When we checked in, I was offered a free Starbucks drink from the cafe as my gold amenity.  When we went to get it in the morning, the lady had no idea what I was talking about.  Classy.  When we left, the valet didn't leave the key fob in the car.  When we were about 10 mins away, we had to turn back to go get it making us late for our bunch.  The vast said it wasn't him who pulled our car around.  Again, classy.  The food was decent, but I'd never stay here again.  Apparently it's too difficult for employees to communicate with each other.I liked staying here. The rooms were classic Westin, service was nice and the price appropriate. Nicely located for the various Detroit suburbs that I need to float in and out of.Stayed here for the weekend for the recent Penguicon conference/convention, and this place is, by and large, awesome.- Rooms were clean and absolutely no complaints about the amenities available...not that I used any, because I think I was in my room for a grand total of about 6 hours over the course of the entire weekend...but, still, solid.- The staff could not have possibly been more friendly, especially in light of the crushing crowd that descended upon them for the weekend.- The staff was hilariously completely in the mood and in the mix for the con, with most of them wearing costumes, shirts, or something that showed an interest in the event along with their name badges, and were almost to a fault wanting to talk about what brought you there, what your interests were, and just friendly chatting in general.- Meeting rooms were great, and had everything needed for the various presentations and panels that I was a part of.- The only negative I can ding them for, really, is that the bar staff's kinda slow on the uptake, even with nobody but three of us sitting in the bar.  Not for nothing, but I shouldn't *really* have to remind you twice of our order of three beers.  All the same beer too, so really not a complicated order, and again...""dead"" at the time, so it's not like there was a mob scene.  In fact, they tended to react better during the mob scene times...although still a bit on the slow side.  Still awfully friendly and chatty though, which is always a plus in my book.That one minor note aside, it was an outstanding experience, and I'd totally stay here again.  I'll definitely be back for next year's Penguicon.We stayed here for a wedding. The day started off by calling to see if we could check in early. The lady on the phone informed us that she had no such reservations. We booked THREE rooms.. THREE (and had the receipt for said rooms.) The wedding was at 2 and the reception was at 5. We arrived at the hotel a little after 4, and we were told that only one out of three of our rooms were ready. We had to go to the reception, so were forced to check in to our remaining rooms when we got back... After midnight. When we finally got into our remaining rooms they were merely wiped down. There were crumbs on the counters, etc. One thing that really grosses me out are when cloth type things are visibly dirty. For example: A lamp shade. When going to turn on the light I could see dark stains all over the lamp shade. How cheap are lamp shades? It would be an easy fix. When returning from the wedding reception. We went back to another family members room, we were there for less than 10 minutes when a security guard knocked on the door. He asked for the person paying for the room to come to the hallway. Where he rudely stated, ""we have gotten multiple calls (ya know, in the total 7 minutes we were in the room) if I have to come back again you will be EVICTED from the room."" Slow down BUCKO, evicted? Get over yourself. Oh, and you mean the room that we have had for a grand total of 30 minutes because your hotel wasn't prepared? Very pretty hotel lobby though!I am in the ""Heacebly"" bed as I write, and I am SO happy. Based on these reviews, I was expecting some sort of run-down institution. Nope nope nope!The only trouble we had was getting to the front of the hotel. Google Maps, you have failed me for the first time ever. It will take you around the Town Center - DON'T DO THAT! If you're coming from the highway, after you turn into the center, just turn left almost immediately into the front parking area of the bank, and straight ahead is the hotel. Easy peazy. When we got there, the attendants told us we could leave our car by the curb so we could check-in first and park after. He was so nice! We were also welcomed by another attendant in the lobby. So much love!Our Front Desk person was Homer and he was GREAT! With a welcoming and genuine smile, he got us a great room and made small talk as we waited for everything to process. We also had an issue with internet which he resolved immediately. Can't get better hospitality employees than that! Two thumbs up for Homer!We went into the garage to park (didn't feel like parking in the open even though it was closer). Turns out that there is a SKYWAY from the lot to the hotel which took us right to the elevators! Pretty much the same distance as the front parking spots were!Elevator wait was minimal. The hallway was fine. But our room is STELLAR! I was seriously expecting mold and dirty sheets based on reviews. Our room is clean clean CLEAN! The bed is so comfortable, the bathroom is spotless, and our room looks fairly new (we're in a basic double). Some of the furniture has scuff marks here and there, but who really cares? Maybe I'm in an updated room, but this is pretty sweet (thank you, Homer!!). I'll update more as our stay progresses, but I am super pleased right now.This Westin offers appreciable discounts off-peak, and so we were able to book a four-day Christmas stay in a hotel with many amenities while visiting relatives in Detroit, so many thanks to them for giving us that opportunity at a discount. We'll probably stay here again. On the plus side, Southfield itself is safe and still super convenient to Detroit proper, and the outside parking lot is free and (given the low winter occupancy rates) ubiquitously available. Huge points there.The hotel is vast and probably earns most of its bread off of business conferences, but the staff were nevertheless gracious and accommodating for these two married holiday travelers with two small dogs. Heck, one of the concierges would stop us so he could pet our furry children on the way in and out from walks. Little things like that matter, and we felt welcomed by the Westin.The room we had was nice enough, if a little older, although the mini-fridge was broken. They were kind enough to send us up another one, so, no points off there. The advertized ""Heavenly Bed"" and ""Heavenly Shower"" were more pleasant than ecstasy-inducing, so, yay for a good effort, anyway. The hot water on the shower, e.g, came and went: I hope whatever actual heaven people believe in sets the bar a little higher. The restaurant and bar are not so good: while the hot breakfast that we got cashing in our ""don't clean our room"" tickets was filling and tasty, the dinner menu is generally mediocre. The bar's beer selection is nothing short of terrible (not a single Michigan craft brew?) and the cocktails all cost 50% more than they ought to even for an upscale place. The indoor pool with hot tub was a nice bonus, as was a fitness center that's vastly better than that of most hotels (with free weights and multiple treadmills in addition to the ubiquitous universal gym).So, four stars for a Priceline Express Deals discount, probably more like three at advertised rates. It fit our needs at the time, which is really about all that you can ask out of life.My fiance and I like to go to hotel rooms just to get away for the night. We were looking online and the Westin Southfield kept popping up.. So we decided to book a room for 1 night.. Let me start off my saying that the valet attendant and front desk personal were very pleasant...The Room....The room is clean.. the bed and pillows are amazing..The view is nice..The wallpaper is peeling..The shower head is hanging.. Broken glass on bathroom floor.. The Starbucks Coffee was nice..The room was a tad too warm..3pm check out is Amazing.. Was nice to not get woken up by vacuums or someone knocking on the door..We did not get a chance to eat there.. We actually ended up at Beans and Cornbread.. Which is amazing lol..The PoolThe pool area is sweltering!the pool and hot tub are soooo tiny! And over ran with tax baller baba kids.. Little 3 year old with no control In The hot tub, which clearly stat 16+... They have every single lifeguard object pulled off the wall.. I understand kids want to have a good time and swim... but damn.. I was really looking forward to enjoying the hot tub.. but unfortunately I kept getting splashed by kids jumping in.. Also, the 2 pops that we did get from the vending machine, we're expired!! From December 14...The hotel NEEDS to monitor the pool area...Overall I the hotel is decent!!I probably will not be revisiting this hotel..This is a great hotel in the middle of Southfield. There aren't too many Starwood properties in the Detroit area, but this is a nice one. Over the holidays it was very quiet. We were upgraded to a suite both times we were there. Overall a great place to stay and reasonable rates.I enjoyed my stay here and found the experience to be very relaxing and comfortable. Check in was fast and easy, and the woman working was very kind. She gave me free internet access and allowed me to check out at 2pm instead of noon. The room was aesthetically pleasing and beds were very comfortable. Internet worked very well. Free parking attached to the hotel. My only complaint is that housekeeping knocked at noon and woke me up. Overall, I found this hotel to be a great value.Lobby always seems to be understaffed, been staying here for work on and off for nearly 7 years and this has always been the case. Expect 10-20 minute wait no matter the day of the week. Such a shame because the rooms are extremely clean and the breakfast buffet is second to none. What a shame.The Westin Southfield has been newly renovated.  It is clean, modern, and smells great.  The beds are very comfortable.  I've stayed here several times for business and found everything up to par or better.  The only downside is the elevators are slow and it seems one or more is always out of order while I'm staying here.  Not a big deal really.  The hotel bar is nice and they have some very good house wines. Haven't had a meal here yet but the food looks pretty good from what I've observed.  The covered, connected parking structure is a bonus especially during the winter.I live in the area but spend a lot of nights out with my wife to escape the kids. We get to see a lot of the areas hotels and always ask for the best suite. I am very displeased with our deluxe master suite. The carpets are dirty and stained throughout our floor. Our room has a funky musk and mold smell and is not what I expect for a deluxe suite in the area. My wife was especially surprised at the small size of the bath, which is usually one of the luxuries we enjoy when staying out. Unless your attending a conference or other reason to be in the facility you would be better served at one of the other fine hotels in greater Detroit.  This is not a nice place to stay, just an expensive one.This review is specifically for the restaurant. Don't get the breakfast buffet. It's $17 and the food is horrible. Our waitress didn't come back for a half hour after dropping off our waters, came back with our bills, and then was gone for another 20 minutes even though we were pulling our our cards as she was putting the bills on the table. Never again.Decent hotel for the price!Given I'm orginally from the area- my usual ""hotel"" is mom's house.  But on this recent trip, I needed a less familiar setting so I stayed where my business meeting was located.Given I travel a lot, sometimes it's the little things that keep me from giving hotels a 4 star rating even though there is nothing wrong with a 3 start or an ""a ok"" rating, it just means that there were hassles and as a road weary business traveler, little hassles can ruin a stay.In this case, the little things added up. It was the lack of valet to take my car (I had to hunt one down through the front desk staff after standing out front watching people smoke around me).  It was that the hallways leading to the rooms needed new carpeting.  At least my floor (which was a preferred floor)was dirty and stained which had me wondering what my room was going to be like, yet, I will say, when I opened the door to the room- all was well there. Just gave me a bad first impression.And finally- there were a couple of problems with my check in/checkout. I got a gift basket that was obviously intended for someone else when I checked in, and when I checked out, I should have looked at my bill as they billed my room to some other company's master account and all I had were the incidentials (rectified when I called the hotel but I'm all about ""hassle free"" as travel is enough of a hassle.The good news?  My room was clean and spactious with coffee, paid internet and a stocked bathroom.  The bed was soft and inviting and there were plenty of different kinds of pillows allowing me to choose just the right one for a good night's sleep.I also thought the meeting space in this hotel was quite nice and the public areas leading to the meeting space was modern and had comfy seating arrangements so that small meetings could take place.And while I didn't use it- the bar must be pretty good as it was packed both nights I was here.All in all it was a good night's sleep which is often just what I need.  But when hotels are competing for my business, sometimes it's the little things that make one hotel stand out from another.I stayed here while on business and while the hotel is clean and modern I had a few issues here that would prevent me from returning. First the room I was in had small nat like bugs for two days and I never once ate or had food in my room. Second in the bathroom there was two spots with peeling paint. This was not a huge issue but should have been caught and communicated to maintenance on routine room checks. Third the tv would not sync to the sound after being on for several minutes. It was annoying. Fourth and my biggest issue was the fact that my room keys had to be replaced twice over the course of a one week stay as they would not work on the elevator and my room. Nothing like getting up to the ninth floor and then having to come all the way back down to get new keys late at night. When I checked out they said here you go. No how was your stay to get feedback or have a nice day. That was just the way to end my stay. If I had the opportunity to come back to Detroit I would not stay here again. Too many things just did not go right.So sad, I have watched this hotel decline over the years.  Several times a year I hold meetings at the EMC- which is wonderful. My meetings require the overnight stay of many of my meeting guests. The Westin Southfield is conveniently located to the metro area, and the Westin use to draw the appeal. In the last two months I have had two meetings, both came with very long, understaffed check in lines, no delivery of a receipt, and maintenance issues with the rooms. The heavenly beds? After many years of use, those have started to break down. The beds are not heavenly, the rooms are often unable to cool themselves down, and are too hot. In fact I stayed last night and had someone from maintenance working on the temperature control for two hours, after midnight. The hotel was sold out, so they couldn't move me to another room. For the price they charge, you can't put a price on a restful stay. Maintenance issues which include toilet problems, temperature control, and long check in lines, you can only take so much off.  The first time, shame on you Westin Southfield, the second time shame on me. After two bad experiences within a month, I'm not sure I will be bringing my business back for overnight stay at the hotel. Outside of the EMC, which offers excellent customer service by Fred and his crew, the only other good part to this place is the bar. Service is great, drinks are made right, and it has a great atmosphere.Great hotel in Southfield Detroit! It's location is nearby everything and the Hotel itself is great. Rooms are spacious and modern looking. They have a small gym with swimming pool and jacuzzi. Also simple checking in and out process. For the price, it's a great hotel to choose from in the area.","Super-super disappointed in this one. Westin's are usually bulletproof; the one in Edina MN is one of my altime favs. This one in Southfield gives off the impression that they've given up. I had spent a fair amount of the day travelling and was really looking forward getting some work done in the room and relaxing a bit. The first issue was trying to find a sandwich. I asked the valet/concierge if there was a place to grab a quick sandwich to bring back to the room. He said ""Oh yes. Just go into the restaurant and they have prepared sandwiches."" Great...only they don't. The waitress said that the deli/coffee shop that makes them was closed that day ""and I don't know why."" There were no other places to get food...so back to the room. As I started to unpack and get set up for a meeting I decided to at least have a cup of coffee. No dice. When I went in to the bathroom to fill up the pot, it was obvious that it hadn't been cleaned well. There were used tissues on the floor and when I opened the coffee pot, there was a used coffee filter in the machine...yuck. Now, I'm 10min away from getting on a call and I have to switch rooms. The front desk was nice enough about it and got me a new room on the 9th floor. This room looked similar to other one in that it was pretty dated and roughed up. Chips on the desk, stains on the throw pillows and this time (although the coffee maker was clean) they didn't have any creamer. The downward trend continued in the fitness center when I had to try 3 treadmills before I got one that didn't randomly turn off. I love Westin, but this place has got to get their act together.The best thing about this place is the bar, that's it.  Mike the bartender really knows how to poor a drink.  And its a good thing b/c you will sleep horribly here. The beds were comfortable but the temperature control in the rooms was horrible.  The AC kept breaking/not working at all and they really did nothing to fix it.  Gym: Sucked, how hard is it to get good equipment? I find it crappy that you have to pay for the wifi and the wifi is really bad!It's a nice hotel, good layout, good food, friendly atmosphere. It is what you would expect out of any quality hotel. What really made this place stand out was the EXCELLENT customer service we received from Guest Service Jonathan Hayward. He solved our problems and truly made our stay here amazing. This guy was an all star of an employee. Thank you Jonathan!Let me just state the facts. There was A LOT wrong with this hotel so I will list them:Nice looking lobby, but the room they gave us looked nothing like the website. This hotel markets itself to meetings and weddings. They have put most of the money into their lobby area, and have ignored their rooms. Upon our arrival, There was a musty odor and dingy lighting.After traveling several thousand miles that day, we were looking forward to settling down, but we were greeted with mildew and sub-par air conditioning. Old uncomfortable furniture, a lousy bed that was not comfortable. The furniture is worn and amenities such as hangers and luggage valet are often missing.BROKEN HANDHELD BATHROOM MIRROR. BROKEN SHOWER HEADS and PIPES DISASSEMBLING from the wall. NO WATER PRESSURE. Poorly equipped fitness room &amp; pool are TINY. The PHONE FOR RENTAL CAR SERVICE AT THE FRONT DESK DOES NOT WORK. IN-ROOM COFFEE MAKER DOES NOT WORK. COMFORTERS ARE DINGY YELLOW.The FOOD IS LOUSY. SERVER BROUGHT BURNED CHEESE BREAD to the table. Saw the COOK GO OUTSIDE and SMOKE while in uniform.I can't imagine anyone wanting to have an event at this horrid establishment. Needless to say, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if they GAVE me a room for the night.What positive thing can we say about the experience? It's over! Oh, This was the WORST travel experience ever. EVER.I'm a frequent business traveler and have stayed here frequently. Never had a problem. Nice clean room, great service and very good food in the restaurant. I got a passcode for free wifi (perhaps due to my SPG membership). No complaints from me and I will stay here again.EDIT: They charged my card twice..so another star off for the inconvenience. I was in the area for a business trip. My coordinator helped booked this place because it was the closet to our venue. Good service, attentive staff. The rooms were a bit rustic and old though. You could see the stains on the toilet and showers, so one star off for that.Amenities:  I was a huge fan of their lotion, which I bought more of at their gift shop. Gym: The pool was tiny and looked nothing like their website. The gym was small as well, but enough to do a quick work out in. Service: The service was quiet and nice, they never bothered me. And whenever I needed something they were quick to deliver it. WIFI: There was no free wifi. One star off for that. Overall, nice staff, but I've been to better.This hotel was definitely mediocre. Not worth the nightly rate we paid. I guess it was cleaned ok but the heavenly bed didn't have crisp linens like I expected and was like any other beds I've stayed in. Nothing special. The bathroom needed some repair and just over all wasn't in great condition. The carpet had pink stains through out. The check in process was really easy so that was a perk. Since we only stayed for one night I don't have any input on the amenities. Parking was easy and location was convenient. Very close to everything.Many issues with this so called 4-star hotel1. Parking is ridiculous: parking is part of a 4 building  complex where they share a parking garage. There is no clear direction on any of the four entrances as to where to park for the hotel. I drove around for 15 minutes before happening upon the entrance. This is an awful first impression. Put some way finding signage on the street! Hello?2. The room cards have to be used to get up to your room which is no big deal if they worked without having to try them five times. Very annoying3. Internet is NOT FREE?!? What kind of hotel nowadays has the audacity to charge for Internet?? Are we back in the 90's? When asked to make this right if they wanted to keep my business they refused! Talk about lack of basic understanding of service philosophies with this decision. 4. No USB connections for powering your devices in the rooms. And no iPhone docking stations for your music. There are 3 star hotels that offer this! 5. In a absolutely dead area for decent restaurants or entertainment. Nothing worthwhile any where near the hotel. Unless you find Wendy's and Qdoba tolerable. You will have to drive 10-15 mins to find a decent restaurant Basic flaw here is that they believe they are a four star establishment. This rating carries with it certain expectations which start with a very user friendly guest experience at which they fail at on many levelsDo yourself a favor and drive the extra 10-15 mins and stay elsewhere 4 star rating that is a 2 star experience*** Solid accommodations, 12 floors, perfect for groups. ***Free weights in the gym, woo-hoo!  A pool and whirlpool too.I liked the amenities here.  Westin is a comfortable spot to be.Yet they actually still charge for wifi. (gasp)  No bueno in 2013.*** Westin is ideal for a large gathering, meetings, ballroom. ***They must have renovated the rooms, the staff and the kitchen because this place was top notch in all areas. Had one of the best yogurt parfaits of my life and everyone was super friendly despite the obvious drop in foot traffic in this area.The reason for the one star was, I went there with my boyfriend for a family memorial service in the area. Since it's a 4 star hotel we've decided to stay at this hotel. Our other families had also decided to stay at the same hotel. Once we got to our room everything was nicely placed except we found a big stain on our couch. So they were nice enough to exchange another couch for us hoping it would be a clean couch, which it turns out the second couch has a bigger stain. After all the time spent in the room waiting for them to come get the couch, remove the couch and place another couch. That's a whole day wasted in the hotel. Finally, we had decided to just live with the dirty couch since we have things to do and places to go. The manager, ""Catherine"" was nice enough to give us complimentary lunch for the inconvenience. Then on a different night, somehow I was sitting outside with my boyfriend enjoying the nature since we are not from Michigan. After we came back to the hotel room. We found out my boyfriend might have dropped his cellphone on the floor while heading back to the room. So I rush downstairs headed back to the area where we were sitting using a flashlight hoping to see if I can find the phone on the floor. A gentleman asked if I lost something, I said yes an iPhone. So he said he found a phone and handed to the valet. So I ran to the valet guy ""Miguel"" and asked him, he said he handed the phone to two girls that drove up to the hotel and Miguel asked if the phone belongs to them and they calm the phone was theirs. First of all, was he sure the phone belongs to the two girls? Did he even check to see if they even have the password to turn on the phone? Isn't this common sense for any security to check if an items belongs to someone? Or aren't they supposed to place a lost item in lost and found first for someone that actually lost an item to calm themselves instead of handing it to whoever shows up w/o calming a lost item? What's even more upsetting is I gave Miguel a number to call me if he see those girls again said he will call but never did. An hour or two later, I went downstairs to speak to Miguel, he said he saw those two girls but didn't have a chance to call me or stop them. I guess that's a lesson learn to be very careful with your belongings in this hotel because no one cares about your lost. In this situation, I felt that the staff are not trained well enough. In my conclusion, I feel this is a hotel I would not recommend anyone anymore and I will not feel comfortable staying there again.Flew to Detroit and stayed here 12/21/14 for business. The room was dated, worn, dirty with holes and rips in the carpet and furniture. The quality of the interior was more like a Travel Lodge Motel with cheap and broken IKEA semi-modern decor. The closet door was broken, there were stains on every piece of fabric from the shower curtain to the bedding. Needless to say, I slept 2 hours that night and had a 7:30am work meeting the next day. I've stayed at Westin's all over the country for business---- this location is such a disappointment. The service at check-in was rude and stand-offish. The woman behind the counter didn't even greet me, she just looked at me, rolled her eyes and just asked for ID and credit card. I've never experienced service like this at a Westin hotel. It seemed like she hated her job and/or she just didn't want to help me. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the lobby is this hotel's best quality. The rooms are uncomfortable, disgusting and the service is far below standard for this hotel chain. The parking lot and garage are both filled with litter and broken glass. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. They could use help from Hotel Impossible!!I feel bad giving this Westin 1 star because the people I *talked to* while I was there were pleasant and nice. However, I would not be able to recommend this hotel to anyone, and I will certainly never stay there again. My husband and I arrived there late, checking in at around 2:00 a.m. When we walked into the room, there was a pile of pillows on the bed. A long decorative pillow and two regular pillows... except they didn't have pillowcases on. We thought it was weird, but the room seemed fine otherwise, so my husband called the desk and they brought 2 pillows with cases. We'd been driving for hours, and I fell asleep quickly. My husband was not so lucky. The men in the room next to us were shouting in their room until approximately 3:30, and the walls were so thin my husband could hear every word. He couldn't fall asleep until they shut up.In the morning, I got in the shower -- saw 2 little bottles there on the tub. Got in, got my hair wet, picked up the bottle I thought was shampoo, and it was body wash. Got out, looked around all over the place in the bathroom -- there was no shampoo. I'm standing there with wet hair, freezing, with no shampoo, so I yelled to my husband to call the desk. I got in the shower to stay warm. Stood there 10 minutes. No one came with shampoo. My husband called again. Stood there some more. While standing there I'm looking around, and there is a gross long brown hair sitting across the handicapped seat that is folded down over the tub. It obviously had not been cleaned. And people are expected to sit on that thing with their bare bum! There was another long brown hair stuck to the side of the shower wall. The tub obviously had not been cleaned since the last guest. How gross.When I called to tell the manager about this, I told her that my husband and I were concerned that the bed that we slept in hadn't even been clean. I mean, if housekeeping didn't clean the tub, didn't replenish supplies, and left unfinished pillows on the bed, what else did she just not bother to do? The manager was very apologetic and seemed pretty upset about it, and she offered to send breakfast to our room -- it wasn't her fault and she was trying, but by then we were so upset that all we wanted to do was get out of there and never go back.The bar inside the Westin is my go to spot when I come home. The food is really good and the drinks are so, so, STRONG and tasty, just the way I like it!. The BEST BARTENDER is Mike (Hi Mike, if you ever read this lol).In regards to the rooms they are decent. I decided one weekend while visiting home I needed some alone time away from home, crazy huh? The room was clean (I check everything, sheets, covers, under the bed, over the bed, top of the bed, wherever!) and the bed was very comfy, which is all I cared about. The only issue I had was parking in the garage and finding my way to get inside the actual hotel from the garage. But, that was me being absent minded :)Westin the star. I like this hotel chain so much because its very clean and comforting. The rooms are big and service is great. Westin hotel always smells very good from the time you enter the hotel until you leave. You literally smell so good even when you leave and I think it's their soap, shampoo etc. my favorites are the coral gables Florida location and Hollywood ft lauderdale ocean front location. Oh and don't forget to collect free stays at the Starwood preferred guest program it's free!Customer service rude. Carolyn informed me that I had to contact American Express to handle their problem for a wrongful charge. I called American express and they had no record of a debit submitted. Had to file a dispute with American Express. This was my third phone call to Westin.This place is all about yeah yeah we will do that for you but when it comes time to it they won't! I'm more than unhappy with my stay here, idk where to begin! I called three times prior to arriving to make sure I could have two cribs for my one year old twins, they said yes it would be no big deal. When we got there to check in we were told the cribs would get there in ten mins. We waited thirty mins no one showed up with a crib. We called the front desk they told us two cribs were a fire hazard, that was irritating but I thought whatever they can share. We waited another hour and the one crib still hadn't came, they ran out of cribs and we weren't getting any but they would call their manager to figure something out! I understand that they don't have to supply cribs but if you really don't have a lot to give out we would have brought our pack n plays and made other arrangements! They brought us a roll in bed like that would do the trick, you can't put year old babys on a twin bed!!!!! Other than the cribs situation the hotel is filthy, there was lipstick on the cups and very outdated.PROS:-looks nice from a distance-room service phone staff and delivery was friendly (plus my ""Steak Frite"" was delicious)CONS:-found a used cotton ""q-tip"" swab next to the plush ""sitting chair"".  What else do they not clean? gross.-the dust cover under the mattress was ripped and about 3 feet of it was lying between the double beds.  It's just not something you want to see when you walk into the room.-no free wi-fi.  I've stayed in some no-frills hotels and still got free wi-fi from them.(they have ethernet cable access, but ipads and tablets don't have ethernet ports)I was disappointed. I've the SPG membership so when we went to Detroit for the auto show, it was easy for me to choose a westin hotel for the quality. Well, I was wrong in this one. First, the front desk who checked me in did not even ask me for my welcome gift choice for being an SPG gold member. Our room was dated. The bathroom was so dated it looked like an accessible bathroom. The pillows were long and tiny. They were uncomfortable for sure. The lamp on the right side of the bed wasn't working. To top it off, there was a strong wind gust at about 45 mph so power went out at 4 AM. My toddler was crying and it was difficult to change his diaper and prepare milk using your cellphone. When we were about to check out, I didn't get portfolio receipt under the door. So when I went to the front desk to get a copy, they gave me someone else's bill to mg horror. They missed the last number and unfortunately saw someone else's bill and contact info. I will never ever stay in this hotel ever again.Pet peeve - shower doesn't drain fast enough, you end up standing in water. Toilet flap was leaking an ran all night.Restraunt menu was limited. Concierge gave us a list of near by places to eat, first four were all shut down.No free wifi....NO FREE WIFI... NO!!!FREE!!!WIFI!!!!  How do you do, no free wifi? Seriously?","We stayed here with our hockey team for a tournament. Any hockey team puts a strain on the hotel and its staff. They were extremely patient and professional with us. With scuffed walls and banged up doors, the hotel is in need of an update.I am with the Dean Graziosi real estate events and we had an event in this hotel.The staff was very helpful the screen was wonderful. They provided pens and pads for our students and the staff helped us with anything we needed. Very impressed with this place.Paper thin walls. You can hear every conversation on either side of you and above you. Horrible location. I have platinum and ambassador status with spg and never once have I been upgraded at this hotelThis Westin is just OK. No concierge lounge, but they do have free parking. The air conditioning in the room was loud, and the toilet broke during the stay. Also, the power outlet by the bed didn't work.  The breakfast buffet was so-so. Most important tip- Ask for a room away from the freeway, it's loud.Ummmmmmm 4 star? Not so much. Peeling paint and wallpaper.  Gross gooey ceilings.  Moldy caulk in shower.had to stay here for a business trip, Nice hotel. Good location. As always Westin has great beds. great nights sleep. If your staying at this hotel you will need a car to get around. Not a lot within walking dist. If your looking for a good place to eat. I headed up to Maple and Telegraph. Its called Andiamo""s the food was fantastic. Its a must. they also have food on site. I have eaten here a lot and they have a great menu. Perfect  place in the Detroit areaRestaurant on the main level had really bad service during breakfast.  The $16 breakfast buffet is on par with the free breakfasts you get at chain motels - definitely not worth it.  Room and hallway smelled like weed, so to resolve the issue, they pumped a citrus smelling chemical air freshener through the ventilation system.  Shower drain was backed up and slow to drain, making a luke warm pool to stand in during my shower.  Internet wouldn't connect on my iPad, so they sent the maintenance guy up.  He acted like he'd never seen an apple product before... Had no idea what he was doing.  So he called internet tech support from my hotel room phone, and left me to talk to them.  Upon checkout, I found that I was charged an absurd $2 connection fee for making a phone call from my room - the phone call the maintenance guy made.Won't go back.  Won't recommend.This hotel has seen better days.  I am an SPG member and stay in a bunch of different properties, so I am comparing to those.  While nothing is soooo bad that I would leave there are a lot of things that could easily change to make things better.  For example, the hallway has stains all over the carpet, my bathtub doesn't drain if you use the ""heavenly"" shower (they fixed it once, still didn't work), the pillows were that older, yellow-ish color.  Also, paid wifi still exists? Again, nothing terrible, but probably not going to be my first choice.I thought westin stood for quality but I guess it stands for ""as much mediocrity as the paying customers will bear"". The coffee shop isn't open on Saturday. I was informed I could get coffee in their grossly over priced mediocre restaraunt, but figuring it was probably $6 a cup, I declined. Water is lukewarm at best in the shower along with no ventilation fan, so the mirrors all fog. Wifi? Yes we have it, for another 5-10 dollars that is. Heck motel6 has free wifi! Some kind of voodoo is required to get the room key to work as well. Both in the door and the elevator. I have stayed in hotels that cost half as much and had the same or better amenities. Judging from the other reviews and westins copy and paste reply, nothing much will change here. Stay well!I'm very fussy about where I lay my head, and this occasion was a weekend getaway/family visit.  I absolutely LOVED it at the Westin.  The hotel is beautiful, and the staff was friendly and courteous.  The bed was amazing.  Best I've slept in a long time! Loved the double shower head in the bathroom, and the white tea scented products.  The fitness room, albeit a little warm, was well equipped.  I will definitely return the next time I'm visiting my hometown!This is a somewhat newer Westin which usually means an instant 4 star review. However, that's not the case here. Here are the highlights:- mediocre service except for maintenance (which begs the quesiton, why did you have to call maintenance)- gym is tiny by Westin standards...as if there's a shortage of space in the suburbs- Heavenly Bed that was closer to purgatoryOne highlight for the biz travelers out there is solid wireless in the room: 3.71 Mb/s down <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F1292711259.png&amp;s=97cb82e4a182720d8e7790d0d7ee774fdd8bdd89f6d5129bb089a83c918cf879"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/129...</a>Overall - mehI've stayed in a lot of Westin hotels and this is not up to Westin standards.  One of the great things about this chain is how consistent they are from property to property.  My room here felt old, most of the outlets didn't work to power my Mac and the restaurant is abysmal.   It feels grungy and the breakfast buffet looked unkempt enough that it scared me away (and that's unusual for me).  The location is not great primarily because there really are no other restaurant choices around that area.  I also couldn't connect to their wifi through Safari but could through Firefox.  Weird. This reminded me of a Radisson more than a Westin.SPG Platinum member who thinks this hotel meets normal Westin standards.  Good looking hotel on the outside, nice lobby, clean, well-kept, bar and restaurant look good, and the rooms are up to snuff.  Free parking via the garage with an attached walkway.  Got a room on a high floor away from street, and the room looks good.  Not sure how to reconcile that with the other reviews of old, dated rooms.Downsides include no concierge lounge and a minimal amount of restaurants I'd feel comfortable eating at in the area.  Another reviewer says there are lots of restaurants nearby, but a) none are in walking distance, and b) even with my poor eating habits I don't view Qdoba, Wingstop or Uncle Joe's Chicken Fingers as good options.Second time staying here, and both times the hotel seemed empty.  Maybe it's just me...I've stayed at this Westin a couple of times. I snagged the rooms here for around $75 via Hotwire and Priceline, so the value was great, especiall since parking is free out here. Located in the clean, safe and well-kept business district of Southfield - this hotel is very accessible to all the highways and is a short drive down The Lodge (M-10) to Detroit. It's also near 696 and is very equidistant to almost all areas of metro Detroit.The building looks very modern from the outside. It's truly a gem on the inside as well. Overall the lobby is very classy and business trendy. The rooms have some of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept on. They are kept very clean and equipped with a roomy, glossy bathroom - as well as a darn big LCD widescreen TV. This is truly a 3.5 to 4.0 star hotel. I had a drink at the bar in the lobby with an old friend, and the service and pricing was very reasonable.Overall, this is a great hotel for the price, especially when locked in via Hotwire or Priceline. Parking is free, service is up to par, the whole building is gorgeous inside and out, and there is even hand sanitizer at the front desk, haha. They are also very kind to late checkouts at 1PM, which guys like me who party hard on Saturday nights can appreciate on a detox Sunday afternoon. If you want to be in a central location in metro Detroit while being in the suburbs, and want to have a short drive to downtown, the airport, Dearborn, the east suburbs, Troy, Royal Oak, west suburbs, etc. - this this Southfield location will very much please you. Restaurants in the immediate area are awesome too. I highly recommend ""Beans &amp; Cornbread,"" the soulfood bistro nearby.I'm not a traditional type of girl. I would be more likely to throw a wedding in a field (which we did) than a hotel.That being said, the Westin Southfield is a beautiful spot for a wedding. Our friends got married here a few weeks back and it was very well done. The atrium was gorgeous, the food was nom worthy and the staff was really nice.The hotel itself was nice, as well. It seems like a decent place to stay in the metro-Detroit area. I was NOT a fan of the $12 glass of wine pre-ceremony, though. It was a little much for what I got, but what can you do? You're a captive audience at that point.This won't be long. When I was in my LDR, this was my hotel of choice, for several reasons:1.  It's the Westin--who wouldn't want to stay here?2.  The price...there's a cheaper way in!3.  The location--it's easily accessible, and pretty close to a lot of key areas of the metro Detroit area4.  Parking is free AND covered.5.  Free wi-fi...which is a luxury all on its own lolIt's a beautiful hotel, and you can get great deals on it periodically on those bidding sites. I've never eaten here, so i can't vouch for that. I usually don't go to hotels to eat...lol I don't think you can go wrong! But that's just me. =)Paid for wifi that barely works.  Writing this review from my mobile because the Internet keeps cutting out.While the staff was courteous and nice, this is probably the most disappointing SPG hotel I have stayed in.This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of it all. Perfect place for a wedding, as they have a gorgeous courtyard that makes you feel like you're outside without worrying what the weather will be. The dining halls are gorgeous and the rooms are so comfy! This hotel lives up to the Westin brand name.I've stayed at Westin Hotels around the world. The one in Detroit is a great value for the service and amenities. Quite cheap for a Westin. (I paid around $100 per night. Can't beat that!)The staff are amazingly nice. On one day, I was on my way out when one of the employees wished me ""an amazing day."" Wow. And that's not an exception. Everyone at the hotel is polite, they acknowledge you every time, and are genuinely friendly. Service is top-notch too. They are fast to greet you at the check-in counter or the restaurant. They are efficient yet friendly in fulfilling your needs. And since it's a Westin, the hotel rooms are comfortable, classy, and filled with nice shampoos and soaps. You even get an iron and board so you don't have to ask. Lighting is dim outside the bathroom, but since I didn't stay much in the room, that's not a drawback. The lamps have outlets on their base so you never have to stoop to plug in your laptop or phone; a convenient touch.The breakfast buffet was the let-down. Not bad, but the floor was sticky. Gross. I tried it once, then stuck with the menu items after that. Since the hotel has some delicious entrees with just the right portion amount, you're best to stick with the menu. I ordered an egg-whites only omelet with broccoli and cheese; very tasty! It came with a side of hash browns that were perfect; not greasy, and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Good stuff.The hotel is centrally located to surrounding neighborhoods. That's great except these neighborhoods are all a 15-20 minute car ride away. Unfortunately, this Westin is smack in the middle of a business park. The hotel is quick to get you a car, but you're best served by getting a rental if you stay here. (Unless you're on a business trip and the company's paying for your cab! I have to say, every cab driver I had in Detroit were friendly, great to talk to, and honest). There are some places in walking distance, but all are of the fast food / diner variety.Place has a gym and wi fi, and adjacent buildings in the business park are connected, so you never have to step outside if you're going to one of the nearby offices. This is a plus when you're talking Detroit with it's rain and snow.Overall, you can't beat the place given that most Westin Hotels are $300+ a night, and the great service. They even comp you $5 if you choose not to change your linens each night you stay. Pretty cool, and good for the environment too.Parking: Free and they have a garage which is wonderful in the winterElevators: super slow. They would generally only run 2 at a time, which meant tons of standing around.Food: The food was good the first couple of times I had it, but the selection is fairly limited and by my 4th week of staying there, I was pretty sick of it. Rooms: Comfy beds and clean facilities. Everything you should expect from a Westin. The King and Queen sized rooms both have enough space to allow for a workout in your room. Gym: Tiny. 5 treadmills, a stairmaster, and an elliptical for cardio machines. Some free weights and a bowflex. Definitively useable, but its also right next to the pool meaning that the air is super humid and warmer than normal. Definitively a no-no for me. Staff: professional and courteous. TLDR: If you're in the area and are concerned about travel time this is a great hotel to stay at. If you are willing to drive 15 more minutes the Book Cadillac in downtown is fabulous","This is my hotel of choice when on shopping trips around the Troy region. Simple reasons:- Accommodate dogs at no additional charge.- Solid breakfast selection and hospitality at Tango restaurant (within hotel)- Modern &amp; Immaculate rooms.- Quality service throughout the hotel.- Starbucks coffee in rooms.There are decent options for fast food and convenient stores nearby. Having said that, the hotel itself is located in an odd, yet safe mixture of townhomes and commercial buildings. Granted, the front desk could use refresher training in customer service and hospitality as they're a little icy, but I don't spend more than 3 minutes checking in, anyway.As a Gold Starwood member, and someone who goes out of their way to stay at Starwood...this hotel is a big disappointment.   I was on the Preferred guest floor and my room didn't have hot water, and there was a pile of cigarette ashes in front of the window, left from a previous guest.  There was a huge hole in the drywall where the bathroom door handle had smashed through it.   The cleaning staff was singing while cleaning, so loud it interfered with a conference call. The restaurant is decent, as is the gym, and parking is free.I stayed here this past Saturday as a surprise from the Mr. for our anniversary.  They have a special package that comes with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, and late check out (4 PM).  We stayed on the tenth floor and needless to say I can't mention too much about what the hotel offers!But as far the actual room, they have a collection called Heavenly, the bed and pillows felt as if they were made just for me.  We noticed that you can actually purchase the mattress, box springs and sheets,etc for a very reasonable price.  Ummmmmm  no, not used!  lol.  They have a booklet that highlights their collection for the public.  They have a nonsmoking policy in the entire hotel, which I was shocked to discover.   Their gimmick is ""be well"" or some jargon of the sort, but they promote physical and mental well being so smoky halls don't fit in with that I suppose.The only downside was the breakfast buffet at their restaurant Tango.  It was ok, just basic stuff that we cook at home.  It would have been nice to see some more unique options.  It was picked over, but Late and Later didn't get down there until 30 minutes before breakfast ended, and I never like to go anywhere when they are wrapping up. One highlight was curdled cream!  It was like they just went up to a cow, made her happy and brought the clumps straight to us! gross me out!  They replaced it expeditiously and discovered that they had 3 cases gone bad, but that should have been discovered before it came to our table.Overall, I recommend the hotel for locals looking to get away, or out of towners visiting.This is my go to hotel when I visit Southfield due to its proximity to our office.  I have no major complaints about the place.  The staff is always super friendly and the beds and showers are nice.  I knocked off one star on this review for the following:  Gym - given the size of this hotel, the gym needs to be larger and should offer more machines.Room Service - while the food tasted fine, everytime I ordered, they forgot something!!  Nothing like waiting for someone to run and find the correct item you orderedMenu - I have been coming here for almost 5 years, it is time for them to revamp their menu.  I appreciate the healthier options but the choices are limitedStayed here for three nights this week. The pros: Very conveniently located between all my meetings in the greater Detroit area. Easy to access and to park at. The staff is very friendly. The bed is incredibly comfortable. The bar serves a good Malbec. Poached eggs were good on the room service breakfast. The workout room was serviceable if a bit warm.The consMy room was verging on shabby. It was the Starwood Preferred Guest floor! The lampshades were stained. The in room dining book was falling apart and written on by previous guests. There was a handle missing from one of the drawers, a light bulb out in the bathroom and the wood surfaces were scratched. I could not figure out the wireless so did all my work on my cellular plan. The magnifying free standing mirror in the bathroom had a missing screw which meant I couldn't orient it properly .Being on business, i didn't have time to report or deal with the issues and they really didn't impact my stay - apart from the dim light in the bathroom. Having a Starbucks with bagels available in the lobby saved time and money on breakfast and the nearby restaurants - especially the kabob restaurant - were cheaper and nicer than Tango's. In summary - this hotel is serviceable for the business traveller not looking to spend much time in their room. It may not suit the vacation traveller.A very nice hotel with extremely helpful staff. The rooms are clean, new-age and spacious. Then only downside is that the restaurant is not that good. There breakfast and lunch selection is pricey and limited. Dinner and dessert is better. Ask the bellhop to point you in the direction of a restaurant to please your appetite and I bet you will be quite satisfied!I've stayed at this Westin a couple of times and I've always had a good experience. The staff/service is great, always helpful! The rooms are super spacious, always clean, and big flat screen TV is a plus! This location is particularly unique because it's attached to an office building so there's lots of restaurants, a gym, coffee shop all under one roof. Tango's is the restaurant on the first floor associated with Westin. I went there for a business dinner one night. Their fried macaroni is AMAZING as are their hot wings! Don't let the dim lights and mature crowd fool you, the place really isn't that expensive, and they have a good happy hour!Want a botanical wedding in the middle of January? There's a beautiful indoor garden atrium, with a huge glass wall, letting in all that sunlight. I've attended a couple weddings here too, and they have a big ballroom where you can have your reception.I would definitely recommend you stay here for any occasion!The beds here are soooooooo comfy!!  The blanket, the pillow, the mattress... mmmmmm.... I just want to go back and get swallowed up by the soft coziness!  The beds were so comfy, in fact, that I had trouble dragging myself up in the mornings.The rooms were well-kept/clean (and smelled really good!), the showers come with dual shower heads which I've never had before (I had fun playing around with them =P), they have a decently stocked gym, and they did a good job decorating for Christmas =)I just had a great customer service experience with a reservation problem.  Thanks!Here for work.  The Detroit office is in the next building, so it couldn't be more convenient.   Rooms are clean and attractive.  Awesome shower and comfy beds.  I just can't believe they charge for wifi / internet.   I've been in hotels half the price with free internetI stayed here for several nights over the holidays while back home to visit family. Since I love the Westin at DTW, I thought I'd be thrilled with this location as well. When I walk in to a place I feel the vibe, and what I felt here was not entirely positive. Nothing bad happened, but the place is not well lit, and my room was dark; that in addition to not feeling entirely at ease here, did not make for the most relaxing stay. Services were reduced or eliminated due to the holiday week, and they were only 20% full due to that. The bathroom had an odd smell to it, and though the room was fine overall, it was just an OK stay. I had some of the their food and oatmeal was very tasty (believe me, my oatmeal at home can't compare to their oatmeal); the shrimp with pasta and avocado is really tasty. Good service, just an off vibe.I love it here and stay at this location 5-6 times per year. I always get a nice, fluffy bed with lots of pillows and fresh linens, and the front desk staff is always happy to see me. Tangos is gross, but who cares, you're in Southfield. There are lots of restaurants nearby. Potbelly's down the street delivers, as well as Jimmy John's across the street.One of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in the area. The company I work for was hosting a conference for a couple of days and we did the entire package with Westin. Rooms were great! Nice, clean, and BIG. I checked in at night, so the room was pretty dark, and the light switch by the door only turned on a light by the door and then I had to hunt around in the dark for another light switch, which there wasn't one! The rest of the room lights were connected to lamps. What could improve? The conference food was terrible. Just bland, no taste, and gross. Skipping dinner tonight and hitting a chain because I just can't bear to eat anymore of it. Also, the parking garage is a mess! Things are roped off and all, the angles and signage is terrible.Heavenly Bed. Heavenly Food. Heavenly Service. I was in the Detroit area for a funeral so my stay at the Westin was pleasurably despite seeing my family during a sad occasion. Using my Star Friend discount was helpful for this last minute trip. The best part--the food-- green tea salmon, calamari with an olive sauce, and the berries and cream for dessert.  Delightful.We had a horrible experience. When we checked in they did not have us in the computer at all and insisted we were at the wrong place, even though I had my confirmation e-mail stating I was at the right location. They finally found it and after rude service we were checked in. Our room was supposed to be a larger room and when we checked in it was standard, so the manager moved us to a ""larger"" room (so she said), yet when we got there it was the SAME EXACT ROOM!! So we stayed in the original room.Room was NOT CLEAN at all, definitely not up to Westin Standards. Hair on the floor and stains on the sheets. Since it is winter we did not have control of the temperature in our room so the room was WAY TOO HOT!! We slept horribly because of it and also because the pillows are so old and flat that it feels like no pillow at all. About the pet policy, it is horrible and rediculous. You are allowed to bring pets but you can not leave them in the room alone AT ALL!! They did not tell us this when we booked the room. It does not even make sense..how do you go to breakfast or go do activities? Also, the elevators suck and you have to use a key every time you get in which is super inconvenient. Lastly, the pool and hot tub suck. It is so warm and muggy in the area we could barely breathe. The pool is only 3 feet deep and really small, so there is not much room for much of anything. It is also really hot in the pool.One more thing..whoever said something about fried macaroni is incorrect because they do not even serve those here. You can find a way better hotel for your money! Dont stay here! PS. I payed $15 extra for internet, and while I was writing this review it went out again.If you're used to frequenting SPG properties, this one is average compared to most that I've stayed in.  Definitely not the nicest Westin that I've stayed in, but it's a Westin and I have to stay in a hotel every week, so I'll take what I can get.  They have the heavenly bed and bath, but the hotel just seems a little dated (slow elevators almost make me want to give 3 stars, but the service that we've received makes this a 4 star hotel).    The workout room is decent, small but the equipment has built in tvs, so that's not so bad.The rooms are fine, nothing fantastic.  Definitely good enough for me to stay in every week and, as I said before, the staff is really nice.  This hotel is a solid 3.5 always, a 4 sometimes :)This place is fine.  If I weren't here on a ridiculously unnecessary business trip, I might have given this place 4 stars.  The service is good, the food is so-so but they do everything with a smile on their face.  Expensive for Detroit?  I would say so.  I wanted a beer after dinner so I ordered one - $15 for a Bass!  Ha ha...good thing I wasn't paying but come on.  Anyway, for room service there are massive charges that  if you there on business you could care less about but if it's your own wallet, beware!!I actually stayed at the Westin Southfield for a 3 day conference my company was sponsoring even though I lived 3 miles away. I wasn't complaining. It gave the chance to check out the place for free. I was satisfied with my overall stay. The gym facility served my purpose, the service from everyone was awesome and all 3 of my daily meals were cool.I especially like the restaurant/bar that is in the hotel. Since my visit to the hotel I frequently visit the restaurant/bar when I don't feel like being in crowded places. This hotel isn't as updated as the one I stayed in while in Chicago but hey no complaints from me.I have stayed here a couple of weeks and have had no problems at all. The staff is very friendly and I love the fact they had Michigan apples available at the front desk,  yumm. The only bad thing I can think of is the darn parking garage and the fact I can never seem to find the exit...I hate that.I just spend the weekend here with my boyfriend.  We were in town for the NCAA Midwest Regionals in Detroit (Go KU).  I LOVE Westins and this one didn't disappoint.  The beds are amazing... and I dream of the duel shower heads.  Flat screen tv's.  Mini-bar :)Kinda lame that they don't have wireless in the hotel and they charge $14 for internet access through the cable in the room.  They do have a community computer in the lobby though.  They were under renovation while we were there so the pool was closed as well as the gym.  However, I proudly squeezed in a work out (eats in Detroit are NOT healthy).  They moved all the aerobic machines into 3 guest rooms.  Slightly odd but it worked.  Really enjoyed my stay and if I ever come back to Detroit I'll definitely stay here.","The room is spacious,very  comfortable and clean. The business center has computers, wi-fi connection and state of art color printer/copier. Besides pool &amp; jacuzzi, the gym has all the standard gym equipments plus more. Most of them are the newest model, which I was a bit surprised since most hotel don't update their gym equipments.But the most impressive part was the customer service. The manager there, Pam really stands for what customer service is all about.. She was courtesy, understanding and with compassion.Growing up in Downriver Detroit, Southfield was just the other end of the Southfield freeway from me and the Town Center was where most of the big companies had their offices, before cities like Troy and Auburn Hills took that over.  The Westin dates from that time period architecturally, and while it's been remodeled, you can tell that this is a franchise hotel.  While the amenities are all the ones that you expect from a corporately owned Westin, the bed's not the same Heavenly Bed.  The signage, not the same.  It's like the parallel reality Westin.  However, good things are ability to park and how quiet the hotel really is.  My first choice for when I visit home is the Westin at the Detroit Airport, but, this will do, especially with a weekend rate of $80 a night.I like the bed and dual shower head.  The staff are generally friendly and helpful.  The restaurant and bar leave something to be desired though.  I especially dislike the layout of and lack of modern televisions in the bar.I arrived at the Westin Southfield at 2am during a blizzard.  The combination of a desk clerk that seemed genuinely glad to see me and greeted me with such warmth was so great after a wildly stressful drive across town in a whiteout.The beds (Westin Heaven Bed) was fantastic.  It is also dangerous for the business traveler as I was really reluctant to leave it in the morning to drive across town for a meeting.If you can get this place on Hotwire for a deal and (hotel with a golf course) it is worth it.Stayed there while on business trip in Detroit.  I was told later by a friend who lives in Michigan that Southfield is not the safest neighborhood.  This is an older hotel -- simply judging it based on the age of the elevators.  Staff is nice and helpful.  I was super sick while I was there, and the valet parking guy actually offered to get me medicine from Walgreens.  Of course we gave him a nice tip for that.  I got room service basically 3 out of the 5 nights I was there, and the Filet Mignon was really good (at least for hotel food).  I ate at the bar one night also, the shrimp cocktail was decent.  The only complain I  have with Westin is that I don't know why they don't support wireless...instead, I had to plug my laptop in to get internet connection.this really isn't that good of a hotel... although, i have def seen much worse. that said, i'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but because the floors aren't level and the carpet looks worn down, i can't give it more than 2 stars. =()","['review',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/detroit-marriott-at-the-renaissance-center-detroit,Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center,3.0,$$$,159,"This hotel could be great if more attention was paid to the details.  Architecturally, the hotel is a magnificent building but the structure design certainly shows its age.  The view made for an amazing morning view watching the sun rise over the city of Windsor. Complaints include missing bell hops during check in, broken appliances in the room, ""fresh linens"" that still had wine stains in them, and waiters who would rather wait until the next presidential election to check on our table.  Would I stay there again? Probably, but it's unlikely it will be my first choice next time I visit Detroit.*** UPDATE to comment below from manager.I called and left a long detailed message with a representative at Marriott Customer Relations about my experience on 11/25.  Having not had a phone call back, I called again on 12/1 to ask what the heck is going on.  They told me that they could still see my comment in the system and that to wait a few more days and they were sure a manager would get back to me from your hotel.  It is now 12/3, and you guys have responded on Yelp asking me to email in describing my experience and my contact info.  Further frustrations...______________________________________________________Really not what you would expect from a Marriott at all.  Huge beautiful building that seems to be deteriorating quickly.When we arrived the entire building had no water.  Couldn't use the sink, shower, or flush the toilets.  Once water came on again, our shower drain was completely clogged.  This was the 1st of 3 times we needed a maintenance man to come to our room.  He opened up the drain and pulled out about 5 years of other peoples hair and nastiness.Our keys stopped working multiple times a day for our room.  Probably had them reprogrammed 20x in 5 days.Our heater stopped working (wouldn't turn off no matter what... blasting hot air even set at 65 degrees,  This was maintenance guy #2).  I called at midnight asking for blankets... two hours later at 2 am I called again asking where they were.  She said she 'sees me in the system and I will have them in an hour'.  I asked her, 'Are you trying to tell me I am not allowed to sleep warmly in your hotel until 3am???""  They got them up pretty quickly after that.Our bathroom door needed to be oiled so bad that everytime someone opened it in the night it woke up everyone else in the room.  This was maintenance guy #3.  The staff was incredibly edgy, and at times down right rude.  Maybe this is a DETROIT thing that I am not used to, BUT IT SURELY ISN'T WHAT i EXPECT AT MARRIOTTS.  I will say the staff got nicer as the week progressed but the first few days they were really bad.  They had the entire Raider's football team in and a Men's Wearhouse Corporate Party... maybe they were over whelmed.The business center.  LOL.  Good luck in there.  Will cost you $30 to get anything done, the printer was broken, and the machinery archaic.  I thought this place was new?Good luck getting coffee in your room.  The cleaning ladies didn't have any.Oh and good luck getting your room cleaned.  We only wanted our room cleaned once in the five days we stayed.  Finally at 3pm we called to ask where someone was?  A woman finally came at 4 to clean our room, only to announce that our room isn't actually in her section and she would send the other girl.  Had to wait one more hour for the other girl.What the F are we paying for here?  You pay a serious premium at Marriott.  Albeit cleaner than a Motel 6, but sheesh.  I expect so much more.Still waiting to hear from hotel manager to see how they are going to 'make it better'.I've stayed at the Detroit Marriott RenCen three times in the past month, and each time was an overall positive and comfortable experience. The entrance to the hotel has security so I've always felt safe here. Check-in is easy, but there usually only seems to be one employee manning the front desk which makes check-in take longer than if there were multiple concierge clerks. The location is near so much stuff including the Greektown Casino, and the area seems safe to walk around during the day.Each room I've been in has been spotlessly clean and comfortable. Staying on the tower levels, I've been in rooms that had amazing views of Canada or downtown Detroit. Buying wi-fi is also easy. One of the best things I can say about this hotel is that whenever I've ordered room service the employee over the phone has told me my food will be there in 45 minutes and the food has always come in about half that time. The turkey burger is very filling and comes with chips.Besides the concierge seeming understaffed at times, another downside is that the hours of other places in the RenCen seem inconsistent. I went to the Starbucks one day around noon and they were already closed. The gift shop at the Marriott is great- with many snacks and tourist gifts, but also frequently closed at odd times. The Marriott does have a restaurant bar across from the front desk (named Volt-only in Detroit!) that is open for most of the day, and has good food (the breakfast buffet is solid).I enjoyed my overnight stay at the Marriott RenCen.  The bed was comfortable and the entire room was clean.  We had a great view of the night lights from our #5509 room.  First time staying there and yes I did feel it was worth the money I spent booking through Priceline.  Only complaint was the linen, wash clothes, and towels looked old or should I say ""dingy"".  However, as long as they were washed with bleach and hot water, I should be safe.  The bathroom was clean and decent for its purposes.  One could tell there is gradual renovations happening so I'll pardon the out-dated decor in the halls.  Valet was busy but I had to be mindful that it was check-out time and everyone was leaving at once.  Overall, pleasurable stay and would stay again.Don't stay here if you can help it. So I arrived to the hotel Valentines Day weekend. Had my babes taken by the bellhop and my car by the valet. I headed up to check in and that went  smoothly. Madash was friendly and knowledgeable and was probably the only good part of my stay. I told her I was in a hurry and she said my bags would be right up. I went up to my room and waited for my bags. 5 minutes went by and I called down to see where my bags were. I was told they would be right up. 20 minutes later with no bags i got a call from a bellhop telling me he was on his way up with them. After another 10 minutes I finally got my bags. 30 minutes to get bags up to my room? I could have just brought them up myself. Then when I did receive them, the gift bag I had packed looked like it had been gone through. Everything was still there so I didn't make a big deal of it. I then left the hotel to pick up my fiance from the airport. When we got back to the hotel we decided to order the champagne that came with the room package. It was 4:30pm and I was told by guest services that room service didn't start until 5pm but I could probably get it before then. I said ok. We waited an hour with no champagne and then started drinking the drinks I brought with me to the hotel. At about 7:30 with no champagne I called guest services to cancel the champagne and take it off my bill. They complied. 5 minutes later theres a knock on my door and room service has champagne and glasses. I refused the champagne as we had a standing reservation at Andiamo's for 8pm. Just ridiculous. So you bring my champagne 3 hours later? What kind of shotty operation is this? So after we return from dinner, I checked out the bathroom and was disgusted to say the least. Mildew in the shower, dirt near the corners of the tub, signs of mold and mildew on the light fixture. Then I came out and inspected the rest of the room. There were stains on the sheets, the remote control  had to be wiped down with disinfectant wipes. It was not the most romantic night. The next morning I went down and spoke with Charming at the from desk and told her about my experience. She told me she would apply a $40 credit to my account for the champagne issue. What about the rest? I want my entire stay to be comped. To add insult to injury, I checked my checking account, no credit. I was charged for the full amount. I will not be staying here ever again and I will definitely spread the word to my friends. If you are looking for a less that satisfactory experience then this is the place for you.UPDATE 2/19The hotel did in fact give me a credit. And offered 5000 reward points. I scoffed at the offer. 5000 points for a ruined Valentine's Day experience. No deal! Still waiting to hear back from the hotel.To say that this hotel has seen better days is pretty generous. I'm generally a fan of Marriott branded properties, but this is not one of them.When I arrived, the check-in desk was woefully short staffed. With a line snaking through the lobby back to the elevators, more than half of the check-in terminals were unstaffed. I almost burst into laughter when the person eventually checking me in casually asked ""did you experience any travel delays on your way in?"" (I hadn't until I arrived in that line). The guest rooms were definitely not up to what I would consider Marriott standards. Doors creaked, walls were banged up, sheets were not pressed, and the toilet needed to be flushed more than once to get everything down. Worst was that the room was not especially clean. The area near the windows were dirty and dusty. The area behind the bed hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. I thought about going back down and asking for another room, but then I remembered that ridiculous line, plus who knows that any other room would have been any better?Below average Marriott with relatively low rates. You get what you pay for in this case.Great place to stay! Everything you need is right here. The people mover takes you all around the city and its only 75 cents. The rooms are a little dated. There's a Starbucks, CVS, large bar, and AMAZING views. The only thing is accessing the second floor to get to the people mover. A sweet worker named Anna took us to almost every elevator until we could find it since we had a friend that is handicapped. If we didn't have Anna that went the extra mile for us, we would've never found it! (It's by the Verizon store and Detroit police station on the 1st floor)I was debating between 3 and 4 stars and I'll get to why I rounded down at the end. Pros:  Nice size room.  Bed was really comfortable and good size TV.  Location was great as well.  You are right off the Detroit River and it's plenty of places along the boardwalk to eat and do.  It's a conference center hotel so it's extremely large.Cons: Check-in absolutely sucks.  I've never stood in line for 45 minutes waiting to check-in a hotel.  And there were only 6 people in the line.  The reps just took their time with checking ppl in and then going back and forth from the back in between check-ins while ppl were standing in line.  Not a good start.While it was great to be next to the Detroit River, my view was a small opening of it and an empty, vacant room that was under construction.  Looked like an abandoned building.  I get it may be under construction but not pleasant to see when you wake up everyday.  Bathroom was a little run down.  Towels were old.  The saving grace was the shower but that's about it. Usually I would say 3.5 stars but then I saw the most absurd thing I've ever seen at a hotel.  A $45 AUTHORIZATION CHARGE TO USE THE PRINTER DOWNSTAIRS.  Yes, every time you swipe your card to print something or look up something on the Internet, a $45 hold is placed on your card EVERY TIME.  Who is printing out that much stuff to secure 45 dollars?  I printed Erykah Badu tickets not the Bible.  Ridiculous.Stayed here on a Saturday night as we were attending the MoPop festival. I've been to this hotel many times and I knew it was going to be busy, it always is. However upon walking in to check in the line was so long it went all the way down the hallway. It took AN HOUR to check into our hotel room and when I walked up to be check in I received no apology for the long wait. Not to mention there were SEVEN people checking in guests! I don't understand how it took so long considering it took me about 2 minutes. The line should have been moving much faster, and they staff should have been so sorry for the long wait. The room was clean, and nice and we were give a really nice view...points for that. We didn't spend much time in the room so when we came back to crash I noticed that they only gave us 2 pillows on each bed...which seems weird as normally they will give you 4 pillows on each bed. A few of us wanted extra pillows so I called hospitality and asked if I could have 3 pillows brought up to our room...she said ""I don't know if I have 3, but I""ll bring you 2"" Fine....ok...whatever. About 45 minutes go back and still no pillows, so I call again and I was told that there was a lot of request in front of me and the runner would be there as soon as possible. Ok. Well another hour goes by and still no one came to bring us our pillows. At this point I was SO tired I didn't even care to call back. I don't think I'll stay here again, you can't beat the location but I'd be willing to stay somewhere else for a nicer experience.I stayed at this hotel while visiting a good friend in Detroit for her wedding. Overall, I'd say that this hotel was very accommodating and clean. It was very interesting having GM cars line the bottom floor. The room was clean and spacious and the view was outstanding. We were on the 60th floor and looked straight into Canada. I was a little disappointed there was no fridge, but I don't consider that to be a big deal. What knocks this hotel off down several stars is the so-called valet service. They handed me a valet ticket that had three options for car-retrieval. Option 1 - there was a number I could text that alerts the front desk in advance that I want my car. This number was blacked out in permanent marker. Option 2 - there was a number I could call that would alert the front desk in advance that I want my car. That number was also blacked out in permanent marker so I couldn't read it. What is going on? Finally, I could scan a QR code to alert the front desk in advance that I wanted my car. To no surprise, that code didn't work. Ergo, I had to go to the front desk to tell them I want my car. Of course, this is fine. I asked them why the ticket was blacked out and why the code didn't work. They simply shrugged their shoulders and ""I don't know, it doesn't work."" Okay...so 45 minutes later the car FINALLY pulls up. The valet is quite rude and rushing us....and when he realized that I wasn't going to leave a tip due to extremely sub-average service, he became almost hostile. The hotel is nice but you have to get your Valet service act together. The lack of professionalism and working product is a substantial knock on the overall experience.I cannot say it enough ... FAIL. FAIL.  FAIL. Oh the staff try and they are all super nice. ...kudos to manager of the restaurant deserves a medal.  She had several hundred angry ( I can't get a room) people descend on her restaurant and she managed beautifully.  The food was only ok ...but every waiter and bartender was on point.  Further, I noticed that she tried to remedy issues outside her scope ...Like working with the bell captain to get luggage stowed and housekeeping re: status of rooms ...But overall this property is a poor reflection on Marriott! 1.  The towels are an embarrassment.  They're old. Greying.  Thin.  Replace them. 2.  There's a space for a fridge ...but there isn't one?! 3. Despite the issues with check in, not one word from management.  A nice letter of apology would have gone a long way.  NEVER again.This is the place to stay during Movement. With VIP pre-sale, you can also get dibs on some rooms at a discount price. This year, there were a couple of weddings and a national volleyball tournament happening in the city at the same time, with patrons of all three in the hotel itself. I was impressed that the people we encountered were very nice. Jonathan, in particular, was very fun(ny) when we checked in as he mused about all the different populations in the hotel that weekend. (They offered complimentary ear plugs due ot the festival.)The staff were able to keep the lobby relatively clean, though at Movement's peak, there were straggling bottles and napkins all over the place. The woman cleaning our room was nice. The bottom sheet of our bed was definitely not fitted correctly and kept coming off, but it was only a small nuisance.Great time In The ""D"" First to hotel. Get ticket band for concert..Styx.. Buffet at Andiamos. A bit pricy  but ok food. Chicken, salad and a pasta dish for $20.00. Concert rite across street. RenCen open all night with nice clean bathrooms, thank you GM !I've stayed here a few times over the years, especially recently, and found that it's one of the nicer spots to stay in Detroit.The place is open to all people and for all events, from wedding parties to family reunions to concert goers to people who just want to party on a Saturday night. The rooms are above average, boasting nice carpeting, beds (very comfortable mattresses, among the best I ever slept on) and great views of the city and sometimes the river/Canada if you're lucky. The ice machines always work, they have bars and easy access to restaurants, there is a Starbuck's inside for a quick pick-me-up, etc.The price isn't the worst, though it's not a stay at the Econo Lodge for $25. On a summer Saturday you might be shelling out $250 for a room based on events taking place in the city, or just for the ""grandeur"" of the hotel itself. I always was perplexed to find that our most recent room had no blow dryer in it. Even the crappiest hotels I have stayed in have had hair dryers. They also skimp a little on bath towels.Overall, it's a nice place to drink, play and sleep. It's nice to close the shades to pitch black, turn the A/C down to 62 degrees and sleep like a king or queen, if only for a night. And when you check out, you just have to leave your room and call it a day. Definitely worth a visit.The customer service is horrible. I'm a business traveler, the service is definitely not what I'm used to at a Marriott hotel. I've been waiting for clean towels since this morning and it's 12:20 am. I've been calling the operator for 15 minutes on the house phone at the front desk and I've not gotten an answer, it just rings. There are dirty towels and trash in the halls on my floor. Three people have come in and out of the back office and never acknowledged that I was standing at the front desk. I've been waiting for a refrigerator to be delivered to our rooms since Monday and we check out in the morning. I will not be my choice to ever stay here again.One of the best places to stay in Downtown Detroit.   Several renovations have made a big difference in improving the experience.  The Concierge lounge is very nice.  There is also pretty good food options right near by.The view can be very good - especially if you get a river view. Unfortunately ours view was somewhat spoiled by a stupid decal they put on the side of the building for the upcoming Grand Prix.  If you want to stay downtown and near the river, this is a very good option.Poor Customer Service at the Renaissance Marriott Downtown Detroit!!I checked into the hotel and once I got to my room, I noticed two charges for the exact same room rate moments after another. I called downstairs and the lady answered the phone and told me to come down and they will look into it. I went and told her the problem and she immediately said ""oh thats your bank"". I replied, ""Why would my bank charge two room rates moments after another?"" She replied, "" sometimes my bank does that?"" Huh? (First mistake) I requested to speak to the manager and she never showed. She send this complimentary breakfast coupon out, after my pressure for something to smooth it over but he/she never showed their face after 15 mins of waiting.So, it seems as though since I used my debit card to pay for the room, it holds two room rates. i called customer service and she was explaining to me what happens as opposed to using the credit card. I agreed and said again, but why the second hold moments later. If its not incidental, a debit card fee, or any other fee, why the second hold moments later. She replied, "" maybe she changed the reservation"". So she transferred me to another lady who basically was saying the same thing regarding the first hold but couldn't explain the second. At this point, no one is acknowledging the fact that the lady at the front desk charges me the room rate(which is fine) and probably meant to charge incidental but charged another room rate. Keep in mind, I never even had a hold pending for incidental so we know the room rate wasn't for incidental.I got an email from the manager explaining the same thing but said NOTHING about the second charge. She went on and on about the hotel industry and I can always use another card in the future. Never once did she explain why two charges for the same amount was appeared moments after the other and why there was no incidental fee. She also went on to say that the Marriott was not responsible for over draft if any overdraft fees occurs. First, this was a crass assumption because I don't even have overdraft fees and on my account and second, I mention to the customer service center that "" thankfully I had enough to take cover the two charges and I have no choice but to wait."" No one said anything about overdraft fees. Maybe next time if the young lady was less busy talking about her coworker being hungry and crazy, she would have more time to ask the important questions at the front desk and getting the charges right. I have stayed in many Marriott's over the past year, this was just a very different experience.First stay after achieving Platinum Status with Marriott ... of course there woudl be a Penecostal convention going on ... and of course the concierge lounge would be overrun with people who weren't supposed to be there who had big appetites and even bigger mouths, complaining about this (but, you're not entitled to be in the lounge), that (... but...you're not entitled to be in the lounge) and several points in between (forgetting the fact that ... ... you're not even supposed to be in the lounge).  Things got so bad that the GM had to visit the situation to see for herself ... only to be chatted up by another platinum (or so she says) guest who WAS allowed in the lounge but who had to repeat several times ""... you know, platinum member means I have over 75 stays at Marriott properties this year?""   Yes chatty, platy Kathy ... everyone heard you...each of the seventy-five times you said it.  But anyway, GM, concierge staff ... they handled the chaos like pro's.  The Westin is newer, but for the location, the views (if you get the right room) and friendly and helpful staff, i'll keep coming back to the Ren Cen Marriott.This place used to be much nicer. I was just there earlier this week for a conference and the room was disgusting; mold In the bathroom, old discolored towels, stained bedding...ugh!  To compound the misery, the food was the worst I have ever had.  Cold, overly salted, not cooked or over cooked. Never again!Room was fine. Clean and decently appointed. However the hotel is poorly designed and staffed. 20 minutes for an elevator to get to your room. 10 to get down. 30 minutes plus for the valet to get you your car. I am way too impatient for this place. Will not stay again.","Adding another star because of the fantastic room service. Chef did a custom meal for me which was one of the best room service meals I've had in awhile. And all of the service has been tremendous from over the phone to in person from guest and room services. Everyone has had fabulous attitudes which is what you want from a business in the hospitality industry.I didn't actually stay in the hotel, but let me just say how beautiful it is here and how massive this place is. Came here for the 42nd annual Access dinner, and the banquet hall on the fourth floor is huge. Greeted by friendly valet that were so busy but took care of us with kindness. They had signs where to go and ushers leading us to the elevators and then greeted with more ushers on the fourth floor to guide us where we were supposed to go. As we were walking in to the beautiful hall, our tables were beautifully set and plated to perfection. Candles everywhere, bread rolls, butter, water glasses filled, a million pieces of silverware, salads and desserts were plated. After the speeches were finished, our plates were cleared and our plated entrees were brought out with fast service. Fresh coffee was served, and omg were their chocolate cakes and cheesecakes so delish. Everything was class from start to finish, and perfect for a nice mingling night with some powerful respectable people.Having stayed here again for Youmacon 2014 and Midwest Media Expo 2014 I can at safely say that nothing much has changed from my prior review of the place. I suppose the only big changes were more signage from the convention telling people where to go (which was really nice) and the great fact that at Midwest Media Expo, the elevator lines were small to non-existant which was a godsend. The lines for the elevators at Youmacon however were definitely long as usual but there were no hotel staff that I saw keeping an eye on the lines as in prior years. As far as the hotel itself, nothing much has changed from my last review. Its still incredibly easy to get lost and you better have a big chunk of change on you if you want to eat anything. There seemed to be a couple of new places in the food court (a new mexican place comes to mind the most, it was really good!). As stated in my last review, the McDonalds does NOT have a Dollar Menu so be aware of that when eating there. The only gripe I always have about this venue is the People Mover station. You have to go through a tunnel to get to it and it is always without fail, freezing cold because there is very little enclosed space in the outdoor part of the station. There is some roof coverage but the wind is still constantly whipping around you and you will be frozen by the time the People Mover pulls in. This is why I love the Cobo Hall station because that one is indoors. The only other revision to my prior review is what the heck was up with the hotel staff and the piano in the lobby during Midwest Media Expo (April 10-12)? My friend was allowed to play on it for a little while prior to checking in (which by the way took FOREVER as there seemed to be only one or two people at the check-in desk when we arrived) and the next day apparently something changed and he wasn't allowed to play on it and the lady at the check-in desk rudely told him that he wasn't allowed to play. Another complaint I have was from back in October... my friends and I were trying to get a taxi from the RenCen back to the Greektown Casino Hotel where we were staying for Youmacon 2014. The lady who ""assisted"" us (and I use that term very loosely) was beyond rude. She essentially 'bitched' at my friend because we weren't sure how much the fare would cost and had the audacity to say ""It's a $5 ride! Do you kids not have $5 on you!?"" (Keep in mind I am paraphrasing that, as I don't recall how much cab fare was, but it was relatively cheap - we just didn't know, hence why we asked for help in the first place). I really hope her behavior has changed since October because that was probably the rudest thing I have ever seen a hotel staff member do. Other than the abovementioned points, there aren't any other major revisions to my review that I can make. I hope this proves helpful to others staying at the RenCen for Youmacon or any other events.Stayed for the movement festival during memorial weekend. I will never stay at this hotel ever again. I booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> but called marriot to confirm and reserve two double beds months in advance. I arrived and was given a suite with a king bed. There was 4 of us staying in that suite. I was then promised two roll away beds not only was I given the run around for about 4-5 hours before I recieved my two roll away beds. Also staff was very rude, I encountered some very pleasant and polite staff majority was very rude to me. I was also told at one point that I'm only allowed two towels for my stay due to the hotel being overbooked, that was not okay for me so I fought for more towels. This is my second year staying in that hotel I will never stay there ever again. And anybody who I will warn them to never stay there. Not worth it.I am very torn about how to rate this place.  I normally rate based on whether I would return, and I'm not even sure how I feel about that.  There were so many ups and downs here.I can't decide to start with the good or the bad, so I guess I'll just start in chronological order.First I will clarify that there was an Eminem &amp; Rhianna concert downtown the night before and the night we were staying.  So the hotel was sold out in advance.  We only booked 2 weeks in advance (long after a lot of others had booked) so our regular room was $250 before tax.We arrived on Saturday at 4pm (check in starts at 3).  It took about 30 minutes to get from the street through valet into the lobby.  At 4:30pm check in was the biggest shit show I've ever seen in a hotel.  The ""line"" snaked all through the lobby and there were people everywhere.  Someone mentioned the line to check in was 3 hours.  So we decided to go put our stuff back in the car and just walk around and explore downtown for a while.  On our way down to valet, someone mentioned it was a 1 hour wait for your car through valet.  Luckily our car hadn't even moved yet, so we used our other key to open it and drop stuff off.We walked through the hotel, which is gorgeous, and went out the back to the riverwalk.  The riverwalk is amazing, and it was lovely to be out there.  This hotel really does have a great location.  We walked around downtown, walked through Greektown, and had a nice afternoon.We returned to the hotel at 6:30 (we had 7:30 dinner reservations and needed time to get cleaned up).  At 6:30pm the hotel was still checking in people that had been there hours earlier.  When people finally checked in they were cheering.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that people had been tailgating while in line.  Some drank beers straight out of their coolers, others had drinks from the bar that was right next to registration and the line.  We finally checked in at 7:15pm.  Other people were being told at check in that their room still wasn't ready yet (a lot of rooms were still being cleaned).  I think we were angry enough that they found a clean room for us.All of the hotel staff seemed completely frazzled.We got up to our room and the view was outstanding, however there was only 1 bed instead of 2.  We called downstairs and they sent up a rollaway within a few minutes.The hotel comped us breakfast in the morning for our troubles, but said they didn't have time to do anything else at the moment we were checking in.  The next morning we called the corporate office to complain, and they were very understanding and apologetic and reduced our rate for our troubles.  While this was enough for me, I don't actually think it is good enough in the end.It really isn't acceptable for a hotel to have guests waiting for hours to check in.  What if people who arrived in the afternoon were late to their evening weddings, concerts, meetings, etc because they could not get into a hotel room they reserved and paid for in advance.The breakfast Sunday morning was fantastic.  I'm not sure I would pay $22 for it, but I'm cheap.  It was certainly a wonderful breakfast.  The staff in the restaurant/bar were wonderful, patient, and kind.  It was a huge difference from the staff experiences we'd had the night before.  There were so many healthy and unhealthy options for breakfast.  They had scrambled eggs, pancakes, blueberry pancakes, bacon, sausage, turkey bacon, turkey sausage, and biscuits and gravy out.  They would make omelettes and waffles upon request.  There were all the standard cold options.So to recap, the location was great, the water front views were great, the corporate office fixed our issues promptly, but the hotel has issues getting guests into rooms (which is kinda a big deal for a hotel since that's all you really need).  In the end I decided that not being able to get into your room promptly is too big of a problem for a hotel to have, and therefore it is hard to encourage other people to stay here.This is a very nice Marriott located right by GM in Downtown Detroit. The rooms are pretty clean, service is great and amenities are definitely adequate.Parking is reasonable at $25/day for valet and anywhere between $15-$20/day for self-parking.The hotel is close to Greektown which is a great little area for grabbing a bite, as well as a couple of casinos if you like to gamble.The sports arenas, Comerica Park (Tigers) and Ford Field (Lions) are walking distance, only about 1 mile or so away. There is also a food court and some stores for shopping connected right to the hotel. Love that convenience.So I'm on my third visit now and the rooms I have had the second and third visit were definitely nicer than the first.  The nicest of the three is on the 52nd floor.  The 29th floor is definitely better than the 15th.  I have had occasion to use the laundry service, which was very prompt, though it would have been good if they'd left me a new laundry slip and bag -- I called to request one the next day but unfortunately couldn't wait in the room long enough for it to arrive which kind of defeated the purpose.As in my first visit, everyone on staff has been extremely friendly.  I ran into the housekeeper as I was returning to my room and she was super friendly, told me she'd already been in my room (she was finishing up next door) and hoped everything was to my satisfaction.  Interestingly enough, like my first visit she did not throw out any of the obvious trash (in this case, a crunkled up straw wrapper or the used styrofoam cup).  Iy  can see not risking to throw out something a guest might want but an empty straw wrapper?  Just seems weird.  Not upsetting in any way, just weird.  My beds have all been comfortable and the baths have good hot water and water pressure.  The soundproofing of the door could be improved in my current room; two men were chit chatting outside my door this morning when I was dressing and if I'd been trying to sleep it would have been a bit vexing.  But I have not heard any late night racket or anything like that.So really, my complaints are pretty minor and I'm upping the rating to 4.  I still recommend asking for a renovated room though.My recommendations for other businesses inside the RenCen - Joe Muer Seafood is great if you're splurging.  The gyro place in the food court has suprisingly non-greasy gyros (they're not amazing, but they're not greasy!).  The scallop entree at Andiamo is really good and worth dining there just for that, but stay away from the giant only-cooked-on-the-outside meatball.  If you want to have a great dinner or beers nearby but outside the hotel... Jacoby's, all the way.I am rating the Marriott 2 stars and that's basically based on the restaurant/bar VOLT! Breakfast and lunch was delicious and the staff was very accommodating and friendly. I was extremely disappointed with the Marriott hotel itself. Where do I begin.... I'll start with the check-in.... As I'm waiting in line and there are 4 women at the counter to ""be of service"" I continue to wait as they were extremely flustered and distracted by a rather handsome gentleman that was being assisted with his check in ahead of me; but I waited patiently. Once I was noticed (I was the only other customer in line at this point) one lady finally makes eye contact and says ""can I help you""....lets just say I didn't get the warm welcome I am quite accustomed to being a platinum elite Marriott member....but that's neither here nor there. She was very short and didn't seem like she wanted to be there as I handed her my license and asked if I could check into my room ( I reserved a king bed and requested a crib for my 7 month old and a mini fridge for my breast milk). I was told ""we don't have a king available right now we can give you a double or you can wait"".... Seeing that hubby and I just drove 13 hours with an infant I settled for the double beds as I couldn't even fathom how long I would be waiting for a king and was exhausted. We get to our room and of course there is no crib and no fridge.Our room was not made up when we walked in. We ended up in a handicaps room with a door that didn't lock correctly. We were never given any direction on how to work the lock. I was very disappointed in the quality of service along with the condition of the room. For $200 plus a night I expected a lot more. I wouldn't recommend the property even though it may be one of the most reasonable priced places. U might be better off heading north on I-75 to find better accommodations.We drove down here to attempt to reserve a block of rooms for our Wedding. They then just gave me a phone number to their representative; which was fine.After trying to work with rep Kelly, she was condescending to my Fiance and was slightly rude. I've had to follow up with her twice before getting a response. I've had many great experiences with Marriott but this one didn't meet my expectations.I stayed in a room at the Renaissance Center for a wedding. We were supposed to be able to check in on Saturday at 3pm. Unfortunately, there was a large conference there that weekend and a lot of them hadn't checked out yet so our room was not ready when it was supposed to be. The line to check in was very long and there were only a few people working the check-in desk, so we stood in line for almost 20 minutes just to find out our room wasn't even ready. We were told that they would call us when the room was ready. Thank goodness our friend was lucky enough to get checked into his room, so I went up there to shower and start getting ready as we had to be at the ceremony by 5. We got the call that the room was ready shortly after I had finished showering, so that was good. When we went back down to the lobby, the line was even longer than before. Since all we needed was to get the room keys, we went up ahead of the line and asked for them at the desk. The woman at the desk was rude, and said, ""I'm helping these people, and it's going to be awhile, so you need to get back in line."" she was talking over me as I was trying to explain that we had already checked in and just needed keys. She kept repeating herself and finally told us that we could go to the Elite line. Once we were in the Elite line (which was still very long), we finally got the keys and got to the room. The whole process was frustrating. I'm not sure why all the conference attendees were allowed to stay later in the rooms that were booked for a wedding party, but that was poor planning. I heard that many of the wedding guests weren't able to even get into their rooms before the wedding. The price of the room wasn't bad, but I don't know that I would stay here again. If I did, I would plan for a very large amount of extra time and not expect to be able to get into the room at the promised time.Bad experience. They overbooked the hotel so some of our party have to sleep in rooms without beds. Also, their boiler went out both mornings that we were there so we didn't have any warm or hot water to shower. I would recommend other hotels in thee area. For their price it wasn't worth the stay.Filthy. The elevators are dusty, the floor buttons are dusty, staff is incredibly rude, hair in shower, random cigarettes in our room, mean people work here. Spent $300 a night for an elite conference and everyone is mad because it is pure FILTH. If you like sleeping on other people's filth and have money, stay here.Unlike in some cities, there is not much choice of luxury hotels in Detroit. Marriott is not luxurious, but keeps its standards and quality. And it offers definitely the most spectacular view of the city, river and Canada. Walking distance to the river walk and downtown. Spacious rooms. Excellent room service menu, but it's not 24 hours, unfortunately, just till 11pm on weekdays and till midnight on weekend. So if you're coming late from the concert or something - order in advance and ask them to bring the table in your room before they close. They used to have shrimp quesadilla that was very delicious, but they discontinued that one. No minibar, no fridge. But if you ask- they kindly bring little fridge to your room. Breakfast downstairs at the restaurant on lobby level. Since the hotel is located in the huge Renaissance center- there are a lot of conventions going on all the time and a lot of people during daytime. CVS pharmacy and Starbucks are right in the building. Couple great restaurants downstairs- one seafood, one Italian. The fitness center is pretty big and occupies three rooms: all that you might need for the good workout is there: cardio, weights etc. The stuff is nice and friendly. Great quality for reasonable price.Reserved a suite which only had a pull down bed.  When time came to go to sleep, bed had no sheets or pillows and none were to be found in room. Couldn't get anyone to answer calls for bedding. After 4 attempts and 30 minutes later,  tattered bedding and pillows  dropped off without so much as an apology. Paid a premium to stay in a suite and had to beg for linens and make my own bed. Horrible.After a prior less than positive stay about a year ago which the management addressed we booked a night. I am very glad we did. The staff was very professional and freindly. Our room was very clean and the hotel felt safe. The ren cen had many shops and resturant options at every price range. Our room had a great river view and the night lights were beautiful. It was a very romantic classy night. The hotel offers a very high end feel and the hotel bar was alive and fun.Not impressed. Price was high for the mediocre room. Elevators from any floor over 7 take forever. got into our room and went to shower and noticed an open half used bottle of conditioner- if housekeeping missed that what else did they miss?! :( toilet was overflowing after 1 use. Called front desk and the maintenance man was excellent. For something that was once the pride and joy of detroit it has definitely gone down hill.I would never come back here, Very disappointed in the customer service. My first time ever staying here was the end of July and I would never return. We booked a room for a Saturday night. We had tickets to the Tigers game at 1pm that day (double header game) we called twice, the day before our reservation to check if we could do early check-in, we were told to call the day of our reservation and we did.  We called at noon to see if we could check-in early and just take the people-mover to the game. The staff told us YES, we could check-in early. We were on our way! We get down there, have our bags and get to the counter.  No one is in line but us; it takes forever to be greeted by the nasty front desk girl who looks like she's been bothered and has her head down, not acknowledging us until we say  hello...  She very rudely tells us we cannot check-in but we can leave our bags off to the side and come back after our Tigers game. We both agreed to do that, no point in getting upset. But I should've written down whoever I spoke with on the phone who originally told us that we could check-in early.  We come back from the Tigers game and planned on getting ready, relaxing, going to dinner and going out for the night. We come back to check-in, this other girl at the desk was very nice. She Checked us in, gave us our two room keys, asked if we needed anything, etc. and we were on our way up, the check-in process did not take long at all.  On the 53rd floor, very nice room, great view, comfy bed.  My boyfriend took a shower and got ready, I was fixing my hair and makeup, he gets out of the shower and gets dressed and all of the sudden we hear someone is at our door &amp; uses their key and walks right into our room! Some lady with her hands full of her own bags actually walks into our room and her key worked. We were just shocked... Thankfully we were both dressed, and at least we were there.  If we weren't there- what if that person was going through our stuff? Stealing, etc. You never know... So this lady who walks into our room is so embarrassed and states she's meeting her husband down here for the night and he's already checked in and the front desk gave her a key for our room. Her and I go down to the front desk, the girl who just checked in my boyfriend and I tells me that she has no record of us checking in. (She literally checked us in maybe 15/20 mins before this happened) The girl at the front desk needs a lesson in customer service. I asked to speak with the manager and the girl just pointed to where she was at, not polite or anything.  The manager said she was sorry, but really didn't seem to care. This was my first time staying here, I want to enjoy it, I want to come back, I want to let other people know my experience. She tells the lady who walked into our room that her husband does not have a room at the hotel for the night.. And that she also cannot find my reservation. She leaves and comes back after a few minutes, figures everything out somehow and tells the lady that they will comp her husband's room for the night. I of course stated she better be doing something for our room as well. We didn't have to pay for our room, but at this point I didn't even want to stay there... everyone was cranky and seemed like they hated their jobs.  We also requested a fridge for our room, which was not there and we were told that they were already gone for that night.  I ended up writing a letter to corporate and STILL have not heard back. Very disappointed.  Would never stay here again. I know that things happen; I wouldn't have been so upset if the staff was friendly and helpful.Sunday afternoon: Got here at 11, was traveling all night. Trying to rest, massive drilling sound like someone drilling into concrete constantly every 2 or 3 minutes. Called the front desk and they said curtains are being hung and there's nothing that can be done about it. Now I have a massive headache. Almost 5pm and still drilling away. Sent email and contacted on Facebook - nothing has been done!  Would never stay here again.  Who would have imagined construction on a Sunday afternoon.  I can't wait to hear their excuse on this one.  Maybe I'll get some work done and pay $15 for internet (per day that is) since I can't sleep.Lobby and entrance is really nice but the room isn't anything special. Confusing hotel to navigate but it is very clean.","I'm adding another star because they actually have staff answering people's comments making sure issues and concerns are fixed.  That tells me that they actually care about their visitors.  Thank you for taking the time to comment on my post.  Kudos and hopefully next time I stay there, I will be able to give them 5 stars!My girlfriend and I booked a ""scenic"" room with a king bed for a one weekend night so we could attend a show at the Fillmore. Parking was easy. Even though there we're some wedding parties at the hotel, the check-in was fast and professional. Also the building is rad. Our scenic room was just that, 38th floor. Our room was totally updated since my last visit a few years ago and our view was awesome. Everyone at the hotel, and in Detroit; was great.After the show we decided to go back top the hotel and get room service. The late night menu was limited, and we went with the pizza. Room service at decent hotels continues to surprise me. Great pizza, drinks with an awesome view, and a perfect ending to a great night. And check-in is at 3 PM with a Noon check-out, so we got to sleep in a bit.Our stay was decent, I've been to better Marriots, but I've also been to worst hotels.  The military room rate is always appreciated at the Marriott, the location is great seeing that it's downtown by the water and the people mover is accessible.  The room was nice and cozy,nothing too special. The service was mediocre, especially since originally they didn't apply my Marriott rewards number and tried to charge me for complimentary Wi-Fi.  They also don't have complimentary parking. Nevertheless, I would return.We stayed here during a trip to see the Tigers play the Royals.  I haven't spent much time (if any) in Detroit so I was pleasantly surprised to find the city very welcoming.  Like any city it had its share of ""stuff"" but overall clean.   The center has many things so you don't really have to leave much if you are just there for a quick weekend.  We left to go to our events (baseball game, murder mystery dinner, and escape from the room with a zombie.  However, other than that, we stayed in.  The hotel bar/restaurant Volt was surprisingly good.  Staff at the hotel were very nice.  No complaints at all about the room - the view was phenomenal.  We had a wall to wall view of the river and Windsor.  We had two rooms that were ""suite-ish"" (called executive suites).  Definitely if I ever go back to Detroit, I would stay there... unless I stayed in a casino (which I didn't know that had or might have stayed there! :)This is going to have to be another good/bad rating because there is a lot.Good:  Great location, walking to distance to wherever you need to go or you can jump on the train.Good/Bad:  This hotel is huge, overwhelmingly huge. It is easy to get lost in this hotel.Bad:  Most of the restaurants close early.  The do cater to the Mon-Fri guests.  Good:  When they are open, there is a huge assortment of places to eat.Great:  The fitness center.  It is up to date and has great views.  Even better was the staff.  The women who runs the gym was so sweet and kind.  She even gave me some fruit to take back to my room with me.  She went out of her way to make sure that she was able to meet my whole family.Great:  The concierge lounge.  The food was good, always well stocked and the staff members were friendly.  We had extra hockey tickets and they helped us try to sell them. We were in a basic room, the room was nice sized and clean.  the only negative I can give is where we were, the blue lights from the top of the GM building flashed all night long.  We tried to close the curtains, but you could still see the lights.Like:  We loved being able to see Canada out the window.Now, the huge negative... the bar.  We went down to have a few drinks not realizing how expensive the drinks were. There were four of us there, 6 beers and 2 martinis later, the bill was just under $100.00.  We were shocked.  I don't mind paying for a drink, but the prices were crazy!I am familiar with the Ren Cen since I'm from the area and have attended events here.  I had seen the rooms at the Ren Cen Marriott many times but not stayed here.This winter, I booked a last minute weekend stay.  It was intended more as a surprise weekend ""getaway"" for the person I was dating.  It was a busy winter with work and a lousy winter with bad weather so we needed a break.I was able to get a room at a good rate (less than the $200/night I expected).  We had a beautiful river view (and view of Canada across the river at night).  The room was clean and spacious and modern looking with a cozy bed (great warm comforter and nice pillows).  The bathroom was a bit basic (if this was Chicago or something maybe a jacuzzi would have been nice) but without any flaws.  The room was very clean too.Service was excellent from reservation to check in and during the stay.  We didn't do much except relax (had a dress up night at Andiamo for dinner and just hanging out at Volt lounge and then to nearby Greektown more casually the next day) but the fitness center was very nice.  I can understand some of the criticisms of reviewers.  The Ren Cen is confusing.   Where is the main level?  Where are the elevators?  Where is the food court?  Where do I park and get in or out?  Oh the shopping is here?  Why is it so quiet and empty on the weekend (well it is the middle of winter)?I don't know if I would spend this much on a romantic weekend again though.  It doesn't really change problems in a relationship but at least in the end we had a great weekend to remember.  I do think save this and keep it in mind for an anniversary or a wedding if you are from the area.  The service is good for that.The management here sucks.  They wouldn't work with our schedule to extend our stay.  They were the most inflexible hotel managers I have ever seen.  I'm Platinum Premiere and stay at a lot of Marriotts.  We a Flight Crew members and have a late flight out and needed a little later checkout.Really cool hotel and very convenient because it has almost everything you need located inside, only thing is that it gets a little confusing trying to get to some of the places inside but a little extra walking never hurt anybody, the bar is really cool tooThis is the second year in a row that I stayed at this hotel while attending Movement Festival. Besides the horrendous line to check-in, there isn't much to complain about. The hotel was very considerate of the events in town and supplied all guests with a box of Red Bull and ear plugs since the event went from noon to midnight and could be heard from the hotel. The rooms are always clean and sterile. I shared the room with my boyfriend so naturally, when we saw only one bath towel, I called the front desk to have more delivered. They were never delivered, however, in the morning, when the maid came to check on us, she was extremely concerned that we didn't have enough towels and immediately went and got us some. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and polite. The hotel itself is very accommodating. There is a CVS Pharmacy, gift shop, liquor store, gym, Starbucks, bar, and several restaurants to choose from. The hotel is walking distance to the River Walk and also to Hart Plaza. The wifi in the rooms cost per day, but if you go to the lobby, the wifi is free. There are also kiosks where you can print out your boarding pass if you are heading to the airport.The Concierge Lounge puts this Marriott over the top! Yes, I had excellent sevice on check in and the room had a great river view. But, the 1 huge differentiator was the Concierge Lounge.I checked in and ran about 4 miles as I was tired and stiff from traveling. After getting back, I washed my running clothes in the sink so as to not have stinky stuff in my suitcase. Only problem was there was no place to dry it. I decided to work in the Lounge and the very wonderful woman asked if there was anything she could do for me. To which I responded, yes, please let me use a dryer. I explained the scenario and she said, ""go get the running clothes and I'll go take care of this using Housekeeping's systems"".  She did and she brought out ice cream with hot fudge and fresh strawberries. OMG! what a delectable treat.Breakfast in the lounge this next day way also very, very good.This isn't the newest or swankiest place I've stayed. Not even the top Marriott. But, the staff make this a 5 star experience.We've staked here several times and the beds are so comfy and they have nice sheets. Room service was a bit slow but the food was very good. For some reason they gave us a handicap room and the layout it a bit weird and the room is noisy. You can hear everything going on in the hallway. This room is located by the elevator so you can imaging the noise! The valet employees are super rude and very unprofessional. When they took our car they rushed us out and I forgot something.(medication) my husband called to get them to bring the car so we could retrieve it and they were mad and actually said ""what the fu#% for ""when another employee said they have to re park the car!  They also pealed out of the parking lot with the car in front of ours! Not impressed at all!!!! I give the valet staff a 1 star!!!!Got to my room and only had one pillow per bed, called to the front desk and asked for some pillows and was told that they did not have any and that they had to locate some. I'm sorry I didn't know pillows were lost children, should we put pictures of pillows on milk cartons? Oh also I had to watch a guy get tased  in the hallway. Boo this place. And room service isn't 24 hours.Weird round hallways with squiggly carpet makes getting ice an adventure. Room service Pizza was delicious. Almost 25.00 a night in tax.  13.00 a night for Internet  yikes.  Glass round floors looking down on other floors.  Look for high rooms bc you can totally see into the office buildings and see what they are eating for a snack. Weird.  Pillows rock once your eyes refocus from vertigo.   Staff is a mixed bag either they avoid eye contact and make comments about how happy they are to leave shift... Or they are the nicest people I ever met!  It's a crap shootSo there I was hooking up for a nooner with......kidding.  I came here for a few meeting events over the years.  Don't know about the rooms, so can't comment on those.The event rooms are...dated.  They're seriously in need of a good scrub and refresh...but, then again, I guess that makes it ""quintessential Detroit"" then, on some level. :)Food service...typical, meh, ""I'm at an event in a hotel"" food.The serious pain here is with LOCATING the damned room you're supposed to be in.  Now, I get that I'm ""a guy"", and I'm well aware that I am navigationally challenged...but when I follow the arrows, signs, and directions explicitly...and STILL wind up TWO FLOORS AWAY from where I'm supposed to be...that's a problem.  That alone was annoying enough that I almost walked out of the hotel without even attending the last event.Parking is easy, valet is available, and lots of cool stuff within walking distance (we washed away the hotel food with the beer selection at the nearby Jacoby's), so get out and explore a bit.We called the week before our stay to check concierge room hours. The person verified the concierges room was now open 7 days ago, and Friday and Saturday evening is 5:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m. In addition, the concierge will be open for breakfast 7 days a week. We just checked out and the concierge room is not open in the evenings 7 days a week. In addition, the room isn't open in the morning at the time listed. The parking has a text feature to request your car from valet. The text response reads, ""Your request requires payment. Please see a valet attendant."" So, I went to the front desk to be sure there were no issues with my card. The young lady at the front desk says, ""You have to go to valet, they're separate from the hotel."" I said, ""I know parking is managed by Central Parking. The text said their is an issue with payment (while showing her the text I received). I'm paying Marriott for the parking, not Central."" She checked the room and valet parking was charged to the room and no issues with the card. She continued to repeat, ""Valet is separate from the hotel."" I then asked, ""Would you mind calling downstairs to valet to let them know there are no issues?"" She said, ""You have to go to valet."" I said, ""I know, but there's obviously a problem."" I gave up at the front desk and went to valet. Valet was showing no payment, yet we were charged in our room for valet. The lady at valet fixed the issue.This hotel has a lot of work to catch up to the standards of the Marriott brand.This hotel is slightly smaller than the Bat Cave. We found the rooms to be clean and tasteful. Most of the views are spectacular. Not only are a ton of famous Detroit landmarks within walking distance, the hotel staff is knowledgeable about local public transportation and overall seem to be a very friendly lot. We were a bit confused as to where to park. The Beaubien garage is fairly reasonable. I can't speak for the food; I don't think I've ever eaten at a hotel, come to think of it. The drinks are pricy but they don't skimp on the portions. It would seem that other reviewer's concerns about the modernity of the rooms has been addressed, by the way. Everything seems brand new and spotless, but again, it's all about the staff and the people here are very nice.I made a reservation in February for my anniversary thinking that everything was all set I called today to confirm my reservation only to find out that our reservation was cancelled apparently in march by a email that was not the email used to make the resrvation.  After being on the phone with multiple represenatives I found out that the hotel is over booked by 120 rooms and their is nothing left open.   Odd that my reservation was ""cancelled"" and they are over booked all at the same time.  Now I am left hanging with only a couple days before my anniversary trying to scramble to find a place.Pros:+ great views of city and riverfront + convenient location in heart of downtown+ easy access to People Mover Public transit+ plenty of on site options for dining+ meeting rooms are variety of sizes and great with technology+ beautiful fitness facility overlooking river cons:- very confusing to navigate. Once you're on floor three or higher, you're set though- shops and restaurants seem to be targeted more at employees of GM in the complex (only open Monday- Friday business hours)- rooms on floors 40 below are not renovated and are quite dated (as of May 2014)- you have to pay for Internet ($13-16 per day) and the basic package isn't very fastAs a newcomer to Detroit from Boston, I've not stayed at the Detroit Marriott at the Ren Cen, but am disappointed in the utter lack of response from their Sales Office regarding a block of rooms for an upcoming event. Not only did I submit a form online via their website nearly two weeks ago [read: using THEIR intake process!], but placed a call and left a voicemail, to no avail. Absolutely no response. As someone who has planned many personal and professional events, I am shocked by this Marriott's inability to respond to potential customers' needs in a punctual, professional manner, which doesn't bode well for a good stay to say the least. I'll be sure to recommend other establishments, of which there are many with much higher standards, to friends and colleagues planning events, or to friends visiting from out of town.This hotel is housed in the GM headquarters building in downtown Detroit. It is a total of 70 floors. My room was on the 18th floor. You can valet at the hotel or self park in the deck right across the street (which is the same place where the valet takes your car but charges you more money). Within this huge GM building, there are various retailers, a CVS, a food court, a full movie theatre, and a few restaurants. You can also catch the people mover train (which I didn't do). There are probably more things in it that i dont know about  The hotel sits right on the Detroit River so it is easy access to the Detroit Riverwalk. You can see across the river to Windsor, Canada and the hotel sits right next to the tunnel to go across the border. There were about 2-3 weddings going on the weekend I was there and it didn't seem like the hotel missed a beat, nobody was going crazy behind the counter. I'm not sure if this is the only hotel (other than casino hotels) that is decent to stay at, but I would probably lodge here again. It's safe.","BEDBUGS.  We stayed there June 12 to 19.  Our first night revealed bedbugs in one of the beds.  We tried to find another place to stay, but couldn't.  Marriott gave us one nights free stay and $50 in restaurant food.  Oh, and they ran all of our clothes and suitcases through their industrial dryer so we wouldn't infect another room.  Ruined my handbag.  Nightmare scenario.  The only reason I didn't give them  one star is because the employees at this hotel are super, duper nice.  I wish them well, but never, ever, ever will I ever stay at this hotel again.Ok rooms with a view if you're lucky. Terrible service. Let's face it; the average person in Detroit is lazier than the average person in Dallas, LA, Chicago, DC, Atlanta, San Fran or other places. We had a problem with the doorman; we had a problem with valet; we had a problem with the desk clerk (chose people out of line ahead of us, for not apparent reason other than color) and we had terrible experience as the bar downstairs. Can this really be harder to get a beer than it is in the Gingerman in Manhattan?  I can get to the bar, but no service. Also, no bar in the room. Not even water. This place is kind of like a glorified La Quinta.Hotel Stay for July 11th and 12th, 2014. First off I would like to focus on a couple of areas that has triggered the Detroit Marriott at Renaissance Center to be an awesome establishment. Those areas are the views, location and guest services. From the time I walked in my mouth dropped. This hotel was massive with beauty. Not only were the river views breathtaking but the architectural designs gave phenomenal elements. Location location location, what else can I say. Well positioned in the heart of downtown Detroit. This Marriott property allows you to leave your car and venture out.  As many mentioned before it is really easy to get around on foot and is safe to a degree but every big city has safety precautions. The valet parking was hectic because there was a lot going on, but well organized with a kiosk and a visual on your car process. I wish they had a parking garage near that gave in and out privileges for a flat fee because this could eliminate the valet congestion and help those who just like having their car keys.  Yes the hotel is massive but if you are paying attention its easy to explore. Just remember,  from the first floor lobby just take elevator to 3rd floor and from there you will have the elevators to access your room floor. The building is a full circle so its hard to get lost. As other reviews mentioned, within this Marriott there are many eating options that will fit your budget also shops.  Now for the good ole nightlife. I was there during the weekend and I all have to say is wow. Crossing over to Beaubien Street to the strip and yes walking, was easy and amazing. From casinos to dive bars, this was nightlife heaven. So if you are traveling solo and looking for an adventure this hotel should be your one stop shop. Even if you are looking to tour the city by car, the 75 freeway is right at your doorstep. Tylisa Jones was my first point of contact. She was amazing with stellar professional qualities. From there the staff, concierge, and security was a delight and well informed on their surroundings. This property will be my Detroit go to.The worst hotel experience I've ever had. It took an hour to park anywhere near the hotel. When I attempted to check in at 3:00, after waiting in line for almost an hour, I was told that the hotel had been overbooked and they did not have a room available. The room had been reserved for over 2 months. They offered to put us in a different hotel 30 minutes away in another town. There was never an apology, never a word from a manager, despite requesting several times both in person and on the phone that I be able to speak to someone. For $189 a night one would think you could at least rely on decent customer service, but that was not the case here. It was a horrible experience from beginning to end.We stayed at this hotel prior to the Detroit Free Press Marathon. The staff was friendly and the recently remodeled room was clean and appealing. My only complaint is that the hotel's Starbucks closes at 12 on Saturdays.  The Ren Cen makes staying here a unique Detroit experience.I really wasn't thrilled by the Marriott at the Ren Center.First, it's obvious the property is older and the rooms have not been updated.  The rugs and furnishings were definitely older than other Marriotts that I've stayed at.There was an obvious stain on the sheets in the CENTER of the bed when we pulled them back.... why would you make the bed and hope no one saw that?  They responded quickly to our call, though, and remade the bed.The bathroom was tight --hard to open the door and get access to the tub.  They also only supplied 2 towels for the 2 people in the room, so we had to call for extras (personally, I use 2 just myself because of my long hair!).Our view was very nice of the Detroit River looking out to Canada, however.My biggest concern with the Marriott is that my grandmother requested a handicapped room.  They gave her a non-accessible room at first and then moved her down to one that she could use.  When she was seated after a shower on the handicap seat in the bathroom, it COLLAPSED because there were screws loose.  My grandfather couldn't lift her up, and so they had to call EMS.  It turned out that one of the loose screws cut her leg and they had to do wound care.  Yes, the Marriott apologized and took pictures/offered them a free breakfast, but they should have offered to remove the first night's fee from her bill.  (Which they did when I went downstairs to speak with a manager.)Again, I feel like the accident was a result of this being a older property and there not being regular upkeep.  Not sure if I'd stay here again.It SHOULD be noted that the lobby bar serves food until 1am, though, and that was awesome.  I was pretty pleased with their drink options and the plentiful seating.Hotel is significantly understaffed.  They advertise (even in the elevator) that they can accommodate up to 2200 but at our convention, it was clear they weren't able to do so.  Our convention was just starting, only 40% of the attendees had arrived, and the hotel was already ill prepared.Took 25 minutes to check in.  Not enough staff at checkin.  Hotel is very confusing to navigate.  It would help if they provided details at checkin of all thats available in the hotel AND added better signage around the hotel to direct guests.But where they really fail is housekeeping.1) Housekeeping deserves 0 stars.  My first thought was that they were lazy but they, too, are probably understaffed and being pushed beyond what's possible.  With that said, I'd quit before I allowed my work ethic to be compromised to this degree.  The lack of cleaning is unacceptable.We checked into a room that had:- urine on the toilet- hair all over the bathroom floor- food and drink spills remained on the office desk - phones were super dirty - dust caked on...all from previous guest.Called housekeeping.  They came and cleaned half of the items - toilet and food.  Left hair.  Called again.  Brought towels.  Didn't clean the hair.  Hmmm??  Called 3rd time.  Someone finally came and swept floor as we watched.2) Next day - arrived back to room and noticed that bed had been made but sheets hadn't been changed.  There was a suspicious yellow stain on sheet night before.  Stain still there.  Obviously sheets weren't cleaned.  Too late to complain.3) Day 2 - returned to room.  Trash remained on floor and in receptacles.  Beds were half made - pillows weren't in right place.  Sheet was bunched under comforter.  Bed skirt was caught in comforter.   Sheets were not changed and yellow stain remained.Called housekeeping.  Always very friendly but the horrible level of service and lack of attention to detail was unreal.Other members of our party also complained of dirty rooms.  Some arrived to trash in their room, upon checkin!  Hotel is nice, in theory.   The staff again is always pleasant but the hotel needs attention to detail and not just pleasantries.I recently stayed here on business. The staff were great which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. The room service breakfast was terrible. I had a bagel which was so rubbery. The fruit cup was decent. I realized I forgot a toiletry item and needed an OTC medicine. I went to the CVS in the hotel which was closed by the time I got there. So I went to the gift shop. I expected to pay a premium as it is a hotel gift shop and not somewhere you'd normally buy shampoo. The prices were beyond outrageous. I think they're taking advantage of the fact people are there on business and have expense accounts and also that people may be leery of wandering around Detroit. I also think that WI Fi wasn't free is also unreasonable. Again, taking advantage of expense accounts.Had a nice time at the Marriott Detroit, room was clean, beautiful view, people mover right there although on a beautiful day great to walk to comerica park! Cocktails and appetizers at the hotel Volt lounge after the game...perfect!I thought the Renaissance Center Marriott was super nice.  Goods and bads:Goods: Right on the People Mover line, on the river and in the Ren Cen.  Wow.Rooms were nice and spacious.  Nice decor.  Updated.  Comfy beds.Nice staff.  People were super friendly - being from Detroit I know that the friendly thing is a challenge - so this was a nice surprise.Relatively cheap.  You can stay at the casino for more money, but why?  This place is nice.Bads: Super confusing to get around.  We wandered in circles looking for the People Mover.  The signage makes it worse.Elevators can be very busy.  The good news is they are seperate for lower and upper floors to eliminate really lengthy lines.  But put your bag down so your shoulder doesn't seperate while you wait.Bar is super expensive.  I understand that is the norm in the hotel bar scene, but the pricing is really high.When they get busy, the valet gets crazy unorganized.  And they charge for the high floors because of the ""view"".  Get over it.Overall I loved it.  Maybe it is cause it was my bday and it was a surprise, but I thought it was a nice one.Meh....got a ""cheap"" rate on a package for a Spacing Trip....Plus: right on the People Mover which gets you where you need to go for 75 cents- the comfiest bed EVER- minus -- time wasted trying to resolve the totally unintuitive layout and multiple levels with escalators hidden in dark corners. I'd air bnb it next time. This place feels like the borg: just getting outside is a major undertaking. And wi-fi for $15/day, have we also rocketed back to 2003?Great view, ideal location, very nice room, but absolutely the worst conference food ever. In addition they over booked our groups room and it took over two hours to get the mess straighten out.  Seriously, the food was awful, bland and not served at correct temperatures. This was the general consensus of many attendees in our group. Take that into consideration with your budget.Although it is a nice hotel, guest services is not accommodating and downright unhelpful to their guests. I had the misfortune of visiting on a busy weekend, and I was met with a rude staff and absurd ""procedures"" that made no sense to me. I do not recommend this hotel.Not quite sure about the hotel rooms because I live close to the ren cen, but the bar at the Marriott is amazing. The hotel is huge and the deck outside of the bar is so relaxing. On a hot day it is nice to just have a double vodka while over looking the riverwalk and Canada. Bartenders are nice but sometimes people have events and throw weddings on the huge balcony which can be extremely crowded.Not sure what so many people are complaining about. The service here is really casual, but still extremely helpful. The views are even better. Was here with a friend on the 29th floor, and we had a view of the waterfront, the Ambassador, and the US-Canada tunnel. Stunning stuff. The tv checks you out, and the amenities are pretty decent. They also host a numerous amount of events, including the car show this weekend, which coincided with the Detroit Marathon, which I did with my friend. The beds are a little too soft, and the elevators whoosh on by, sometimes leaving you woozy in the head, but hey, there are 70 floors; they kind of need to move quickly. Here's what I learned from my stay here and in the Detroit area: people are just really nice, whether or not they work for the Marriott (but people who work in the Marriott are particularly kind).We came down for the night to have a nice dinner then attend a concert. We chose the Marriot for the view and because of it's reputation. We were not impressed. The view of the river was great, but the quality of the room was not worth the $275 that we paid.  The check in process took 2 1/2 hours which caused us to miss dinner as we had to go straight to our concert. Management was very rude and kept blaming the long wait time on guests. They wanted guests to split up and wait on the patio or in the lounge while the other checks in. It was highly disappointing!The view facing the river can't be beat. They are finally remodeling some of the rooms. It is much better but they should have gotten better beds. They seem just as old and sway as always.I loved this hotel! Stayed here on my wedding night and it was both private and had a good sized king bed. Our room overlooked the Detroit river and out into Windsor. I am a Quicken Loans team member so I was able to get a discounted rate which might explain why I loved he hotel so much. Cheaper rates always skew emotions. They were able to accommodate my wife and her down allergy which made the world to us. We don't feel like there was anything to shoot down about Tue hotel. Valet was quick and luggage was speedy. Check in and check out were painless as well as the front desk was personable. We will definitely stay here again! I also love the RenCen and enjoy being in downtown Detroit as it is. I have had the food before so I know it's good and would probably order room service next time. Overall a great night and great room.Drunk high school kids running through the hallways, puking in elevators and generally being annoying. No security or control. This hotel is not for business travelers.If I could give the hotel zero stars, that's what this hotel would receive. I'm so disappointed in this hotel that carries the Marriott name. From the time I checked in , the service has been horrible. I felt like they were very unprepared to host our convention.  I booked my room in March for an August convention. I should have had 2 double beds in the room, but there was only 1 king size. I should have been told that at check-in but instead I got that surprise when I opened the door. When I asked about switching rooms I was told none would be available until Saturday.  However, on Friday when I asked again suddenly they already had a room available (mind you, I had already called corporate the night before) but I felt like had I not came to the front desk, I would have never known about it. The ""managers"" were rude. When I inquired about getting a refrigerator in the room I was told they would send one right up. After an hour, I called back to check on the status &amp; explained that there was medicine that needed to be refrigerated &amp; was told by the ""manager"" Cory, ""well you should not have bought that!"" I was appalled at this response.  If I were speaking to her rudely or acting in any way irate or irrational,  I would be able to understand her defensive &amp; extremely rude behavior,  but since I never once raised my voice &amp; was never rude to her, I could not understand her treatment to a customer that was spending $500 to stay in this hotel. The saga continued since the whole weekend went by and the room was never cleaned, the trash cans were never emptied, clean towels that were requested were never brought. As I met with other people that were attending the convention I heard the same complaints over &amp; over. I don't understand how someone can request toilet paper, towels, blankets, pillows, etc &amp; never receive 1 requested item. This review doesn't reflect the entire staff because there were some courteous workers in the hotel but the rude ones I encountered unfortunately soured my experience for the entire hotel. On this day as I am preparing to check out, my mind is saying I will never spend my money at another Marriott hotel &amp; I will pass my complaints on to the corporate office. Good customer service goes a long way &amp; I am sad to say that this hotel is lacking in that big time. I have not even written about everything that has happened here this weekend.  For any employee that reads this review, I know you have a customer service acronym that you are supposed to use called ""l-e-a-r-n"". Please note that it needs to be put in practice, especially at times when you feel overwhelmed with your customers.","We stayed for the car show January 17th. When I made the reservation I was told check in was 3pm, which was when we arrived. The girl at the desk told me I was wrong and that check in was 4pm, but she would see if we could get early check in and someone would call us by 4. I wonder if they told the front desk to lie about check in time? I later found out from another employee that she was lying and check in was 3. By 5:30 pm still no call and we FINALLY got a room after I stood in line to talk to the desk again. We drove for 5 hours and had to stand around in the lobby all that time waiting. The lobby was filled with other people waiting so we could not even sit down while waiting. The next morning valet took an hour to bring my car. We lost 3 hours of time at the car show because we could not check into our room. Worst experience ever, I will never stay there again even though I will be returning to Detroit every year. I also emailed them and got no response.Hi Ami I spoke to someone from the hotel finally and they said check in is 3 lol.. Pretty weird to lie on here but ok.For the price, I think this place is slightly overrated.  There are a few restaurants onsite but as soon as you get offsite, you better make sure your wallet is in your front pocket.  The area downtown in Detroit is pretty sketchy.  The building is well designed however you can tell the hotel only upgraded certain features because the decor is not modern in all areas.  The gym (health club) was nice, I'm sorry that I didn't use it every night I stayed there, I only had the opportunity to use it once.  Would I stay there again?  Maybe but if you aren't meeting downtown or need to be downtown for your vist, I would recommend that you stay elsewhere.  There isn't much to see around this area.  At night, there is no nightlife and it reminds me of a cavernous maze at night.  During the day there are tons of people since there are lots of offices including GM.Oh yeah, and the Wifi sucks here.WOW!  The view from our room here in early January was breathtaking!  A snowstorm came through overnight that was incredible from our vantage point...an all around wonderful time! :-)Great service. I cannot speak enough about how well the staff here treated me. They were extremely accommodating and helpful for the proposal of my now fiance. I had booked a room, utilizing the romantic views overlooking Detroit city, the river and Canada as my backdrop. I had checked into the room earlier in the day to sex it up with rose petals, (electric) candles, champagne and various photos of us throughout our lengthy relationship. I returned downstairs to the front desk with an odd request. I returned them my room key and asked if they could check me in again later that evening as if I have never been there before. The key to surprising my lover was placed in the acting abilities of the front desk staff. To my delight, the plan was executed beautifully. That night, I was greeted at the front desk and asked if I have ever been to the Detroit Marriot before, which I slyly replied with a ""no."" They went through all the motions of checking in, asking for my credit card and ID. My fiance didn't suspect a thing. Upon arrival to our romanticified room, she was definitely surprised by the gorgeous views and the lovely decorations. However, her face was completely melted when I got down on one knee and pulled a sparkling ring out of my pocket....Later when I returned to the lobby to thank them for their assistance, I learned they had placed post-it notes on every computer to keep an eye out for my return. The staff here definitely went the extra mile for me to pull off my proposal that night. I would not hesitate to stay here again!Oh yeah, and she did yes.I've stayed in many Marriott's around the world &amp; this was not as impressive for the price that we are paying. The rooms are small and outdated in furniture &amp; designs. We have a great view of the river &amp; west part of the City. The hotel is connected to the GM buildings &amp; it's a maze going from one level to the next trying to get to places within the building. It's literally right next to Hart Plaza for those attending Movement Music Festival which makes it awesome to get to.Had to stay here on business and thought it was fine.  The check in service was great.  Their beds were comfy too.I will also give them kudos for decent catering.  Not only was the food edible but also tasty.  Had no problems with service during my stay.I've stayed at this hotel over a dozen times for about a decade. It was pretty much my preferred hotel in Detroit. I stopped staying here after a couple of bad experiences and have stopped going to Marriott hotels altogether.Prior to these bad experiences, I thought this hotel was OK (probably three stars out of five). The rooms were pretty good, the beds comfortable, and the bar and restaurant are alright, though not spectacular. The main appeal was the views of the Detroit River, Canada, and the city of Detroit, depending on what side of the hotel you're on. But I did have some gripes about the place. 1) Parking is kind of a pain because you have to park in the garage to the east, then walk through the Renaissance complex to get to the hotel. 2) It's a bubble, i.e., if you stay in the hotel and don't venture very far from there, you won't get to experience many of the terrific things about the greater downtown and midtown areas, much less the rest of the city. But then I had a couple of bad experiences. The first bad experience occurred during a longish stay. I actually reserved and paid for two rooms: one for me and another for a colleague. The front desk screwed up my Marriott Rewards number, so the points didn't register on my account. So instead of accumulating points for a four-night stay for two rooms, I got no points. After I tried to rectify the situation by faxing my receipt and claim to Marriott, then calling a couple of times to follow up, I got no response then gave up in frustration.. The second bad experience was way worse. I checked in and the room appeared to be ready, because the bed was made. But when I checked the bathroom, the toilet hadn't been flushed and there was hair all over the bathtub--and who knows what else. When I asked for a new room, I was told that the hotel was fully booked. They weren't able to send housekeeping quickly because I checked in so late. The front desk person very helpfully encouraged me to just flush the toilet. Unfortunately, I had to sleep in that room that night. The next day, I switched to another hotel: the Inn on Ferry Street, which is now hands down my favorite place to stay in Detroit, and probably my favorite in the whole darn U.S. It's just a delightful bed and breakfast consisting of old Victorian mansions. When rooms aren't available there, I stay at the Westin Book Cadillac, which is also very good. So I guess I should be grateful for my horrible experience at the Marriott because it led me to explore other, better hotels in Detroit and now I'm much happier for it. I haven't stayed in a Marriott since, because 1) in Detroit, I like the Inn or the Westin better and 2) in other cities, I can usually stay at another Westin or other SPG hotel. It doesn't make any sense for me to accumulate Marriott Rewards points anymore. That was two years ago. Farewell, Marriott.My favorite Marriott ever! This hotel rocks. I've been coming to Detroit all of my life because of family but never stayed in hotels until recently.The staff was awesome. There were several conferences going on as well as regular guests and their professionalism never wavered. Even if there were a problem, like a mix up with my car in valet or not satisfied with the meal at the restaurant, I was quickly compensated and taken care of.I so love the GM cars on display in the lower level and our view of Canada was fabulous. Even though I was visiting for a funeral, the ease and comfort of this hotel made my visit easier.We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance Center for 4 nights, leaving on a Sunday morning.We stayed on the 60th floor facing the river and the view was tremendous.  My wife said during check-in the staff took extra time to find us a room with a nice view.  We were paying $125 per night (rate tied to wedding reception package).Rooms were clean and nicely furnished, with room to move around.My son (the groom) had a very nice ""junior"" suite for Saturday night after the wedding reception.  It was very spacious, had great views and lots of sitting area.The only place we ate in the hotel was the 42 Degrees Restaurant (breakfast only). They offered a buffet with the usual fruits, cereals, etc., and hot hash browns, French toast, sausage, etc.  They also had excellent chefs cooking omelets / eggs to order, and it didn't take too long.  The staff was friendly but it can be a bit slow when they are busy, but no too bad.We used the Marriott to host / cater the wedding reception.  They did a very good job, providing snappy bar service and plenty of wait staff.  The food was quite good.  There were cheeses and crackers, meatballs, etc. early, followed by breads and salad.  The main entree was a baked chicken with a delicious sauce, and veggies, complimented by a rice side that was great.  They also provided the wedding cake, which was nicely sized for the wedding party (110) and tasted great.All-in-all, I give high marks for the wedding reception.Down sides to this location are:- wifi costs $12.95 per day for use in the guest rooms, but was pretty speedy at least.- the the entrance you drive to valet or drop off is difficult to get to...you have to go around the north side of the building (which is also GM headquarters!) then circle back toward the river and back south.  Quite confusing the first time you do it.  Use this address in GPS to get to the hotel entrance:400 Renaissance Dr NDetroit Michigan 48243United StatesValet staff seemed a bit disorganized at times, and the price for parking is high - $20/day to park yourself, or $25/day for valet.- elevators were another problem.  You have to use your room card to go to guest floors, which is fine, but the card readers often did not work.  During our 4 days there we had several occasions where a group of people got stuck riding up and down the elevators because the card readers did not allow selection of the proper floors.  I saw some elderly folks we tried to help having a very difficult time.  This needs to be seriously looked at.- hotel operators - we never had a problem when in the hotel, but several times we were away from the hotel and called the main number and it just rang rang rang - for 10 minutes straight once.  I had to call numerous times to finally get someone to answer.  This was a problem because speaking to a person was the only way to get connected, since there was no auto-attendant to allow self direction of the call.I would stay at this property again.Just a so-so Marriott but very convenient if you are needing to be close to GM-Land. The rooms are a little dated, supposedly they are remodeling it next year- they need to. The gym is decent but no hot tub or pool. The heating system is old and loud. Room service was pretty good though.Here goes: At check-in we found out they did not have a refrigerator or a microwave available for us. As a matter of fact, they did not have microwaves at all. We get to our room and there was no chair (or bench). After they brought the chair we realized the safe had been left locked by the previous guest and had to call guest services back. They sent up security then an engineer. They left our room at approximately 4:30 am. When I got ready to leave to attend my meetings later that day the safe would not lock. Of course, I had to call guest services again. I waited over an hour and a half for security then engineering to come up. They finally showed up and I put my things in the safe only to return later that night to find I could open the safe to retrieve my belongings. Again (3rd) time waiting for security! Needless to say, we could not use the safe our entire stay. Over the course of our 7 night stay, the housekeeping staff half cleaned our room every day. They left dirty dishes, trash and did not wipe down anything, did not change the linen, vacuum or leave clean towels on several days. My comforter was not even in the duvet. The duvet was just laying on top of it! We were advised by the housekeepers that they were out of towels. Day 3 after returning to our room at 10 pm from all day meetings the room was not cleaned at all! I did call guest services and they sent a young lady up to service the room. This was inconvenient due to us being tired and needing to rest! When the Concierge is rude to two elderly ladies needing help, you know you have a problem. Guest Services employees were hard to reach and when you did reach them they were rude. Even hanging up the phone on me. I patronized Volt on several evenings. The wait was unacceptable and my order was incorrect each time which made me have to wait even longer. To make matters worse they were also rude. I also patronized the seafood restaurant and the service was unacceptable there as well.  Our stay was a total of 7 nights and it was disappointing to say the least. Several of our conference attendees had similar unsatisfactory experiences during their stay as well. Including being locked out of the room each time they would leave the hotel. Waiting over an hour and a half to get in the room because they were advised that someone was coming up when no one was ever dispatched to the room. The noise was high due to remodel and thin windows (I guess). I was attending a very large convention and it seemed that Marriott Renaissance Center was not  equipped or prepared for a convention such as ours. I could go on and on about this experience  however I will end my review here by saying, I am definitely writing a letter to Marriott's Corporate Offices!  2 stars, 1 for convenience and 1 for the remodeled room with a view (my stay was in August).I can only presume that this hotel suffers from being in a city that's still in the throes of a major economic collapse. The hotel, itself is still pretty decent - meets most of the standards you expect from a Marriott. Being in one of the tallest buildings in the city, the views from the upper rooms were spectacular. That said, given how much of a ghost-town downtown Detroit has become, there wasn't much to do in or near the hotel. Even though it sits in a commerce center, everything closes extraordinarily early.One MAJOR WARNING: if you're expecting to do business elsewhere in Detroit and think that you can get away with not having a car, you would be sorely mistaken. When we went to catch a cab, Sunday afternoon, to catch our transportation, it quite literally took over 25 minutes for them to find a cab for us. Every other Marriott I've stayed at in the US and Europe, there's always at least a couple cabs waiting to pick up passengers. Not only were there no such cabs waiting nearby, the hotel didn't have any kind of immediate-dispatch arrangements made with any of the Detroit cab companies. Nor do they offer shuttle service to make up for this lack. Eventually, the bell-stand guy was able to call an off-duty buddy of his to do an off-meter run. That guy was very solicitous, but resorting to a gypsy cab to transit through an economically destroyed area is an exercise in faith that I was very uncomfortable making. Obviously, we made it home and *just barely* made it to our transport (really glad I'd padded our travel schedule to account for these kinds of snafus)I'll be writing a letter of disappointment to Marriott Corporate when I have time to compose something civil.Nice place, but walking to your room can take a bit.I had to stay a bit to pickup my family as they came down for their luggage.  No hassles from the valets or hotel staff even though it was about 1/2 hr.When I saw some of the reviews I almost didn't go to this hotel but I'm glad I did. I stayed at this hotel last weekend and was impressed. The front desk staff was very friendly, courteous and accommodating. The room was clean and looked just like the photos. The view from our room on the 37th floor was amazing, overlooking the river showing the Ceaser's casino in Windsor. The bed was comfy. The hotel is close to Hart Plaza, Greek town, restaurants and other downtown sites so we walked everywhere. The only downer was that the walls were thin. I could hear people's conversations in the hallways. Also valet parking was a little expensive at $25 a day but most downtown hotels do have expensive parking so that was no surprise. This hotel has all the bells and whistles like room service, a restaurant, rooms with a great view and good customer service. I would definitely go back. I think either the hotel has improved  over time or the other reviewers are just a bunch of debbie downers.We stayed at this Marriott last weekend for a wedding that was held at the Detroit Yacht Club on Belle Isle.  Several family members stayed at this location so we were able to check out multiple rooms.  The views from the higher rooms are really spectacular due to the floor to ceiling windows!  The hotel is clean and rooms well appointed.  Staff members were as helpful as you need them to be.  We weren't sure where to park when we arrived so we ended up using the valet parking service which was $25 per day.  There is a touchscreen valet kiosk near the front desk when you're ready to retrieve your car and want to bypass the desk.  This hotel is in walking/ driving distance to many of Detroit's downtown attractions.   Anyone staying at this location should take caution and be aware of Detroit's many potential ""challenges"".  On our way back from the wedding there was a shooting directly in front of our hotel which made getting back to our room a bit of a task...to put it mildly.  After ducking and running into the hotel, we headed straight to the Volt for cocktails and snacks.  The following day we all agreed that the black-out curtains over the gimongous windows happened to be the pinnacle of room features at this Detroit Marriott.The Bad &amp; Ugly:  Outrageous valet parking charge per day.  Even just parking yourself in their lot will put you back the cost of a decent lunch.  And what the heck conference was in town that weekend, with people dressed all in white laying around on the floor?  Huge, impersonal hotel.The Good:  UPGRADE!  I used hotel points to stay here for our anniversary... and when we checked in they directed us one of the elevators that takes you to the top floors.  Sweeeeeeet suite!  Floor to ceiling windows, view of the river, two, count 'em two bathrooms.  Followed by a knock at the door and complimentary chocolate covered strawberries to help us celebrate.Now, I travel a fair bit for work (and I love me some Marriott), but I've never ever gotten this nice of a perk.  Maybe it was all due to the wonderful woman who took my reservation, or maybe the place is just awesome.  I'm afraid to book there again though - how can our stay be topped?I found my stay at the DR-Marriott to be quite nice.First we were greeted by a very friendly valet and doorman.  Both smiled nicely and the doorman gave us directions for check-in, without being asked.  Just a lovely, ""Welcome to the Detroit Marriott -- please take the elevators to the third floor and exit to the left for check-in services"" -- I mean how wonderful!We arrived in the check in lobby and waited all of 15 seconds before a lovely smiling girl offered to assist us.  We walked up and she politely checked us in.  My boyfriend asked for a nice view and she obliged w/ no hesitation.  We took the elevator to the 67th floor where we had a river view.  Our room was clean and spacious -- the king size bed over-adorned in fluffy pillows.We went to the Volt bar before our wedding, which is the hotel bar located on the third floor.  I found the prices to be reasonable for a hotel bar ($9 for house wine).Our bed was super comfy.  The only downside was the towels -- they skimp on how many they give you.  I know hotels are trying the ""go green"" approach, but at the end of the day, all women use two towels and men at least one -- so please put three large towels in a room.Great stay though!Cheerful service and attention. I was pleasantly surprised. Nice double queen room, quiet and efficiently run. I had a bathroom light go out. Within 15 minutes of my calling, a maintenance man tapped on my door and changed it. Lots of levels you have to get used to when entering and exiting. Security quiet and comfortable. I think the staff is great. The hotel looks out on 'The Riverwalk' good for runs and enjoying the view. Bike rental around the corner.DO NOT USE THE VALET.They tell you to call down 10 minutes before you want to get your car.  I did.  But NO ONE ANSWERED.  Tried several times.  Took 10-15 minutes before I got ahold of anyone, and I ordered my car.  Then I got down to the curb, and waited forever for my car.  Never came.  I ended up having to jump in  cab to make my morning meeting, and I had to come all the way back to the hotel to pick up my car, before rushing out for a flight.I called the hotel and the valet company to get the charge removed.  The hotel said they couldn't do anything, and that I had to talk to the valet service, as it's a completely different company.  I called the valet company, and they've flat out refused, saying that I should have talked to the manager immediately... which would have made me miss either my meeting or my flight.Terrible service.  Avoid this hotel.I recently attended YoumaCon here at the rencen, and while the building was impressive, it's complexity detracted from the event. First off, the meeting space is on the lower lobby floors, 3-5 I believe. That's great and everything is connected by escalator. However, want to go to your hotel room? Our room was on the 48th floor, so no stairway, no how. This turned into an epic fail by about 10am friday for the rest of the weekend, as there was no way the 6 elevators could keep up with the massive demand.Kudos to the hotel, as a ""mystery fridge"" appeared in our room sometime Friday afternoon, we didn't ask for it, didn't pay for it, but boy did we use it.Tried the starbucks, but not the hotel's food, but who would with the ren cen attached.Rooms were clean, bathroom was smaaaaaaaaaaall. Otherwise ok.","['hotel', 'great', 'attention', 'paid', 'details', 'architecturally', 'hotel', 'magnificent', 'building', 'structure', 'design', 'certainly', 'shows', 'age', 'view', 'made', 'amazing',
