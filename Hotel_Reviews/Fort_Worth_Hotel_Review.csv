http://www.yelp.com/biz/hattie-may-inn-fort-worth,Hattie May Inn,5.0,$$,12,"This review is for cooking class at the Hattie May. (I live in Fort Worth and therefore have not had occasion to stay at the Inn.)Laura and Scott, the new owners of the Hattie May, are just the nicest people you'd ever care to meet. In addition to owning and operating the Inn, Laura is a holistic nutritionist and chef and offers small group cooking classes at the Inn. Tonight I attended the first of what I hope will be many classes with Laura. The focus of tonight's lesson was cruciferous vegetables; we started off with a handout to review the many veggies in the category and all of the important health benefits they provide. It was immediately clear that Laura really knows her stuff! I thought she gave us just the right amount of information to give context to the lesson without getting too bogged down in the science. Then we dove right in preparing three dishes: a bok choy and apple slaw, steamed broccoli salad, and an arugula mushroom saute with cauliflower ""rice."" I loved how hands on the class was. Laura gave us tips for better knife technique and even sharpened the knives we brought from home. We five students had plenty of opportunities to prepare the different ingredients, and the class moved quickly enough that we were never bored. And then of course we got to eat! All of the food was delicious, and nothing felt too intimidating to replicate at home. Not only did we get a chance to try some familiar ingredients in new ways, but we met some veggies that I wouldn't have even been able to identify before tonight (hello, daikon).I would recommend cooking classes at the Hattie May to anyone- of any level of expertise- who is interested in learning more about the power of eating natural, whole, unprocessed foods and how to prepare them in a way that's both appetizing and healing. I can't wait to go back for ""alternative grains"" in a couple weeks!I booked a rather long stay--4 nights--as an alternative to a downtown conference hotel and boy am I glad that I did! Hattie May offers an opportunity to relax in comfort while keeping a short and equidistant walk north to downtown or south to hipper nightlife spots. That said, the real highlight here is co-owner Laura's vegan/vegetarian breakfasts--the best part of the day, every day. She and husband Scott are a delight to stay with, so I'm sure that I will again when I'm next in Fort Worth.Beautiful:)!  Great place &amp; close to the convention center.  What a gem!  My friend loved staying here - plus new owners are super people!!This review is for the cooking classes at Hattie May Inn. I can't tell you how excited i was to learn the cooking classes offered by Laura Slayton are both yummy and healthy (right up my alley)!  I have taken a Grains class, a Cruciferous Vegetables class, a Greens class and a ""Game Day Eats"" class! All classes have three recipes that the class participants make. We chop, we measure, we massage (kale), we stir, we do it all! After the recipes have been prepared, we clear the dining room table, Laura brings a pitcher of Hibiscus tea and we eat our creations! It's fun, it's educational, it's great for newbies or seasoned cooks. I've made several of the recipes at home. I'll definitely be signing up for more classes! This is by far the best setting for cooking classes--a 100+ year old Victorian home--come on, it doesn't get better than that!Thank you to the new owners, Laura and Scott, for sharing this small part of your lives with us. My husband and I don't normally stay in bed and breakfasts, but we wanted a change from the typical hotel. We felt so special and comfortable when we arrived and Scott brought us a glass of wine in our room.Neither of us are vegan or vegetarian, but we want to eat better, and were excited to see what nutritionist Laura would prepare for breakfast, and it was delicious.We recommend the Hattie May Inn to anyone who wants to stay in a warm and comfortable home that's close to everything you might want to visit in Fort Worth.We were so happy with our stay at the Hattie May Inn.  The house, and rooms were beautiful.  The owners were so nice.  Price was great.  Food was delicious.  Location was perfect.  We can't wait to come back!My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. We stayed in the Oriental Oasis, which is fairly small, but extremely comfortable. It connects to the original bathroom, which still contains the original claw-foot tub and a pull-chain toilet.Linda, the owner, is extremely friendly and accommodating. I forgot to tell her beforehand that I have a gluten sensitivity, but she still had everything she needed to make me delicious gluten-free blueberry waffles in the morning.This is about as close as I've ever come to staying in a traditional and authentic bed and breakfast. The house is lovely and well-preserved, clean, and nicely decorated with a mix of antiques and modern artwork. Laura greeted me upon my arrival and was extremely hospitable.  I met Scott the next day and he was equally friendly.  My room, the Americana, was just perfect in terms of size and the bathroom was extremely clean and updated. My room had a sleeping porch attached so I was able to keep my balcony door open all night to catch the cool spring breeze. It might be a little warmer in the summer but there is a window unit in the room. I was very comfortable. Breakfast was delicious and again, because it was an authentic bed and breakfast, the guests sat together at on big table and were served at the same time. That allowed for some nice conversations with people I would have never met otherwise. The south side of Ft. Worth is developing into a fabulous place for dining. The homes in the neighborhood are in transition but you can see he potential everywhere. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to act. Worth.Ok this is only my second bed and breakfast so compared to my first, very sketchy B&amp;B - this one IS as good as it gets!  The owner reminded me of my own-everyone-is-a-wonderful-person kind of person.  Super sweet and very obliging.  Going at Christmas was great for an elf like me.  ( What's your favorite color?)  It was decorated so beautifully.  The owner gave us a great tour at first which was interesting and neat. Then we hung out to enjoy our wine while we enjoyed some records . . . oh yeah, CHRISTMAS records.  :-D   Breakfast was delicious and Linda, the owner, stayed with me because I was kinda late getting down and everyone else got up almost as soon as I sat down because they were done.  I have a secret favorite room but I'm not sure I'll share it bc I want to get it again sometime!!  Hint - its NOT the biggest one!I've stayed there twice with my wife and both times Linda was exceptionally accommodating. She is happy to share the history of the house and people associated with it. I recommend the room at the back of the house with the US flag - it has a little screened porch which is great for lounging. Only problem with the porch is a window from an adjoining room looks out on to it - assuming the guest pushes curtains out of the way. So as long as you stay partially clothed should be OK.We stay at Hattie May Bed &amp; Breakfast every time we go to Fort Worth. It's beautiful and comfortable and Linda is wonderful. I notoriously forget things and she's so sweet and accommodating. The beds are cozy and the bathrooms spotless. It's our favorite place and we highly recommend it!!What an amazing bed and breakfast.  Wonderful house with interesting rooms and comfortable beds.  Everything was decorated and homey.  Linda the owner was friendly and sweet.  Breakfast was delicious.  I couldn't ask for anything more from a bed and breakfast.",,,,,"['review', 'cooking', 'class', 'live', 'fort', 'worth', 'therefore', 'occasion', 'inn', 'laura', 'new', 'owners', 'nicest', 'people',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-fort-worth,Country Inn & Suites,3.0,$$,10,"We had a great stay. The staff were lovely and having the free shuttle bus was fantastic. We were shuttled around and saved money on taxis.Hotel was clean and had everything we needed.The facilities here are very clean; perhaps overly so.  Upon arriving, I was greeted by the strong scent of disinfectant in the lobby - I think it had just been cleaned.  I could also detect a trace of it in the room, but it was not enough to be an irritation.The man at check-in was not very friendly; I felt like I was just taking time away from him playing Candy Crush.  The WiFi is free; it was not working when I first checked in, but it did work later in the evening.  (Luckily, there was an internet enabled-computer in the lobby.)I had been on the road for a week, and this hotel had the best breakfast spread by far - there was the requisite hash browns, eggs, sausage (which were good) and pastries, but there was also yogurt and fresh fruit.  They even provide silverware (not plastic), which is a nice touch.One downside to this hotel is that there is not a lot of interest in the immediate area.  There is a Mexican restaurant called Mercado Juarez  across the street; I didn't go there, but you can check the reviews on Yelp: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-juarez-fort-worth"">yelp.com/biz/mercado-jua...</a>.  If you are ok with this, then Country Inn &amp; Suites is a fine place to stay.Quaint place, very comfy beds, nice and helpful staff.  Free shuttle to Sundance and stockyards.  Right next to mercado juarez!  Was pricey on a busy weekend.The room was huge. I had 2 queens with a love seat  and mini-kitchenette (microwave, frig, sink, counter). It could stand some updating, but it wasn't bad. The night before I stayed in a completely up-to-date room, this room was a step down, but still nice.They have a free breakfast with a large variety of items. The eggs were awful, but there were plenty of other choices.Also, free internet.They had chocolate chip cookies at check in, that always earns a few points in my book!I would stay here again.This was the dirtiest Country Inn &amp; Suites I have ever been to. The shower head came off during my shower, too... Very run down.We stayed here for an anniversary and had a lovey time.  The hotel is located near the stockyards so we were able to enjoy great dinner choices and also we walked on the scenic river walk paths.  We wished we would have brought out bikes but instead, we just walked.The hotel has a two room suite with TV's in both rooms, a couch and table in one and the bedroom had a two-person jacuzzi tub.  It was a lovely room that was quite and comfortable.I see there are other reviews that are terrible but this was NOT our experience at all.  Maybe they have had a change in management or new help since those were posted.  We thought we would like to stay there again!The breakfast was small but we came for the comfort of the room and the location.Had good prompt service upon arrival. There was a strange smell in our room that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Not a bad smell but it was almost like they were trying to cover up a bad smell. But on the positive side you did get used to whatever the smell was quickly and did not even notice it after 15 minutes. The included breakfast was ok. The coffee was cold but other than that it was edible.Great room for the price.  Not the Ritz, but clean and that's really all you should expect for how cheap the rooms are.This is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life. Avoid it if you can. The rooms are outdated by at least 30 years. There was trash on the floor in my room, the upholstery was ripped on one of the chairs, the complementary toiletries were previously used (the seals were broken), there were ""small hairs"" still on the floor of the bathroom from the previous guest, the curtains didn't close all of the way (I had to use clips to close them), the tv sound was broken, and the room smelled strange. To top it off, I couldn't sleep because I was so terrified that there were bedbugs. I left absolutely disgusted.I didn't expect the Ritz, but I expected clean and it wasn't. There were crumbs all over the floor and used q-tips next to the microwave. YUCK!!! The room also reeked. It smelled like musty cigarette smoke and the entire hotel is non-smoking. I would not recommend staying here unless you have to.",,,,,"['great', 'staff', 'lovely', 'free', 'shuttle', 'bus', 'fantastic', 'shuttled', 'around', 'saved', 'money', 'taxis', 'hotel', 'clean', 'everything', 'needed', 'facilities', 'clean', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'upon', 'arriving', 'greeted', 'strong', 'scent', 'disinfectant', 'lobby', 'think', 'cleaned', 'also', 'detect', 'trace', 'room', 'enough', 'irritation', 'man', 'check', 'friendly', 'felt', 'like', 'taking', 'time', 'away', 'playing', 'candy', 'crush', 'free', 'working', 'first', 'checked', 'work', 'later', 'evening', 'luckily', 'enabled', 'computer', 'lobby', 'road', 'week', 'hotel', 'best', 'breakfast', 'spread', 'far', 'requisite', 'hash', 'browns', 'eggs', 'sausage', 'good', 'pastries', 'also', 'yogurt', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'provide', 'silverware', 'plastic', 'nice', 'touch', 'downside', 'hotel', 'lot', 'interest', 'immediate', 'area', 'restaurant', 'called', 'across', 'street', 'check', 'reviews', 'yelp', 'yelp', 'com', 'biz', 'fort', 'worth', 'yelp', 'com', 'biz', 'country', 'inn', 'amp', 'suites', 'fine', 'place', 'quaint', 'place', 'comfy', 'beds', 'nice', 'helpful', 'staff', 'free', 'shuttle', 'stockyards', 'right', 'next', 'pricey', 'busy', 'weekend', 'room', 'huge', 'queens', 'love', 'seat', 'mini', 'kitchenette', 'microwave', 'frig', 'sink', 'counter', 'stand', 'updating', 'bad', 'night', 'completely', 'date', 'room', 'room', 'step', 'still', 'nice', 'free', 'breakfast', 'large', 'variety', 'items', 'eggs', 'awful', 'plenty', 'choices', 'also', 'free', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'cookies', 'check', 'always', 'earns', 'points', 'book', 'dirtiest', 'country', 'inn', 'amp', 'suites', 'ever', 'shower', 'head', 'came', 'shower', 'run', 'anniversary', 'time', 'hotel', 'located', 'near', 'stockyards', 'able', 'enjoy', 'great', 'dinner', 'choices', 'also', 'walked', 'scenic', 'river', 'walk', 'paths', 'wished', 'brought', 'bikes', 'instead', 'walked', 'hotel', 'room', 'suite', 'rooms', 'couch', 'table', 'bedroom', 'person', 'jacuzzi', 'tub', 'lovely', 'room', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'see', 'reviews', 'terrible', 'experience', 'maybe', 'change', 'management', 'new', 'help', 'since', 'posted', 'thought', 'like', 'breakfast', 'small', 'came', 'comfort', 'room', 'location', 'good', 'prompt', 'service', 'upon', 'arrival', 'strange', 'smell', 'room', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'bad', 'smell', 'almost', 'like', 'trying', 'cover', 'bad', 'smell', 'positive', 'side', 'used', 'whatever', 'smell', 'quickly', 'notice', 'minutes', 'included', 'breakfast', 'coffee', 'cold', 'edible', 'great', 'room', 'price', 'clean', 'really', 'expect', 'cheap', 'rooms', 'worst', 'place', 'ever', 'life', 'avoid', 'rooms', 'outdated', 'least', 'years', 'trash', 'floor', 'room', 'upholstery', 'ripped', 'chairs', 'complementary', 'toiletries', 'previously', 'used', 'seals', 'broken', 'small', 'hairs', 'still', 'floor', 'bathroom', 'previous', 'guest', 'curtains', 'close', 'way', 'use', 'clips', 'close', 'sound', 'broken', 'room', 'smelled', 'strange', 'top', 'sleep', 'terrified', 'bedbugs', 'left', 'absolutely', 'disgusted', 'expect', 'expected', 'clean', 'crumbs', 'floor', 'used', 'tips', 'next', 'microwave', 'yuck', 'room', 'also', 'reeked', 'smelled', 'like', 'musty', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'entire', 'hotel', 'non', 'smoking', 'recommend', 'staying', 'unless']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 12), ('hotel', 6), ('free', 5), ('also', 5), ('like', 4), ('breakfast', 4), ('smell', 4), ('clean', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('bad', 3), ('great', 3), ('place', 3), ('check', 3), ('nice', 3), ('used', 3), ('floor', 3), ('yelp', 3), ('still', 2), ('staff', 2), ('biz', 2), ('amp', 2), ('small', 2), ('choices', 2), ('shower', 2), ('microwave', 2), ('ever', 2), ('stockyards', 2), ('smelled', 2), ('quite', 2), ('broken', 2), ('country', 2), ('strange', 2), ('com', 2), ('next', 2), ('lovely', 2), ('reviews', 2), ('expect', 2), ('inn', 2), ('good', 2), ('close', 2), ('shuttle', 2), ('suites', 2), ('eggs', 2), ('upon', 2), ('lobby', 2), ('walked', 2), ('time', 2), ('came', 2), ('help', 1), ('dirtiest', 1), ('money', 1), ('cheap', 1), ('disinfectant', 1), ('silverware', 1), ('anniversary', 1), ('facilities', 1), ('bikes', 1), ('sleep', 1), ('crumbs', 1), ('bedroom', 1), ('touch', 1), ('cold', 1), ('saved', 1), ('bedbugs', 1), ('cigarette', 1), ('busy', 1), ('located', 1), ('quaint', 1), ('avoid', 1), ('spread', 1), ('location', 1), ('suite', 1), ('posted', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('sound', 1), ('coffee', 1), ('evening', 1), ('wished', 1), ('around', 1), ('far', 1), ('quickly', 1), ('upholstery', 1), ('instead', 1), ('arriving', 1), ('items', 1), ('edible', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('entire', 1), ('chairs', 1), ('always', 1), ('candy', 1), ('clips', 1), ('large', 1), ('jacuzzi', 1), ('night', 1), ('river', 1), ('side', 1), ('enjoy', 1), ('cookies', 1), ('right', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-fort-worth-west-fort-worth,Staybridge Suites Fort Worth West,4.0,$$,12,"The front desk (Damaris and Tammy) was very friendly, professional, and helpful. It is unusual compared to other Staybridge Suites' front desks.The rooms were clean and in great condition.We will be definitely come back to this Staybridge if we come back to the area.Can't go wrong staying here.I don't really have a single complaint about Staybridge. The breakfast was better than average (and they provide bags so we could take a few things to the room for snacking). The amenities are better than average. No nickel-and-diming. Friendly staff and good guest info (what's going on in town, weather, etc. We stayed at another one mid-week and got the free reception. Had a king room there with pull-out. That one had recycling. This one doesn't, so taking ours with us. This time we shared a 2-bedroom with my brother and it worked perfectly. Two beds in ours and one in theirs, two bathrooms, three TVs and the living area. Would be nice if the bedroom doors locked for a tad more privacy, but with family we all got enough space. Only other negative was having to sign in to the wifi every time you use it. Overall, great stay at both places. Maybe a step down from Embassy, but then so was the price, so overall may be a better value. Got our money's worth here as a family of four. Will definitely be back!I am so pleased with the Staybridge Suites Ft. Worth on Clifford Center Drive.  The staff has neen exceptionally welcoming. Their hospitality is off the charts amazing.  Marteka, the desk clerk, was prompt, informative and displayed a great attitude.  I also met with Laquentha, a manager at Staybridge.   Again, another employee with a genuine joy for her job and her desire to make all of her guests feel welcomed and happy to be here.  The accommodations are very clean, very well taken care of, and a pleasant Texas style.  I would highly recommend a stay here. They offered a complimentary social with food and live music that was awesome!This place is not worth the money.  The carpet in the room is filthy. There is a gummy bear stuck to the kitchen counter. It is a dump. The walls are dirty and it smells bad. The beds are not made correctly...the fitted sheet was put on the wrong way. It is gross and I want my money back.Great place to stay and for all that you get, you just really can't beat the price.  Check in and out  was really quick.  During my stay all the staff were very friendly.  Decent, clean room with queen size bed and pull out couch.  There is a full size refrigerator with burners, dishwasher and microwave.  The fitness center is great--it has an elliptical, two treadmills and a bicycle--all with tv's in them.  There is a large tv on the wall, a yoga mat, weights, an incline bench and a large exercise ball. The pool is outside.  It's very clean--I saw them cleaning it every morning and the temperature was perfect--around 75.They have a great breakfast every day--oatmeal, waffles, omelets, bacon or sausage, potatoes, cereal, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, muffins, cottage cheese.  There's juices, coffee, tea and milk.  Tuesdays - Thursdays, they have a social which includes, wine, beer and food.  There are free cookies at the front desk--I think all night.  The coffee carafes are out from morning til night. There is a nice theater room with really comfy seats--I saw the tv playing, but I didn't use it myself.  I did notice that others were using it during the evening and it did sound like there was a good sound system.Although good during the day, the wifi is a little slow and spotty during peak hours.  Luckily there was a McDonald's nearby with speedy wifi.  I'm sure this doesn't matter if your computer has wired connection capability, but my laptop doesn't so I had to depend on the wireless.  I used the business center's computer at times, but there is a humming noise that goes on and off (not sure what it is) which can be annoying if you're using the computer for any length of time.  But this wasn't such a big deal since I was able to get around it.There's a Walmart, CVS, Savon, Walgreen's and an Albertson's nearby.  Saw a drive-thru Starbuck's (which I didn't need since the hotel had good coffee), Chili's What more could you ask for?  This place is a great deal!Great place to stay. The rooms are nice and the bed is soft, with great assortment of  pillows for anyone's taste. Free breakfast, the usual. On Tuesdays through Thursdays they have an evening meal with free wine and beer. Quiet hotel with plenty of parking.  I've stayed here twice and would stay here again. Don't forget to get a IHG membership to rack up some points.I booked a night here on Hotwire for a concert at Billy Bobs.Checking In/Out-We checked in late (8 pm) and the lady was very helpful and cheerful. It was a very quick process. Check out is noon but we were able to get it extended to 2pm. Again a very quick process with great staff.Room- The room was very clean and I am picky on that. We had a queen suite It had the bed, pull out couch (bedding for it in the closet), two small coffee tables, desk, full size refrigerator,  mini dishwasher, 2 burner stove top, sink, dishes, microwave, flat screen tv that swivels. There was plenty of room to move about. The shower had great pressure and no limit of hot water. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast- They had a complementary breakfast. I did not have any but the person with me loved it. Cereal, fruit, fresh waffles, muffins, ect.I did not get a chance to check out the pool or the grill they have by the pool. They have a 24 hour pantry with microwave meals and such, I didn't check the price but they had a decent selection.I will for sure stay here againWe were sent over here when their sister property (Candlewood Suites) gave our reserved room to someone else. We were told by Candlewood Suites that Staybridge Suites would honor our $106.99 rate. They did NOT, and our room ended up being $155.24. Seems a little like a scam, doesn't it?In addition, I discovered that the phones in our room didn't work, and that the smoke detectors in our room were both covered by plastic wrap taped to the ceiling. Maybe the previous occupant was a smoker? It didn't smell like it, so that was really strange. There was a guy at the front desk (Chris?) who came and looked at it. He was MORTIFIED and immediately offered us another room. However, by this time we just wanted to settle in. So they got the plastic off and we were good. As an FYI, there is a Chili's within walking distance. So that's what we ate for dinner. We got it to go and brought it back to the room. As we were eating it, there was a knock on the door. It was Dominique, who was working the front desk. She had a little gift bag full of goodies to make up for the inconvenience. And the next day, they called me when a guest found a presciption medicine that had fallen out of my purse in the parking lot.The staff here are wonderful! They get 5 stars! And the rooms are nice with comfy beds. It's not a bad place to stay. I just feel like they should have honored the $106.99 rate I was offered at Candlewood Suites. We were there for a National cheerleading competition, we didn't get to stay with our team at Candlewood. So there was quite a bit of disappointment.The wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Fort Worth. The service was good, room clean and very comfortable, breakfast was ok. Very good value. Only complaint was the hotel was kinda hidden no large sign to see from road, front driveway not very well lit  and parking was sparse.  Be sure to pet Oreo the hotel cat.Ok, 2 things..I stayed here before, it was great. Beautiful rooms, attentive care, honest policy's. This last time I was charged 109.00 originally, then got a bill for 160.00, they said it was ""hospitality tax""I travel all the time &amp; hospitality tax isn't usually 25% without being near Disneyland. I asked several times before being charged, and even signed a receipt for 119.00 (with tax) but they had my credit card, and so they charged it whatever they wanted. 2) I lost a very important fur throw, called &amp; they said they had it. great! Girl named Katie took my credit info again to ship it to me..again telling her to call me so Id get tracking &amp; cost on shipping. I never got a call, as a matter if fact, I'd call &amp; I got the biggest run around, &amp; guess what? They finally tell me two weeks later, they sent it..still haven't got the blanket. I'm disappointed. There were coffee grounds in our coffee the morning we left &amp; the bananas were green, but hey ..at least they tried. I will personally plan in staying anywhere else.Good customer service and room was clean as well as the bed. Towels didn't look clean.  We were given our dog fee back due to the noisy environment that evening. Which was nice of the manager, we had also cancelled a previous reservation and they were very nice to deal with.  If the towels had been clean and we had encountered less noise. I would give them 5 stars. There is also Chilis's in the same parking lot which is very convenient.",,,,,"['front', 'desk', 'friendly', 'professional', 'helpful', 'unusual', 'compared', 'suites', 'front', 'desks', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-fort-worth-4,Homewood Suites,4.0,$$,11,"Well, this review has been a long time coming, but after a staying here for a week straight I decided that now it was time to write a review...I've stayed in a few hotels in the area, including the Omni in Downtown Ft. Worth, but even it doesn't have the charm and comforts of this hotel.The atrium is lively, bright and welcoming.  The hallways are simple and clean.  The dinner and breakfast areas are excellent.  There is a putting green near the outside lounge and pool area.The beds are comfortable as can be, the TV and Blu-ray player is awesome and the rooms are (with the exception of one time) very clean.The service is really where this place shines.  From the front desk to the cleaning ladies, their service is top notch.  In fact, for that reason alone, you should stay here.  If you take advantage of it, it's really that good.            All in all, do yourself a favor and stay here.  This is where you'll find me.  ;)I've  stayed here twice now, one week each time as it is close to work when I'm in town.  The hotel looks relatively new.  Unfortunately my stay was not pleasant.  I woke up to multiple bites on my arm at 2am in the morning.  I packed my things and went downstairs to ask for a room transfer. I showed them the pictures attached to this post,  and the young lady switched my room.  I was moved from a king suite to a queen due to availability.   The young lady suggested the hotel take my suitcase to have my stuff cleaned to prevent the possible transfer of bugs. I agreed and went to bed.The next morning I decided to check on my suitcase and retrieve clothes.   I was surprised to find my suitcase was back in the bug room.  It was explained they did this to quarantine the bag until pest control could investigate.  I was told someone would call me when complete.Long story short the call never came.  I approached the desk to get an extra key and was asked if I had been called about the bugs.  I told them no.  She said not to worry, it was just fleas. She asked if I was a Hilton member.  I said no.  She said that she wanted to do something nice for me,  but apparently only if I was a Hilton member.  My job payed for the room so I really couldn't leave without being out of pocket.Really a poor experience.  I expected them to be shocked there were bugs in the room,  but it seemed as thought it was business as usual. No apologies and very little concern. Btw, the bugs in the pictures are definatley not fleas.Let's just call this our ""Wedding Weekend Disaster."" We reserved a wedding block of rooms in January 2015 at Homewood Suites Fort Worth Medical Center, a subsidiary of Hilton, and fulfilled our minimum 5 reservations needed by April, months ahead of the deadline. Knowing we had many people coming from out of town, and that it was TCU vs. SMU and TCU Parent's weekend, we also added a block at the hotel across the street to provide everyone ample number of rooms to stay near each other and our wedding venue to cut down on transportation costs. Fast forward to the week of our event on Sept. 19, 2015. Three, I repeat THREE days before people start checking in, We get a phone call from Homewood Suites informing us that our entire wedding block has to move 20 minutes south to Hampton Inn &amp; Suites  Fort Worth - Burleson, or has to be separated out across Fort Worth to various hotels. Although we were told Homewood Suites was hosting ""an unusually large number of residents who had been displaced,"" my wife and I could not find any wars, fires, floods, natural disasters, etc. in Fort Worth that were mentioned in our contract. We also contacted the Hilton corporate offices, but never heard back and were told the Homewood Suites contact was our only option for support. So we began to speculate back to our original reason for making the contract so far in advance - the TCU vs. SMU game and TCU Parent's weekend. Heck, the hotel is only two miles from campus, why wouldn't they try and double rates for parents to make more money?! The lady we were working with at Homewood Suites said ""You are the last person I want to be calling right now about this,"" ...Then why are we even having this conversation?! The football schedule came out months ago, yet we were never contacted at any point to express concern about overbooking. We even exchanged emails with the lady from Homewood Suites on September 9 to get an updated list of rooms. Being just 10 days before we check-in, there was still no mention of even the slightest possibility of there not being enough rooms to accommodate us. Any hotel worth staying at should have some idea that there might be an issue with accommodating a wedding block with a contract.So now we had less than three days to track down everyone who was staying at the hotel and inform them of the situation. Even though Homewood Suites Fort Worth Medical Center sent emails out trying to inform all guests, several email addresses were wrong, meaning several guests would have been totally unaware of the changes had we not given them a heads up. The rest of the week became chaos.  Being forced out to Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Fort Worth - Burleson was also just the beginning. We missed part of our wedding photographs as the bride, groom, family of 20 and photographer all had to fight over the ONLY UBER that existed in Burleson (which I'll come back to). My sister, her husband and kids missed our rehearsal dinner because of the added 45 minutes of traffic hell getting through downtown and south Fort Worth traffic on I35. My wife, myself and all other guests were unable to celebrate with all of our out-of-town friends and family that were fortunate enough to stay at the other hotel, defeating the whole point of reserving blocks at side-by-side hotels. We also had some cancel their reservation entirely because their homes were now closer than the Burleson hotel, or because the new hotel didn't provide the same amenities as the one originally booked. We also almost got stuck in the elevator as it dropped half of a floor while we were on it the first night. Just dandy. We also noticed the elevator was past-due for inspection - even better! I will acknowledge that Hampton Inn &amp; Suites  Fort Worth - Burleson tried their hardest to make things right, but telling us we will get ""Free Uber and Lyft vouchers"" when they were really only promo codes for first-time users so we couldn't use them, ""craft beer"" that was actually Blue Moon, ""two bottles of wine"" that were actually mini bottles of Sutter Home pink something-nobody-drinks-and-were-probably-free, and ""snacks"" that were really just one of every item in their mini convenience store, ""maps provided from the hotel to the venue and back"" which must've just been Google maps because we never received any maps, and one free night at the hotel, there was still more to be desired for how much chaos this caused the week leading up to and during our wedding. I know so many people say there's always one thing that goes wrong during a wedding and to not sweat the small stuff, but I felt I had to write this and post it everywhere so the world knows just how awful this one thing was, and how little respect Homewood Suites Fort Worth Medical Center and their Hilton corporate partners had for their customers and their wedding guests.Beautiful, CLEAN, well appointed room with a great staff. Nice thick towels, comfy bed, loved the mini stove and included kitchen ware. Will definitely stay here again when visiting Ft Worth. A few minutes from Cavendars and 15 minutes from the Stockyards.This hotel I am guessing is a brand new hotel, if not they sure do keep up with it!The decor was very Texas, not in a bad way. It was beautifully done. A very friendly staff. Nice big king sized room we had. There is a practice putting green, laundry, pool and spa area, exercise room, a little convenient store down stairs. Really everything you could ask for.They are pet friendly...a clean pet friendly. Breakfast area had a good spread of things. Texas shaped waffles which was pretty cool! It's a quiet hotel, by that I mean you know there is noise outside but their windows and walls are thick and you don't hear that noise or the neighbors.I highly recommend this hotel and if we are ever in the area again we will stay every time!This is a new hotel in the area.  Stayed here for 10 days while in the area.  We had a king bed suite.  It was very nice.  The room was well appointed and had a separate bedroom and living room/ kitchen.  It was enough room for my husband, son and I to spend time in the room without being on top of each other.  The bathroom is good size and the closet was big enough to fit two large suitcases as well as hanging clothes and shoes/ laundry basket on the floor.Breakfast is good.  New selections each day.  The evening reception was hit or miss but the staff were very friendly and attempted to provide you with what you needed to relax at the end of the day.  I used the hot tub and gym almost every night.  They never felt over crowded and were always clean.The hotel is right next to the train track and you can hear it in your room.  It did not keep me up at night and my son enjoyed watching the trains come and go.  Unless you are a very light sleeper I don't think it should stop you from booking here.Very enjoyable stay.Can't believe I am the first to review this place. But I guess it is pretty new and the amenities showed. Get here and stay here before the place gets ""used."" What I mean is that everything is still pretty new now. The BBQ area, pool, and putting green are in great condition. The hot breakfast is of course a nice touch and the staff is extremely friendly. We needed our room made earlier than their scheduled time and a maid came within 10 minutes to complete the job.As for the room itself, it was spacious and had everything you need. Stainless Steel appliances and granite counter tops gave it a modern look and the bathroom was well designed, with the sink outside of the closed off area with the toilet and shower. My only complaint is that the TV was not in a good position to be viewed by anyone in the room. Oh ya, and it is next to some train tracks, but you hardly notice the noise that happens every once in awhile.We stayed overnight while a family member was staying in the hospital. The employees were friendly and helpful, breakfast was great and the rooms were comfortable. There is a pool and a putting green along with lots of outdoor space and seating. Our kitchen came with utensils, cookware, even tupperware for leftovers.They offer free breakfast and weeknight evening dinner. Everything was clean and new, and I loved all of the outlets around the room!The bedroom was spacious but the tub and toilet area were somewhat small.I would happily stay at this property again.This hotel stands out for many reasons.  The location off I30 and Forest Park is very convenient, downtown is only a $5 Uber away.  The friendly service is the first thing  you notice.  My wife joking said as we pulled up ""well this isn't the Omni so we won't be getting any champagne for our anniversary!"" and then when we got to our room there were 2 small bottles of Muscato, 2 flutes, a huge selection of chocolates, and a Happy Anniversary card signed by the staff.  Seriously, this was unexpected, and while it may have only cost them a few dollars it really showed how much they appreciated us.  I should mention we were staying on points and this was our first time here, so it was all very unexpected.  The hotel is beautifully appointed, gorgeous lobby, quiet and swanky hallways.  Our 4th floor room (even numbered) faced downtown Fort Worth, which while not a massive skyline, is pretty neat from this angle, especially at night.  The suites are large, with a comfortable kitchen and living room.  For 2 people it was too big, it could easily handle 4 people before getting crowded.  The bedroom was comfy, and the bathroom plenty big.  The hotel is recently built with very soundproof walls and windows.  Some light rail noise but nothing to wake you up.  Breakfast was nothing fancy, but plenty of choices.The staff is WONDERFUL! They work very hard to make sure that you will enjoy your stay and feel like home. The pool was warm and the exercise room is much bigger then your typical hotel. Having the kitchen in your room makes life much more convenient. They also have a real estate discount for people moving into town or in between homes.I have been staying for a while here, I am from Turkey and here is liley second home. All staffs are extremely friendly and so I don't feel alone. Pool and fitness room are so clean and rooms and appleances are so new. When I came fort worth, the first suite that I stayed is here and I never minded to look for another place.",,,,,"['well', 'review', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'staying', 'week', 'straight', 'decided',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-ft-worth-southwest-i-20-fort-worth,Hampton Inn Ft Worth-Southwest I-20,4.0,$$,12,"We have been living in Arizona for the past 5 years a trip back home to Texas for Thanksgiving reminded us how friendly Texans are, starting with this great place to stay!  Establishment is very clean, and comfortable.  Employees are  very helpful and friendly!  Love it!  We will visit again.  Highly recommend!Alright so we got to fort worth Friday October 30 due to a family matter.  Due to the last minute scramble to get here, and coupled with the 4.5 hour drive from the Bastrop area due to flood and a tornado warning we had no reservations.  After having been in town for several hours we decided on Hampton.  We have had positive experiences before in multiple states so why not.  We got the room booked and headed over in the rain. We arrived to find it packed to the gills.  I love sports but never thought about tcu &amp; the Dallas Cowboys playing. I'm reasoning that was the reason for folks everywhere.  We got our room keys and tired headed upstairs.  We got in and weren't awe struck.  We have stayed in very nice Hampton inn before but this seemed lacking.  The shower tub was dated. The bathroom door squeaked.  The shower pin was difficult to pull up.  The bed......well let's just say it did us no favors. I tossed and turned all night and so did my Wife.  We also had the great pleasure of the ice machine being right next to us. In the morning we checked out and were running off fumes. The breakfast wasn't appealing so we grabbed tea, juice and two boxes of cereal and left. I'm not boycotting Hampton inn but I would say we'd put our hotel snobbery at a 10 before we reside here again temporarily.The rooms at this Hampton in are decent and on par with what you would expect from a Hampton Inn. If all you need is a place to shower and sleep, you'll be happy with your accommodations. It is worth nothing though that the hotel itself is located on an usually small lot and so this is hardly a ""Texas-sized"" hotel. This means that there is not lobby to speak of and upon entering the hotel you immediately get to the front desk on your left. Beyond the check-in desk are hallways that take you by an indoor pool and jacuzzi to the elevators. Again the rooms are fine, and few people probably pick a hotel for its lobby. But the small lot means that parking here is extremely limited, and I imagine that if they were booked at full capacity there would not be enough room to park for each guest. This is particularly burdensome if you have reservations ahead of time and arrive only to find there is no place to park. This almost happened to me.Also, this place is located right off the highway, so is prone to traffic noise. If you're a light sleeper, you may want to avoid this spot. On the plus side, there are lots of restaurants within close driving proximity, and a 24 hour fitness up the way, in case you have membership and want a decent workout on the road. Also, this Hampton Inn offers water bottles and candy to guests, which is something that not all Hamptons do.We came to stay the weekend in Ft Worth and picked this hotel due to its close proximity to the seminary and Hulen Mall. While checking in I felt the lobby area was really cramped. There are plans to expand the common areas, so we'll look past it for now. We had a great room very clean and spacious. The breakfast was the typical Hampden breakfast but nicely done. The staff was friendly and helpful. Will probably stay here again in the future.For the low price, this place was pretty good.  The carpet in the hallways was kind of smelly but that was all I could really complain about.  There is a ton of construction in the area but it did not affect my stay.  Nice room, clean bathroom, well appointed, good tv, free wifi and a decent free breakfast.  Basic, reasonable, great staff and affordable.Stayed here on a cross country trip.  Great accommodations and breakfast.  Staff went above and beyond when they didn't have the room we reserved and my husband left his medicine in the refrigerator.  Definitely recommended staying here.I'm not a frequent er of hotels/motels but for the price i paid the room was nice and clean, the bed was comfy, the ac blew super cold, and the staff was friendly. would definitly recommend.This was the nicest hotel experience I have ever had.  The rooms were super, beds comfortable beyond our wildest expectations and they even called after we checked in to make sure everything was ok and did we need any assistance.  It is close to many great restaurants and a shopping mall, and a nice indoor pool. When I lived in FW, I never knew this place existed.  Now when I go back to visit, it is the only place I will stay.  Thanks folks at Hampton Inn for the great visit.I've stayed here twice on business and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Breakfast was above average for the Hampton Inn-type continentals. Breakfast nook was very inviting and pleasant to sit in while reading, doing work, etc. Hotel is within walking distance (1/3 mile) to good restaurants and to Hulen Mall, its associated movie theater, Barnes and Noble. Rooms are clean, quiet, and comfortable. Perfect for those seeking convenience to the highway or an affordable stay with no surprises.Ok but nothing special.  Usual craptastic pool and semi functional gym equipment.  Convenient to the usual off-ramp eateries and good if you're coming from Austin or San Antonio because it's on the south side of Fort Worth.Stayed here on Business. Very happy with the hotel. Lobby was small. Room was nice and clean. I would say a little above average Hampton Inn. I would definitely stay there againok accommodations, but completely inflexible when I had to change the duration of my stay.",,,,,"['living', 'past', 'years', 'trip', 'back', 'home', 'thanksgiving',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ettas-place-fort-worth-2,Etta's Place,3.5,$$,12,"My wife and I just got back from a night at Etta's Place for our 6th anniversary. It's within walking distance of several great dinning and entertainment spots in downtown Fort Worth. The historic building has a lot of personality and the fixtures in the rooms are antique and comfortable.Breakfast was delicious and relaxing. It's served on a refreshingly eclectic mix of old, miss-matched china by sweet friendly people. There is a nice common room with comfy leather chairs, warm lighting and walls full of old books. If you are looking for a quite escape with the option of easily taking in dinner, a show and local art, Etta's Place is a great spot. We will definitely be going back.Not a real great place. As another reviewer posted the best thing about the place is the location. The hotel as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Cleanliness and maintenance is not a priority. My wife and I stayed in Maude's, my wife was taking a shower and an open pipe in the ceiling over the shower dropped something in her eye. The baseboards and carpet were worn and a bit dirty and the shower wasn't entirely clean. In the end I wouldn't recommend this place.Stayed in Etta's Attic and was disappointed. As my hubby and I ascended the staircase we noted that it had been a while since the carpet had seen a vacuum cleaner. Entered our room and noted the kitchen floor needed a good sweep and mop. There were also candy wrappers and other small bits of refuse on the sofa, bed, and floor. The guest service staff member shared that house keeping was out for the day and that she was sorry. I get it that a room change in a B&amp;B is not easy but get someone up with a swiffer and a token of your apology. The decor was descent, dusty but descent. If you are ok with cheap blinds and Texas shabby chic go for it. The more I think about it I should have pitched a fit, but it was my birthday and every time we noticed something my hubby looked crestfallen. The location was the only plus, from the hotel you can walk anywhere. Guess what there are other places in the area that may be cleaner and more customer friendly. The breakfast, I mean who does not go to a B&amp;B for the delicious hot breakfast with tea and fresh juices. The food was lukewarm and so was the orange concentrate. We had precooked sausage patties, a spinach egg dish, and over toasted English muffin. Needless to say we picked over our food and left quickly no need to linger. Just paid the pricey almost $300 dollar and made a run for it. Seek residence elsewhere.My husband booked a night in Maude's room to celebrate my birthday. While the location is fantastic, this was a sad, sad hotel. The main problem for us was the cleanliness of the hotel was lacking (crumbs and such on our room floor, for example; peeling pant in the room), not sure the bed had been changed. No one to be seen to ask, since we checked in after 8 pm (!). It was a cold night in January, and the super loud heater ran constantly (on the plus side it masked some of the loud street noise), with no instructions on how to change the thermostat or turn it off. The breakfast was disappointing also. When making the reservation, my husband called to ask them about accommodating my diet restrictions (something good BNBs manage just fine), he was told to put in the online reservation. Imagine our surprise when my breakfast came full of stuff I couldn't eat! After we reminded her (though it seemed she hadn't been told), she offered me ""an egg."" She did a nice job of scrambling that egg, but I expected better. For those who do eat gluten, I suspect that they would have been disappointed by the breakfast casserole served with store bought raisin bread (on Sunday morning, not even any pastries). Not exactly gourmet as advertised. This seems the remains of a lovely hotel (beautiful library and patios!), but the owners seem to have given up on the place.This place was really cute,  but the WiFi is almost non existent.  Worse than old school dial up.  Don't plan on having real Internet service here! Breakfast was good though.We stayed 2 night in the abundance suite and were very happy. The parking garage is close by and easy walk. There is not a ""front desk"" but it's ok. The room itself is simple and cute. We got the romance package which included cider, strawberries, and massages. The massage lady was very nice and relaxing. The best thing about the hotel is the breakfast! It is so good! And the lady is so nice. The only downfall is the noise around 7 in the morning is when the streets get busier and construction starts so be prepared but it's expected. It is close to everywhere and ideal location for everything. You have to ask them to validate parking! We will be booking and recommending. Enjoy!Stayed here for one night in 'Laura's Lounge'. I would definitely recommend staying at Etta's Place. AMAZING location in Sundance Square, friendly staff, good breakfast, spacious rooms. There were a number of very minor things in the room that warrants a bump down to 4 stars: broken mirror hinge, very dust blinds, no body wash/soap, a wet book, the bathtub coating was peeling. Still a great overall experience.My wife and I had an event in Fort Worth this weekend. I looked at various hotels downtown and you can't beat the price of Etta's Place. We stayed in Will's Refuge. It is probably one of the smaller rooms but was perfect for us. Clean and comfortable and we never heard any noise from anywhere. This was our 2nd stay at Etta's place and its great. Close parking, free wifi, Incredible breakfast each morning and you can't beat the location. The only problem is picking what you want to do nearby. Four Day Weekend is a must. Great restaurants nearby and great bars and clubs. The only time we left downtown the entire weekend was to go to the event we planned in the first place. I could recommend this place enough.What a great space!! We had the.  perfect stay. Mona and Ryan were overly accommodating.  The common areas were so cozy- courtyard, piano room, library, and kitchen.  Breakfast was delicious! Green chili eggs, peach blackberry crisp. Not drowning in cheese or smothered in sugar. Homemade and naturally TASTY! I'll be recommending Etta's to everyone going to FtW.  Oh, check out Scat's jazz lounge closeby. Former speakeasy, great music.I was pretty amped to stay at Etta's, especially after reading the other reviewer's experiences.  My husband and I lived in Ft. Worth for several years but never stayed downtown so when we came back to attend a wedding rehearsal dinner at Reata's right next door, it seemed like a prime opportunity, but we were extremely let down.  We got to the hotel at 7:45pm, after a minor flight delay, and despite getting their before their proposed closing time, there was no staff to help us, just a small sign that said go to an apartment building (I cannot remember the name, but the name was listed on the small sheet of paper) to pick up our keys.  I walked all the way around the block and didn't see the named apartment building, it wasn't until I asked someone who was walking into a nearby building if they knew where the place was, and they said it was through the double doors, but there was NO MARKING OR NAME ANYWHERE, very frustrating.  Also there was no mention on my confirmation email that there would be an alternate location we would need to go to get our keys - and we were given minimal direction on where to park, luckily we knew the area well enough to know where to go.  Demerit #1 and #2.  We got to our room (Ben's room) which was fine, just as pictured, actually a little bigger than I expected.  It was clean, and had a large walk in closet with robes.  Bathroom was large, fully stocked with amenities, which was nice.  There was also bottled water waiting for us, which I liked.  The bed was very comfortable, the most redeeming quality of the stay for sure.  We found the room to be quiet too, and were not bothered by any street noise.  So that was all good.  There was someone smoking what smelled like illicit drugs down the hall, so that was not cool, but luckily didn't permeate into our room.  Because we had no human contact with any staff when we checked in we had to search the room for info on what time and where breakfast was, which was provided in a tableside guide (not in our check in paper, which I found odd as well, since it is advertised as a B&amp;B).  We got to breakfast and there were a couple muffins and coffee available, and ran into a woman who asked us if we wanted hot food, which we did.  She was nice enough, saying good morning but that was all, she didn't introduce herself, didn't talk to us at all, didn't ask us how our night was...nothing.  Very odd.  We waited about 15 minutes for our meal, which was fine, we were munching on muffins and coffee and orangejuice.  The breakfast was Mexican eggs (a sort of casserole) served cold, with a side of sausage and English muffin, with no butter or jam.  Seriously??  Cold breakfast and no condiments??  The lady disappeared and we didn't see her for more than 20 minutes - so unfortunately the couple that came in after us had to wait for a long time to get their food, infact, we finished eating and grabbed seconds on coffee and they still hadn't gotten anything yet.  We packed up and went to check out, but still no one was to be seen anywhere.  There was another small note that said to leave the keys at the front desk, so we did.  So basically we had the opposite of a B&amp;B experience, with zero human interaction and a mediocre breakfast.  The location is great to be sure, the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are clean, so it is not a total loss, but they definitely need to work on their B&amp;B skills and customer interaction.  To be honest though I would not bother going back, it wasn't worth the price, and wasn't worth the falsified B&amp;B title.For options on Sundance Square, this was great, they really are within walking distance of so many great places to dine. The rooms are spacious and the old building charm is amazing, wonderful patios and views abound here. Really a wonderful place with wonderful charm and amenities.Priced a little steep for the size of the room ($150+), but located centrally in downtown Fort Worth. Bed -- a little soft, but Etta's is my choice when visting Fort Worth because it puts me in the heart of the downtown. Friendly staff, very secure and safe. (Actually, all the downtown area feels safe as local police patrol the area on bicycles throughout the night).",,,,,"['wife', 'back', 'night', 'place', '6th', 'anniversary', 'within', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-fort-worth-fossil-creek-fort-worth,Hampton Inn & Suites Fort Worth-Fossil Creek,3.0,$$$$,11,"This Hampton Inn is fabulous! We came to stay here for the Cowtown Marathon. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The room was extra clean and the amenities in the room were fantastic! We were leaving the hotel by 5 am and asked the staff if we could get some breakfast prior to leaving and they accommodated us by opening the breakfast early for the basics. Fully supported us! The management here is top notch and I will be back to stay at this hotel again! Thanks for a great experience!This place has a serious problem with noise at night. To many doors slam. All the way to midnight. Front desk takes several calls just to get hold of them. And hey do nothing. No clean towels at the pool. Just a bunch of dirty towels. The noise at night. The doors slamming. Unexceptable. The staff who's works here should be ashamed. Find another place to stay. Anywhere. And the breakfast sucks. No bacon.Oh where to begin! First I think it's important to know that whenever we need a hotel the Hampton Inn is our go-to. We've stayed in several of them! The maid at this location couldn't understand a word we said, (she didn't speak any English), so we didn't get the items we requested, (tea for example). The indoor pool was FREEZING cold so we were unable to enjoy it. Breakfast was ok, not as good as the other Hampton Inn's. BLACK MOLD and mildew in the bathtub, (see the photos I posted). We could hear every single person in the hallway. I was afraid to place anything on the broken desk, (see photo from how the hotel staff tried to fix it due to a previous guest). I wish we would have never stayed at this location, waste of money and they ruined our weekend!Good customer service, extremely clean and a great continental breakfast! I was very pleased that this was our hotel of choice for our travels! I was comfortable and had the opportunity to relax while staying there. My only question is: where do you hide the remote control to the television?Just stayed here last weekend for a concert at the Stockyards and I was very impressed! My room was huge! It was very beautiful as well. Not a bad price for what you get either. The staff was very nice and helpful. The entire hotel was also very clean from what I could tell. The only thing that I have a complaint about was that the shuttle van did not pick us up where he said he would at the Stockyards. I happened to look around and see him down the road and had to run to catch up. Thank God I did or I would have been stuck there. Other than that, everything was great! Will be staying here again.Absolute worst hotel experience of my life.  The management here can not control the noise volumes from the guests.I packed up my children and left the hotel at 12:30 am.Booked my stay over 3 weeks ago..I arrived.. And was greeted well.  After giving her my name..she could not find my reservation.  Asked for my confirmation..I pulled up the saved email on my phone.  Still could not locate my reservation.  After several minutes..she decides to finally just get me in a room ( I had requested the top floor when I booked) of course their were no rooms available on the top.  I tried to pay with my husband's credit card, and was told I could not do that.  I get ready to give her another card with my name, and by some miracle my reservation shows up..and it's pre-paid with my husbands card! And that's okay?? WTH I still don't get the top floor and by the sound of it..they have allowed some baby elephants to stay in the room above meStayed at this hotel numerous times with ok service. Was charged different rates every stay. Tried establishing a set rate and was told no chance. I would suggest traveling a few blocks down for half the price and you are able to set a standard rate for numerous stays. Poor management.For our purposes, this Hampton Inn was great! We came in from Dallas for a show at Billy Bob's. This location offers a Billy Bob's weekend discount of $20. They also provide a free shuttle to and from Billy Bob's, free hot breakfast, and free WiFi. Room was spacious, comfortable and clean. Easy access to 30 for sightseeing in the cultural district. Will definitely stay here again for any overnight trips to Ft. Worth.This Hampton rocks. Manager understands customer service.If you are traveling on business or like to have reliable and fast Internet access, do NOT stay here. Horrible service. You will not get any work done here if you need Internet access. Talked to personnel here and they admittingly said they were aware but not enough people complained to do anything about it. Pathetic service. This is the 2nd Hampton Inn to have this problem. I'm starting to wonder if I need to go to another chai and lose my Diamond status.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-fort-worth-4,Hampton Inn,3.5,$$,10,"Rooks are so nice. Clean always have a comfy bed and I totally love the suites. All kinds of room and everything you need. Breakfast is as expected but not too bad. Luke having options and they have a few. Staff is awesome from check in through check out. First rate and always helpful. My new favorite hotel in TexasBottom Line:  Clean and comfortable facility with large rooms but not for light sleepers.I've stayed in about five different Hampton Inns in the last year.  One was totally ghetto while the rest were perfectly comfortable. Overall, I thought this hotel was fine for my business trip.  If you are thinking about staying here, here is some information you may find helpful:- Convenient location to I-35.  Several decent restaurants within a five minute drive.- There is ample, free parking.- Large rooms with a big desks are great for business travelers.- Hotel has breakfast in the morning.  Not gourmet but plenty of variety.- They always have coffee and tea in the lobby.- The staff is pleasant.- The decor in common areas is fresh and up to date.  I found my hotel bathroom to be a little generic but it was fine for a business trip.- Free wi-fi or you can pay $5 and upgrade to a better connection.The biggest downside to this hotel is its loud.  My biggest complaint was the road noise from the interstate but my coworkers also had complaints of elevators dinging and doors slamming.  Luckily i am not a light sleeper, but I did find this hotel to be nosier than most.I had an amazing 4-night stay here!+ Staff was extremely friendly, always greeting me and smiling+ Courtesy phone call as soon as I got to my room asking if everything was okay+ Plenty of parking+ Close access to the highways+ Close to Target / CVS / Gas stations+ Complimentary wifi+ Complimentary breakfast (toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, mini muffins, yogurt, oatmeal, etc)+ Coffee/ hot chocolate / tea always available at the front desk+ Very cleanThere is nothing great about this hotel. I have nothing against Hampton Inns but this one is particularly unwelcoming. The folks working here are fine but the decor is really bad &amp; the room itself feels cold &amp; in need of redecorating! Upon returning to the room at 3:00pm we find it still hasn't been made up. We left at 9:00am! This is not a mid priced hotel! This is a cheap hotel. I really dislike this place. Yuk!So it's hard to give a budget hotel 5 stars in my book but this one is as close as it gets.  The staff is exceptionally friendly no matter the time of day.  The room was very clean in all aspects.  Pool and hot tub were clean, well chlorinated,   Over a few night stay there was no exceptional noise or large crowds.  The building is well secured and required key cards at all doors except the front 24 hours a day.  The front locked down at night as well.  Parking was no issue, for the few nights we were there the lot was 1/2 full, maybe 3/4 full,  Parking lot does have two ways in and out which makes it a bit easier for locals to smash and grab but on the backside so many rooms look into the parking lot they would have to be brazen.  If you are working on this side of town or within a 15 minute drive I advise this is one of the better hotels out there.My family stayed here on a Friday night because we had an early Saturday morning event and home is just far enough away to not want to leave that early.  We really enjoyed the stay.  The room was very clean and spacious.  They recently had DirecTV installed, so that was a huge upgrade to the typical channel selection and cable quality.  The pool and sauna were well maintained (maybe a little over board on the chlorine).  The breakfast was honestly the freshest I have had at a Hampton (hundred of nights in Hampton Hotels over the years).  They were restocking it even before it emptied.  The biggest thing for me was the friendliness of the staff.  Everyone that passed us had a very warm and genuine hello.  Also, we hit Fort Worth a little earlier than expected (about 9AM) with plans to spend the day outside.  Unfortunately, it started raining as we were getting into town so we had nothing really to do before check-in.  I asked if there was a way that we could get a key to use the pool for a couple of hours until lunch.  Instead, they found us a ready room and let us check in completely for no additional charge.  The only two things that keep this from being a 5 are the price (over $100 after taxes for a weekend night on the West Side of Fort Worth - so nowhere near the airport - was a bit much) and the internet access.  It was miserably slow even by hotel standards.Stayed here for about 3 days. The room was ok. The room was set up as a big studio room with bed and sofa at opposite ends. The breakfast was good the usual. The staff was very friendly. And best of all the hotel is right across the highway from a mall. Grab your Hilton points here.The renovation at this hotel came out great.  Checked in last night and had a great nights sleep on the new mattresses.  Woke up this morning and really enjoyed my workout in the fitness center.  The staff is super friendly and I love that they have Direct TV so I can use the guide when deciding what to watchI recently traveled to Fort Worth to meet with a vendor and I stayed at this hotel. I left my room to go to dinner the first night and I was unable to re-enter it due to some sort of lock malfunction. They parked me in an adjacent room where I spent a fitful night sleeping in my clothes on top of the bed in there. The hotel was not able to re-open the door until the next morning as their maintenance person was unavailable. I was late for a planned 8am meeting the next day.The manager comped the room for both nights, although the front desk needed to be reminded of that and the first bill they gave me included a charge for the second night. They also gave me a $25 gift card to Starbucks since the free room benefits my (huge) employer and my employer wasn't inconvenienced by this at all. I was thinking more along the lines of a voucher for a free night's stay in the Hilton chain, but I guess he wasn't thinking along the same lines.The breakfast was so-so. I am a bread and fruit person when it comes to breakfast and the cut-up fruit had a funny taste to it and a couple of the pieces were well past their prime. The room was clean. The toilet in the room they transferred me to had a problem with the flapper valve, but if I flushed it a couple of times it would eventually seat correctly and stop running. Their maintenance guy was asked to look at it, but apparently he figures that it's ok for guests to flush the toilet a few times to make the toilet stop running.I don't plan on staying at this hotel again should I need to have additional meetings in Fort Worth with this vendor. The manager did what he could to make up for a situation that never should have happened in the first place. It wasn't enough.Great mid-priced hotel. Large spacious rooms, great staff. Free wired/wireless Internet in the rooms and common areas.Nice pool/whirlpool/workout room. Super nice, except I really hate the Philips flatscreen HDTVs that can't preserve aspect ration of standard def channels.",,,,,"['rooks', 'nice', 'clean', 'always', 'comfy', 'bed', 'totally', 'love',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-fort-worth-north-fort-worth,La Quinta Inn & Suites Fort Worth North,3.0,$$,10,"Great rooms, nicely decorated.  Great rates. Pool needs a good cleaning and disappointing you couldn't walk to the pool area without holding your breath from all of the smokers hanging outside the pool area.  Not sure if beds were comfortable I was asleep before I could tell. Blackout curtains did the trick, either that or before bed time swim did bc kids slept till after 8. Breakfast choices were lots of carbs, bagels, fruit, cereal, Texas shaped waffles, juices, coffee, muffins and hard boiled eggs. Seemed to be a nice area, felt safe. Overall very nice la Quinta.The room was nice enough, but good Lord the service is less than I've come to expect from La Quinta. They have these really nice rooms that face their lobby, but what they don't tell you is that almost every night the lobby (it's big and easily usable for parties) is rented out to anyone that might want to put some money down on a place to be as loud as possible until as late as they want. Two nights in a row now, I've asked the desk clerk (different person both times) to break up loud, alcohol-fueled (not speculation-bottles everywhere) parties, not only well after midnight, but after they'd been going on for several hours. Tonight, a desk clerk named Katherine told me, ""well sir they rented the area for a wedding reception."" Great. Thanks, Katherine. I RENTED ROOM 212 FOR THREE NIGHTS.  DOES THAT MATTER TO ANYONE?! Apparently, it doesn't. It confuses me to wonder why they'd have rooms that are basically in the lobby and allow this to go on. There are only a few (4 maybe? Less?), but they offer absolutely no retreat from tge noise of the appatently rentable lobby. Oh and on the first night, the hotel had to be evacuated for over an hour at almost 3am because of a fire alarm. The official story about it involved mechanical malfunction. If that's true, then I guess it really couldn't be helped and isn't the hotel's fault, but it was very inconvenient. Also, The proximity to the Interstate means traffic noise all day and all night.The breakfast is sub-par too. Every other  La Quinta I've stayed in for the last five or six years has had hot food items like eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, bacon, etc. For the days now this one can't be bothered for more than a half hearted, poorly stocked attempt at cereal, toast, dry muffins, and waffles. To be fair, the waffles were shaped like Texas. That was cute. I stay in La Quintas everywhere I go because they take pets and because their rewards system is great. This experience won't change that, but I'll never stay here again. This has been the least restful hotel stay I've ever endured.TL;DR-- La Quinta is great, but you should definitely skip this one.We've had mixed results staying at La Quinta before, but overall they've been decent. This room is not even decent. When we booked the room we were told we'd have a bedroom that was separate from the couch area, but when we arrived we were put into a smaller room and had to pay extra for what we were supposed to have had originally. There were long hairs hanging from the overhead light in the hallway, from the 'do not disturb' sign in our room, in our bed, and pubic hair and soap left on the shower wall. The carpets are stained throughout the room, and the ceiling was leaking, which I found out by stepping in a puddle on the floor. Just when we thought that was all, there were candles left on the rail and collecting rain outside the window, and loose pills on the shelf in the closet. Most of that stuff was found after I turned down the offer to move us to a third room so I've been told that I have to speak to the manager to ask for a refund of any sort. Spend your money elsewhere.This place is in need of a serious remodel. The reason we picked this hotel was because they 1) allowed dogs and 2) were on our way to OK and it didn't detour us.First of all, this place is pretty grungy. I didn't know there are still hotels with the option to smoke in the rooms. You can definitely tell which wings allow for smoking. So gross. The elevator smelled of gas and another patron even mentioned it after I smelled it earlier. The bed was meh. The place sufficed for one night and for our circumstances. The staff was friendly upon interaction. I will say, we called about an hour before we got there to make a reservation and it took all of three minutes. However, they never mentioned that the driveway street to their entrance was being re-paved and unable to access. At a 1:30 am arrival, it would have been nice to know because we wound up getting lost trying to find out how to enter. To the gentleman who answered the phone at 1:30 when we were lost: thank you for your courteous help and patience with us by staying on the phone with us while we found where we were. We are grateful for that! :)Total bummer that the entire highway is also under construction there so it wasn't easy navigating to get back north, even with technology today. It's not the hotels' fault but it was an inconvenience trying to get out of dodge. Hopefully these two hiccups are cured soon. If this location remodeled like another La Quinta we recently stated in, it could be a great spot to stay. The staff is friendly, they allow dogs, and eventually the highway will have a beautiful entrance ramp. If you're looking to stay at a La Quinta, I recommend inquiring if it's remodeled. It makes a huge difference of opinion.I'm visiting my kids and grandkids in FortWorth because the house is so full with 4 adults 4 kids and 3 dogs I got myself a room at the LaQuinta I got a GREAT price and it's very nice free breakfast free wifi my grandkids love the pool... The people that work there are so nice it's really made my trip great... The only downside is there's no restaurant on sight and you need a car to get to any....We have stayed at several LQs from California to Florida since the beginning of this year and this one was the nicest experience so far. The lobby was palacial compared to the others we had been to and the grounds looked akin to a summer resort. The room itself wasn't exceptional in any way but with two windows and a really nice view, it seemed more like a condo than a hotel room. It was quite comfortable. Looking for a good reason to stay another night ...Service declined. Less that LAQ standards. Elite client. This facility is not recommendedI stayed here for a the 4th of July holiday for a little mini-getaway to Fort Worth and had a great time!  We had never stayed at La Quinta before so we didn't know what to expect.  We got a really good rate and the best part is that we could bring our dog with out any sort of fees or deposits.  They just require that you sign a waiver that if anything does happen, you will be liable.  The check-in process was a little time consuming because they only had one person at the desk.  But the lady offered me a late check-out the next day without my even asking for it.  How sweet.  The room was clean and had a microwave and fridge.  It was very quiet.  The next day we went down for breakfast and it all went well.  They don't really have a full on breakfast, but they did have more than your average continental breakfast.  They had a waffle iron that you make your own Texas shaped waffles.  Pretty cool touch.  We also went to the pool which was very clean and refreshing.  They had a sign stating to ask for pool towels at the desk, I waited about 5 minutes to be told there were none.  Bummer. Not their fault..she said people may have brought the front desk towels up to their rooms after the pool.  Check-out process was just as time-consuming as the check-in because there was again only one person.  She was very sweet though so I didn't mind, the persons attitude can make or break a situation.  I will definitely be back here if we decide to stay the night in Fort Worth again!This is a fine hotel, but I'm really glad I got a discount 15% by making reservations over the phone. LaQuinta allows guests to bring pets with no deposit or extra fee so I was able to bring my dog - which was nice. My room was on the ""highway"" side though &amp; it was super LOUD. Pretty much every motorcycle, 18 wheeler or car with a muffler problem sounded like it was right outside my window. That's the main reason for the low star rating.The facility was clean and looked like it has been well taken care of and for such a low price - it was pretty good, even if I had to listen to traffic all night.I'm wrapping up a 5-day family road trip where we stayed here with a baby and 2 dogs. We got a suite for more space and were happy with that, but that's really about it. Overall this was the worst of the places we stopped (we stayed at another LQ, HIE and Hampton Inn). We love the no pet fees and there was a nice field for our dogs if you follow a path past the hotel. The room was in bad need of a makeover and the shower was gross. Our room was near stairs where I saw giant roaches more than once, but on the plus side, no bedbugs!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-fort-worth-university-fort-worth-2,SpringHill Suites Fort Worth University,3.5,$$,10,"Very polite staff, clean room, pretty quiet area next to a bank. Our uber drivers always had trouble finding it because of the weird location. They had a fridge, microwave, and basic amenities. Plenty of space for 2.I'm not sure where to begin with my review.  We stayed one night at another place far from this one. Between the limited parking and uncomfortable bed we searched for something more suitable and accommodating. After having compared it with much newer and more expensive lodging we chose Springhill Suites. We arrived Saturday night 10.31.15. The place was packed with people wearing T.C.U. apparel.  I realized our proximity to the campus was very close. We got to the counter and a very nice lady greeted us. If you have a stay here we hope you get Mrs.Shawntay at the counter.  The lady knows her job and does it with a smile.  She gave my Wife and I restaurant recommendations and I even gave her one she hadn't heard of. The few days we stayed she worked probably 3 if not 4 shifts, sometimes split shift.  My hats off to her &amp; Management if you're reading give this woman a raise in the money department.  We made it to our room and on the way noticed the wallpaper and carpet.  Different than most hotels but not terrible.  The room on the other hand was a different thing. The popcorn ceilings hit you as soon as you walk in. You notice the couch with a drab grey color.  The bathroom needs updating and our tub drained slow.  The bed......ohhh the bed. Well it's your standard hotel room King size bed.  The sheets were okay and pillows decent.  Now here's where I had an issue.  I had a bad experience in Spring, Tx june of 2012 with bed bugs. I thoroughly check walls, bedding and floors for them.  I don't want them on us or traveling to our home. When I enter a room I Immediately check for any signs of bed bugs.  You will see a video of the bed sham were it looks like it was leftover from a bed bug infestation.  I will say that we Didn't experience any bed bugs issues.  The breakfast wasn't all that great.  They seem to have served real eggs.  The Canadian Turkey bacon was horrible, waffles okay and juice decent. My Wife really liked the black tea they had. She took two more packets with her. Although by a main highway we didn't have noise issues.  We got our rest and the bed was cool.  I appreciate the free covered parking as well. We were able to park with no issues.  I hope Springhill Suites puts up 4 million to renovate because the place would benefit from it immensely.  Get showers with no tub and some new loveseats. For God sake take up the stinking carpet and put down some wood or faux wood. I might go back if we are in the area but I would hope for updates.Great service. Free suckers at check-in. Everything was great until I spotted several, either ticks or bedbugs on the couch. I'm up at 3am writing a review now because I'm afraid to lay back down and go to sleep. So if you come, don't get room 214 at least.  Ill update in the morning if I survive the night.Regretfully, management can't fix the way too close proximity of the interstate... Room is noisy from vehicle traffic and even on 3rd floor shakes when trucks go by...  Odor of mildew from the AC unit also needs to be addressed.Reasonable rates! My room was clean. Staff did a great job of meeting my needs. The breakfast is hot, fresh &amp; had numerous options. I love options. Internet was fast.We came for a conference/training with TCU and stayed for 6 nights. The room was great for two people and included a microwave and mini-fridge. There are a few restaurants within walking distance, but we preferred to explore the area. A downside to the facility is they have the smallest pool I have ever seen! Seriously- cannot do laps. The fitness center is quite small as well, but I never had to wait for any equipment. Overall, it was a great stay-quiet, clean, good breakfasts, and friendly staff.I came here for a conference for a few days, not knowing what to expect, after all this was my first time in Texas.   The staff at the front desk was very nice and checked all of us in. We weren't the only conference group that just arrived.  Two other groups of over 10 all arrived with us.  They were patient with us and every gave us recommendations of were to eat around the area.  Parking here is free if you have a rental. If the public lot is full you can use your hotel key and park in the private lot.  The rooms were clean and when I trouble with my tv, they immediately sent someone up to fix it.  There is free breakfast in the morning that usually has eggs, ham, or sausages, and other pastries.  They also have waffle and toaster maker.  My only complaint is that when i wanted to make tea the water that came out was brown. It was probably from the coffee from before.  But again, it was over 107 degrees outside, i guess i didn't need my tea.  Overall it was a great stay!I was staying here while attending the Scentsy 2011 Convention. The people at the front desk were super nice and always friendly. When walking in or out the always say hello, welcome, or bye. I've never experienced this type of pleasantry before at a hotel before. The decor in the rooms is a little outdated but still nice looking. There is a mini fridge, microwave, and tv in the rooms. Be sure to bring your swim suits as there is a small pool and jacuzzi located on the side of the building. There is even a grill next to the pool too :-) The room cleaners come pretty early so if your sleeping in make sure to put the sign on the door so they don't walk in on you naked like they did me. lolThe reason I gave this place a 4 rating and not a 5 is because of the location. There were a few taxi cab drivers that didn't even know where Springhill Suites was located making it a nightmare at times to get back.Great service.  Hotel is great for price-range, especially when booked on Priceline.  This is my hotel of choice when visiting TCU.Great highway access as well as near TCU, Zoo, Culture District, Stockyards &amp; more.  Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful when needed.  Makes for an enjoyable stay.Very nice clean rooms with a great modern color scheme. The suite was roomy and the bed was comfortable. The staff was super friendly and the rate was excellent. I'd gladly come here again. The only knock is that while it's in a very busy area it may be difficult to get to.",,,,,"['polite', 'staff', 'clean', 'room', 'pretty', 'quiet', 'area', 'next', 'bank', 'drivers', 'always',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-fort-worth-fossil-creek-fort-worth,Hilton Garden Inn Fort Worth/Fossil Creek,2.5,$$,16,"Needs upgrading big time.  I've stayed at least 20 hiltons garden inns this one is on the ""help me"" side of the fence.  Wifi does not work.  Painters and construction around the property. They think they are improving the rooms with paint... Need more improvements... Furniture, bathroom fixtures, etc Don't get me wrong, it's clean but, just paint to improve?  Hilton.... You can do better.One star because negative isn't an option.  Don't go here.  Gave away 2 of our guaranteed nonrefundable rooms that were represented as not changeable or cancelable when blooded before noon Friday AND AFTER  my son checked us in to all 3 guaranteed reserved rooms @ 9 on Saturday by calling my son @ 1115 pm to tell him to call the rest of us and tell us we couldn't come because the hotel was ""overbooked"", then called us ""crazy for expecting our other two rooms and threaten to call the police is the other guests came to the hotel on both my son in his room and those of us left stranded.  In addition my son reports the bathroom in the one room actually delivered was filthy including had urine and pubic hair on the toilet seat.  I'd skip this and any other Hilton property until the organization cleans up its rooms and its Business practices.Hot water won't heat up, shower door leaked &amp; tile entryway got soaked. Keurig was broken, could hear everything &amp; across from workout room, front door wouldn't shut, could see into room thru crack. Horrible Hilton. By road &amp; lots of noise &amp; construction. Room 142 blowsI'm honestly not one to write bad reviews but I stay at Hiltons and Hilton Garden Inns basically every week and this one was by far the worst. It's in the middle of nowhere, outdated, has a weird smell to it, the water fails to get warm, housekeeping does a poor job, and I had horrible experiences with two different members of the front desk staff. Hilton price for motel quality.Dingy old hotel in the middle of nowhere. Don't stay here unless you have too. Hotel smells like smoke and everything is in need of an update.Hotel service was AWFUL, we had to wait in line over 30minutes just to get checked in! The rooms weren't all that nice either, add in the fact that our ac wasn't working... I won't be staying here again that's for sure!Hmmmm. I don't hate it, but it's an inadequately maintained property by Hilton standards. Like most hotels with an indoor pool it suffers from poor ventilation and a general mugginess throughout. The staff is super friendly and the quiet location would be great - 5 minutes drive from downtown Ft. Worth if not for the awful highway construction. Needs updating with replacement doors, etc., not just another coat of paint.Old dated super8 quality and hilton price.  Nothing here worth 200$ a night.Great stay. We had a little trouble with breakfast one morning when they were very busy. Otherwise the breakfast was perfect. We nearly always book the bed and breakfast packages when we stay at Hilton Garden Inns, well worth it!The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was large, clean, and comfortable.Stayed here with the family for an overnight trip to FW for a funeral.  Clean rooms and friendly staff.  Breakfast was good and the lobby bar fine for a quick dinner and few beers.  Only downside is the location, it's right next to 35 in middle of an industrial/business park area.  Not that easy to get to, especially at night.  Also not much around it in the way of restaurants, etc., but it was just down the street from funeral home we were visiting.  All in all it was what I expected from a Hilton Garden Inn.Diamond member so have experience in many HGI have to rate this the worst I've stayed in.  Mold all over the shower, hair on the vanity, slow draining sink, shower handle put on so hot really means cold.  Loud housekeeping banging on doors in the a.m.  Really disappointed in the $169 I spent here really gives Hilton a bad reputation.We initially had a checking in snafu but the way their front desk staff handled it was so great! Amanda was especially helpful. They even upgraded our room and gave us free tickets to Billy Bobs. They made sure we were comfortable and we so friendly.The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was really good! All in all they made sure our stay was wonderful.Bottom Line - This hotel is NOT clean and has a funky smell to it (I think it's the lingering smell of smoke). Though the lobby looks newer or renovated, you're in for a shock once you enter your room.  Housekeeping here is on the poor side... at check-in, there was a penny on the floor next to the bed, large pieces of lint on the carpet, and long hair strands on two towels (one on a bath towel, and one on a hand towel). Also beware that the hotel's backyard is a freeway, and can get pretty loud. In 2010, I stayed in hotel rooms for 83 nights, 60 of them at Hilton properties... this makes me Diamond VIP during 2011 with HHonors. I'd say it's going to be pretty impossible to have satisfactory stays 100% of the time and you're bound to have awful experiences.... the Hilton Garden Inn Fort Worth (at 4400 North Fwy, Fort Worth, TX) is the hotel that is the unsatisfactory/awful one.The fact that there were large pieces of lint on the carpet floor (as well as a penny) tells me that housekeeping here is lazy... in my case, they did not bother to vacuum the room between guests (I can be okay with no vacuum within my stay, but even that isn't okay), and they do not inspect laundry for hair because there were strands of hair on my ""fresh"" towels! I uploaded a photo of one of these hairs, just click the link above. YUCK. I booked 3 nights in this hotel.  As I type this, I am on my 2nd night (I checked in yesterday), and have already told the desk staff that I will be checking out in the morning. I should have checked out this morning after the 1st night, but I was in a hurry and running late.  This was laziness on my part. I will be telling the hotel staff about my dissatisfaction when I check out. I also realized this afternoon that I have two small bug bites on my right hand... I can't be 100% sure they happened during my first night, but I didn't have these bites yesterday. Once I get home, my suitcase is going straight to the laundromat and my luggage is going to be vacuumed before I even go home.  *shiver*I plan to take an ambien tonight, get through the night, and get the fuck out of here and into a different hotel. I plan to cross-post this to TripAdvisor.Construction going on until June, wasn't told of this until we arrived.  Mattress needs replaced, sleep in a hole from being worn.  Employes were friendly.  Some 3rd floor rooms have been remodeled, I'm on the 2nd floor without an updated room.  They were working outside my window yesterday until 5:30PM putting stucco on the exterior of the building, quite noisy.  Front Desk told me the workers return around 9AM.  Clean hotel as far as I can tell.  Pool closed.  Diamond Hilton member.I stay here periodically and I'm always pleased.  Front desk staff is always friendly and check-in is quick.  Rooms are clean, and housekeeping staff is accommodating for extra towels, etc.  The outdoor pool is always nice, although I wish there was an outdoor spa as well as the indoor one.  Breakfast here is reasonably priced and Annette in the restaurant is the friendliest, most helpful person we've come across.. always remembers us by name.  Free wi-fi is a nice perk and the beds are SOOOO comfortable!   The location works well for us, close enough to downtown and the stockyards for a quick drive, yet far enough to be out of the traffic and noise.  I read the other reviews, but have never experienced the issues with cleanliness that some have.  No complaints and I will continue to stay here.Reasonable clean is the highest praise I can give this place. The best hotel I ever stayed at was a Hilton Garden Inn, but it was not this one... If all you need is a clean safe room for the night near the highway, there are cheaper places. If however you are looking for something more look elsewhere as well. No free breakfast, coffee or tea, fruit, or any of the other bonuses you can usually expect from comparably priced hotels.",,,,,"['needs', 'upgrading', 'big', 'time', 'least', 'garden', 'inns',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-dfw-west-hurst-hurst,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Dfw West - Hurst,4.5,$$,14,"When I think of a Holiday Inn, the first thing that comes to mind is a cheap subpar hotel.  This was definitely not the case for this hotel.  I stayed here for 2 nights during a conference that was being held nearby at the Hurst Conference Center.  The great thing about this hotel was the quality of the room and the proximity near the conference center.Upon entering the room, I noticed how spacious the room was.  Our room contained two beds, TV, microwave, coffee maker, ice bucket, and a fridge.  Each bed contained a faux down comforter with four pillows: two firm and two soft pillows.  There were enough plugs to charge your electronic devices.  The bathroom had a modern feel with a large sink and bath tub/shower.  The room and bathroom were very clean with plenty of towels.   Along with the comfortable rooms, they offered free happy hour and breakfast in the morning.  Most cheaper name hotels only a continental breakfast, this was definitely not the case.  After enjoying a workout in their fitness center, I was pleasantly surprised to find hot breakfast with healthy options, such as turkey sausage.  They have breakfast options for everyone's preferences from the traditional cereal and oatmeal all the way to a pancake maker. The FREE happy hour was impressive.  Their happy hour offers a selection of local and domestic beers with horderves.  This happy hour was located in their dining room area and was popular among the individuals staying in this hotel.  Do not pass up this opportunity to enjoy good conversation among individuals while enjoying a beverage with finger foods.I would stay at this hotel again.  I was pleasantly surprised how I enjoyed my stay here better than some Marriott or Hilton hotels.Did not stay here for lodging - but came here for a small 3-day training seminar. Although there was construction going on at the front lobby (guests had to use the side doors), it was clearly marked and the noise was kept to a minimum.  Our conference room was located pretty close to the construction, yet we never heard a sound.  Because the three-day seminar, occurred all day.  I wanted to comment on parking and breakfast.Outside the lobby, there is a table seating area for guests to meet or eat.  In the morning hours, they serve breakfast, which includes pancakes (that are made by a conveyor belt machine - which was pretty cool, BTW), biscuits and gravy, sausage, eggs, delicious and magnificent cinnamon rolls that compare to Cinnabun. I would just eat one pancake and with the cinnamon roll instead of using syrup.  They also offered muffins and other pastries, which I did not partake because the cinnamon rolls is what I spent all my morning calories on.  The rolls are kept under a heating lamp, so they are kept warm and never get hard.  The air conditioning worked great too, although a couple of guests said the AC units were really loud, but I love the white noise of a AC unit, so it would have been just fine for me. The parking was abundant and easy to navigate.  There were plenty of shade during those hot summer months when it makes a world of difference parking under a tree.  If I wasn't staying with family during the training seminar, I would have definitely stayed here.Wow.  I never give 5 stars.For $105 I got free shuttle,  to/from DFW.Wine bar / breakfast with protein / ...and Very new and clean roomThe place was immaculate.I'm from Vermont and I can tell you this room would be $350/NIGHT in VT.  Wow. ...Got stuck next to the elevator and it is LOUD. We can hear all of the mechanical and electrical sounds in the room... we can even hear the elevator ding when it arrives on the floor. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. And, the staff won't move us because they are sold out... even though priceline shows 3 available rooms... understandable. What I cant understand is that this is a newer hotel and the sound proofing is non-existent. Totally dissatisfied with this hotel.We booked 6 rooms for 3 nights at this location. The staff was so nice &amp; accommodating. The rooms were clean &amp; the beds very comfortable. Housekeeping was amazing &amp; friendly. The hotel is in a great location - right across from the police station, so there is a great sense of security. It is also close to plenty of great restaurants &amp; shopping. We were not disappointed  with anything!The hotel and staff are great.  I had a VERY clean room(not just the synthetic cleaner smell either).  The hotel was quiet during my stay and the beds was good.  I don't expect it to feel like home for me, but I do appreciate a good bed. Breakfast is the typical HIE fare, and was as expected. I missed the evening reception, but those are always welcomed when I see them. My only negative here is the internet is pathetically slow. Worse than dial up. I travel a lot for work and depend on being able to work in the room, but this is bad.  I even moved around the building looking like a creeper to find somewhere that I could send an email from.  Now I know why the Starbucks down the street was packed. If the Internet worked great(and there is no reason a hotel should be bandwidth limited) I'd give this a 5 star rating.  I actually struggled to give it 4 solely because of the wifi.Great experience!  Doesn't get much better than this for a hotel around $100 a night.  Clean, courteous staff, great lobby, etc.  Only negative is there is so much construction on the freeway.  However, that's not the hotels fault.  I'll continue to stay here when I'm on business in this area of DFW.I opted to stay here for business after reading some of the other reviews here and on Yelp. It is a few minutes away from other Holiday Inn Expresses, but looks to be so much better. The breakfast bar area was pretty nice and clean and quiet, and the food was pretty good. The staff were nice, the rooms were clean and pretty modern. The TV channel selection was huge compared to others I've seen recently. The only concern I had was that the police station or hospital that were nearby would keep me up/be noisy, but it wasn't an issue.Overall, if you are in the area, definately consider this property. Although I didn't go into the other Holiday Inn Express right up the road towards the airport in Bedford, I would discourage people from staying there for now as there is massive construction going on.Only reason this isn't 5 stars is that it isn't a resort hotel on a beach somewhere ;) PS If you stay here, go to BJ's Brewhouse about a mile away. Great beer selection, great service, and the food was good.Great hotel and a good value. Well appointed and in like new shape.  You usually get what you pay for when staying at a hotel but this one gives you more.This place is awesome, next time I get stranded in Dallas waiting on a flight of North and their airports are iced/snowed in I'm coming back here!!! They sent a shovel out for me once I arrive the room was ready to go, great looking room clean smell great looked excellent also from 5 to 7 is their happy hour had plenty of food and beer available. Staff very courteous driver excellent. The pool and hot to of were great as well hit the spot stayed open until 11 PM.I will definitely and I do mean definitely stay here any time... Maybe when NASCAR comes back this year is not that far away from the track.In town for family visit, usually stay a couple doors down, but they were booked, so we got in here.  Our history with Holiday Inn Express in other towns has always been good, so we didn't expect this stay to be any different.  From the moment we walked into the hotel, we knew it would be different! First, I'll start with the interior, very beautiful, clean, staff friendly and courteous.  Our room was spacious, clean, and very nicely decorated.  We had so much room to spread out and after being on vacation for a few more days, this extra space was nice.  Our bathroom had no tub, but then who usually takes a bath on vacation?  The amenities were also very nice, the breakfast bar served both hot and cold items, the pastries were fresh and delicious, the coffee per my husbands comments, was better than most.We didn't swim, but took a look at pool, it was indoors, and completely empty, and although the temps in town during our stay were warm enough for swimming, we just didn't have time.We got clean towels and toiletries daily, however, my husband spilled some potato chips on the floor, tried to clean it up best he could, and we noticed on day three they didn't run the vacuum, as the broken chips could still be seen on the floor. With the location of my family close by, this seems a good location to stay for future trips, and I feel was a ""nicer"" hotel compared to our previous stay up the street, and so with our future visits, I do believe we'll be back!I stay in a ton of business hotels and travel to DFW often.  If you find yourself near Hurst, this Holiday Inn just cant be beat.  The staff is friendly. The hotel is beautiful and the managers reception every evening is top notch.  Wireless internet is fast.  Its nice to find hotel management that still understands the importance of first rate customer service.  Bravo!Just checked in and am very impressed with cleanliness on the whole place.  Looks brand new.  Rooms are spacious.  Beautiful lobby, business center.  Indoor pool that closes at 10pm.  One problem- had to have keys ""rekeyed"" several times.  Would open door fine- then wouldn't.  Weird.  May be an isolated problem.As a priority club member, I've seen a few Holiday Inn's.  This one is one of the best I've seen. This place was impressive, lobby was clean, very up to date with beautiful decor, very very high ceilings with custom curtains to the top, wall covered dark wood fireplace with huge tv mantel and sitting area, also adjacent to the sitting area are these huge wooden glass doors leading to what looked like a library business sitting area.  Just seems accomodating for travelers that have to stay longer than the norm. The room was nice, shower was beautiful for a Holiday Inn, tile work and walk around shower feature was wonderful.  Tile work was also seen in pool area, hot tub was great, and rock flooring and decor was inviting.  Business office worked well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the breakfast, could've been a lot better, would rather go somewhere and pay for breakfast. Biscuits were hard as a rock, eggs had no flavor...that's with it being an ""omelet?"", sausage was cold...just not good.  The area is great with it's wonderful mall, huge theatre, cheap gas, and restaurants...speaking of...Sweet Basil Thai Cuisine is absolutely a must!!  Ate there both nights we were in town, and ordered some for the trip home the next day.  That good!",,,,,"['think', 'holiday', 'inn', 'first', 'thing', 'comes', 'mind', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'definitely', 'case', 'hotel', 'nights', 'conference', 'held', 'nearby', 'conference', 'center',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-fort-worth-3,Hilton Garden Inn,4.5,$$,24,"Probably the best hotel experience I've had in a long time. Great facilities, but the staff is what makes it great. Perfect place for kids, breakfast is great, location is perfect. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.My boyfriend and I stayed here for a couple of days for a business trip this past weekend and I promised him that I would write a good review once we got back. Overall we both had a pleasant experience. The hotel is nicely furnished and well kept, but still had a casual vibe and did not feel the least bit stuffy or pretentious. The people at the front desk were super nice and helpful. We stopped by the hotel bar at one point, which was pretty decent. The cocktail list was fairly short. My appletini was alright, but the bartender was nice and friendly, so you can't go wrong there. We ordered room service for food once. It was convenient, but in my opinion lacked options. My 7 in. pizza was pretty good, but my boyfriend wasn't blown away with his chicken fried steak. I guess the menu is a hit or miss. I definitely recommend walking to the Torchy's that is literally right next door since we are both familiar with the chain and know that it would be great no matter what. Anyways...I'm used to having mediocre experiences with hotels, so our stay here was almost like a breath of fresh air. The service was great overall and we had a very comfortable stay with nothing to really complain about. It seemed to be in a good area as well. I would be happy to return in the future.4 stars in relation to hotels of similar brand and prices.  (Not talking the Four Seasons here.) Just a couple of little things kept it from being a 5/5.So, you need a place to stay in Ft Worth?  A place with easy check-ins, a couple of walkable places to eat, a decent lobby with a bar, and a kickin'-A indoor pool for your kiddos? THIS IS THE PLACE.Staff: super friendlyCheck in: super easy (online)Check out: easy, but they didn't have luggage carts available. They were all in use, and they had no idea when they would return downstairs. This was hard on us since we had a baby with all sorts of baby stuffRooms:  Merely decent. Nothing special about the rooms. The shower was nice.Pool: looked awesome. Indoor!Nearby: plenty of parking in an adjacent garage. A Torchy's Tacos was adjacent as well, that has a bar and is open early for breakfast tacos. AWESOME.Highway Access: super easy to get back on I-30. We had easy drives to Shady Oaks Country Club and Joe T. Garcia's.The elevators stopped working properly while we were there, but they had elevator repairmen out first thing on a Sunday morning. This property is well-managed.This is our new place to stay in Ft. Worth. We thought it was a very decent value!Nice place.  Room was comfortable &amp; clean.  The food was so-so, but the coffee was good in the morning.  I ate a hamburger there and it was nothing special - but it did the job to sasiate my hunger.I can only comment on banquet facilities.The hotel is conveniently located near downtown in the western part of the Hospital district. I like that fact that's it's away from the downtown traffic and they provide free parking.The room was very nice, the light was a little dark but maybe that could have been adjusted if we would have asked.The lunch was actually really good and the special touch of the edible flower on top made for a pleasant experience. The wait staff was very attentive and our luncheon was very successful. I'm""m sure we will be returning to this hotel next.Not a bad place. Not a bad place, indeed. As what I could imagine to be a popular spot for parents and visitors coming in to visit TCU students, it serves as a convenient hotel for that kind of trip. Located close enough to TCU and all the action on Magnolia street - it was definitely the place for us lovely Yelp ladies to enjoy our time in Funky Town. It has all the necessities, except complimentary breakfast, but is definitely doable for a quick personal or business trip. With free coffee in the lobby all day long, I knew I was in for a good visit to fuel my late night work hours. Plus, the staff was nice and even willing to extend the breakfast just a little longer for my late-rising self. The rooms were spacious and the beds were comfy. The pillow situation was definitely interesting as there were four tiny pillows rather than two over-sized pillows. I almost enjoyed it more as I could make a whole pillow wall to sleep against. Free wifi for guests was a perk and the speediness made it even more attractive. The showers would be my only gripe as the was no water pressure and not the best toiletries. All in all, Hilton Garden Inn made my Fort Worth trip a successful one!I highly recommend staying at this hotel or just stopping in to meet some of the nicest people! I was staying at the hotel next door and wanted a drink which my hotel didn't offer so I went here. I was greeted by the nicest hostess and server at the restaurant bar. They had nothing but kind things to say and I was having so much fun talking and laughing with them that I told them I would visit them again the next night. The next night not only did I have a grand time I met the best chef, bartender, guest service staff etc... They even went out of the way to help me with printing and scanning things for my work. The food was also delicious, made fresh in no time! I will be visiting them all again tonight because I consider them my friends. Also the hotel itself is kept in immaculate condition and located just 3 minutes away from downtown Fort Worth.I loved my stay here and hope to return soon. My room was filled with art highlighting Fort Worth landmarks. The bed was great and top notch staff. The landscaping was also very welcoming. I highly recommend this place. Clean and quiet. Every staff person I encountered was friendly and the ambiance of the entire hotel was relaxing.Our home away from home when visiting Fort Worth. While the husband attends to business, I shop and do errands and this hotel is convenient for what we need to do. Clean, comfortable rooms with full bar and restaurant with a great menu. Breakfast is fantastic with cook to order eggs, Starbucks coffee and the works. Convenient to the medical center and the zoo. Give it a try!!!I got to experience Hilton Garden Inn while in the area on business, and I was pleasantly surprised. I tend to prefer boutique hotels. And though the rooms were simple, they were clean and the lobby had enough personality to win me over. It's huge and they have a great downstairs restaurant and full bar. Work station, indoor swimming pool and fitness center amenities are offered. Best of all, it's in a great location. Just minutes from the vibrant TCU campus, there are loads of restaurants, museums and other great local businesses in the area. Parking is free and there is a Torchy's connected next door if you're not in the mood to drive around. Best of all, the staff was very friendly and hospitable. This hotel is a fitting choice if you happen to be in search of quality on an reasonable budget in a desirable area of Fort Worth.This hotel is so awesome. The food is spectacular and the service is amazing. They are always asking how they can make my stay better. I'm currently enjoying the Chicken Fried Steak in my room and WOW. I would highly recommend this hotel. Love it.We had never stayed at a Hilton Garden Inn before and decided to give this one a shot since it is close to Baylor Medical Center and John Peter Smith Hospital. Check in was easy and fast, room was very clean and bed and pillows are very comfortable, free parking in the garage across the street, happy hour drink specials between 5-7pm, takes only minutes to walk to Torchy's Taco's or Jason's Deli. There is a nice patio outside with a fire pit. Also has a business center and the lobby is nice to relax in (lounge chairs, sofas, fireplace). There is an awesome indoor pool for anyone with kids - basketball hoop in the pool and play structures. I didn't see any kids or even families during our two nights here - mostly single and group business travelers and couples. Our room was quiet and the shades kept it dark so I could sleep in. There is breakfast and coffee served in the lobby in the mornings but you do have to pay for it. Water and tea are complimentary throughout the day, self served on a table near the entrance which is nice due to the Texas heat! This hotel is also a 5 min car ride to downtown Fort Worth and Sundance Square and close to the interstates as well. There is no shuttle here but we rented a car so not a big deal for us. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again.We had a fantastic stay here on a venture to Live Oak to see some bands we like, and didn't want to make the long drive home.  I was initially a little annoyed at the front desk service - one poor guy alone at the time we checked in around 5 - because he was giving such individual service to each person, so I had to wait to check in when we had a show to get to!  Then I realized how incredibly patient this young man was, dealing with a language barrier by taking the extra time to show a customer around so he wouldn't get lost.  Wow.  The hotel was just fine, but that level of caring customer focus won me over immediately!  The same guy and another employee at the desk were just as perky and caring the next day as we were checking out, so it wasn't a fluke.  Wi-Fi didn't work for us, but we weren't there to work, so it wasn't a deal breaker for us.  The rooms are clean, comfy, quiet, have a new feel to them and some really nice local photography on the room walls.  We didn't do breakfast or anything there, but it was crowded and folks looked happy with it.I stayed at this hotel for 1 night for a business trip to Fort Worth. The hotel is clean and new and the front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. The room was comfortable albeit unremarkable, and I appreciated the Keurig coffee maker in the room versus the usual in-room coffee maker that makes completely undrinkable coffee. The restaurant was unimpressive and I would avoid it for anything but the breakfast buffet ($9.95). There is a full bar in the hotel. On the bright side, the wait staff were friendly and helpful.I am not sure I would stay here again.I love this hotel. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are very new smelling (odd, I know, to say this), the internet always works, and it's not too loud. It's nice that there's a Torchy's right downstairs as well. The fitness room is also very nice (Precor machines). I like to stay here over a lot of other places in Fort Worth.Good buffet breakfast reasonably priced. Problem is that the hotel does not clean the snow and ice in front of the entrance and keeps a dangerous condition to exist. I even offered to buy a shovel but 3 days later, still no action. Very disappointing for a HiltonAlways an exceptional experience. Great staff. Great location (for my needs).Awesome hotel! My coworker and I stayed here during a four day training class downtown and we were both very happy with our stay. The hotel is conveniently located right next to I-30, about a 5 minute drive (if that!) from downtown Fort Worth. The hotel is very clean and well kept, with super friendly and helpful staff. Our room (we had two queen beds and shared a room) was very clean and even the hallway smelled nice (you know... sometimes the hallway smells like smoke). They have complimentary coffee and tea all day by the check-in desk. There was plenty of parking in a free garage right across the hotel driveway. The breakfast is not free, but you can get pretty much anything other than made to order items for $4. Not bad for muffins (which were really quite good), cereal, several varieties of fruit, hardboiled eggs, juice, milk, coffee, toast, bagels, etc. And after one particularly long/stressful day, my coworker and I ordered beers at the bar and then sat over in a more ""secluded"" area by the fireplace and enjoyed the quiet. We even hit up the pool/hot tub one evening and were entertained by all the fun/kid stuff they had in the pool (a whale that spouted water, water flowing from pipes that could be manipulated and played with, etc). Without a doubt, I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone! Great location, friendly staff, clean and quiet hotel!I travel a lot and the best hotels for my long stays are Hilton Garden Inn because they offer everything I need (laundry room, restaurant, quiet, clean and friendly staff). This hotel was great, all the staff knew me by first name, always very friendly and in a great mood. The chefs knew how I like my dinner and always made sure I was satisfy, the bartender always remember my drink and of the rest guest. Chef Mike always made an effort to check in with the guest and make sure that their meal was good and if they needed something.  If I go back to the area, I would stay here in a heart beat. The only con is that it was build in a weird position and didn't have parking on the sides, so in order to come into the hotel after parking you had to cross the lobby. Sometimes I like to stay under the radar.Stayed here 11-14-14. Very clean well appointed room. Very quiet. Nice polite service oriented staff. Beautiful lobby with complimentary beverages. Good parking in adjacent free garage. Easy access to medical center.","Nice rooms and super friendly service. First time in Fort Worth and it was for my birthday so all the hotel employees signed a birthday card for me and gave me a goody bag with treats! Super super nice! Definitely recommend!Nice rooms and great customer serviceRoom was very nice.  For a newer hotel, this was great.  The king bed in the room was comfy, plenty of pillows and a very nice TV.  The hotel offers coffee and tea all day in a little bar area by the front desk.  They do have a restaurant on premise and the breakfast I had there was pretty good.  The buffet hit the spot.  If you want a little lower priced hotel that is not far from downtown, I recommend staying here!The hotel has been open since April 2012, super friendly staff at checking in and at breakfast, the rooms were very very clean and comfortable, equipped with microwave, fridge and coffeemaker, nice large flat screen TV, very comfortable bed &amp; linen. The lobby is very nice and comfortable, breakfast was delicious! Made to order omelettes and waffles and all the other items available definitely exceeded our expectations. Shops, restaurants, popular venues are just a short drive away. One of our favorites now! Large beautiful indoor pool area and very nice gym with modern equipment, treadmills each have their own individual TV screen attached. Will definitely come back!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-fort-worth-university-fort-worth,Courtyard Fort Worth University,3.5,$$,12,"Super cleanA little pricy for what you getLandscaping was perfectNice employeesThe rooms were comfortableBathrooms very cleanHotel is in a good location for some posh shopping.  Room is clean and nicely decorated.  First floor rooms have a sliding glass door out to parking lot.  However, there is a loud train that goes by a couple of times a day.  Not a fan.  Also, my bed squeaks on my side.  The toilet seat is a cheap plastic and practically falls off when you sit on it.  Shower is small but water pressure is good.  Not my favorite Marriott because of the train.  Good location though for some great shopping and restaurants.  We would've stayed here longer if they were pet friendly.The Bistro is overpriced. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Initially were put in a west room on level 2. We had to change rooms the second night due to the loud noises from the train switching yard that is located behind the hotel. The drink prices at the bistro are outrageous. Expect to pay $10.00 or more per drink. Domestic bottle beer was $5.50. Double Crown and Pepsi was $23.00. Food prices are average. The hotel and room was clean and the bed was comfortable as always with Marriott.Pleasant stay for a wedding, a little pricy but I suppose it's justified.1) Prime location - close to TCU, museums, and the zoo!2) The lobby is spacious/modern and the front desk lady had great customer service - she even provided some us with some local Fort Worth history.3) The pool was nice - lots of towels, plenty of chairs and tables, and it was surprisingly cool considering how hot it is in Texas.4) The rooms were fine, there's free wifi and the bathroom was big but could've used some upgrades.6 people waiting 20 minutes and only 1 person running the front desk and servinfg at the kitchen too.  Poor lady doing everything.  Although it was during the TCU vs. KANSAS game.  They need a new Management team.Room was nice enough and clean with a good location.Not gonna lie, prolly one of the nicer Courtyards I've stayed at. For some reason, I always feel like these are dodgy hotels....but alas I have been proven wrong. Yay. The lobby area looks like it just went under some MAJOR renovations. The check in desk is sleek and the people are so friendly. The little lobby sitting area has great big couches and a flat screen with scrolling news, weather and traffic. Very handy for the out of towners that don't know there way around. You can also park your car near your room, since its only a 2 floor hotel and you can enter from many different parts. I like this. I don't need to be walking around the hotel late at night after my nightgames....errr parties...err dinner. They have a happy hour in their lounge and a complimentary breakfast every day. Now, this is a plus....they have a 24 hr convenience store right inside! No kidding!!! I think my man-piece made besties with the guy working since he was down there getting munchies at 2am both nights. Le sigh. The rooms are spacious and the bed was surprisingly comfy. The room came with a couch, mini fridge, microwave and a desk with internet connections. The bathroom was large and very clean. The only downside, which I think is common in most hotels, was the shower itself. Ugh, no water pressure, the water literally comes dripping out and trying to wash my hair was such a nightmare. Why can't hotels just man up and pressurize that shizz. It's for the better, trust. Upon checkout, I was waiting for a woman who was on the phone (I don't mind waiting) and a guy comes around the corner and goes ""Oh I'm so sorry you've been waiting!"" I mean borderline freakout...hilarious. I laughed and said it was no big deal, just wanted to check out. Took maybe 2 minutes and I was on my way. Well done Courtyard. Sweet dreams.The room was clean and the staff was nice but it is not my first choice when staying in Fort Worth. They do not have an elevator and thus if you are staying on the second floor you will have to carry your heavy suitcases upstairs.No free breakfasts.Let me preface this by stating that I did not stay here overnight, I came here 4 days in a row for my Kaplan NCLEX class in their meeting room. Otherwise, I'd definitely give them 5 stars. The service was friendly from the front desk staff to the coffee shop/breakfast bar service person. I really liked how they have the small breakfast restaurant inside their lobby so you could stop by for a quick breakfast before leaving (or in my case, going in). Free coffee is provided for guests. There are two computers and a printer free for everyone to use, and another computer linked to a printer to print out boarding passes for the airport. The hotel really gave us great service. Free water pitchers were provided for us every day and they gave us pens and notepads daily as well. The meeting room was clean and a staff member was on hand to assist my instructor in carrying her items and in any technical issues she had. Location-wise, it's on University and you can walk to Panera and Hoffbrau steak from the hotel. There's a shopping center less than 5 minutes away driving.One of the more poorly managed in the Marriott system. I've 80,000 points in my Marriott account, so I've had some very good experiences with Courtyard as a value play. But the housekeeping, the poor sanitation standards of the kitchen, and general management really ruins the overall nice look of the place. They seem to have way too many ""chiefs and not enough indians""--at night they had one person running the whole hotel--no manager on duty, no housekeeper on duty (room was not clean), no engineer when things didn't work, no phone operator, just one person. No bell assistance, but plenty of managers go to lunch for two hours. No way to get any decent service.  And NO elevator. They just fired some of the supervisory offenders, so I may try again in the future, because they are very close to TCU campus, but a terrible representation of how any Marriott should be managed. Enough to send me back to Hilton, and I really enjoy most of my Marriott stays.Plenty nice enough if you are traveling on business. My room was clean and the lighting was great. Free wifi was a snap and the little cafe in the lobby convenient. I walked to the TCU campus to save the hassle of a cab. If ever back in the area, I would stay again.If your companies paying, go to the Hilton unless you like small gyms and the soothing sounds of freight trains in the middle of the night.Keep in mind my review is for a business trip paid for by my company with food expenses so my expectations are bit different than the regular traveler.I was here for a week long stay and booked a single king bed suite.  There are a few decent restaurants nearby as well as the TCU campus.  The lobby here has been remodeled recently and is the highlight of the complex.  It has a modern look with a lot of lounging area, a small bistro bar, and several TVs scattered around.  A cool little hangout for those that don't have time to venture out too far or just want to get out of the room for a few.  The lobby also has free to use PCs with printers, wifi access, newspapers, and a 24hr mini mart for a late night snack or those items you forgot to pack.  Past the lobby however everything steps back about 20 years.  The rooms have been touched up a bit with new decor and a couple upgrades just not the full on remodel the lobby received.  The room was clean and had all the necessities for a business traveler.  Cable TV, comfy bed, desk with chair, couch, network access, alarm clock, ample lighting, coffee pot with comp coffee, mini fridge, etc.  The bathroom was clean, spacious, and water pressure was good.  I found it difficult however to get a good sleep for two reasons.  First, the AC I found to be a tad bit loud when it cycles on and off.  However, if that doesn't wake you the nightly 2am train that rolls by will.  The train is not right next to the hotel but its close by and woke me up every night with its damn horn.  I've been told from some other coworkers that they experienced the same issue when they stayed here.  I suggest asking for a room on the side of the hotel away from the train.  For those looking to get their workout in while on travel, the gym here is 24hrs.  The equipment is fairly new with TVs, adjustable AC, towels, sanitizing items, disposable earphones, and a water cooler.  However the whole thing is tiny.  There is exactly one treadmill, one elliptical, one stationary bike, one adjustable bench, and one set of dumbells that only go from 5-50 lbs.  There's no open space either for any kind of free form exercise.  The adjustable bench is terrible with a large gap between the seat and back.  If all you do is the cardio machines you will be alright as long as no ones on your machine.  If you want to lift weights you better get creative and again hope your the only one planning on lifting.   The best thing I experienced here is the breakfast at the bistro bar.  They serve a full menu of starbucks coffee here including espresso drinks which was convenient for me.  The oatmeal with nuts and dried cranberries was also delicious.  It was a very nice and convenient way to start my morning.  The lobby also offers complimentary coffee in the morning but I prefer espresso.  If it wasn't for the train and inadequate gym, the hotel would be decent.  However, my previous trip I stayed at the Hilton for the same rate and it was much, much more luxurious and in the heart of downtown Fort Worth.Was pleasantly surprised! Nice room, pool and hot tub, continental breakfast, and really close to the zoo. I would for sure recommend.",,,,,"['super', 'little', 'rooms', 'good', 'location', 'posh', 'shopping', 'room', 'clean', 'nicely', 'decorated', 'first', 'floor', 'rooms', 'sliding', 'glass', 'door',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/rosen-house-inn-fort-worth-2,Rosen House Inn,5.0,$$,14,"The Rosen Inn is a wonderful bed and breakfast. Great room, good food, and warm inn keeper. Would definitely recommend to everyone.   They accommodated our dietary needs with a delicious breakfast. They left cupcakes and a bottle of wine in our room and homemade bath salts to use. The bed was warm and comfy with lots of fun antique items all throughout the house. The house is in a great location, close to lots of restaurants.Hubby and I stayed here Friday and Saturday night as we were attending a wedding in downtown Fort Worth.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the two delightful ladies AND the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.  We also met the puppy, Chloe and the neighborhood kitty, who I dubbed Orange Kitty because I forgot his name.The house is beautifully decorated and guests have full run of the downstairs rooms, including the one with recliners and the amazing old typewriter office room!Three guest rooms are located up the creaky stairs, along with a fridge with sodas and waters, a K-cup coffee machine and snacks, including popcorn.  They thoughtfully included a microwave in this area, so it's an amazing perk.We had breakfast both days and my fave was the eggs Benedict.  Hubby doesn't eat meat, so they dressed his with spinach and tomatoes.  We ate every last bite and left two happy pandas!On Saturday evening, hubby and I visited the pool and just quietly paddled around, enjoying the unseasonably pleasant Texas weather.  Another wonderful touch is the basket of pool towels and sunscreen!Such a relaxing place, so very close to the happenings of downtown and Sundance Square.  It was about $8 for the two of us to take Uber from the YWCA to our quiet hideaway, which makes this an even greater bargain!My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend.  It was beyond our expectations. Kelly was extremely welcoming and wonderful. Breakfast was amazing, and when she noticed I didn't eat because I didn't like a dish she whipped me up a new one. She made us chocolate covered strawberries which were yummy, and left us a bottle of wine in our room.  The room itself was very cozy, we had our own private bathroom, cable, and wifi.  We will be coming back for future celebrations.I enjoyed the stay it had a very comfortable bed and love the breakfast and it was very romantic with my guest.I will back hopefully soon.Very pretty B&amp;B, nicely traditional decorations (but without a chintz overload). Comfortable room, lovely breakfast, and friendly owner/manager folks. Located in a neighborhood that's almost completely made the transition to renovated, with lots of local restaurants nearby. Very close to both museums and the stockyards. The house itself needs some updates - it's 100+ years old and some stuff is broken (faucet, latch, floors so squeaky they woke us up). So treat it as an excursion into the past and not a luxe modern hotel. But it's a fun way to stay in the midst of a very cool, non-touristy area. We'd stay again, for sure!Beautiful old home renovated to host a small number of guests.  Breakfast daily was perfect, served in the main dining room.  It was nice to chat with the few others that were staying there each day.  The one day that I had to leave early (~530am), there was a packed breakfast for me waiting outside my door!  The location is also a plus, just a 5 minute walk from lots of eats/drinks along Magnolia street.  Also, on my short jogs in the afternoons, it was easy to reach the TCU campus and the Trinity trail to sight-see.This is the quintessential bed and breakfast. The owners are sweet and go above and beyond for their guests. The location is convenient, yet tucked in a quiet neighborhood. My friend who was getting married, invited the bridesmaids to join her for breakfast the day of her wedding. The owner generously served breakfast to all of the bridesmaids, even though we didn't stay the night. Next time my husband and I are in Ft. Worth, we want to stay here!We stayed there around Christmas time and the house was all decked out for the holidays! The little touches around the room and around the house made it feel so homey and welcoming. Kelly made a wonderful breakfast! She even heard that we were looking to move to the area and she called around to help us find apartments! This was above-and-beyond kindness and we really appreciated her making us feel welcome, not only to the inn, but to the city.This was my first time staying in a B &amp; B and I'm afraid I just wont be able to go back to hotels/motels.  Everything was top notch which has been stated in other reviews, we stayed in the Fairmont Suite and the mattress was amazing as was the bathroom.  We really enjoyed the pool and conversation with our host, we felt like we were staying with friends.  Kelly's breakfast was amazing, makes me wonder what she could do with other meals!!  We loved this place, I want to come back soon and I want to bring my friends and family.  If your in Ft. Worth then you simply have to stay here!  If you don't have a reason to be in Ft. Worth the Rosen House Inn is a really good reason to make the trip!!Fort Worth's Fairmount neighborhood has a good number of stately turn-of-the (20th) century homes, making it one of the more charming residential areas in Tarrant County. If you're not already lucky enough to live here in a home of your own, then the Rosen House Inn is the next best place to stay.This circa 1910 well-to-do home turned bed-and-breakfast has been extensively restored to something very close to its original splendor and the owners have taken great pains to create a space that very much occupies a specific place and time. The living spaces and dining areas on the ground floor have all been finished and decorated to recall its original 1900s character, while the guestrooms upstairs have been furnished to continue the historic narrative.And while all the hospitality accoutrements might be vintage, the important stuff is up to date, meaning your wi-fi, bathroom plumbing, flat screen TVs and mattresses are all up to your 21st century standards of living. Guests arriving with cars will appreciate the private parking. A pool is available for cooling off during the unbearable Texas summer months and the generous front and back porches are great for relaxing during cooler days. Reserve a stay in the Fairmount Suite if you can, its sprawling bed and cavernous bathroom are well worth whatever you'd pay for a comparable room downtown.Breakfast is served daily by the owner's mother, Deb, and chief innkeeper/owner Kelly is quick to welcome and make sure all your needs are met.To be sure, it comes with the usual old-building tics - thin walls and creaky floors - and the surrounding Fairmount neighborhood is still a few years away from being totally cleaned up. But this Inn is so well put-together, you're likely to be so taken with its restored glory you won't be paying attention to anything else.The Rosen House is a one-of-a-kind historic experience and deserves to be considered by anyone travelling through the great city of Fort Worth.Beautiful rooms, great care, and delicious breakfast. We stayed a night there. It was very comfortable, and we had much more available than expected. Breakfast was yummy eggs Benedict. The tea was great. Kelly and Deb are wonderful hostesses. We will be back. Whether they like it or not.This is a wonderful B&amp;B. Breakfast were so good. The accommodations were very comfortable. There was a refrigerator always stocked with bottled water and assorted beverages. Great hospitality. Will stay here again!A lovely bed and breakfast.  Great location near magnolia street. Walking distance to cat city grille ( great dinner with a groupon).  The inn was extremely friendly and comfortable.  Our room was perfect.  Everything was very clean.  The breakfast was delicious.  French toast with   croissants, multiple types of syrups, potatoes and bacon...along with yogurt and fruit.  The wine in our room topped off a lovely visit...definitely would go back!This is a new B&amp;B venture for Kelly and they seem to have started off well. Opened in December 2011, I believe Kelly said. While a little cool just yet to take a dip they have a rather nice pool which is somewhat unique for B&amp;Bs as a whole, certainly for Fort Worth. They also offer gated parking which is a very nice alternative to street parking. Moat of the rooms have been renovated after a fire a couple of years ago, prior to Kelly's ownership I believe. Yet they've maintained the look of an historic home. Breakfast was a quite a treat - Eggs Benedict and potato hash. That was a another little surprise and a very pleasant alternative to the typical B&amp;B fare of quiche. Magnolia St (or Ave, maybe) is about four blocks away so easily walkable. Lots of restaurants there. Also only a few blocks from Esparanza's (associated with Joe T. Garcia's - see my review on them). When Arts Goggle is going on this is a very convenient location to walk to the event. Highly recommend the place - Go support Kelly's dream!",,,,,"['inn', 'wonderful', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'great', 'room', 'good', 'food', 'warm', 'inn', 'keeper', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'everyone',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/booger-reds-restaurant-fort-worth,Booger Red's Restaurant,4.0,$$$,12,"We went here on accident and it was amazing!THIS IS THE PLACE TO DRINK IN TEXAS!We go to the Dallas Cowboys Stadium every year to see a game and it is now a tradition to stop here to drink.We are fans of tequila and their selection of  tequila is HUGE! They make their own pepper margarita (Anita Rita) that is sooooooo good!The bartenders are always well educated and extremely helpful.The bar is nice and a fun atmosphere to drink in.I guarantee the Best Margaritas in the World!Excellent BBQ Ribs and sausage!  Never expected the food to be this good.   The ribs were fall off the bone with a great smoked taste.  The baked beans were delicious with meat and sweet onions in them.  Corn was roasted and very tasty.Food is fresh &amp; well flavored. Atmosphere is fun &amp; as Texan as it gets. Service is hurried &amp; curt. Would def returnA good 'ol western bar and grill right in the middle of the Stockyards. The decor is, well, look at my pictures haha.  It's very well themed.  Every third bar stool is a saddle- not much for comfort but they do make a good photo op. They have a couple fruit infused tequilas- which I highly recommend! I got a margarita with the mango infused tequila and it was delicious- not too sweet, not too tart.  And no burning tequila.  I got the pulled pork sandwich and my friend the burger- both were delicious- and the fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Minus 1/2 star because the bartender wasn't really quick on the service.Great servers with real personality! Food was very good. Queso appetizer is devine! Awesome decor....worth the stop!Awesome atmosphere. Margaritas (especially the Anita Rita, which is a pepper infused margarita). Bartenders were swamped busy, but stayed on top of our drinks! Definitely recommend trying this out.An entertaining, casual spot in the Stockyards with a little store where you can purchase slngshots, sit at a bull seat at the bar, and imbibe huge drinks. Regrettably the food leaves much to be desired. The corn on the cob was overcooked and bland, the side of spinach was more like a side of ranch, and the fish was tough from overcooking. I can't get over the giant portion sizes. This is not a place to go for healthy eats. But the food is cheap here. Good for a group. Our table of seven with six ordering steak dishes, a few appetizers and drinks came out to only $280. Yay Texas prices!Had a friend from out of town come in and went to Stock exchange. Boogers was a place I have not yet ever been to so we decided to Check it out for lunch. We stood at host stand for probably over a min and was ignored by a few staff. Finally we get sat. Our server was also the bartender. She was very short with her words and not friendly at all. She made the experience not good. She wasn't busy by any means.  When the food came it was less than mediocre. I advise don't get the chicken BLT wrap. Its very dry  and tasteless. All and all it was below par.  I definitely will not go back here again.Love this place! The cheese burger &amp; fries I ordered was delicious! My husband ordered the fried catfish and loved his too! Try the buffalo butt beer, it was so good. Loved the decor, you really new you were at the stockyards! Great atmosphere, great staff (the hostess &amp; our waitress were both so nice &amp; helpful.) We will absolutely be back!Great selection of beers; excellent barbecue; great atmosphereThe classic Texas atmosphere coupled with the great lunch menu definitely was a plus. Going with the Brisket Sandwich and washing it down with Fort Worth's own Buffalo Butt Beer (Amber Lager) was the perfect lunch to fuel my walk through the Fort Worth Stockyard.This is really a fun place to sit and have a drink when in the Stockyard District.  You have the campy, but cool cowboy motif including saddle barstools every third seat at the bar.  The bartenders are super friendly.  The traditional margarita is an in-depth fresh concoction.  Although some might find it expensive $9, it is large and might be the best margarita we have had from Mexico to these 48 contiguous United States.",,,,,"['went', 'accident', 'amazing', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ashton-fort-worth,The Ashton,4.0,$$$,27,"This review is for the high tea at the Ashton.We hosted a baby shower for a friend at High Tea. It was a lovely afternoon. We had a party of 12. The staff, food and service was fantastic.The tea costs $38 and includes valet parking. It is a good value, in my opinion.You have your choice of tea, and start with a small taste of soup. A variety of finger sandwiches, veggies and deviled eggs followed. These are all small snack size portions. But you will not leave hungry! The tea ended with hot scones, shortbreads and chocolate covered strawberries. The desserts were very large!It was a lovely experience and I highly recommend it!Flew into Fort Worth for a night for business and stayed at The Ashton after finding a good deal on Expedia. Great price and absolutely loved where it was located downtown. We were greeted very warmly and given our room key, which was so unique. I fell in love with the ambiance, the friendliness and the location. The rooms were extremely clean and spacious.Bathroom is well lit and has a stand up shower. Outside you will find the prettiest stand up tub with massage options. Very romantic.The bed was extremely comfortable and the view of downtown through the window was great.Check in and check out process was easy and quick. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Fort Worth!Location: Smack dab in the middle of downtown Fort Worth. My wife and I were in town for the ballet at Bass Performance Hall. We were able to park our car at the hotel (valet parked it actually) and walk a block and a half to the venue. We walked to Starbucks in Sundance Square. We walked to dinner that night. We walked to breakfast the next morning. If you're like me and HATE parking in Fort Worth, this is a pretty good deal ... even at $22 (plus tips) for overnight valet parking.Facilities: Great. I don't know what else to say about them. Everything's top notch. Bed's super comfy with high quality sheets. The bathroom's elegant with flattering lighting around the mirror. It's just ... great. We didn't use any of the hotel's amenities, e.g., the gym.Staff: We dealt with two different women at the front desk and they were both delightful. Both of the valets we had were equally helpful and friendly.Price/value: The Ashton is a tad on the pricey side, due in large part to its primo location downtown. We paid $238 (including valet parking) for a small corner room on the third floor, which seemed reasonable to me.Cons: There's only one, and for me it was a pretty big one -- I couldn't sleep because of the traffic, sirens, and drunkards screaming ""Wooooohoooooo!!!"" every little bit outside my window. Now, this isn't exactly the Hotel's fault, so I'm hesitant to deduct a star, but the fact remains that I paid $238 for a hotel room and couldn't sleep ... which is precisely why I rented the room in the first place. I thought it would be a good idea to pay a little extra for a corner room, but what ended up happening was rumbling car engines coming from FOUR directions into my room since we were nestled between two busy streets at an intersection. The view was great, but once I turned the TV off and was ready to sleep, I laid in bed until 2:05 am when the last drunken ""Wooooohooooo!!!"" pierced my eardrums. I slept till a little after 5:00 am when fire and police sirens came screaming by my room -- the third time that night. By that point I was done trying to sleep, so I took my three hours of sleep and got up to take a shower. It should be noted that I'm a light sleeper and that my wife didn't have much of a complaint about noise, though she sleeps like the dead. Again, I don't know if it's fair to fault the Hotel, but if I can't sleep due to the hotel's location -- the sole purpose of a hotel room is to sleep after all, right? -- then is it really worth the price?Here's another strange con ... or maybe it's a pro? I don't know. A little after 8:00 pm we got a knock on our door. It was Hotel staff offering us two bottles of water and two cookies. It was a pro because the bottles of water stocked in the room's refrigerator were something like $6.00/ea., so it was nice to have some free water waiting for us in the morning. It was also sort of a con, too, because my wife and I were already tucked in bed (and not wearing much), watching TV, so it was kind of a pain to jump out of bed, throw on some clothes, and race to the door.Lovely boutique hotel with really spacious room and bathroom. Things I loved:1) being able to put the luggage valet in the bathroom2) water and cookies in the room. Really good cookies! 3) lighted magnifying glass in bath4) lots of plugs for electronics5) powerful hair dryer6) Awesome staff!Might be the best hotel in DFW.  It's beautifully decorated. The food is exceptionally good- try the mascarpone omelet. The bathrooms are the highlight. Great tubs and showers. All roomsHave excellent lightning, big windows. Comfortable beds. I added a picture of the gym. I had a hard time finding it. It's in the basement. Now you know. Also, restaurant is not 24/7 and hours are haphazard. Be sure to plan ahead re: food&amp; drinks. Finally, if you need wine, walk 5 minutes to Oliver's. Descent selection also has cheeses, fruit/veggies.I loved my stay here! The hotel staff was extremely nice and professional. The rooms are HUGE, the bathrooms are large and have jacuzzi tubs. Great breakfast and quiet hallways. I will definitely stay again.Great downtown FW location. Really comfy bed and linens, delicious chocolate chip cookie's left for us in our room that night. I loved the Thames toiletries. Hotel is very quiet so if your looking for loud late night bar it is not here and we weren't so that worked out perfect. We will definitely be back.The hotel room was great. The valets were great. The front desk lady, Jazmine was TERRIBLE. She charged us 92.00 for 22.00 parking, and didn't take ownership of the problem. Instead she made it seem as an inconvenience to fix the bill. I guess she assumed because we were younger girls we would take the time to read the bill. From the moment we walked in the hotel she made us feel as if we didn't belong there. It was a special evening for the bride we were celebrating and Jazzy's attitude and customer service wasn't appreciated. Dialing the better business number next.We stayed at the Ashton last night for a bachelorette party and the rooms were great! The guest service on the other hand was not.Jasmine the front desk clerk was rude to us from check in and on. This morning when I woke up to a bill charging me 92.00 for parking instead of the actual 22.00. I called the front desk and she was rude about the mix up. The Ashton was great and so were the bell hops but I will not be returning because of the rude service we received at the front desk.We stayed in room 505 and it was spectacular. The restaurants &amp; bars that conveniently snuggle its prime downtown location make it perfect for an upscale date night. The room was a piece of art. High ceilings towered above us in the suite and the windows peered into the downtown area; we paid the extra $19.00 a night ($219.00 total) to have a room with a view. The bathroom was very well designed with excellent tiling stepping up to the the long bathtub and back down into the heavy glass enclosed shower. Screw the chain hotels, splurge a bit &amp; enjoy this fine one-of-a-kind boutique gem of a hotel.Nice boutique hotel with modern decor and spacious rooms. They balance the mod decor with a pair of fresh, homemade looking baked chocolate chip cookies on your bed. As someone with a major chocolate chip cookie tooth this is much, much appreciated.I've stayed here a few times and the service is typically comparable to the space. Although during one stay they actually checked me into a room that had been freshly painted. Yes, it certainly reeked as such. Low VOC paint they did not use. They first decided to try to air out the room and bring in fans before realizing blowing fumes around was not a way to actually remove the fumes. They finally moved me to another room after I complained again. Sorry, I don't want to join the hotel room death list- especially not by any misdeed on my part!The room service portions are normal size, especially compared to everywhere else I eat in Fort Worth. Serving sizes in the area are astronomical but here, I almost felt like my veggie egg white omlette was too small. It was fine, nothing spectacular. Oatmeal is pretty tasty. If you can, request a room with a tub. Something about the showers makes me dizzy. might be the tiles.A cozy boutique hotel right in the middle of downtown Ft Worth. Customer service was great, and the location worked very well. My room was not huge, but well done with a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. Older feel, but with most modern conveniences.Very disappointing. Have been coming here since the Ashton opened and loved it. Check in this afternoon only to find it tired, bar closed, no room service and a poorly stocked mini bar.  When asked, the front desk attendant cheerily told me the bar opens tomorrow afternoon, 6 hours after I check out. Sad that this is my last stay here.Do yourself a favor; next time you are in the Fort Worth area and need to stay in a hotel, stay at the Ashton.A date night with the wife was made extra special by staying at the Ashton. After dinner down the street, we wanted to watch the second half of the Cowboys game. We went back to Ashton to sit at the bar, the tv wasn't on and there were a few people enjoying a quiet dinner. We asked the bartender (never got her name but she was great) if we could order some drinks and go sit in the lobby. She did better and told us to go sit and she would come to us for orders and serve us in the lobby. The drinks stayed full and it made for a really nice moment with some dear friends.When we returned to the room, we had fresh cookies from the hotel service team waiting for us on our pillows.Great experience and we will be back next time we are in the area.  The personal service makes all the difference in a world of corporate hotels.The Ashton is quiet, quaint, and full of top quality service. The rooms are modern but retro at the same time sporting high ceilings, large window views, and adorable tiled bathrooms.  This hotel flies a bit under the radar, but has a great location right on lower Main Street. This is a true Fort Worth gem and a must try.Stayed at The Ashton on a recent girl's trip - Highly recommend.The room - King-sized bed in a spacious room for $360/night, including breakfast the next morning. Large suite with comfortable bed, very soft bedding and feather pillows. I enjoyed a plush robe, the in-room coffee, and the complimentary iPhone/iPod dock. Free wi-fi.The hotel - Just gorgeous. Business center, including computer and printer. Fitness center (which I never saw).Breakfast - $50 for two people. The eggs benedict, fruit bowl, and OJ was wonderful.Loved the 4pm house keeping service. The bed was turned down, cookies and ice were brought in. Very nice touch!Friendly and helpful concierge &amp; valet ($20/night for valet).If you need to stay in Forth Worth, then this is a lovely boutique hotel located in downtown. Easy access to the day/night life of Fort Worth. Very friendly staff.  The place is clean, renovated and charming.  I was here for a wedding and the food was fabulous!  It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Positives: - location, service, convenience, foodNegatives- small rooms, pricey, no fitness center, no viewGreat place for an eventLocated in the heart of downtown Fort Worth, the Ashton stands out for it's elegance and beauty. This boutique hotel has been fully renovated and restored, but thankfully they retained its unique architecture. Ladies, the bathrooms are amazing. Separate shower and tubs, huge vanities and an excellent supply of bathing products. Each room is also equipped with full, fluffy robes and slippers. I was disappointed that my boyfriend didn't think to get a room with a dresser for our four-day stay, and an upgrade was not available. The Ashton over delivered when I called to inquire, quickly sending up two rolling carts (the kind with drawers you can find at BB&amp;B) making sure we were able to fit everything needed. The customer service was impeccable.The breakfast of pastries and fruit that I ordered every morning was always delivered within ten minutes and was unbelievably fresh. The coffee was strong and delicious.  The beds were comfortable; the room was equipped with an ipod doc. I would recommend the Ashton to anyone staying in Fort Worth, it is definitely worth the price.**This review would be for SIX 10 GRILLE**Was here for dinner with my vendors for a meeting last Wednesday; party of 7. at about 645p.Place was clean and inviting.  Seated by the window.  Granted it was mid week and it was probably not busy for the remainder of thenight but there was one server.  she took our orders etc but not only did our orders come out what it seemed to be 5 years later... but the rest of the night was the same.  Refills on drinks seemed forever!Food was great though, I had the sea bass and others had the pork.. we were a simple group.  I wouldn't personally come back as there are other locations to eat at that I would think have better attention to detail and faster service...Wanted to do Fort Worth without the touristy trappings.  Chose the Ashton Hotel for its historic designation because I really like that element.  While the hotel is elegant, clean, and quiet with a great accommodating staff, there is very little of the ""historic"" remaining.  The only trace of historic I could find was the elevator call button.  Guess the ""historic"" is hiding beneath the modern design renovations. The shell remains but the details have been all but erased.  Breakfast in the Six Ten grill was very nice, and again, service was great.  Would have given 4 stars had the atmosphere been more historically preserved.","This formerly charming hotel in the heart of downtown Fort Worth has new owners, and a new ""can't-be-bothered"" ethos. We've stayed at the Ashton at least twice before, the first time for Christmas 2006, and we've recommended it to friends as an affordable gem: comfortable beds in contemporary but luxe rooms, warm and professional staff, a very good restaurant and bar, and not only pet-friendly, but pet enthusiastic. This year, we booked two rooms for three nights over the Thanksgiving weekend and it was like another place - our reservation was mixed up and the staff was only mildly interested in fixing it, the ceiling in our shower featured a rusty hinge on an HVAC trap door, not all of the lights in our room worked, and the phones only worked intermittently. I mentioned the latter problem to the front desk - ""I'd like to order coffee service for the room, but the phone's not working"" - and got no reaction (he directed me to the bar for help, where no one was on duty). The front desk no longer greets guests as they enter and leave - faces are trained resolutely on the computer screen - and the bellman, who's stationed right inside the front door, is far more interested in his smart phone than opening the door, even when guests' hands are full.Worse - if the restaurant hopes to attract the general public as well as its guests - the bartender had no discernible bartending experience (likely the reason the place was deserted by its discouragingly early closing time), and the one meal we had was mediocre. But I didn't get the impression that the staff didn't care so much as they were young, inexperienced, and untrained -- which means it's the owners and management who don't care. In which case they should lower the prices, and customer expectations.What a lovely hotel. It was perfect for our staycation. We had dinner at Grace across the street the first night. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was AMAZING. Out for live music the second night and it was all walking distance. Service was impeccable and they have all the little extra that you'd expect from an upscale boutique.My wife and I booked the ""Summer Stay and Save"" package at The Ashton for our Anniversary after I had basically made my mind up to stay at The Adolphus in Dallas. The fact that they upgraded us to a Suite to celebrate our special occasion made the decision even easier for us. The location is perfect. We walked to a fantastic dinner at Grace which is located across the street. The room has floor to ceiling windows larger than most garage doors and the bathroom is extremely nice with a very large jacuzzi tub/shower. We have heard that the hotel's restaurant, Six 10 Grille, is excellent as well however we did not get the opportunity to try it out.  As The Ashton is located just off Sundance Square, there IS some street noise until 1ish in the a.m. but that should be expected. Upon check out, we were being charged for overnight valet parking ($17) and when I called the front desk to point out that was included with the package we purchased it was removed with no delay. We also had a fun event with the housekeeping staff when they knocked on our door while we were getting ready for dinner and when I opened the door to let them know we were ""OK"" right now the kind lady said ""OK"" back to me and then walked right in and started straightening up our room for the evening. It wasn't a big deal as we were basically ready to go and the cookies she left us were enjoyed later in the evening.Beautiful small hotel, registered on the Historical Hotels of America, prime location near Sundance Square, this is a fantastic hotel to spend a night or a weekend!We had our brunch the day after our wedding four years ago at the Ashton.  Our guests absolutely loved it!  I have been dreaming about the bananas foster French toast ever since that day!  Today we went back as an anniversary celebration.  The French toast had no taste at all, heavy on cream, but lacking in flavor.  The food was cold.  The service was slow, probably due to two young ladies sitting at the bar who got lots of service...  I hear the management has changed, obviously the chef has too.  Sigh.  Just shows: You can't go back in time  :-(Great location just a block off of Sundance Square.  It is a historic hotel that has been re-done in a nice way that is nice new and clean without taking away from its historic feel but also without making it feel old (if all that makes any sense).  I feel like sometimes historic hotels try to have old feeling furniture and stuff in the room to make sure that you don't forget that they are historic.  This hotel has nice new fixtures, and bathrooms, and free Wi-Fi, etc.  I was also impressed because the rooms were fairly roomy for a histroic hotel.The Ashton is a nice hotel, but I had much higher expectations, especially for it being ""historic"" and ""luxery.""When we arrived we asked where we shold parked and were greeted by an older door man who asked, ""why are you here?"" Well sir, we are checking into the hotel you work at. It didn't get much better from there, The front desk wasn't very friendly either. The room, meh. There was a water damage spot on the ceiling, ink stains on the bed, wallpaper coming up in the bathroom, hair in the bathtub and cheap toilet paper that you could see through. We should have gone to the La Quinta, at least there we could had a complimentary breakfast and saved ourselves atleast $200.A wonderful hotel.  Room, accomadations and service were all perfect.  Wonderful and extremely comfortable bedding, beautiful room, big nice bathroom.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-fort-worth-cityview-fort-worth,Hyatt Place Fort Worth/Cityview,4.0,$$,22,"Stayed here from 1/6 - 13/2016 and loved it.  Breakfast = Great!Customer Service = Great!Special Request = Honored = Great!Late Check in = Great!Enough said!Friendly staff, very clean rooms, close to shopping and freeways for a great rate.Our stay during Thanksgiving was made much easier by the excellent service and amenities of the Hyatt Place Cityview. We didn't have to drive for breakfast, since there was a plentiful complimnetary breakfast buffet available - eggs, fruit, pancakes and donuts - something for everyone. A Walgreens and a Super Target are within easy walking distance, and allow you to grab a necessity you may have forgotten. There are many options nearby for grabbing a drink or a nice dinner, plus basic bar service right in the lobby!Thanks to the kind and attentive staff who didn't break a sweat even with multiple guests' requests at the same time. A very nice stay.Excellent breakfast and friendly staff. The room was a nice size and comfortable and clean. Our room happened to be a little too close to something outside that was extremely noisy first thing in the morning, but that means I would stay here again and just ask for a different room location.Great place to stay!This is an easy 5 star review for me. I booked here because they have free wi-fi in the room. It actually works and there is no problem getting connected. Are hotels finally getting ""it"" about wi-fi? The location is fabulous. It's near a lot of restaurants and other interesting spots. The room price was very reasonable and you get a fabulous room for the money. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The couch was super huge and comfortable. My son didn't even have to pull out the sleeper sofa. The shower was perfect. My only small complaint is that the soap seems really greasy and you have to take forever to rinse off the soap. They also have an exercise room and a heated pool. Their free breakfast is outstanding with a lot of choices. My favorite was the biscuit sandwich with the egg and bacon. So good!Let's talk about the staff. Courteous and on the ball. Any question that I had they answered. Need a shuttle to the airport just call 1-800-bluevan. There was one mix up where I had a couple of guys create a reservation for me to stay an extra day. All of us blew this one since I didn't read my email that they booked me for Friday night instead of Thursday night. Fortunately I double checked with the desk  before my extra night and the young lady at the desk made everything better and changed my reservation.I will be traveling to FT WORTH more often in the future and will use Hyatt Place exclusively.Friendly staff, modern rooms, huge tv!My stay here has been wonderful, for a very reasonable price.Very very good for the price. I recommend staying here to all my friends and family from out of townIncredibly impressed with this hotel. I lived about three blocks south of this location while I attended TCU, but never knew this little gem was tucked away just down the street.I stayed here overnight to prep for my bridal portraits this past week, so it was a short trip. However, it is a clean, friendly and well-appointed location with an amazing free breakfast. It's a hotel I'd stay at again and one I highly recommend to anyone traveling to the south Fort Worth area!Decent hotel, but HORRIBLE pillows.  Trot on over to Target and buy yourself a decent one - it'll be worth the 8-12 bucks.  Breakfast was tasty!  And so was the coffee!  Roomy rooms!Recommended!You know you are in good hands when you have nothing to gripe about. And that's the best review a hotel can get.Fort Worth Hotel Interior Designer Found Guilty of Killing Romance.   I am a firm believer that the architects and designers of living spaces should be sentenced to at least a year in their own creations; it would make life a lot more livable for the rest of us.   Just looking at this room, in the model or architectural rendering forms, maybe even walking through it when completed, it would seem OK, but within the first hour of occupancy its faults started showing up in a big way.    First and most important, this is Texas and an AC that may well work anywhere else, needs to be bigger here, as even after 16 hours the temperature was barely livable and the gradient from one end of the room to the other was at least 10 degrees, making all the bed clothes superfluous.    Second, the washbasin and huge mirror were almost opposite the bed and not tucked away in the bathroom, so not only was the person in the bed disturbed by necessary ablutions, but they had the bounce effect of a million candle power light in the huge mirror over the sink that was just sufficiently misaligned to be useless for anything else.       Thirdly, the little sitting area had a lighting problem to, in that the separator from the bed was not big enough and there was not a small lamp on a side table, but again a searchlight bright florescent wall sconce that lit the entire room like an emergency room. The little desk and wet bar were of course visible from the bed with their own mirror and floodlight.    Fourthly, why put bedside lights, again bright enough to degrade the picture on the huge flat screen TV, just far enough away on the wall to make you have to get out of bed to reach the switch? Please, I really want an answer to this one.    Other than that there were just the irritating little design flaws, like putting the toilet roll dispenser on a wall so thin and tight it acted like a drum head;    On the up side, and there was one, it had two ironing boards. Seriously, its fixtures were quite impressive, like a patch board for electronic devices built into the wall behind the desk, so you could logon, jack in, power up, input, out put and generally enjoy any device you had the correct cabling for. For a change the blackout curtains almost worked, just leaving a little bright stripe at the bottom.   I think the other reviewers have coped with the pool, breakfast etc. except mentioning that they threaten 24 hour food and have a strange non-bar in the lobby where you might be able to get a beer and sit and drink it, but there are enough places within walking distance that it was not worth my trying to fathom the method.Overall I like the Hyatt Place line.  The decor is modern and stylish. The staff was reasonably friendly and helpful.  Continental breakfast is included and you can purchase additional hot plates if you like.  Coffee was good but I was bummed to find out there was no half and half available.  They did provide a good selection of fruit though.  The room is spacious and well appointed. Like one other Yelper though we noticed the musty smell which was off-putting.  It seemed like running the AC/heater unit in the window actually made it worse so it could be that they need maintenance.  We mentioned it at check-out so hopefully the staff will look into the problem.The hotel is conveniently located next to the freeway and has plentiful parking (no surprise in TX).  If I were in the area again I'd happily stay here again.Was a little apprehensive, due to the ""place"" designation.  I have stayed at every other type of Hyatt, however never this type.The lobby was quaint, and that's just the way it needs to be.The breakfast was better than they advertised it.The room was the perfect size, with a nice pull out sleeper for my son.  It was a little divided.  just enough to keep some privacy.Great place to stay, def. recommend.Very nice for the price. Stayed here and really liked it. Big rooms, firm bed, HDTV (though HD channels were really lacking), free WiFi. The continental breakfast is very nice and worth foregoing something in town since its free. Lots of fruit, beverages, biscuits and gravy one morning, and they have some delicious little donuts but you have to get there kinda early to get the glazed donuts. Trust me on that one, the powdered donuts suck. 3.7 stars. Great value, would definitely stay here again.Room smelled old and musty.  Yellow color scheme reminded me of Mad Men - dated.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Complimentary buffet was good but no scrambled eggs.  I asked to try another room but it smelled the same.  I won't stay there again.Had a great stay here. Not much to say (and nothing to complain about, which - in many ways - can be the mark of a great hotel.) Clean, FANTASTIC free breakfast, near lots of options for exploring Forth Worth, and reasonably priced. Would certainly make this my choice again if I'm ever in the area.Great rooms, huge 40"" Plasma TV' in every room, but no washer/dryer! The continental breakfast here is pretty good, but sometimes they take the bagels off the buffet... The rooms are roomy and clean with comfortable bed, and a big family style L shaped couch. I have met the sales women here and she is dedicated to customer satisfaction, however, my company has been telling her for years the place needs washer/dryers on site.The entrance is very inviting and modern, which I found surprising for the price. We stayed the weekend of 9-11 for a charity event and needed a place to sleep so here goes: The first thing I noticed was the smell of the room. I am very sensitive to mildew like smells and this room had it. Wasn't smoky or anything...just had that ""old"" smell. So much so that my nose began getting stuffy. Something just wasn't right. The room was beautifully decorated, and i liked that it had a divider that separated the sleeping area from the living area. Everything was clean, sheets were scratchy (cant complain for the price though) and they had extra blankets and pillows on hand just in case. Bathrooms were clean; could be a little more thorough because I noticed some splash marks of some kind on the bathroom wall. Everything else was quiet peaceful and there is even a target within walking distance. Across the street is a dry cleaner and several places to eat. The mall is also about 3 miles away, if even that. Seems to be in a decent area of fort worth. I didn't notice anything that would keep me away from this place again. I just know to bring my air spray next time.I have mixed feelings about this hyatt place... I am a fan of the hp in general, but this is not my fave. Its not in the most ""view"" tiful area, as the name would imply. And it was super full when went so there were some key hiccups...... BUT the manager was so nice and helped up reprogram the lock right outside the door to the room. Breakfast was good, thank you for fresh fruit!nice place, GREAT staff.  don't get the neg reviews, maybe hyatt listened and made changes.  only thing keeping it from five stars is the loud window AC unit.  bed was VERY confortable.  will return.This hotel is absolutely amazing!  They recently renovated that place into a modern, artsy, contemporary style that just works!Our favorite part was the hotel room.  Each room contains a 42 inch flat screen TV mounted on the wall.  The room is decorated in such a way that feels more like an apartment, than a hotel.  We just relaxed on the huge couch with a glass of wine, enjoying putting our feet up on a very comfortable ottoman that comes standard with each room.Additional attributes about the room and hotel:super comfortable beddeskrefrigeratorenough sitting room to accommodate at least six guestsoutdoor poolI promise, if you stay here, you won't be disappointed!","Stayed here for 6 weeks due to work. The staff is AWESOME. The hotel, not so much. Almost every other night the fire alarm would go off many times. It's really fun going to work when you have 3 hours of sleep almost every night. The breakfast served has a good mix. Could be better but it is above most. The people working there really are some of the best that I have seen at any Hotel and I usually stay at 4 or 5 star Hotels. I would have given them 4 stars but if you can't fix a fire alarm from going off and it does it every other night you are lucky not to get 1 star. Almost forgot that if you want to watch the TV you better like news or sports because they only get about 14 stations and most are news or sports news stations. The ones that aren't, aren't worth watching. The rooms are nice.great accommodations, big-screen tv, comfy bed, great sitting area and simple wifi service! the pool was a little shabby considering how nice everything else was, but i still swam in it and was satisfied. the morning breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful!",,,,"['2016', 'loved', 'breakfast', 'great', 'customer', 'service', 'great', 'special', 'request', 'honored',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-fort-worth-downtown-fort-worth,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Fort Worth Downtown,3.5,$$$,30,"We stayed two nights here for my daughter's cheerleading competition.  Not a bad hotel.  Nothing fancy, but nice.Pros:  The free breakfast is very nice.  The staff is friendly.  The rooms were clean and beds were fine.  Pillows soft.  They have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere in a 3 miles radius.  Just tip the driver.  Free WiFi.  Check out is not until 1200-so that's nice. Small refrigerator and microwave in the room.  Cons:  parking is kind of a pain.  Limited parking spaces, and the parking spaces are very small!  Any vehicle bigger than a 4 door car makes it difficult to park.  The elevators are very small and slow... Stairs are a lot faster.  I do recommend the hotel and would stay again.Everything we could ask for in a Holiday Inn and at a decent price. Jonathan checked us in and helped call a few bars to find us one with an open kitchen. He was nice and super helpful. Breakfast was solid. We were able to park our uhaul trailer on the street in front of the hotel for free, and Jonathan helped us with that as well. Overall a great experience. I'd happily stay here again.Pleasantly surprised. Free breakfast was great, free wifi was great and the hot tub was actually hot.  Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable and hard and soft pillows were offered. The only negative things were the house keeper forgot to replace shampoo and floor mat one night. One caution note: doesn't seem safe to wander at night. Fortunately the hotel offers a free shuttle.I had a great stay at this location. The outside looks a little dates and the room could have higher quality linens but the staff was fantastic. Especially Bobby Bedsole and his team. It is in a good location and I would stay here again.Pros:1. Within a mile of city centre downtown and other hip walkable areas 2. Free self parking 3. Good water pressure in shower 4. Sufficient heat for shower 5. Good AC6. Comfortable bed and pillows 7. Shuttle service to and from locations within 3 miles (didn't use it though so can't say much to its dependability)8. Bath and body works products (shampoo, conditioner, and lotion)9. Responsive to fixing toilet 10. Provided extra lotion at front desk 11. Spacious room with seating area 12. Right next to gas station and highway 13. Free breakfast ( haven't tried it though)14. Fridge and microwave in room. 15. Free internetCons:1. Low water pressure for sink2. Cleanliness is a 3 out of 5. Unpleasant to see hairs in sink and shower when first got here. 3. While parking is free, there isn't much space and it is tight. Thankfully, I have a compact car. 4. Shower head hurts! Only two options and they both suck. 5. Channel selection on TV is limited. For example, only one hbo. 6. TV says HD but doesn't look HD 7. While you're downtown, no views from hotel to make you feel you are downtown. It doesn't feel like you're in a downtown hotel8. No toothpaste provided.Reasonably-priced accommodations in the heart of a city like Fort Worth are not easy to come by, especially if you neglect to make reservations until time is short.The hotel is undergoing a major renovation that includes a total interior/exterior makeover and adding floors with new rooms.  The interior of my room and the existing public areas looks to be complete and is modern and stylish.  One area that did not receive an upgrade was the elevators, which were a bit slow.  Maybe when the new floors are put in, new elevators will be put in also.My room AC was noisy but very powerful.  It was a mild summer day so I was able to turn off the AC at night and still remain comfortable.The hot breakfast was simple but enough for me.  Eggs and bacon.  Cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruits and juices were also available.The desk staff were friendly, helpful and approachable.  The hotel has a free shuttle service that will shuttle to any locatoin within 3 miles of the hotel, which includes sightseeing locations like the Stockyard.All in all, I enjoyed a pleasant stay and would stay here again if travelling through this area in the future.Called reservations the evening of 8/23, for checking in between 830-9am on the 24th, with a late checkout (2pm) on the 24th.Get to the hotel 8/24th checked in between 8:30-9am, was given a dirty room. came back downstairs, they apologized, said they were understaffed, so Joann checked me into another room. Went to the room to sleep. Within 30 minutes, someone opened the door, luckily i had the door latch locked. Left the hotel around 9:45am to go across the street.  Then was charged for the night of the 23rd and a ""no show"". i called the hotel and spoke with the same woman, Joann, who checked me in on the 23rd. I explained to her the situation and she said that the manager would have to ""look closer"" into the charges. So I go Ashley's voicemail. Then I called corporate and they were less than helpful. So I then called the hotel back to see if I could actually speak to Ashley. Ashley was pleasant but kept asking me to prove that it was agreed that i had requested a late checkout. Asked me if I had the name of the person i made the reservation with. So she could call Reservations and ask that person if they really said that...lol. Seems like a grade school act. Is this typical Holiday Inn treatment?Stayed at this venue for IALHA Nationals as a judge.  Staff Manager Lauren was one of the best, and I see minimum 2 hotels/month. She was polite with us and with OSU football team who had just taken a whuppin-challenging.Room was big enough.  Bath was totally stocked, and, new towels, etc.Bed was very comfortable, even covers smelled and appeared clean.Breakfast was OK.  Since we had to be at Will Rogers early, and many show staff &amp; participants stay here, maybe start 1/2 hour earlier, so there is not such a scramble.Travel by shuttle was OK, but unfortunately, without a car, you are married to the shuttle, since there is really nothing within walking distance.Still---four stars----------------Here on a business trip. This place could be better. The AC is a wet/cold experience. I think you know what I mean when I say wet/cold. It's cold but with humidity. Just horrible. The internet is no better (198 Kilobytes per second download) but then again I shouldn't complain because it's free. The parking is free but it's not really secure. Close to the highway so it's easy for a smash and grab. The price is a bit high for what it gives.As of 10/11/13, the renovation is almost complete.  The scaffolding is off the exterior and floors basement through 4 are complete.  The only things left are the 5th floor and the parking garage.The rooms:I had a room with two queen beds.  It was nice, newly renovated, and comfortable but on the small size as it was not an accessible room.  It had all the HIE mainstays (the pillows, Bath and Body Works toiletries, etc).  Like most hotels, the walls are pretty thin, but the AC fan covers most of it without being too obnoxious.Oh, and there was adequate internet!  The speed was adequate at 4:00pm and at 9:00pm.  No issues!  The grounds:I enjoyed the fitness room.  It has two treadmills, two ellipticals, an exercise bike and weights.  However, the Cardio Theaters on the treadmills didn't work.  They worked on the ellipticals though.  There is one large television in there.  One night, some thoughtless idiot turned on THE O'REILY FACTOR.  I had to suffer through that for 30 minutes, until she finally left.  There should really be a posted rule about not turning on inflammatory television programs in the fitness room on the big tv.The lobby was nice (see photos) and filled with the smell of Otis Spunkmeyer cookies every afternoon.  However, parking in the overflow lot across the street wasn't convenient.  I wasn't fond of jay-walking across Lancaster in the mornings.Service:Everyone I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful, from check in to check out.  They acknowledged my high IHG status and told me about a point promotion I wasn't aware of.  All in all, I will stay here again next time I'm in Fort Worth.This location is different from the typical Holiday Inn Express buildings that we've all seen scattered at various points along a freeway. It's an older building, which looks like it was originally a different hotel. It's also right next to a gas station, the properties almost seem connected. Pros:*Friendly staff*Good free breakfast*Clean &amp; comfortable bed &amp; towels*Granite countertops in bathroom*In-room movies availableCons:*Small bathroom*Not a very good shower head - two settings, either stinging water or a stream like a hose*Difficult &amp; limited parking (apparently this is currently being renovated)I would stay at this location again, and I look forward to seeing the parking situation improveWe recently stayed at this hotel for five days. On Wednesday, September 9th, I experienced a terrible fall in their parking lot which was inadequately lighted. I immediately reported it to the staff but did not seek medical attention once I ascertained that no bones were broken. However, the fall was so painful that for several nights I woke up in the middle of the night and had to take more Advil. Of course, my entire right side was badly bruised. Thursday morning I spoke with the manager, Ashlee Heldt, and asked that something be done to correct the situation. She said that the lights were on timers and I told her that I thought they needed to be on 24/7 since the day that I fell was a cloudy day. The next day when we came back to the hotel, the lights were off again and the place where I fell was very dark. I confronted her about it the next morning and she would not agree to do anything about it. I believe that this lack of action is utterly outrageous and irresponsible. One of these days, if not corrected, someone is going to suffer a life-altering injury.Stayed September 2015, traveled as a coupleLoved this place. It's not the cheapest, but the location is awesome. On top of that, you have a nice, big, clean room with luxurious amenities. The tv has double the channels as your average hotel. The sheets are clean, the pillows are comfy, and the bathroom will exceed your expectations. On top of all that, the view is fabulous!I checked into the Hotel for a five day trade show in the area.  The room was not available at the time so I left my luggage with the front desk.  Upon my return that evening I find out the Hotel gave my luggage to another guest leaving the country.Initially I was told it was given to a group of international travelers from Panama and they were trying to get a hold of them and left messages but there was a language barrier.  Over one month later, I am told they made every attempt to contact the guests but the international number they have on record is not a correct number. And now they report the guests were flying to Portugal and could not understand how the luggage could have made it to Brazil...The Ft. Worth Hotel has done everything to try to sweep this under the rug. They were unresponsive to my emails and calls to where I was forced to call the corporate office. The corporate office was little or no help as they would only place me on hold to call the Ft. Worth location to prompt some response from the Hotel.  It took 4 weeks for a response from the Hotel with their nominal attempt to resolve the situation.  The resolution was minimal and unsatisfactory.My suggestion if you are ever in this situation with this Location is do not leave the premises until your situation is resolved to your satisfaction.If I could give them 3.5 stars I would,,this was a nice hotel,very clean but a little outdated for the price.Service was okay,nothing to brag about.I was told I would have to park across the street and on the second floor of the garage because they were busy.Fortunately I listened to my wife and checked their lot and found plenty of convenient parking available.We were happy with our valentine stay and it was very convenient to Embargo where we partied that night.But the rooms were the same price as our luxury hotel on the riverwalk in San Antonio,,and in Ft Worth our view was off the rooftop ac units and the freeway..I didn't stay here but my friend and her family did.  They really liked the hotel. The lobby is very nice and updated. Very trendy.  There room was the same. It also had a fridge to keep some food.One thing I was able to experience was they backed some cookies!  They really hit the spot after a long morning of shopping!Great location and their shuttle will take you to the stockyard.  Or anywhere within one mile.  Parking was sparse but it didn't seem to bother the guest.It wouldn't be my first pick, but since I was in town just for the night, the rate, proximity to my work event, and great reviews were enough to allow me to book it on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>. Parking is free (and some of it is covered), they have fitness room, a very small indoor pool, complimentary breakfast ... and the rooms are equipped with a mini fridge, blowdryer. The few things I didn't like about the place was the seriously bad lighting (even for hotel standards) and the loud fans in the restrooms; there wasn't a separate switch in the RR, so as I did my makeup, the LOUD fan irritated the hell out of me.The good:- clean, modern and safe- priority club welcome + upgrade to suite- fast internet- breakfast area spacious and clean- microwave, freezer, large HD, coffee machine, hair drier, ironing board- nice fitness room- friendly staff- one morning I was late for breakfast and the lady prepared a plate for me.The bad:- standard HIE - quite priceyThis is an atrocious hotel. Awful staff, paper thin walls, expired food at the breakfast, double charge on my card for the room. A nightmare.Good location, friendly people, good price. We ended up checking out one night early and they did not charge us for the extra night. Location is convenient and the hotel it's self is nice, could use some more parking and faster elevators, but no big deal. Beds are a little hard but good view of downtown Fort Worth. I would recommend it.","I had reservations about staying here as I really one choose it because of the low cost. I can say I was impressed in almost every way!  Extremely friendly staff that genuinely seemed to want to help. The room was nice and the only issue was that the ac and the bathroom fan are loud, but really if that is the only issue, it is a win. The free shuttle is what set this over the top. Super friendly and helpful in every way. Went well beyond the normal service level I have been accustomed to. Free and ample parking is a nice bonus as well!I travel to a lot of small towns so I frequent the Holiday Inn brand.   I am starting to see where most of the HI Express hotels are nicer and newer then the Holiday Inn's.  This hotel is no exception.  The lobby had great decor, great breakfast and business areas and a store.  The rooms were very nice and the beds were comfy.  The location was also great for all the places we wanted to visit in the area.Not impressed with the staff.  I know friendly customer service isn't that hard and they need to work on it.  The elevators were INCREDIBLY slow and twice we had staff take over an elevator in front of us, instead of letting us have it first.  I guess they don't have a service elevator?  The walls in the rooms are very thin so any outside noise is super loud.  I'm glad we had to be up early because I would not have been able to sleep late due to the screaming kid next door.  Parking was also tricky.  We got back to the hotel at 12-1am and there was only one spot left.  Overall the good and bad aspects made me feel like this place was just a ""maybe"" if I was thinking of places to stay in Ft. Worth.I was only here one night while visiting FtWorth but it's worth reviewing simply because tehy accomodated four of us in one room. Ok, so maybe they didnt realize tehre WERE four of us...but the fact that we could all fit in a regular room was pretty neato. Two on the giant bed, and two on teh queen mattress we blew up and put on the floor. I'm sure we violated soem fire code since couches and such we wedged every which way elsewhere, but we all got a good nights sleep.Props to covered parking, overall cleanliness, and a free hot breakfast. The coffee was good, and they had eggs, breakfast meats, and fruit for us non-cereal/oatmeal/pastry paleo freaks. The highlight of this experience was hearing Pitbulls' ""Hotel Room Service"" on the way home and signing along, ""Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday nn (EXPRESS!)""My wife and I spent the night here while visiting Fort Worth for the weekend.  We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel.  It looks like Holiday Inn is really updating their appearance.  The lobby was very nice, they offer a free hot and cold breakfast and they also have free wi-fi.The room we stayed in was a King Suite and it was very spacious, it had a king size bed, sitting area with a sofa bed, desk and a large LCD TV.This hotel also has an indoor pool and fitness center, although we did not use those facilities.  Overall this is a very nice hotel and I would stay there again.  FYI:  The beds are very hard.As far as HIE properties go, I've definitely experienced better.The parking situation was tight - there isn't much to start with, and if you get back to the hotel late, you are likely to miss out on getting a spot. The elevators are very slow. There are two elevators, but during checkout, they were constantly filled with house keeping carts, towels carts, maintenance carts, etc. I waited over 10 minutes to get an elevator on one trip up to our room.The shower water had a distinct ""fish tank"" odor coming from our shower water. I don't know what else to call it....algae maybe? But it was stank! And then there was the fact that the shower curtain didn't contain the water. It was literally pouring out onto the floor no matter how we positioned the curtain.The breakfast area was extremely busy. In general, it was just a busy, overworked property.They didn't do any of the ""little"" touches that I expect from a thoughtful HIE (which we have stayed at many that do these things).Clean, modern and a free breakfast... not much to complain about here. Stayed at the hotel for a quick weekend getaway from Austin and was pleasantly surprised. Centrally located, basic but nice gym and a clean pool/spa.I stayed there for 7 days last February. The hotel is OK, my room was clean, spacious and well equipped (microwave, freezer, large HD screen, coffee / tea machine, hair drier, etc.). The check in didn't take too much time, and check out was extremely fast, as I just had to sign the invoice that was dropped in my room the morning I left. This hotel has a 24/7 fitness room with running and biking machine, and a small swimming pool with a spa. Breakfast and Internet connection are complimentary and both of good quality.The only ""cons"" is that the hotel is quite far from Fort Worth Downtown (30minutes to go by foot) which can be annoying if you don't have a car. In a few words, not excellent, but not bad at all either.I stayed here for 3 nights after staying 1 night at the Embassy Suites in downtown. This hotel is a lot cheaper than Embassy, but still pricey considering it is not city center. The staff was friendly and the hotel was well kept. If the hotel was a little cheaper I would recommend staying here, but if you have the money I'd say you are better off staying more in the downtown area where you can walk to all the shops and restaurants.My first stay at Holiday Inn Express, my flight arrived at 5:00 a.m. the staff was really wonderful about getting us into a room early.  I was here for a training and stayed for three nights all were pleasant.  Nicely appointed rooms and common areas.Great remodeling recently done. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Staff was friendly and was knowledgeable about the area. The rooms were very clean, spacious, and free internet! Lots of complementary toiletries, plus a nice selection of items downstairs just in case you forgot something. Very nice lounge area and wide variety of items for breakfast. Rooms had new coffeemakers and fridges.",,,,"['nights', 'daughter', 'competition', 'bad', 'hotel', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'nice', 'pros', 'free', 'breakfast', 'nice', 'staff', 'friendly', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/stockyards-hotel-fort-worth,Stockyards Hotel,3.5,$$$$,17,"I needed to find a place to have a large group dinner and Leah was so helpful. I had a group of 40 plus and we ended up renting the banquet room and bar/patio area. I opted for some appetizers and a cocktail hour followed by a buffet dinner. The food was good and the girls serving us were great. Plates and glasses/bottles were constantly being picked up. My only complaint was how long it took to finally close out our bill. I would recommend it if you've got out of town guests and want the authentic Texas feel.I loved this place! The room was spacious and clean and the staff was extremely helpful. We were originally booked in a room that opened into the atrium but once we got in found it just kind of boring. We called the front desk and they gladly switched us to another room facing right down into the street where we could watch the cattle drive and nightlife. The adjoining bar and restaurant are awesome!  The valet and bellhops were some of the most helpful I've ever seen, I'd gladly return.We had a great stay at the Stockyards Hotel.  We chose the Geronimo room and boy did we love it.  The decor was authentic Texas and the service great.  Its proximity to the attractions makes everything walkable and part of the charm.  It is close to restaurants, the Historic District, and shopping.  We only wish we weren't just driving through as a few more days here would have been great!The first time we stayed here we had a great experience.  This time....not so much.  My nieces room had a leak in the bathroom ceiling (room 214) from the time they checked in.  They reported the problem that day.  A maint main came to fix it the next morning, but whatever he did, it did not work.  So the kids had to listen to the constant dripping all weekend.  Told they couldn't change rooms because there were only king rooms left and they needed two beds.  So by Sunday morning even the carpet was wet.  Management said they would take care of the problem and never did.  They said they wouldn't charge for the room but still did.  To add insult to injury, the girls had a $50 lottery ticket go mysteriously missing Sunday.  In my room, I forgot my flatiron, an expensive one.  When I called to ask to have it shipped to me I was told housekeeping didn't come across it.  I know for a fact it I left it in there. So someone in housekeeping is not honest.Very disappointed in this stay considering we had such a good first experience.  After these experiences, we would not stay here again.Great location.....across the street from White Elephant Saloon. The historic hotel has a Texan theme throughout the building. The Texan Suite includes a king size bed, a separate living area, two restrooms, and masculine furniture, shutters over the windows, two televisions, and two entrances to the suite.Charming hotel. Perfect location! Staff was exceptionally helpful and nice. Not too spendy. We would stay again if we are in the area.ROACHES!!!!!  Do I need to say anything else?!  See posted pic.I didn't stay the night, but I spent several hours here with some friends who did.  Even though was I wasn't staying overnight, I was still able to valet with the hotel ($9 for non-overnight, $13 for overnight).   We about 7 girls up in the Geronimo suite for a mini bridal shower/bach party.   The room itself was a great size - two double beds, a pull out couch, and the toilet/shower was separate from the sink vanity.  We appreciated this so we could all get ready without being squeezed into a tiny bathroom!   The room could easily and comfortably sleep 6.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful.  We forgot a wine opener and we were able to just take the bottles down to the bar and they opened them for us.   The bellman also offered filled our coolers with ice.  What a guy!The hotel was lively with guests both in the restaurant and the lobby.  This place is in a great location and you can walk to everything.    I left the hotel around 10:00pm and valet was a breeze.   Great time here, and I will for sure be back to spend the night!Loved this historic old cowboy hotel nestled in the old cowboy town of Stockyards Fort Worth. I was so annoyed that I didn't bring my entire cowgirl wardrobe, as everywhere you look there are guys decked out in full garb as are some of the ladies. The hotel is an old 3 story building with great comfortable huge beds and is kept very clean. Nicely decorated. Well worth the visit. Downstairs is the H3 Restaurant where my husband who is 57 had the best ribs of his life. Also go to the downstairs bar and sit on one if the saddle barstools! Loved itFirst! You gott'a remember how old this hotel is.......that said; friendly staff at front desk.  Upon arrival it is a fight to get bell service and parking place on street.  Ended up handling bags myself car to lobby and lobby to room (checking out,too).  Valet parking area is a good ways away so plan on a wait to get vehicle.  We stayed in Bonnie &amp; Clyde suite......on 3rd floor corner of Main and Exchange; right over party district.  Just saying!  If you are looking for good nights sleep on Friday or Saturday night bring ear plugs, good drugs and eye cover!  Or get another room on backside of hotel.If you are early riser forget any coffee service or room service.  Restaurant only open for breakfast on weekends; and does not open till 9 a.m.!  First morning I came down looking for coffee; front desk rang restaurant to refill self service, no answer.  So I was told ""just go through double doors toward kitchen someone will be there...""  REALLY!Place is clean; to include room.  However, it was old time period tub/shower with 3 or 4 nobs just to get shower to work.....my wife gave up and just took a tub bath, each night.In the end I wish I had known there was a Hyatt Place 2 blocks away......newer, less street noise and same price points.....Bonnie at the front desk is the best! I found myself stranded in the Stockyards area and she helped me figure out what to do even though I wasn't a guest at Stockyards Hotel - she made me feel like a guest anyway.  Basically what happened is the Uber-like cab driver that the hotel I was actually staying at near DFW recommended, hiked up the fare to an outrageous amount that I am too embarrassed to post when he dropped me off and I was just too shocked to defend my wallet. Let's just say it was three times what I was expecting and although the Stockyards are definitely a point of interest I decided it just wasn't worth paying anywhere close to that again and I didn't know my options on how to return so I felt overwhelmed and stranded. I know, I know - dumb traveler mistake to not ask the price up front. Lesson learned. So let's get back to how awesome Stockyards Hotel is. Bonnie came up with some transportation ideas and said not to worry, she would look up some information and I could come back after the rodeo. So I was free to enjoy the show with peace of mind that things would work out. I returned to Stockyards Hotel and Bonnie found me a great option on the Super Shuttle, let me use the phone and provided me with pen and paper for my reservation, the address to the hotel, etc. She thought of everything!  Then when I got off the phone she offered for me to wait safely inside the hotel lobby, pointed out the restroom and set me up in a nice comfy chair with some tea. I have heard about legendary hospitality in this area but I was so pleased with the kindness and customer service I received at the Stockyards Hotel that I will definitely be coming back again - this time as a true guest at this pleasant hotel.This is a great Historic hotel right in the heart of the stockyards.  The ""Celebrity Room"" is an amazing place to stay in.  It has two bathrooms, a parlor, and a private patio with the required hot tub as well.  The staff was extremely friendly and polite.  They were able to meet our every need.  There is no real parking lot for the hotel though.  Valet is offered at $15/day, there is free parking lots and on the street, and there are some pay lots for $5/day.  That's the only downside of the hotel, but to be honest, if you're staying here its just worth it to pay the valet expense.  Plenty of history surrounding the hotel that fascinated me.  Bonnie &amp; Clyde stayed here amongst others.   Also, the lobby is attached to (personal opinion interjected right......now) one of the best and probably top ten of my restaurants the H3 Ranch.Yuk!We chose this hotel because it was old and we wanted a hotel with that old west charm.   There is nothing charming about this hotel.  Upon arriving we were looking for the parking lot and could not find it so we call ed the front desk and were Told that they only had valet parking and it costs 15.00 a day!  We got to our room... We were shocked!  The room was in the shape of a triangle, had six windows three overlooked a wall of air conditioners the other three had a view of a fire escape and a roof.  The rooms had no refers. No coffee makers. The bathroom was SO dark a candle would have had more light!  We love old hotels but this place needs some serious help.  We were going to stay four nights but left the next day... At and additional charge of 50.00 for and early departure.  We went to the Hyatt and had a wonderful rest of our vacation.First of all, the staff is unfailingly nice, the rooms were comfortable and the hotel itself is very pretty. BUT, it is LOUD if you get a room facing the street. I don't mean a little loud, with a few bumps or some background noise. I mean people screaming, laughing, at least 2 live bands, motorcycles revving constantly--noise so loud it drowns out the TV in your room. I read the reviews and saw other people complain about the noise. PLEASE BELIEVE THE REVIEWS! Saturday night was the worst and then Sunday--beautiful silence. I guess everyone was still hungover from Saturday. Unfortunately, the AC was out that night so my room was a toasty 80 degrees. Monday was not as loud as Saturday but the live bands were back. (The hotel was full and I was there with others or I would have stayed in a different place.)The only other downside was that the rooms were dark. Even with every light on, it was dim at best. The bathroom is especially dark. Luckily I was there alone so I could leave the door open and get some of the light from the dressing area.  If you're a partier and you're going to be out late anyway, you shouldn't have a problem. It would be a blast to stay here and just walk around the Stockyards area. Billy Bob's is close and so are a lot of great restaurants and shops. I'd certainly go back and just make sure I got a room in the back (although someone in my party did have a nice quiet room--with a view of the AC unit!)Pay for the valet parking (just factor the $15 in to the room charge). The Stockyards area was crazy crowded on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't worth trying to find parking and then schlepping our bags through the crowds. Overall I'm kind of ambivalent. The staff was great and the room was comfy and it's in a great location. Just wish there was more light and it was a lot quieter.Extremely hospitable staff and a great location. Easy walk to good food and boss bars. Rooms were clean and comfortable. This was our first time to Fort Worth and we really enjoyed the area. If we stay in Fort Worth again, we're certainly staying here again. Had a great meal at the hotel H3 steakhouse. Flaming tenderloin and the steak with the mop sauce were perfect.Old school kind of place. Big, but awkwardly shaped rooms. Not great in terms of parking -- the Hyatt Place is better with its own lot. Still, an interesting experience. Heard rumors that it's haunted.I loved the hotel and the staff was GREAT!!! We got married there this weekend. August 7th 2010. It was HOT but the reception room was cooled down well enough for when we came in to eat! The food was GREAT and the drinks were too! The street and hallway noise was a little rough which is why i gave 4 stars!! I will be using a diff side of the hotel for later uses!!! It was loud loud loud!!! Wish I could've slept longer.",,,,,"['needed', 'find', 'place', 'large', 'group', 'dinner', 'helpful', 'group', 'plus', 'ended', 'renting', 'banquet', 'room', 'bar', 'patio', 'area', 'opted',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/park-central-hotel-fort-worth-2,Park Central Hotel,1.5,$$$,15,"Is it the newest....no. Is it the the nicest.....no. But if you need a place to stay downtown without breaking the budget, this is it. We stayed on a Saturday night before the NASCAR race, clean rooms, hot shower, no problems. After reading other reviews we were a bit nervous, but the guy at the desk was nice, even after dealing with a lady who cussed him out because SHE couldn't find her room. A little old and out dated, but for the money ($80/room) you can't go wrong, especially, considering you are right across the street from the Fort Worth convention center and every where else is $150-200/ night.  A short 5-10 minute walk from lots of bars and restaurants and only 15 minute cab ride to the historic Stockyards. Parking is a little tight and tricky, but hey, your in downtown so it's better than parking on the street.Where do I start...-Arrived and none of the light switches worked, went back to front desk and had them come up and get them to work.  None of them were plugged in and it was night time. -Sheets had stains and so did all towels.  -Although it was no smoking there were cigarette ashes in the top drawer of the night stand.  -Coffee  pot was disgusting and so was fridge.  -Water leaked from tub 24 hours a day and the tub was stained.  -Shower curtain was gross and rings were missing. - Pillow sham had a LARGE  crusty stain that looked exactly like what you can imagine it was.  -Had cool air on and returned to room being 90 degrees mid day and reported it.  Was told it was switched to heat for everyone because it was going to be 30 degrees.  It was not ever close to 30 degrees and had no air movement in our room ever again unless we wanted all heat.  Was told it would cost $90,000 to fix the building issue that causes this.-Phone in room did NOT work and front desk told us that none of them do.Despite all this the staff were courteous, kind, and did help us where they could.  Location was great and convenient.  Price was decent.  If you don't mind yucky sanitation issues and a bit of uncomfortable things that might occur at a motel then go right ahead and book at this place.This Motel not Hotel is not only unsafe but also comes with great deal of unprofessionalism. The way of dealing with client concerns is to call police. Problems* Towed our rental car after paying $45 for parking in their parking lot. Pictures &amp; Video In possession for proof. *Hotel will not take ownership of mistake and blamed next door business. *will not credit $300 for towing.*Place is dirty.*The pool belongs to the dentist next door and hotel guest are not allowed to use as advertised. *Roaches and grasshoppers in motel room. *Staff said they are new and don't know how to clean??  Please be careful if you stay at this place especially if you park in their parking spaces. Motel runs with kids that have not learned how to deal with problems &amp; do not understand customer service. Please check your bed for bedbugs and other insects that can be bad for your health since this place is not cleaned at all. We would had made a change but other hotels had no vacancies since city was hosting 2 conventions that week. This place is across the street from the convention center in beautiful downtown Fort Worth and it's a shame as it does not match the rest of the city.This is a low-grade quality motel that tries to sell itself as a hotel with four-star prices. This is the biggest dump of a ""hotel"" I have ever stayed in. As far as motels go though it's average but as its trying to be a hotel, I'm gonna grade it on the scale of hotels. Bed had light stains, noise cancellation is non-existant (I could hear the cleaning lady sweep the walkway today), and they charge $15 to park in a basement which looks like a scene of your future death from an ax murderer. You're right in the square which is why I'm even writting a one star review (b/c they dont even deserve that otherwise), but what I'm trying to say is spend $20 more to stay in any other hotel b/c this is such a waste of anything you spend.Well, this hotel is a shithole. I gave it 2 stars because the staff is friendly and accommodating. It's actually a motel. The pool was closed in the middle of may (not sure we would have used it anyway). My nonsmoking room smelled like someone had smoked in it for 10 years and then quit last month. It was relatively cheap for the location. If you're only planning on sleeping here it might work for you. Keep any nice clothing in a garment bag or your suitcase to avoid it taking on the smoke smell. I did not have a noise issue as some others have mentioned. I was on the opposite side of the building and on the 4th floor, which may have helped. Overall I would not stay here again.DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Luckily it was right downtown Fort Worth so I could walk to the bars and drink as much as I could before I had to stumble back to this 1960's hell hole that they called a hotel.The AC was off so my room was 80+ degrees. Very very outdated. refused to sleep under the blankets or take a shower. Extra $15 for parking. NEGATIVE 5 STARSThis hotel serves it's purpose. It's walking distance from all the bars downtown and is way better than a DWI! My friends and I have shared rooms here a couple times and it's fine. It's not luxury or modern, could definitely use some updating, but for a place to crash it was okay.Probably the dirtiest, most outdated hotel I've ever stayed at. I didn't even want to use the shower here. It's good if you only care about location; it's very close to Sundance Square and downtown. However the dive bar downstairs is VERY loud and bands play until 2am. This place wasn't restful at all.This was by far, the absolute worst ""hotel"" experience we've ever had in our entire lives. I apologize in advance for ragey all-caps. Literally 20 minutes in, I was checking to see if there were any other rooms in the area, but everything was booked up because it was a trade show.PRO:Check-in &amp; out was fast and the staff is friendlyCONS:OLD &amp; DISGUSTINGBathroom was like a PUBLIC BATHROOM. Meaning, it was literally a toilet straight out a public bathroom. Big pipes in the back with the huge lever and NO toilet seat cover. The toilets in the convention center were less disgusting!!Towels had HOLES in them!Roach motel. Yup, I found a big, fat cockroach our first dayNo Wi-Fi in the room, which is just great when you're on a BUSINESS TRIP! By the end, I didn't give a crap that this was down the street from the convention center. Yes, it was super convenient to walk 1 minute and be at our booth, but my god it was not worth it. We didn't sleep the entire trip and I honestly think it affected our business. I'm not exaggerating, I looked and felt like sh*t and this is a trade show where you need to be ON all the time.DO NOT STAY HERE. You won't even save very much money! This place makes Motel 6 look like the Ritz-Carlton.Nothing.  We walked out of this hotel.  Our reservation and room we we're given was occupied.  We walked in on someone's room.  Then apologized to me and moved us to a smaller room.  We pre-ordered a Suite, but were given a tiny 2 twin bed room.  We complained again and then we were moved to a larger Room.  1 bed and futon.  TV didn't work. Pool was closed, due to owner sold the property, but not the pool.  Huh..?  WiFi Sucked.  Found used razor in bathub.  We left.  When Momma's not happy, Nobody is happy.I really wish I would have read Yelp before staying here. The first room the TV did not work. So they moved us and then the AC did not work in the second room. It was so dirty I almost did not want to sleep in the bed. I asked for change to get drinks from the vending machine and they told me they do not have any change. The bath tubs were dirty, the floor in the bathrooms were also dirty and heated for some strange reason. Do your self a favor and pay a little more and get a different hotel.This hotel blows. No ac, awful service. Don't stay here. If I could jump off the balcony and get my money back I would.Horrible hotel, very dirty, out of date furnishing, cockroaches every where. Bedding made of burlap, and smells like goat cheese. Really low thread count towels. Also has the toilet paper of a cheesy truck stop, bring moisturizer for after you wipe. Will never go back again, especially for the over priced rooms. If I wanted to stay at a motel 6 I would of booked one, instead of a hotel in Downtown Fort Worth where some expectations of higher class hotels should be meet. I guess there's a reason they leave the lights on for you, to keep the roaches away when you walk in.This hotel is absolutely disgusting!!!!nice staff but I needed a detox by the time I left!Old.  Staff is very nice, but the hotel itself is extremely old and needs serious updating.  Beds are horrible and lord only knows how long those mattresses have been in those rooms.  I was there for a convention which the convention center is right across the street, so it was extremely convenient, but the restaurant and bar were not capable of handling convention mass business either.  Sad with some updating it could be a great place!",,,,,"['newest', 'nicest', 'need', 'place', 'downtown', 'without', 'breaking', 'budget', 'night', 'race', 'clean', 'rooms', 'hot', 'shower',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-fort-worth-downtown-blackstone-fort-worth,Courtyard Fort Worth Downtown/Blackstone,3.5,$$,36,"We were fortunate to be visiting downtown Ft. Worth on a warm January weekend. We stayed at the Marriott Blackstone and it enhanced our experience. We had a corner room on the 15th floor overlooking downtown, the square and courthouse, it was fabulous. The hotel seems classily old with a historic feeling.  The staff at the front desk were friendly and welcoming. Yes it's a drag to have to pay to valet park, but we accepted that it comes with the territory of staying downtown.  The valet drivers were prompt with getting our car. Breakfast is not included but the hotel is attached to The Corner Bakery and they have a good breakfast. The hotel has a pool, it's super small.  The location of the hotel is perfect. We were in town for an event at the convention center, a quick walk away. For the rest of the time we enjoyed seeing the sights downtown, shopping, and trying a couple new restaurants. It was a wonderful weekend and a great downtown area.Nice large room. Clean place, has been modernized thoroughly. Historic building in a great location. The parking is strange, but I suppose they can't do much about being landlocked from 100 years ago. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the Corner Bakery that was on the corner, accessible by the hotel. They do charge an additional $25 per every vehicle. My wife and I had to meet there, so on top of the premium price, we had an extra $50 charge. If you don't mind the price and odd parking situation, recommended.Not a bad hotel for the price and location. There is a parking garage with a valet only option (watch them put your car on the car elevator!). The hotel is walking distance to most anything in downtown Fort Worth. The rooms are spacious and well furnished.Only complaint is the loud noises that the elevators make at all hours of the night.In for the week and Bf is sick. It will be nice to rest up. The room is fine. We did get to doubles so that's ok since he is sick he he. Nice computer area and extra plug ins. Just wish tv had a few more options since we r holed up in here. Does have HBO tho so that's good. Nearby is the AMC movie theatre and lots of restaurants in walking distance. We remember going to a few of these last time here. Downstairs cafe &amp; bakery good thru the hotel here. Got some arugula last nite for my coffee in the morning! Yum. Nice remodel.Fantastic location in the heart of Ft Worth downtown. Very close to all the steakhouses, the sundance square and the bars.  Parking is an issue, but the valet will help you.This Courtyard does not have a concierge / executive level. Nor does it provide the free breakfast that is standard with other Courtyards.  The wifi is free tho.The rooms are large, but it does look dated. The beds are great but the TV is tiny because the room is large.  Overall, a great place to stay in Ft.Worth due to its proximity to everything. I moved from another hotel to this hotel because of its location to all the restaurants.  If you've been to Ft.Worth downtown,  you will appreciate the fact that you do not have to get into a car and go somewhere. The lack of parking in the down town area is a major pita.We LOVE this hotel...Historic building which has been remodeled and completely modernized.  My favorite part of the hotel are the patio rooms at the corners.  It's so lovely to be in the heart of the City, near Sundance Square, and be able to go outside in the evenings, look at the lights, have a cigar with a glass or wine, or just sit outdoors and talk.  Where else can you do that in Fort Worth?  The fact that it's a Marriott hotel also allows you to use your points to stay.  They have a very nice bar in the lobby, and the indoor parking is interesting to say the least.  Who knew there were elevators for cars?  Also, Mallory and Renee take such excellent care of their guests!  If you get hungry it's attached to a Corner Bakery restaurant, which is awfully convenient.  I think you'll be most pleased with your stay here...we always have!Pros:- Location, location, location! It's located right on Sundance Square which makes it convenient for everything in the area and within walking distance of all the best restaurants!- A fun semi-retro decor. The hotel is historic but has been updated and modernized for a pretty cool atmosphere.- Corner Bakery is on the lower level of this hotel. And Corner Bakery is awesome. I do so love their muffins:)- The beds are pretty comfy... And that's important!Cons: -  Valet sucks. No, actually valet REALLY sucks. Just before you check out be sure to call down and notify them to get your car ready... Because they are slow (not really the fault of the workers -- but the garage is operated on an elevator system) and you will wait a while for your vehicle to be returned to you-- especially on a weekend at checkout. - To park at the hotel, it's $25 per day! - The hotel is old and, therefore, it's noisy. There is a lot of street noise, the walls are not insulated well, and you hear city noises all night long. I did not sleep well here - and I was 10 floors from the street level. If you are a light sleeper you may struggle.Overall, I would recommend this place and I would be willing to stay here again in large part due to the awesome location.Ok hotel, deceptive advertising.Called here, made a reservation. Upon check-in, the very nice attendant mentioned the pool on 5th.The site advertised the pool as did the person who took our reservation over the phone.However, the pool is out of order. Go somewhere that has a pool if you can't get free parking from a hotel downtown. Don't go here. Who goes on vaca to a hotel with no pool?Nobody, that's why we were deceived.Free wifi is slow unless you pay for a boost.This is a really cool hotel, situated right next to Sundance Square at a fantastic location close to many attractions in Fort Worth. We've had upper floor rooms and always enjoyed them (on our two stays). The staff are friendly, and they have a small bar in the lobby as well as an attached coffee shop. If you're checking out at a busy time, it might take 15 minutes or so to get your car (it's an elevator system to get the cars into the small main garage areas, and with two elevtaors only it can take a while), so word of advice: call them first. If you do happen to be waiting, they do provide you with complimentary bottles of water, while they do their best to get your car out asap. I highly recommend this hotel!My husband and I stayed here one night to celebrate my birthday and will never stay here again. After leaving the hotel we soon realized that the front bumper of my car had been significantly damaged. My husband called the garage and was told they would review the video from the security cameras. After giving us the run around for several days we were told there was nothing they could do since we left the hotel before making a claim. What?!!! So they can just wreck my car and hold no responsibility for it?! DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR WITH THIS VALET SERVICE!! Sadly, the hotel is nice, but because of this experience and no one taking responsibility, we would never stay here again.The Blackstone has  a beautiful, historic exterior and is in the perfect location. We spent a weekend in Ft Worth recently and enjoyed it.  Our room was very small, but ok for one night. We walked everywhere and being that we were exploring Ft Worth for the first time, this was a big plus. Front desk staff were very friendly. -It would have been nice to know from the front desk that street parking is FREE. We parked in the attached garage and it was $25. This should be a MUST piece of information at guest check in. -The exterior is so lovely, that I expected this aesthetic to translate inside, and that just was not the case. Other than the lobby, our room was a basic Marriott room and included popcorn ceiling and no period details at all. Shame. -Strange furniture arrangement had the TV to the extreme left of the bed, making it impossible to comfortably view in a relaxed manner. -The tap water was absolutely undrinkable - beware. Smelly and dreadful. -The bar downstairs is cute, but is seriously limited in the beverages that they carry - especially wine. -The pool area is on the 5th floor, but lacked any charm. The interior Jacuzzi might as well have been in a local gym. No ambience at all - sterile and smelled like Chlorine. -The interior courtyard terrace on the 3rd floor has the potential to be cute and cozy, but again, no attempt has been made to do so. Other than furniture and high cement walls, there is nothing. I'm grateful that the Marriott has preserved this hotel, but I'd like to see them take the next step into turning it into a place to be remembered for more than just it's location and Art Deco exterior.This is a grade C property and the rooms are tiny!! $200 a night for this !?!NOT. We walked in saw and walked out !No way !!!Plus the pool is closedWe booked a block of rooms for my son's wedding in July.  The location is great in Sundance Square.  Lots of fun things to see and do around downtown and close enough for a quick ride to the Stockyards.  I had family in from out of town that enjoyed going to that.  We had a large group and we were able to hang out in the lobby area. The valet's were pleasant, but getting the car took a while since they use and elevator for the cars, which is actually kind of cool.  The only downside was that the pool was closed, however we knew that going in.  The Corner Bakery downstairs was fine and we really enjoyed breakfast at Jakes across the street.  I got a kick out of walking around Sundance square on Saturday morning and seeing about 50 people enjoying a Zumba class.  It's a really fun area.  I would recommend the hotel and great location to others.Very clean and large rooms. Excellent service, inexpensive, and great downtown location. The staff made some great recommendations on restaurants and places to visit. My biggest complaint was that the gym was really small.When the valet brought my car around, it smelled like someone had been smoking.  Or something.  I really did not appreciate that.  The car was brand new; I had purchased it 24 hours before.  Also, they had the radio on, not on one of my stations.  I suspect something.  And there's not much you can do about this, short of installing a secret nanny-cam.  I don't trust the boys they had working there.Historic hotel located in the heart of downtown Fort Worth. Booked this hotel for New Year's Eve so I can be in downtown for all the New Years activities. Checking in was easy but the valet service was horrible. I had to drive around the next block and wait for the valet guy to park my car. The wait was at least 44 minutes and this was an inconvenience. I wanted to just go to my room and have valet park my car. Maybe because it was New Years Eve and the hotel was too old to have normal parking accommodations. My room was not spacious at all and the thermostat did not work. My room temperature was 67 and it was 30 degrees outside. I literally slept with my hoodie on because the room was so cold. Fortunately I only slept 4 hours here after being out for New Years. The hotel does not offer breakfast or coffee at all. This is the only Marriott I have stayed at that does not offer breakfast. I will probably not stay at this location anymore.With a family of four visiting Fort Worth at the end of July, staying at a place with a pool is a must. The pool described at the blackstone is an outdoor heated pool.  Unfortunately, at this hotel, their pool does not work.  This was not told to us while making the reservation, nor was it told to us during check in. There are no signs or notices anywhere in the hotel, with the exception of directly in front of the closed pool.  The ""alternatives"" given to us were a) next door at the embassy suites- whose pool is 3 feet eight inches deep, the size of a large jacuzzi, and is ice cold or b) the pool at the renaissance which is 3 blocks away. Fun.  We feel.we've been lied to.  To top everything off, the front desk was flippant and sarcastic about our complaints.Centrally located and the people are nice. Parking is an issue. Beds are WAYYY too soft. TV is local and not a good system. Bathroom was the size of a phone booth. This looks like an old independent hotel that Courtyard has taken over. I would bet that Courtyard does a much better job than would be done independently. I would prefer, however, a Courtyard a little farther out. I know what to expect. This place will do in a pinch or as a cheap alternative to the Worthington or the Omni.Upturned face.Very nice hotel for a building established in 1929. Nice modern renovation. Clean, nice little perks and friendly staff. Centrally located in the heart of the historic section of ft worth. Keep in mind, this is a valet only hotel.Amazing! Stay here. A staff that is dedicated to the comfort of their guest. From valet, front desk, amazing housecleaning, exceptional guest treatment. Clean, well furnished, comfortable, safe stay. Rest assured when stating here.","I like this hotel, located 3 blocks from the convention center and all major food venues. People working here was very friendly and knowledgeable. Pool was a little small, and so the gym, but location is perfect to run to the river and park near by (about 6 mile jog) Parking attendants were really awesome, I love it when my car is ready when I call ahead...seems these type of basic service become foreign in some cities.The only downside was my colleague and my key were deactivated by 11:00 (we had Marriott status and should've given us access until noon), so had to get keys reactivated...other than that, all went well. I also recommend not eating at the food joint downstairs, they are kinda expensive and food wasn't that good. I'd recommend the venue across the street, they have much better food and service.This is a beautiful older hotel. We were very impressed by everything. The staff was amazing the room was beautiful we had a nice view it's proximity to everything in downtown Fort Worth is wonderful. For an older hotel you never really know it I would definitely recommend this hotelThe staff was top notch from when the valet took my car to checkout.  Room was clean and had everything you need, Comfortable bed, shower pressure with consistent Temp, reliable Wireless connections, and quiet.  Lots of dining &amp; Entertainment choices within walking distance. The only complaint is the cost to park a car without many alternatives in the area.I'm sure it would've been a better experience if the hotel wasn't under construction/renovation... We selected this hotel to hold our meeting; meeting space, food and sleeping rooms but wasn't informed that they were under renovation.We arrived and they pretty much just had a front desk; no hotel bar or lounge area... just some couches in front of the elevator.  Although we were greeted pleasantly, I wouldn't have booked here if I had known.They charged me $229 a room... and again, for a location under construction, I would think that was high.  Renovated rooms were nice though but again, $229.?  Meeting space was set up accordingly but have to say, it was a bit snug for 38 people.  Breakfast, breaks, beverages and lunch were pleasant and for the most part on time.  During our meeting, there was some construction noise which was quite annoying; they couldn't find the source so it would come and go during the meeting... again, annoying.Location is centralized in Sundance Square which is a plus.  Staff is on point and very accommodating which was definitely a plus.I would come back to see the final product of renovation but not for $229.This is the best court yard I have ever stayed in. (I stay at least 50 night a year at Marriott, so I would know) What made it so good. Was the staff and the location. Everyone from the parking staff to the front desk were outstanding. I even found a Red SoX fan with the parking staff. The location down town was awesome. A real fun area to hang.The hotel also has a great history to it, if you take the time to learn.I had to double check the address to make sure I was reviewing the same hotel as some of the others. My family stayed here 4/20/2013. We came to town to attend the opera at Bass Hall. When we checked in, they didn't have one of our two rooms ready. We gave them a phone number to contact us when the room was ready and proceeded up to our one room. No one ever contacted us about the room. Two hours later, we checked at the front desk on our way out to eat and the room had been ready for a while. The person claimed the phone number didn't work and apparently didn't think to call us in the adjoining room they had already given us.The quality of the hotel and rooms was mediocre. The furniture on the outdoor terrace on level 3 had burn holes all over (and there were 3 staff members laying on the couches smoking out there even though smoking was markedly prohibited that close to the door).But the overshadowing experience was that the staff didn't care about us or much about anything. The best part of the whole experience was the valet parking staff, who were on their game.Overall, I would not come back here. We saw a couple hotels nearby that we will try next time , the Ashton and an Embassy Suites.One last note -- I know this will not apply yo many, but I generate a lot of body heat when I sleep, and they use those memory foam mattresses that trap heat in. Not everybody has this problem (everyone else in my family slept great), but I ended up sleeping on the floor because of this.There's my two cents, hope that helps.Don't ever leave your car with these people.  Mine was missing the lens cover from the side mirror and the broken part was INSIDE the car when I checked out.  Even though no one had access to my car except garage personnel, the hotel denied responsibility, yet could not explain how the  broken part got inside the locked car.  The garage manager told me ""not to say you are lying, but how do I know you found the part inside the car?""  Let me just say, I am not normally a complainer:  In spite of paying the rack rate for my room, I did not complain about being given a room across from the elevator and hearing the door ping until 1:00 a.m., nor did I say anything about the broken thermostat or having to wait until 3:00 p.m. to have my bed made.  Failing to man up and leave a note or call my room to let me know there was an incident is simply inexcusable.Good location and quality staff. I would stay here again.Comfortable and clean rooms, free Wi-Fi, and walking distance to the convention center and other places of interest. If you need a place to stay the night. I would recommend this place. The only downside is that all hotel parking is valet for $20 a day. See if you can find parking somewhere else if you need to park overnight.The Marriott (Courtyards) are my hotel of choice and love them all. But the Blackstone in Ft Worth is at the top! I spend 5 weeks there every summer. Couldn't ask for better accommodations and service. The staff is amazing!Yes, request a room away from the street if you want a decent night of sleep. Otherwise a great location at a reasonable cost. The location is within walking distance of many things in downtown Fort Worth. The staff is friendly and helpful. The room is spacious enough and the amenities are just fine. The shower is a bit weak but otherwise OK. I wish they offered breakfast like the Embassy Suites but outside of that, I like this hotel. I do like the free Wi-Fi.This hotel is in a great location if you are visiting Fort Worth for business or pleasure. Walking distance to a lot of cool places around town. The staff is very friendly...they were quite apologetic about there not being any cookies for us to eat when we first arrived on Friday. They also gave me a toothbrush because I had forgotten mine.The rooms are big and the beds comfortable. The lighting inside sucks and the alarm clocks can't be seen well during the day time because of the angles or something.The showers sucked. The pressure was inconsistent and the heat also wavered at times. Nice pool (too cold to go in for even us Northerners), it is 4 feet deep around and is about 10-15 feet long. There is also a whirlpool and a workout center.Nice place to stay other than the showers and cheaper than the Hilton for us.Not as nice nor as voluptuous as some Hotels, but for the price you get a damn good deal.  The people are always helpful, the rooms are always clean and the location for this hotel is directly in the thick of Downtown Fort Worth.  I will definitely return.  Just be mindful of the conventions that are occurring as this place fills up and sells out fast and frequently!I agree with other reviewers.  On the street side you will be annoyed with either street noise on the lower floors or nearby live music on the upper floors.  I had the pleasure of staying on the 5th floor, and didn't hear any of the live music, since it was blocked by a nearby building.  My brother-in-law stayed on the 15th floor and they said that the music kept them up till after midnight.Meanwhile, don n the 5th floor we (my wife and I) were annoyed with the motorcycles on the street -- something that they didn't hear on the 15th floor.  There are positives.  We were in town for a convention, and the hotel is close enough to the Fort Worth Convention Center for an easy walk.  I personally liked the Corner Bakery which is the lobby level restaurant in the hotel.Our room was on the small side, but the bathroom was nice, however there was no exhaust fan or vent.  The bed was AWESOME!  The employees were friendly and very helpful.Didn't try parking, as we took a taxi from the airport, but did notice a bottleneck with the car elevator.All-in-all, I was happy with our stay, and will stay again.  I will however request a room on the other side of the building.Little tidbit...when requesting your room, if you want to actually SLEEP..make sure you request one facing the courtyard and NOT the street.  My boyfriend's parents were on the street side and had to move our second night due to the bump bump bumping of music from cars down below and from the local bars.Beds are comfy enough...I slept well.  I thought the bathroom could've been a little nicer in that our room had kind of a funky mildew-y scent by the tub...nothing strong enough to deter me from staying again, just noted.The hotel is walking distance to all sorts of bars and restaurants which makes it kind of nice and you can get delivery to your room from Chili's and the Corner Bakery.Parking can be a pain if you're going in and out frequently as they have to take your car down below via a lift/elevator...so if you're in a hurry, find parking outside on the street.Free coffee and fruit in the lobby at all hours...The city lights twinkling at me from two walls of windows open to downtown below this 18th floor room persuaded me to add a fourth star. I am not sure when the hotel was last remodeled and while it's not sparkling new, it is clean and nice. Rooms are spacious, with lots of outlets and comfy beds. The hotel is right in the middle of downtown Fort Worth, which is great for walking to area restaurants, shops, Bass Performance Hall and area bars. My personal favorites for food include the Reata, the Taverna, Piranha Killer Sushi and for a greasy burger and a beer, Billy Miner's Saloon. Valet parking is not reliable - call and call again to double check that someone is getting your car and while they say it will only be five minutes, beware - they have an elevator garage system and can only load in/out two cars at a time. Valet is $10/day and self-park is only at minimal street spots or surrounding pay lots. Staff is incredibly nice, but seem to get overwhelmed when there are several impatient people around at one time. There is a Corner Bakery attached to the lobby which I'm sure is great for a quick breakfast, but today I'm going to check out Lucille's on Camp Bowie, which I heard is great.",,,,"['fortunate',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-fossil-creek-fort-worth,Fairfield Inn & Suites Fossil Creek,4.5,$$,13,"To echo others, the staff here is excellent. The breakfast room is very clean and the selection of fruit was first rate.One of the best deals in Fort Worth!  The Staff makes the difference!!For starters, it's one of the least expensive hotels in the city!If there is construction, they put you on the side away from it (quiet).If you arrive late, they leave the fruit, snack bars, oatmeal, and tea out.Indoor pool as well!If you are looking for clean, safe and inexpensive you might have several options.If you choose this one, you will NOT be disappointed.5 STARsI've stayed here at least a couple of times a year for up to 10 days at a time for several years.  Staff is always nice.  But...  like all Fairfields they start out nice and then just slowly decline.  It's not the place it used to be.  I've had my last stay.  2 roaches in the bathroom before I went to bed and then one running across the bedside stand when I woke up.  I told them at the desk and they were horrified.  They asked if I wanted to change rooms and I said no, it was my last night and DON'T FUMIGATE THE ROOM.  I got back to my room and the sicky sweet minty fumigation was worse than the roaches, one of which ran across the bed as I walked in. They gave me a different room and I drug all my stuff off to the other room for my last night.  I got an apology letter under the door that night.  I really expected a better response.  Just not what it used to be...Stayed here for a brief night while visiting dad in the hospital nearby. Since all my other visits consisted of only interacting with my parents who lived there, this is the first time I truly experienced the warm hospitality of Texans. The staff is approachable, warm and incredibly efficient. Upon seeing I'm just a solo traveler who has booked for a double room, I was offered to be upgraded to a king bed suite. The room itself is comfortable and immaculately clean, with a living room area and a bedroom area. The staff was also very willing to help when I asked for directions to certain places and pointed me to the most direct way of getting there, patiently with details. The breakfast was good with pastries, hard boiled eggs, make your own waffles and variety of oatmeal and fruits.Even though it was a brief one night stay, Fairfield Inn made my rather stressful trip very pleasant with its professionalism and hospitality.Parking and breakfast is complimentary.If you're ever in Fort Worth, stay here.This hotel has the best customer service and I would stay here over and over again. During my stay, there was a guy named Rain who worked at the front desk. He was patient and very kind. I work in customer service and I know how trying some days can be. He was awesome! I hope his boss is reading this so he can get a raise.The customer service from the front desk associates is the reason I am giving them a 5 star rating. Customer Service is everything. Their hotel was also, clean and comfortable.If you are looking for a nice place to rest, you should definitely stay here.The Staff makes the difference!!OK, most Fairfield Marriotts are similar, right?  Well this one, with one exception, has a staff that makes it a very enjoyable place to stay.  They remember you or recognize you from prior stays.  Front desk staff is helpful as to suggestions and meeting a traveler's needs.  Last recent stay (allowed me to check in early so I could leave some things in the room since it was ready).  And even though I was waiting in line for a woman to ask the front desk person a bunch of questions, I appreciated the service they were giving her.  They were full or booked solid.  She offered to help the lady find another place, as she had no reservation (made calls) and gave her advice on cabs and cab fares to a convention or meeting she was going to.  Very friendly even though the lady tried and TRIED to get her to find a room for her at the full location.........LOLMy only exception was the lady who was handling the breakfast situation.........she seemed a little overstressed.  Would not assist with getting a tray for bringing back food to the room even though I was open to using anything makeshift.  Not the usual lady that has been there who was helpful.  But it wasn't THAT big a deal; just stuck out in my mind since everyone else, including housekeeping staff is friendly and helpful.Now that winter has started rearing it's head, I think the inside pool is a nice feature.  I don't think you would go wrong by booking this hotel if you have business in the area or Fossil Creek area of Ft. Worth.Stayed here from June 28, 2014 thru July 1st.  We had the suite with the lounging area and considering our stay, was a nice feature, because we didn't have to sit on the bed, when the room &amp; it gave the room a bigger feeling. We found the bed &amp; pillows very comfortable, so much so, it was easy to fall asleep and sleep in on the one day we had. The hotel does have a washing machine &amp; dryer, which was great, because we just came off of 3 days on the road then being in a hotel plus we would be another few days before our moving truck would arrive.  (We were relocating from CA to TX) The hotel had complimentary breakfast and the lady monitoring the breakfast area during weekend was actually servicing the area, and was helpful.  However, the weekend day lady, could only be bothered with a ""good morning"" and then standing there watching ""her tv show"" flip this house, or some show of that nature, as she told another guest,  she was not concerned if there was coffee, if the muffins needed to be replenished or anything else of that nature.  But she was good at holding up the wall and watching tv.  Wow what a good paying job she had!!!  My biggest complaint was that the hotel hallways, were is damn hot.  I glanced at the thermometer one day as we walked down the hallway and it was 82!  It is quite a shock to go from your cool room, into a sauna like hallway.  It would be nice if the hotel could set the thermometers a little lower is the hallways are cooler. The ice machines put off a lot of heat themselves and I'm sure the hotel isn't thinking of that,,,,or maybe they are, The staff at the front desk are ok in friendliness.  There was ONLY one older woman, with long whitish hair that greeted you every time with a nice smile and said hello, as you came off the elevator or in the front door!!  She  always acknowledged your presence.  Kiddos to her. I would recommend this hotel &amp; I would stay there again..... But I think the hotel could make some minor improvements &amp; get the ""wall , tv watching person"" out of the way!!OK, don't get me wrong, this is not the Ritz, but for value, the rating is true.  The staff here is amazingly nice, always trying to help you.  They are kind.  The breakfast is one of the best I have seen for type of hotel this is.  We stayed here for one week, visiting our daughter in Ft. Worth, and it was a wonderful place to stay.  The beds are Marriott beds, so you know you get a good sleep.  The place is clean, well maintained, put that together with the staff, and it gets 5 stars in my book.Oh, forgot the warm choc chip cookies at night along with the coffee always there for you.  Never seen that before.  Papers for you every morning, the list goes on...Stayed here for two nights with a group of my students for a field trip. It was my first time in the area and I was impressed with the specific directions the hotel gave to get around the construction. They gave me a room in proximity to both of my student rooms (as requested) so that I could keep an eye on them; which was very nice. When my students realized a few of them forgot toothbrushes, they had some for them to use at the front desk. The people who worked the front desk for our entire stay were great -- even giving awesome directions to the workshop we were headed to and helping out if we got lost and needed to call them. They made check-in and out very simple and the breakfasts they served both days we were there were great and always fully stocked even though the hotel was very full! I would highly recommend them if you're looking to stay in this area.Really good place, only bad thing is the highway is getting worked on so you kinda need to know how to get around the back roadsHere with a soccer team. And what a great stay. Lovely staff. Great room. I requested a micro wave - no problem! Fridge in room actually gets drinks very cold! Wish all our soccer trips used this hotel.Here for a night or two. And I can't express how friendly and courteous the front desk person is. Would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this hotel....Sure, a Fairfield Inn is a Fairfield Inn, but the little touches make all the difference.  Such as leaving the fruit, snack bars, oatmeal, and tea out in the breakfast area for late night arrivals.  Soft cookies at the front desk are very nice, too!Clean and safe and plenty of free parking.",,,,,"['echo', 'others', 'staff', 'excellent', 'breakfast', 'room', 'clean', 'selection', 'fruit', 'first',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/microtel-inn-and-suites-fort-worth-2,Microtel Inn & Suites,3.0,$,13,"A very clean and comfortable stay.I came across a deal for a suite at this Microtel and decided to give it a shot. The suite came with a small kitchen, a jacuzzi and a couch. The room itself was very roomy and not only clean, but fresh as well. The jacuzzi was shaped like a red heart, as shown in the photos. The only minor gripe was that the jacuzzi didn't work at first, but after some time it finally kicked in.For amenities, there wasn't much more you could ask for. A large, flat-screen TV, microwave, extra sink, free wi-fi, full-sized ironing board, plenty of cabinets and several chairs for additional seating. There was a good variety of breakfast options in the morning.The standard prices for rooms are a bit steep, but if you can take advantage of a special offer, then you may be able to grab a nice room for a great value here. Check your third-party apps for a deal. Expedia offered rooms for 40% off, which was outstanding.This Microtel could have gotten five-stars if it were not for a few other minor complaints. The toilet paper was on the opposite side of the bathroom from the toilet, meaning not within reach. The room door didn't close all the way unless you forcefully slammed it closed. As mentioned, the jacuzzi was temperamental and that seems to be echoed from other reviews as well.All in all, I would come here again given the overall experience and value.Been traveling the U.S. For the past 3 weeks and I can only afford Motel 6s. And this one is by far the best I've had. Big rooms. Decent price. Modern building. Free WiFi. Spotless rooms. I'm coming back.Stayed here as a last minute booking for a funeral.  I booked it online through Expedia.  PRICE: The price of $72 a night was good for a double queen room.  STATE OF ROOM/FACILITY: The room was clean though a little outdated with decor.  The shower took a really long time to warm up and I didn't want to waste water so a cold shower is was.  The breakfast area was pretty clean &amp; organized.  The juice machine did have a lot of extra juice in the drop tray but that was all. STAFF: I had a late check in and had no issues.  The staff was great &amp; got us the extra items we requested. LOCATION: The hotel is surrounded by other hotels &amp; businesses.  Right off the freeways so very easy to get around as needed.  Very quiet &amp; I felt safe.As part of my road trip, I headed down to the Fort Worth area to meet up with family from Austin.  My cousin booked the hotel, because it was close to things we wanted to do, close to I-35, and cheap.While I would typically stay in a hotel slightly more expensive than this, I can't really complain about anything.  You get what you pay for.  The hotel was clean was clean.  Rooms with two beds were crowded, but again, they were clean.  The staff at the front desk were not overly friendly, but they weren't rude either.Location was good.  Right on the 820, and close enough to the 35.Free wi-fi was good too. My only real complaint (and I guess I can't blame this on the hotel) is the other guests.  It was New Year's Eve, and this was the place to be if you were a 20 something.  People were bringing in cases of beer and other liquor.  The lobby was bustling with cowboys and cowgirls ready to party. My cousins and I stayed up til midnight with the kids, and then I went back down to the first floor where my room was and passed out.  I didn't hear much that night, but I was rudely awoken by my neighbors, one of whom felt it was necessary to ask his friends ""WHAT DAY IS IT"" and annoyingly shout ""HUMP DAY."" The walls are definitely NOT sound proof.  Be warned.But if you're looking for a cheap and clean place to stay.  This will suffice.If budget is only concern then this hotel might suit. Would prefer not to stay here again but it's the chance you take using a third party booking service on price alone.Hotel staff is rude compared to most hotels  and hotel though rather new is already dingy and odd smell.Room colors are too bright and they stimulate rather than help you relax and the lighting is too bright and only options are overhead. The mirror is a huge distraction and would be better without it.Side entrance doors did not work creating a security risk. Pool and spa were closed.No welcome guide in room and uninformed response from staff led you to believe there were not many dining or entertainment options nearby.I go to the Ft. Worth area a few time a year, and decided to try this place based on reviews at a hotel site.  I tried to check in a little early, 10:30, as I had to work late that day, and was told they had nothing ready yet.Once I did check in, the room was clean, which is critical, but older and in need of some repairs - old tube tv's and the amoire had hinges broken. The best part of the trip was their elevator breaking down, and having to go up and down 3 flights of stairs each time I wanted to go out.On the plus side, the room had a fridge.I have to go back to this area in June, and have already booked a different hotel.Also the area the hotel is in, is a little iffy. On the way out to work on the second day, was able to witness the police cuffing a guy they pulled over.  It was like watching COPS.The start was a very unpleasant experience with checkin {see tip} and the when we finally were able to check in they said that they no longer took pets!  I told them when we paid {we use Hotels.com} they took pets.  After confering with everyone she called the Manager who said honour it {duh!} and charge them $25 for the night.  That proved to be great insurance as the night clerk wanted to charge me the $150 penalty for having a pet in there motel!  My advice? There are a dozen cut rate motels within 10 minutes.  Pass up this one and go elsewhere.The hotel was whtat one would expect in staying in a decent non slezy budget hotel. I staying in standard queen suite which consisted of a queen bed, a tiny microwave and small fridge housed with a wet bar sink and in a cabinet that jutted out from the wall. There was also a sleeper couch, which had cushions that didn't even extend to the end out the couch to sit on, and I would rather sleep on the window seat/bed than on the mattress. However other than that, everything was great. The front desk was courteous and helpful, the elevator was quick, there was no problem being on the 3rd floor either. The location was nice. The breakfast was what I expected. The computer was nice to have if needed. I like this hotel chain, you get a decent hotel thats cheap on the wallet. In short if your looking for an inexpensive but decent hotel and you are not too picky about the little things, then this hotel is for you.Sheets were used, floor was dirty, bathtub was clean, towels were those thin mini-me ones, breakfast was ok, but hey - it was a free meal.  Overall, it's a good 'budget' hotel for a quick stay.My family stayed one night here when in town on business.  We booked the hotel through Priceline (last minute), and got a great price!  When we arrived (at almost 1am), we were very pleased with the lobby and quick check-in process.  The gentleman at the desk (which I believe to be the same one as the previous reviewer described) was very competent and helpful, even telling us that if we needed directions anywhere to let him know about 15 minutes before we planned to leave in the morning and he would print them out for us and have them waiting.The room we were in was nicely appointed, with a pull-out couch and coffee table in the sitting area, a kitchenette/island that divided the sitting area from the bedroom area.  There were no sheets on the pull-out couch, so I did have to return to the lobby to get sheets &amp; pillows, as well as extra towels.  I was helped quickly and courteously.  The room was clean and efficient, definitely happy with it for the price.There was no wireless internet, which was a disappointment; however, there was a computer in the lobby for guest use.  It was available all but one time that I was in the lobby (I went several times, as I was printing out information most of the night).  There were really only two drawbacks to our stay.  One - this is an entirely non-smoking facility.  I had not realized that until I requested a smoking room upon check-in.  Two - the lack of wireless internet.  The breakfast (included in the price) in the morning provided a good selection, including fresh danishes, muffins, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, cocoa, and more.Not my usual type of hotel, As long as rates don't break the bank. I try to stay in better hotels. Hotels near the convention center were 250.00 a night.  No thank you! So I choose this hotel crossing my fingers and praying that I didn't make a big mistake, at 32.00 a night my expectations were low. The room reminded me of my first  nice little studio apartment. No frills but everything was clean and in working order. Front desk was helpful and friendly and location was decent. I absolutely received  bang for my buck and had enough money left over to rent a car for my business downtown. This hotel is worthy of four stars because it exceeded my expectations. Heck I've stayed plenty of nicer luxury hotels and have been more disappointed. If you are looking for a room on a budget this place could fit the bill.My dad wanted to come with my husband and I to Texas to visit and look at potential houses. He made travel arrangements on Expedia, not really knowing where hotels were placed in accordance to everything else.We got to the motel after a long flight and driving from the airport. We are greeted half heartedly by a man who had a thick Hindu accent. We were told our reservation was no received, even though we had confirmation from them and even printed out the confirmation itself (good thinking Dad). So we're checked in after 30 minutes, which was ridiculous. We then headed to the elevator, which looked like it was haphazardly installed into the hotel, and even though we were staying on the 2nd floor, made note of the sign taped to the inside of the elevator doors warning those who were staying on the 3rd floor that there was a broken tile and to not trip...nice.The hallways were hot and stuffy, absolutely no attempt at ventilation was apparent. The room was small and cramped. There were two beds, an armoire, a desk and a rolling computer chair with some sort of brownish-yellow stain on the seat. There was a tiny TV on the desk and the room looked like there was too much furniture. Oh, did I mention the oh-so-classy tinted mirror on the wall where the headboards were? Very 70/80's ""bow chicka wow wow""...yuck. The worst thing? They have a ""tech center"" which is comprised of ONE (yes one) computer, which was occupied ALL. THE. TIME. I literally went to see if it was available 5 times in one day to print out our boarding passes to go home only to finally be able to print them out at 10pm after the two people who had been hogging the damn thing all day decided to give it a rest. When I went to the desk to ask if I could possibly use another computer to print the boarding passes, I was told ""Just tell them to leave"" WTF?? The ""breakfast"" consists of week-old cereal (corn flakes), stale muffins, and coffee. Don't stay here...you WILL regret it.For the price...if you only need a shower and a bed...it's the best value in the country.  I didn't know you could get a room for under $50 anymore.  The lobby is depressing..clean just really tired.  The rooms are clean, the bed was very comfortable and we had no noise or other guests issues.  We were there for a school event and the arena was less than two miles away.  We went into Ft. Worth for dinner both nights which was less than a 15 minute drive.  We were very pleased.  The coffee and breakfast are worth passing on...just get dressed and go to Waffle House across the parking lot.",,,,,"['clean', 'comfortable', 'came', 'across', 'deal', 'suite', 'decided', 'give',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-fort-worth-fossil-creek-fort-worth,Courtyard Fort Worth Fossil Creek,2.5,$$,14,"I didn't want to believe the reviews but after our stay I had no choice but to leave this review.  The checkin went smooth but that was it.  Our room cards kept getting deactivated which was a minor annoyance. All these things I could forgive and still would have given at least 3-4 stars but one thing happened that has NEVER happened to me before at a ""upscale"" hotel.  I left a nice shirt I had bought for the wedding we were in town for and in the rush to get out I left it in the closet, well I called at 1pm our checkout was noon and I was polite and was only greeted with rudeness and smugness I have never received before.  The so called ""manager"" who told me his name was MR MILLIONS was so rude and pretty much refused to even ask housekeeping if they had my shirt.  He had the nerve to say (being manager) that he didn't have the authority to speak to housekeeping and that he ""may get to it another day"" I have never been so disrespected especially at a so called nicer hotel.  My wife and I will not stay at this particular As an update: I did get my shirt back from a different customer representative Mrs.LING and she was very nice and everything that should've been presented to me the first time aroundExtremely disappointed.   I'm paying over $100.00 a night and the air conditioner will not cool below 65.  Someone in the Marriott organization made the EXTREMELY STUPID decision to keep the air conditioners from cooling below 65, even though I AM PAYING FOR A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING AIR CONDITIONER.   ALL of their air conditioners should work as they are designed to, none should be disabled so hat they cannot cool as they are designed to cool.  All Marriott has to do is charge 3 or 4 dollars more per night and that will more than make up for the use of the AC.  The window AC unit in all of these rooms  will not use very much electricity in an 8 hour period.   The fact is, that an AC actually cycles on and off during each hour of use so they do not run continuously.   In an 8 hour period an ac probably only runs for an hour or so and once the room temperature is reached it is very easy to keep it at that temperature.  Only a minimum bit of electricity is used to keep a room cool.     Furthermore,  only a very small percentage of their customers will ever run an ac below 65, but their lame brained decision to keep the ac units from doing their job affects ALL of their rooms.  They could have some rooms available in each hotel where the ac units are not disabled.  If they really cared about their guests they would have a system in place that met the customers needs and expectations.   Either set some rooms aside where the air conditioners are not disabled, or charge more per night, or do what most hotels do, and just don't disable the AC's to start with.  Years ago certain organizations charged people to use the toilet, usually it was 5 cents to 20 cents.   That turned out to be a very stupid mistake.  People, if they didn't have a nickel or dime, would use the bathroom outside of the stall on the floor.  Marriott's decision to disable their air conditioners is an  extremely stupid decision also.    Marriott has lost all of my future business,  and I am certain that it has also lost the business of many of its other valuable customers.  Just because they want to save 3 or 4 bucks.  If i was not paying for the room then i would not have a legitimate complaint,  but i DID pay and did not get what i paid for.  I feel taken advantage of and ripped off.   If i stayed at motel 6 i would have been treated better. Now that is irony.Excellent experience due mostly to staff.  Very friendly and helpful.  Clean rooms and great dining options nearby.  We stayed as a family and everyone loved it.  Would definitely go backI am giving this location a great rating for service! My company had a 2 day event location, Frank and his staff were attentive and catered to our groups every need! They recently remodeled...had Christmas decor and music! Love it. Bathrooms next to the lobby area were clean, offer computers with printers. They even faxed off some items for me! Service A+....I recommend you book your events here.stayed 6/28-6/29. I'm 6'4"" tall. Hit my head on Exit sign on 3rd floor. All other signs are lower. During shower, took off wedding ring and left in soap dish. Forgot it. Called 4 times and talked with staff. Was told they would call back in 15 minutes. They never called back. Called 5th time. Attitude of staff was not caring or showed concern for my problem. Stated that room was inspected before/after cleaning. Stated they talked with room inspector &amp; maid but no ring was found. I'm a Mason/Shriner and would not lie about this. Their staff has my wedding ring. Sent complaint on their website, was not called back. Front Desk Clerk Sunday morning was hanging out at Breakfast area (no free coffee or breakfast) and was mocking me and having fun at my expense due to my back being out.  Worst experience at a hotel EVER.They are undergoing renovation and in truth they warn you....but....I wasn't prepared to be at the Baghdad Marriott.  Jeez they didn't do one wing or floor at a time so the workers and the dust was in all the halls. My room was ""new"" but the door to the bathroom and its hinges were preserved from previous decades.  Maybe a nod to the old west??? On a good day this was an average suburban low end Marriott. During my stay it was lower lower end.  ps nearby restaurant included one called ""redneck heaven""...I wish I was joking. er...just whistlin' dixie!They try and offer extra Marriott points to keep guests but truthfully they need to do a wing at a time or just shut down and knock the renovation out.So, I arrive at 5:47 PM (I looked at my watch just to make sure) with my boss' boss. Pleasantly, I was informed that, as a valuable Platinum member, my and the boss' rooms were upgraded to King Suites. However, the rooms weren't ready. That is where I liked at my watch. How can rooms not be ready at 6 PM?  I did say rooms. So, we sat in the lounge for a drink while we wanted 20 minutes for them to prep the rooms  When I got to my room it was pleasant enough, but no trash cans in the entire suite. I got back downstairs to meet the boss, and there he is the front desk. His room still wasn't ready. We're not just talking that the bed wasn't made; the shower curtain was laying on the floor and a tool belt was draped over a chair. The desk clerk now comes up to verify the statement, but i guess he doesn't believe my boss, cause he didnt bring another room key. So, here is the boss carrying his luggage back to the front desk, and to his new room which is double beds, when I reserved a king. Now, back to my room. Pretty nice, but the bedroom door doesn't shut. Newly remodeled room, but no one checks that an interior door doesn't shut? Oh well. So, Courtyard...you get 5 stars for first impressions; but, you lose 1 star for not having rooms ready at 6. You lose 1 additional  star for My boss waiting 20 minutes for a room that was habitable. You lose the third star for doors not closing, not trash can in the room and just general attention to detail.Older setup.  Old TV's.  Place needs to be updated.  The people there are very friendly and the location is good for where I need to travel to on business.  I also get a business rate so the price is real hard to beat.  Please update the place!I stay at this hotel a lot.  It is what it is - a room to sleep in.  This time I took my wife and was a little embarrassed by the overall poor experience.  It seemed like something went wrong every day.  1st day our room wasn't made by housekeeping, 2nd day our room keys didn't work, 4th day our room keys didn't work.The worst thing happened on the 4th day.  One of my pet peeves is when people use their cell phone while they are in the middle of completing a financial transaction (at the store, the bank, a hotel registration, a rental car desk, etc). I was next in line at the hotel registration (when my key stopped working for the second time) and the person in front of me decided to take a call. At that point the transaction was over, the guy behind the desk was just waiting to thank the person before attending to me.  I asked him if he could start helping me while the other person completed their phone call and he proceeded to call ME rude.  Seriously?  The person in front of me takes a phone call in the middle of the transaction, holds the line hostage, and you're calling me the rude one?THis the worst hotel that I have stayed in! I came here for a second time for one week just to give it the benefit of the doubt, however I was not impressed at all! The room is clean and the bed comfortable, INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS WORSE THAN DIALUP!!! So if your trying to business I hope you have 3G!!! The gym is extremely small, I tried out the Hot tub both times I came here and the water was Luke warm and the jets barely work in the hot tub. The only reason I gave such a high score of two stars for this hotel is that the Breakfast bar was great and the service there was extremely good! And I ONLY mean the service at the dining area for breakfast. I don't think I will be staying here anymore, I might as well stayed at an economy motel, because the price is not worth it at all!!! Good luck!I stayed here for 3 week due to business. I flew out on the weekends and would be back by Monday. The hotel was clean and safe which are my biggest concerns. If your looking for the little extras such as internet, gym, or SPECIFIC toiletries this is not your hotel. GYM:The gym is very small, allowing little if no room to stretch. INTERNET: The internet connection is hit or miss because it really depends on the location of your room. At one point the modem in my room was not working, and instead of giving me a new one for the night, I was told I could go into another room and use that modem and they would replace mine in the morning. Although maybe they were just having a bad 3 weeks with their internet provider. TOILETRIES: I called the front desk asking for a shower cap and was told, ""I'm not sure if we have any."" and asked if the employee could go look and was soon told, ""yes we have some"" and was not offered for one to be brought up. Although it sounds like I wasn't happy with the hotel, it really was very clean and very safe as well being conveniently located to the company I was doing business with. It also had a really GREAT breakfast buffet with amazing service. The buffet is not included in the room. Also the hotel did offer 1 washer and 1 dryer for $1 each and provided detergent and fabric softener. Check in and check out was also very fast.Ok so after a horrible plane ride/night to the Dallas/Forthworth Airport (I didnt make it the first night and I ended up staying the night at the Houston Airport) I really expected to be disapointed again. I had to cancel the meeting at my job because I couldnt get there. And my business associate was stuck as well but she got to get stuck in LAS VEGAS....uggggggghhhhh  So anyway I get to the hotel and check in and was pleasantly surprised that not only was my room paid for but they upgraded my room. I still dont know if my company did that or they felt sorry for me because I spent the night sitting on the cold floor at the Houston airport. My room had its own jacuzzi/huge bathtub in it and i was done for the day. I think I spent most of my time in that tub that night. It was pretty flipping awesome. Luckliy I didnt really go out to check out the town because there was nothing to check out. There was a highway and then the hotel and thats about it! The nearest store was walmart and it was scary driving all that way.Its too bad that I had to leave early because my family was waiting for me and they are located in McKinney which is like and hour from the Hotel. But i truly enjoyed my short stay there. I would definitely go back. Oh and although I missed it they had a complimentary mixer dinner the night that I got there. That was a nice touch.There was plenty of parking and people were very nice. Oh and the entire Hotel was inside and so was the Gym. :)There was something about this Courtyard that seemed a little shabbier than the others I'd stayed in.Maybe it was the little things: - one room key vs two, - the oh-so-common AC unit that was poorly placed so it blew into your face as you sat at your too high desk for a too low desk chair,- maybe it was the cheap white Fridge cube, looking like a refugee from the Goodwill, that seemed to freeze everything solid even at the lowest setting- or the prominent insert with my room key stating"" Please be advised. This is a major metropolitan area. For your safety and security, please do not leave valuables in your car."" [now I fear for the safety of the car windows or the trunk being opened like a sardine can]- Or maybe while the cost of the room was reasonable, the normally complementary breakfast buffet was added instead [fair I guess if you don't eat breakfast]- Maybe it was the free wired Internet that was wonky (up &amp; down) for two days.- Or the show water diverter that stubbornly resisted budging to give me my shower--so much so that you could see the faucet downspout was sporting a fresh caulk bead covering where the spout was pulling from the wall.So I am left oddly uneasy about this hotel. My spidey senses are detecting multiple things that made me not quite pleased with my stay here.This Marriott is down at the heels and the service was not what I'm used to. When we arrived, we had to wait over 5 minutes for the desk clerk to arrive. She said she had been in the bathroom &amp; seemed a bit miffed that we were wondering where she was (we were wondering aloud when she appeared). Humorless is a word that come's to mind when I think about her. When we got to the room, the balcony door wouldn't lock (uneasy feeling), so we called the desk. She said they would give us a new room. Rather than meet us up there (which is what normally would happen at a Marriott, but probably didn't because she seemed to be the ONLY staff there at 4pm) and walk us to the new room, we had to go back to the front desk for the new key. The new room was fine - just fine, but I didn't like having to interact with the lady again. On the plus side, the bed was delightfully comfortable and we slept very well.We only stayed one night. The morning desk clerk clerk was friendly (a great ste up!), so we left on a higher note. I was a bit disappointed that there was no continental breakfast and that the coffee provided in the room was only enough for 1 cup of caff and 1 cup of decaf. That seemed odd - why not have 2 servings like most hotels? It just didn't FEEL like a Marriott. I felt a bit like a motel instead of a hotel - lackluster service &amp; a bit run-down.",,,,,"['believe', 'reviews', 'choice', 'leave', 'review', 'went', 'smooth', 'room', 'cards', 'kept', 'getting',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-ft-worth-cultural-district-fort-worth,Residence Inn Ft. Worth Cultural District,4.0,$$,18,"It was kind of a waste that I only stayed in this location for one night. It was definitely well set up for a long term stay with a 2 burner stove and a full kitchen area (with plates, pots, etc) and a breakfast bar. You could even get the hotel staff to do your grocery shopping (except for alcohol and tobacco).My room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the floor was really quiet. Breakfast was fine but nothing fancy. I did like the fresh fruit option. Check in and out was really easy and there were dinner options within walking distance, so that was great.Yikes. This place sucks and my experience sucked.- There was a lizard in our room. Wtf?- Gym is horribly stocked. It's so cramped it seems like it used to be a maids' closet that was hastily turned into a ""fitness center."" Missing several dumbells like the 25 lbs, which make it impossible to do symmetrical exercises..who wants to do Flys with a 25 and a 30?- Front desk staff is unprofessional. Bad attitudes, wearing jeans? No thanks. They were generally unhelpful.- Crazy ghetto neighbors... the conversation went something like this...""Yo b*tch, ima get a pizza""""Who you callin' a b*tch, ni##a?"" *indistinguishable yelling ensued* I know the hotel can't control that, but maybe check IDs and make sure those people didn't commit identity theft. - Next to an apartment complex which attracted some interesting characters to the pool area.- Lobby smelled like fart half the time..... my final contribution to this stinkhole ;) Overall we were so unsatisfied that we cancelled our last night and booked the Hyatt at DFW airport which made this place look like a cardboard box. I was looking forward to checking out the cultural district of Fort Worth, but this unpleasant stay definitely put a damper on an otherwise fantastic trip out to Texas!! Perhaps on a different night, this place would be a different experience, but it just was not enjoyable and won't feel the need to visit again..Pretty decent little hotel, for the price.With all of the amazing local restaurants, I'd probably skip their ""Happy Hour"" food (it wasn't impressive anyway).The rooms are clean, and the service was good.Free parking.Spacious rooms with kitchenettes (but again, you should be eating out - so many great places within walking distance from this hotel).Newly remodeled rooms and dining area.  Also, Lucy continues to provide excellent check in and customer service.  My family looks forward to our extended stay.Yeah, yeah.  It's a nice property and the location is good.  But there is an abundant amount of thoughtlessness when it comes to the details.  In other words, there were way too many corners cut for my liking.Here are some examples:-The bedside lamps don't have outlets in them so you have to move the large nightstands/dressers to plug something in. -The hotel internet not secured. I'm sure apartment dwellers use it and take up bandwidth because it was very slow. -Beds very low (think IKEA beds).-There was nothing in the shower to provide traction at the bottom of the tub, making it VERY slippery and quite hazardous. -Brian, the GM, didn't ask me a floor preference. The people in front of me got asked, but I guess I wasn't afforded that luxury, being the lowly state employee I am, on the government rate. Brian, you really shouldn't put young, single females on the ground floor next to a construction site.-The fitness room was tiny for a hotel of this size and there were no sanitizing wipes.  So gross. Do you see what I mean?  I travel a lot for my job so the details matter.  Needless to say, I don't think I'll stay here again.Great location. Some cool bars and restaurants near by. Also shopping very close. Rooms are good and plenty of room. Free breakfast is actually really good.Only thing I didn't like was the strong ethnic food smell in the hallways. Couldn't smell in the rooms but in the hallways it was strong.I was lucky enough to stay here 1 week for work! Great hotel!Breakfast was better than most hotels I've stayed at.Wifi had some slow moments but I was able to work from hotel when I needed. The location was great when I wanted to go to the river trail to exercise or check out downtown.Great location &amp; awesome rooms. I usually stay here once yearly for a conference I attend. Very clean with always a professional &amp; friendly staff. Beds could be a little softer, but otherwise the rooms are well appointed.The only negative here is their ""Activity Center"". It's about as big as a closet and consists of 2 miniature sized treadmills, a bike, and 4 small dumbbells. Last year they offerred free day passes to LA Fitness (On Crockett Str - 1/2 mile away) but not anymore. I purchased a 2-day pass for only $15; it's a phenomenally nice club. Bring your own towel though.We reserved a two bedroom a month in advance and we ended up getting only a one bedroom. The restroom lock didn't work, the toilet was a terrible low flush, and coffee maker wasn't cleaned, only thing done right was we had enough towels.Great hotel! I use to work for Marriott and as a result am extremely picky about where I stay. This hotel made me feel right at home. Everything was clean and in order. When I requested extra linens, no one fussed or complained and they were promptly brought to my room. My only issue was at breakfast... it appeared they had a full house so I tried not to think too much about it, but the serving area was a mess! There was cereal all over the floor and waffle batter on the wall. There was no fruit when I went to get some (that was all I wanted since I had somewhere to be). I hope that is not a normal scene...This hotel was very pleasant to stay at. It is nice and new and of course offers the free hot breakfast. The selection was decent and the waffle maker was in the shape of the state of Texas, which was a fun touch. The service was excellent. There is a hotel shuttle that will take you places around Fort Worth within a reasonable distance. The driver was very flexible and if you tip him well, he'll ""take care of you.""The rooms were nicely acquainted. We had a 2 bedroom suite at the corner. They would refill our bag of popcorn every day if it was eaten. The 2 bathrooms were nice and they are located in each of the bedrooms, so no common area bathroom. Of course the full kitchen and small dining area were nice to have.This place went above and beyond by letting us use a conference room at no charge for a surprise baby shower. They even provided us with drinks at no charge. The only reason this isn't a 5 is for the extremely small gym, but this is as close to 5 stars as you can get.We stayed here November 23, 2014. The hotel was very clean, nice rooms and in a convenient location to the places we wanted to go in Fort Worth. We had a suite with two small rooms, a kitchenette and two TVs, which was nice. A good continental breakfast was included in a very pleasant, light-filled breakfast room. We only stayed one night so did not get to take advantage of the kitchen or other amenities, but I would stay here again.Nice hotel, rooms were clean and well stocked, complimentary breakfast buffet was really nice-biscuits and gravy, eggs, bagels, fruit, yogurt, waffles, etc.  The fitness room worked for me-it is small but they offer a complimentary 3-day guest pass to the LA Fitness right down the street if you need a little more space.  The pool is a nice plus as well.  The beds are really the only thing that could use a bit of an upgrade-not the most comfortable mattress and pillows, but overall a good hotel.My go to hotel in Ft Worth when coming in town for TCU football games. Location is great. Not far from TCU campus. Also close to downtown F Dub. Tons of bars and shops within walking distance. I also like to run outside and the Trinity River trail is right out the door. So nice to be able to run with scenery versus the standard hotel workout room. Rooms are nice and spacious, typical Residence Inn style. Free parking. Staff is also friendly and fast at check out. Rates are reasonable too!Nice hotel - staff was very nice rooms and hotel are very clean. Very solid value. Pool is open till 11pm and rooms are nice.  Great hotel if you plan to bring kids.Exceptional!  You can't beat the value of this hotel!  It is clean and the people are so nice and helpful.  Parking wasn't a problem for us, but I can see how that might happen.  Trains do pass, but you can't really hear them.   This hotel was designed with business travelers and families in mind,  we were here for a week and had no problems the rooms are spacious and very clean. You can walk to the park, restaurants and shopping they also offer a shuttle to downtown.  We are looking forward to returning.This is one of the nicest Residence Inns I have ever seen. The hotel itself (lobby, halls, etc) looks more like a full service Marriott than a Residence Inn. There are plenty of shopping and dining options nearby, and noise was not a problem. My only problem with this hotel is parking. Upon returning for the evening, I was directed by a hotel employee to park along a curb adjacent to the hotel because all of the spots were taken. My car was fine the next morning, but I was nervous about it getting hit by another car or possibly towed.Great hotel, close to shopping and quiet. I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.",,,,,"['kind', 'waste', 'location', 'night', 'definitely', 'well', 'set', 'long', 'term', 'burner', 'stove', 'full', 'kitchen', 'area', 'plates',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-texas-white-house-bed-and-breakfast-fort-worth,Texas White House Bed and Breakfast,5.0,$$,20,"I had the pleasure of staying one night at the Texas White House Bed and Breakfast this weekend. I enjoyed my stay so much that I did not want to go home. It was so relaxing! Check in was a breeze and we actually were upgraded to another room because it was vacant which I really appreciate. Cindy was so welcoming and hospitable. You can tell she takes special care to make sure her guests are comfortable. She mentioned turning up the heater so we wouldn't be cold (as the weather has gotten chilly recently) And made sure to tell us where the extra blankets were. Parking (located directly in front of the property), wifi, and breakfast were included with the stay, which is a must for any bnb or hotel I will stay at. Our room, the Tejas room, was just lovely. The bird motif was apparent through out, and the room boasted bright yellows, warm browns, and some reds, oranges, blues and greens. The room accurately gave off a New Mexico vibe. The two chairs in front of the tv were perfectly comfy and great for lounging  in. The vintage desk had magazines, cards, a book about haunted hotels and Babs in Texas (oooo!) and suggestions for places to visit. The bathroom was spacious, with a soaker tub and natural bath products. We used the thick robes to dry off after our baths . And the bed! Oh man! Armed with 6 pillows and the thickest and comfiest blanket and mattress I have ever felt, I could have easily gotten lost in the comfort and never ventured out into the world again.There is a happy hour from 4p-10p with wine and small snacks downstairs in the main house. There were little bins with suggestions for outings and restaurants in the area and some fun board games. We loved sitting near the fireplace and admiring the art on the walls, made and sold by local artists.Upstairs in the hallway is a mini fridge, more wine, carafes of filtered water, and a Keurig. We loved that. I almost feel like I'm spoiling the surprise for potential visitors!If you stay in the suites behind the house breakfast can be brought out to you. Otherwise you can dine at the dining table, which we did. Breakfast was served and tea and coffee as well as small breakfast pastries were offered. We had the signature dish, the breakfast nachos and a small bowl of fruit salad. It was delicious, authentic Mexican food, (and that salsa was to die for) but it was not as filling as I would have hoped. Based on the website description I was expecting more for breakfast. I booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> because I have the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> rewards, but it is a good idea to book with Cindy- you never know when a deal may pop up!My favorite part of staying, besides for relaxing, was getting to know Cindy and the other family that stayed at the bnb. We actually hugged them goodbye! And during breakfast, Cindy talked with us about some of her cooking secrets which was so sweet--she's a chef!!! I have worked in Fort Worth for three and a half years and I loved staying here. Getting to know the city even better, from a different perspective as a traveler/local was exhilarating.I cannot wait for my next visit!First, the place is just plain beautiful. The architecture, the fixtures, the rotation of museum-quality art on the walls -- and we haven't even gone upstairs to the room yet.The Lone Star Room walks a careful line between tasteful and kitschy, but that line is -- like everything else -- bigger in Texas. It features a bear-claw tub, a real longhorn steer skull on the bathroom wall, and a king-sized bed with the softest sheets I've ever slept on.The owner and manager, Cindy and Mindy respectively, are both charming hostesses who go out of their way to accommodate guests' requests, whether it's a special order for breakfast or permission to lounge around the parlor long after checkout time to wait for a ride.If you're visiting TCU, staying at the Texas White House is a no brainer. Do it! If you're staying downtown, you'd be well-advised to consider it. Sure, you could be a couple miles closer to your client site, but this is worth the short trip. And by all means bring your significant other!This is a weekend get away we will repeat. We stayed in the Tree House room. It was beautiful and quiet. The sauna and jacuzzi tub were a huge bonus. Breakfast on Sunday morning was delivered to our room and was delicious. Thank you for creating this amazing space.Was looking for a cheap hotel for a three day stay in Fort Worth . Since the stay between flights was, I decided for the Texas White House Bed and Breakfast . The hotel is located centrally , with approximately 30-minute bus rides from the nearby airport bus station is relatively easy to get to Santa Monica / Venice, UCLA Area and Hollywood. Was by bus in the Getty Center, to achieve more complicated, here really lends itself to a rental car, as well as for Downtown. The rooms were straightforward, decorated the hotel clean and typically American - wooden furniture and decoration. Friendly staff. But the pool is at the back does not deserve the name, much too small and way too much concrete around it ...I  was a vendor at a convention in Ft. Worth. The staff was so accommodating to assist me with all my needs to get ready for my show. The rooms were charming and very clean. Breakfast was lovely. There is no comparison of this property  to a chain hotel. The staff is at your beckon call to provide you with the best experience possible. Free breakfast and parking with a clean charming room? That is not at all what you get from a chain hotel.This my first time staying at a B&amp;B and I don't even want to stay at another hotel ever. Cindy made me feel like home. When I first got here I was worried about not being able to find a parking place but don't worry they have plenty of parking spaces. Cindy made an awesome breakfast this morning. During the week she makes breakfasts at times requested by guests. On the weekend breakfast is served at 10 am. I highly recommend this B&amp;B.I can't say enough good things about this B&amp;B. Granted, I haven't stayed in one since I was a kid, but it delivered everything I expected for our 10th Anniversary overnight. We stayed in the Treehouse, the second story of the guest house.  A queen size bed, a small sitting area, an ample closet, a wooden Sauna, and a nice bathroom with a large Jacuzzi tub. The bed was very comfortable and plush, with loads of pillows. The sauna (dry, with water and hot rocks for steam) easily fit two people. With a tall bench about 5 1/2 ft wide and a more narrow bench below, more for your feet sitting up and not as seating on its own. Jacuzzi tub was larger than many I have seen. I'm 6'4"", and I could sit in there with my wife and still be underwater. The outside stair landing has a couple chairs and a small table, and was private enough to sit out there in our robes and enjoy he perfect weather. The grounds are covered with tall, mature trees and the fence is lined with tall shrubs. Nice lawn with a gazebo, and flower beds and sitting areas. The flowers were in process of being planted during our spring stay, but I'm sure they are very nice. Breakfast was two tostadas, one with chorizo and eggs, and one with red bell pepper and (Hatch chilies?), some guacamole and fresh berries. Very tasty, if not the most inventive menu. The room also had a split of Asti Spumante, a growler refilled with sparkling water, a Keurig with coffee and tea, and a few biscotti and chocolates/cookies. We also got a couple homemade scones when we checked out. We checked in at four so we could enjoy the evening there, since checkout is the standard 11am. They asked when we wanted breakfast and they delivered it to the room with some orange juice.   It's about a five minute walk two blocks up to Magnolia Ave. which offers bars and restaurants mostly with a few shops. We had dinner at Ellerbe, which was phenomenal and the recommendation of Cindy, the owner of the TX White House. If you're looking for a relaxing place to spend a night, this place is a great spot.My fiance and I were long term guests at The Texas White House so I feel we have a pretty good knowledge of this B&amp;B. For starters, the location couldn't be more perfect. The B&amp;B is walking distance to some great local restaurants. The neighborhood is safe and we frequently walked around early in the mornings and later in the evenings and never felt uncomfortable. If you aren't sure of where to have dinner the inn keeper, Cindy, is more than willing to make some great suggestions. Speaking of Cindy, she is wonderful! She treated us like family and was so welcoming. Her breakfasts are delicious and she always has tasty treats out in the common areas for a quick snack. We stayed in the carriage house (a small house in the back of the property), which is perfect for a quiet, cozy getaway. The bed linens are AWESOME...I seriously need to purchase a set because they put my $300 Ralph Lauren sheets to shame. I truly can't think of anything negative to say. It was the perfect extended stay and anytime we are back in the DFW area, this will be our B&amp;B of choice.My wife and I wanted a special place to stay the night of our wedding, and the Texas White House did not disappoint! The owners of this property are excellent, and they offer a certain amount of flexibility you just can't get at a hotel. Also, anything we needed they were able to accommodate - their customer service is top notch.I particularly liked the breakfast they brought to us, everything was cooked fresh and tasted delicious.  We also loved the fact that the room had a sauna in it (very unique) and that the business was locally owned.  We will be visiting again soon!My stay at Texas White House B&amp;B was wonderful!  The Land of Contrast room was like staying in your own bedroom.  It was roomy with soothing colors, bed was very comfortable, and bathroom was huge.  My favorite part of my stay was relaxing in the clawfoot bathtub :)My stay was peaceful, relaxing, and quiet.  The whole house is really cute. Cindy was very accommodating.  I would stay again, absolutely!My boyfriend and I had such a great experience at this B&amp;B! Both the owner, Cindy and the woman that helped at the house were so charming and knew how to create an amazing breakfast! They are also amazingly flexible and exemplify great hospitality.The rooms are all decorated with a unique sense of style and they don't skimp out on the little details but really make you feel at home. It is also located within walking distance to shops and restaurants on Magnolia street.I highly recommend this place and hope I have the chance to visit again.All I can say is AMAZING!  Our anniversary weekend started off with bad traffic, having to turn back home to give the car seats to the babysitter, and more traffic.  But Cindy was so kind and so hospitable.  She met up with us at the BnB at 730, gave us a quick tour, and checked us in.  Even gave us a bottle of bubbles, totally unexpected.  She made our crazy weeks heading up to this weekend all disappear.  The place is beautiful, and the garden is gorgeous.  Breakfast was amazing, and so was everything else.I never thought of a BnB in DFW area, but this place is definitely a gem.  I will come back, and will definitely recommend this wonderful, relaxing hidden gem to anyone and everyone.I travel three times a month for work and while I enjoy the perks of hotel chain points,  it gets exhausting after a while so I finally decided to try something different last month.   I booked the Tree House room which was exactly what I needed.  Peace and quiet,  a relaxing room within a relaxing environment and wonderful hospitality.  I returned this month and plan to frequently.   Highly recommend this gem.  Great food,  great location and the Tree House room is perfect for R&amp;R for one or for a couple.  Thank you Cindy for a wonderful first B &amp; B experience.We greatly enjoyed our stay at this quiet, classy bed and breakfast. It's close by for restaurants and shopping - several places are within walking distance, including a nice coffee shop. The staff and owner were very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was delicious both mornings and we were surprised by the extra wine, coffee and tea provided for us throughout the day. We stayed in the Land of Contrast room, which had a huge bathroom, comfortable bed and claw foot tub. We definitely will be recommending this place to friends and family and hope to visit another time ourselves!I stayed at the Texas White House Bed &amp; Breakfast in April while attending a workshop at Texas Christian University. Everything about the experience was wonderful. Grover and Jaime McMains were so hospitable, and one of them (or perhaps both) is a great cook. For breakfast, I had sliced pear with cinnamon and sugar, freshly baked pear bread and a sausage and egg souffle-type dish. And I know to whom to attribute the decor: Jaime. She has great taste. My room was decorated with carefully selected antiques and all the comforts you could ask for. And the bed, oh, the bed. So comfy!The location was also great. For dinner I walked to a restaurant on Magnolia, TCU was just a five-minute drive away, and the B&amp;B is pretty close to I-35 (and you don't have to go through downtown if heading south), so I was able to miss a good chunk of the rush-hour traffic. I would definitely recommend staying here.Just stayed their over the weekend for a wedding reception.  It could not have been better!!!!  To start, the food was exceptionally good, filling, genuine home-style classics prepared with the absolute freshest ingredients and a lot of love.  The presentation and platting were perfect.  Never too sweet, or too fatty or salty.  Very nicely balanced and delicious!  The service was amazing.  The new owners, Javier and Cindy, are lovely and really make you feel right at home.  They were very engaging, very polite, and really really love what they do, which comes through in everything they are doing!  From giving great directions and ideas of places to see, to telling great jokes, they were always there with a wonderful smile.  They are laid-back, and yet you can really see how hard they work to make your experience the best it possibly can be.  The room was spectacular!  It was exceptionally clean and very tastefully decorated; a mix of modern simplicity and eloquence with a flair of traditional Texan/western themes.  Think modern luxury meets longhorns and spurs.  The room amenities were great; flatscreen tv's, cable, DVD player, i-pod player, refrigerator, a spacious bathroom complete with Jacuzzi bathtub, and a really awesome AC/heating unit.  The bed was incredibly comfortable!  I get lower back pain from sleeping on too cushy of mattresses.  The bed was the perfect combination of comfort and firmness, allowing me to sleep the whole night through and play the whole next day with zero back issues.  I highly recommend the Texas White House to anyone, and would love to stay here again.Beautifully decorated, super comfortable bed, really peaceful and serene place to stay. Lots of really tasty and highly-rated restaurants that are just walking distance from this place, too. I highly recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to stay at just a regular hotel. I stayed in the Tejas room and it was perfect. Big kudos to this place!Before our daughter was born, we stayed at the Texas White House on our anniversary nights. In fact, we even stayed here when I was pregnant. On that trip, I fell asleep around 7:00 p.m. and can attest to the comfort of the bed since I was five months pregnant and slept all night! We have stayed in two rooms at this bed and breakfast; each one is unique and comfortable with their own bathrooms. Of course, I have to mention the food. They cook a filling, multi-course breakfast that is served in the main dining area. They will accomodate vegetarians or people with other dietary neeeds. Even though it's located directly across from Baylor, we always had fun kicking back with a glass of wine or a nice microbrew on the big porch. The Texas White House is a bit of an unknown secret in Fort Worth, but it is so worth the visit.I live in the neighborhood and whenever I have friends in town they stay here. The Longhorn Suite, has two beautiful rooms decorated in luxe-ranch stye. This seems to be the favorite! This is NOT your over- lacy, kitschy, antique-bomb just went off - Bed &amp; Breakfast. Just tasteful furnishings and extremely comfortable. Kitty-corner to Finn McCools Pub, as an added bonus.We Stayed here back in September and had a wonderful experience. The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the breakfasts were delicious. The owners were very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again.",,,,,"['pleasure', 'staying', 'night', 'white', 'house', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'weekend', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'home', 'relaxing', 'check', 'breeze', 'actually',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-fort-worth-university-drive-fort-worth,Fairfield Inn & Suites Fort Worth University Drive,3.5,$$,18,"I am a laid back traveler. I don't over plan. My bestest, however, is the absolute opposite. It works well for me because I know I'll be very well cared for and all I need to do is know where to show up and when and it'll be kick ass.A ""road trip"" to Fort Worth meant we just HAD to spend the night, right? Of course! So Megan found this hotel close to all the fun stuff we wanted to do this time, booked and all I needed was to plop down 1/2. This was a great little hotel. The room was clean, modern, and spacious. The bathroom was clean and perfect. We had more towels than we could use and the shower was hot and strong.Sometimes you just want a clean spot to rest your little head after a fun day, and really that's all we expected-- but this turned out to be way better than we imagined. Woot!Checked in late last night. Jamie at the front desk, was fabulous &amp; friendly even given the late hour of my arrival. Room was clean, besides the trains horn blowing, I had a good nights sleep. Breakfast in the morning is very nice. Wearing my Eagles hat in Texas...I was met with nothing but Smiles, Good Mornings &amp; How are you? Very impressed by everyone I came in contact with this morning. Compliments to the management, as well as the staff. Customer service is never easy...making people happy is sometimes harder than it should be. I will be back! Well done! Keep up the Good Work!My review is for a young staff member called ""AJ"".  I was at this hotel in March when it was snowing. I asked this guy at the desk, ""Do you have anything I can use to scrape the snow off my car windows.""  He immediately went outside to his OWN car and got the scraper. He was nicely dressed in shirt, tie, overcoat. He got soaked in snow while clearing my car. I kept saying, That's good enuff !  Go inside !  I tried to tip him $20 and he refused, saying, ""I just want you to be safe, M'am""This guy was awesome. You wouldn't get this kind of treatment at the Ritz Carlton.So after this whole ordeal the manager, Tammy, emailed me saying how sorry she was and she told me she would add 10,000 points to our Rewards account to make up for our experience. It has been several months now and we have not received the points and when I emailed her about it I was ignored. I was willing to give this hotel another chance but that willingness is gone now. I would steer clear of this place!We were told they had actual suites, but that wasn't the case. We booked the hotel for my God sister's bridal party because it was across the street from the venue. Wish we hadn't. Its too small!! Next time we will ask multiple times to make sure we're getting what we're asking for....:/When I stay at a hotel near home, I'm usually only using it for the bed.  This means I don't really pay much attention to amenities and I'm all over finding a good price.  Because of this criteria, Marriott is the first brand I check.  And this version of Marriott went way above and beyond my need for just a bed.Despite being $20 more than normal thanks to the Cowtown Marathon, this Marriott brand brought the fancy.  From the welcome gifts of a bottle of water and a tissue paper sack of Hershey's kisses for a Marriott Elite member (nice touch, y'all!) to the fantastic continental breakfast options (oatmeal *and* fresh fruit in addition to the cold cereal, doughnuts and make-em-yerself waffles - seriously!) to the make-up remover wipes in the bathroom, this Marriott impressed the hell out of me.Marriott staff is usually very friendly and accommodating and the employees at this location certainly lived up to my expectations.  I'm also a fan of the front door only being accessible by a room key after a certain hour and that's SOP at this location.In short, the Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites was exactly what I expect out of Marriott and it's exactly the reason I'm brand loyal.  Thanks for the hospitality, Fort Worth!Comfy and clean suites, located close to the main attractions  and restaurants but not a good location for daylight naps or light sleepers because the trains are in the front of hotel. Trains work around 5am-7pm Monday-Sunday.Stayed here for a conference nearby. The hotel staff was superb. When our shuttle to the conference was late the GM took a group of us in her personal vehicle to the conference so we wouldn't be late. From the fresh cookies to luggage storage...I was glad I landed here!Superior staff!  Was a pleasant suprise. Clean...friendly...comfortable. Will stay again next time in area.  Oh..and close to everything 'Ft Worth'This hotel is not good. Let me start by saying it is right next to the highway and a train runs behind it throughout the night. There is a lot of light in the room as well that are bright when all the lights are off. For example, the microwave, the smoke detector, the huge gap between the main door and the hallway, the TV, the clock radio. Rooms are too tight. We got no sleep. The rooms and bathroom need updating, as well as the pool area. Carpet looks bad. The breakfast area is super compact. We just grabbed food and left it was so crowded in the mornings. The one thing it has going for it is location, right next to the river and close to TCU. We've stayed here on two occasions and I will not be staying there next time.You may want to know that construction of a major building is going on 10 feet from this motel. We were awaken at 6:30 am Saturday by bulldozers, drills and hammers. If you stay here make SURE that you are guaranteed a room next to the river....unless early am wake up is ok for you. It was not ok for our teenagers on west coast time.Liked this place. I needed a last minute room out-of-the-blue and they delivered. Nothing fancy, but really nice and friendly. Quality rooms. Plus you can walk to Ol'South! :)Cozy night sleep for the money! Would stay there again.3.5 stars would work better for this rating.  Despite the age of the building and drab outward apperances, the interior was modern and comfortable.  As with a lot of hotels, common areas and bathrooms were hard to describe as completely clean.  I stayed in both a king executive suite and a standard room with two queen beds.Staff:The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The housekeeping did a quick, bang-up job.  One thing I did notice, though, was that, despite there being a sign saying to conserve, the housekeeping did not comply.  The sign informed guests who wanted to reuse towels to only place those on the floor that you want removed.  Not above using a towel more than once, I always hung it up, but the housekeeping still took it, replacing it with a fresh towel.Indoor Pool / Hot Tub:I went down to the indoor pool area for a couple of nights during my stay.  The area was nearly always empty, perhaps because of the time of the year.  I did laps in the pool and then retreated to the hot tub.  The pool was clean and cold, but the coldness wore off once I began my laps.  The hot tub appeared dirty and in need of renovation.  The chlorine burned my eyes once the jets were turned on.  I did not return to the hot tub after my first time.King Executive Suite:Roomy and on the 4th floor (top floor).  It was nice and quiet.  Living area with couch, coffee table, large flat screen TV, digital A/C unit.  Nice big comfy bed with dimmer lighting above the bed - I particularly loved this feature.Standard 2 Queen Beds:Standard room on the 2nd floor with 2 queen beds and no couch or living area.  No dimmer switches above the beds.  Flat screen TV, though not as large as the king room.  A/C unit not digital, so it was more difficult to regulate the temperature.  Being on the 2nd floor, there was a floor above me, and it was LOUD.  I mean, I couldn't sleep it was so loud.  Whoever was in the room above me seemed to compulsively pace the floor all day and night, and I could hear every last bit of it through the creaky floor / ceiling.  I hated it, and if I return, will request a 4th floor room.Location:I really loved the location, as it was near a lot of nice places to eat.  The University Park Village, featuring yummy places to eat and fun places to shop, was right across the street!  The Botanical Gardens and Fort Worth Zoo are right down University, as well.  And it was just a hop, skip, and jump to downtown Sundance Square.The rooms here are surprisingly nice for being a Fairfield - I thought they were particularly great for a business traveler.  Nice separation between working and living space.  The staff was incredibly friendly and patient with helping me find directions in the area.  The location of the hotel is not in a aesthetically pleasing area, as it is immediately off the highway.  However, it is incredibly convenient to tons of shopping, restaurants, and TCU (only 1 mile away).  Breakfast is free for all guests and the staff does and excellent job of keeping the food stocked even when there are conferences and large waves of people in the morning.  The hotel does not sell wine/beer in the market like many Marriotts do - which is only slightly a downside.  There is a Macaroni Grill 30 seconds away so it's not too disappointing.I booked this hotel through Priceline, wanting to be in the downtown FW area, and I totally lucked out! My boyfriend and I just wanted a place to hang out for a get-away, and this was perfect. We were close to all of our favorite haunts: the Botanical Gardens, TCU, Spiral Diner, Sundance Square. It's located right behind Ol' South (which is an awesome local restaurant) and Macaroni Grill, so if you get lost in the vicinity (since it's set off University), just look for those landmarks. Yes, it's right by train tracks, but I didn't hear any at night (thank you, A/C) and actually found them quite pleasant. But maybe that's just me.The rooms were cheery, comfortable and clean. (The photos are accurate and give you a great idea of what to expect. No surprises.) Mini fridge and microwave in the room. Free outdoor parking was also a plus. I found the desk attendants to be appropriately friendly, nothing over the top. I was on the 4th floor, overlooking the parking lot, and didn't have any problem with noise/hearing other guests.We were just looking for a place to lay around and relax, and this hotel definitely served it's purpose!Great hotel conveniently located off of University Drive and I-30.  This hotel is tucked behind several restaurants but provides walking access to great food, the Fort Worth Zoo, and a great shopping center right across the street.  It's also located directly on the Trinity River, providing super easy access to the Trinity Trails (over 30 miles of nice jogging/biking trails).The decor of the hotel was modern and very comfortable - TV's in the lobby weren't too loud and there were lots of people just hanging out and reading the paper at breakfast, enjoying the lounge area.  My friends and I booked a King room and a King suite and both rooms were excellent - beds were SUPER comfy, something I'd expect in a 5star hotel.  The hotel even provided great makeup remover towelettes, something that most hotels don't have.  The staff was very attentive and friendly and it seemed like everyone was in a good mood!  Dave Moran is the general manager - you could tell he takes pride in his hotel and made us feel very welcome and at home.  I would probably prefer to stay at this hotel rather than hotels downtown from now on because of this hotel's great customer service, prime location, and comfortable rooms.  Highly recommended!!Ahhhh perfect stay as always I have been here for many years and as always great place",,,,,"['laid', 'back', 'traveler', 'plan', 'however', 'absolute', 'opposite', 'works',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-fort-worth-historic-stockyards-fort-worth,Hyatt Place Fort Worth Historic Stockyards,4.0,$$,18,"Wish my wife and I were not passing through just for the night and that we could have stayed longer. The Hyatt is smack dab in the middle of all the Stockyards action and an easy short walk to whatever you want to see there. We arrived just at sunset on a quiet Thursday weeknight and snagged one of a handful of parking spots right out front. I am told they have a  much larger parking area out back. Check-in was quick and easy. The front desk staff were super friendly and helped us with directions to our nearby dinner place. They also filled us in on all the activities including the twice daily cattle drive that we would unfortunately miss. It had been a while since I had stayed at a Hyatt Place. I found the room very comfortable and enjoyed the little living room area. You can tell these rooms went through a lengthy design process as everything seems to be in the perfect spot with opening doors clearing furniture by like an inch. The room was fairly quiet but there are freight trains coming through there all night long. They do supply ear plugs in the room but we didn't need them. On our way out we grabbed a few things at the included breakfast buffet. They even had some hot items there as well. Nicely done.Came here for a conference. Really great hotel that is located in the stockyards. There is a shopping and dining plaza on one side of the hotel and a barn on the other side! I thought i'd be kept up by the noise but didn't hear a thing. The rooms are very spacious and clean. My favorite thing is the bed. Holy moly, I slept so well... When my alarm went off I literally thought I was at home for a second because the bed was that comfortable. Second favorite thing is the amazing water pressure in the shower. You know how most hotels have that soft water or drips where it feels like your showering in mist? Well here you're getting a proper shower.Staff is very attentive and they are on their A game with customer service. Great experience.During our 2 week stay in Texas this was the absolute best hotel we stayed at. I would recommend anyone who is going to the Stockyards to stay here. Hubby and I decided to take a very rare (once in 3 years) night alone when we were in TX. You walk outside the front door toward the street and you're in the middle of all the action. Basically you get to see a few cowboys get a bunch of long horns down the historic street. Afterwards there are several people on the side of the road with trained long horns taking money from tourists so they can take a picture with a long horn.There's also plenty of cute little shops nearby with unique Billy Bob's logo on it and interesting places to visit. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Billy Bobs!Don't come to Ft Worth and miss the albeit touristy Stockyards, but such fun.This is such a fabulous property. Get a room overlooking the stockyards high floor. This place appears to be brand new in 2015. Very modern and yet with a nice cowboy flavor. FREE WIFIFREE BREAKFASTFREE PARKINGALL SUITES? Clean &amp; modern.And they even sell drinks and food and StarbucksRooms are a bit small but beautiful.  Great bar with food &amp; everything else you'd expect from a hotel.I remember it was one of the best night sleep I have had at a hotel. The location was great walking to the bars at the stockyard the service was great and food was very good at the bar in the hotel and they had a saltwater pool which was better than most.the only item was the rooms were a bit small besides that everything was greatWe stayed here one night before heading to grandparent pick-up/drop-off for some summer visitation. The first thing we noticed and loved about this hotel... they have a saltwater pool. HOW COOL is that! As the others reviews state, they are smack in the middle of stockyards and walking distance to a lot of things. The hotel is decorated to fit the area. I find it funny that someone wrote a review and complained about the leather smell... Paalease dude. You are in the historic stockyards what would you expect. You are staying in Giddy-up country. Hotel was great. Staff was not as yee haw friendly as other Texas Hyatt's but I wasn't expecting perfection. The rooms are great, the beds are comfortable and we LOVED the saltwater pool!I am staying here for a conference downtown. I love this hotel and its location is so convenient to the stockyard attractions and a quick drive to downtown. Great breakfast and I don't have to walk to a Starbucks, it's here! Love the pool. Free parking. The only negative is that the hotel shuttle, which does take you downtown, does not run until 8am which is no good if you need to be at a conference downtown at that time.This hotel is located in the middle of the the stockyards. It is within a couple mins walk of many attractions. The hotel has a view of the stockyards or downtown Dallas Fort Worth. The hotel was fun and the staff is very welcoming. They have complimentary disposal headphones in the gym, which is awesome! Another perk is a large complimentary basket of personal items in case you forgot to pack them. Otherwise they allow you to borrow items such as phone chargers. Breakfast is also complimentary. They have a hot and cold menu. And you can't go wrong with a Starbucks cafe there. Parking is behind the hotel and requires a key card for entry.I stay here every couple of months and I am particular.  The location is the best part of this hotel.  It is in the middle of the stockyards area.  Walking distance to any place in the stockyards.   The hotel has a western decor.  Love it.  The rooms are your basic Hyatt ace rooms.  They have upgraded the bedspreads to very nice white cotton coverings.Great location, but always an issue here!  This time it was housekeeping issues and A/C problems.  Really nice hotel, but they need to get their act together with maintenance and housekeeping.  We stay in Ft. Worth every 6 months or so and I think it's time to find a new hotel.Nice place, staff were really good although at check in, she couldnt muster a smile.  come on, its your job to be friendly. if you arnt a friendly person, dont do that job. room was good, clean and everything worked as expected.  i forgot toothpaste and they gladly provided it. my favorite was the location in the heart of rodeo land.  i got out of my car and smelled horses!  enjoy!My wife and I stayed here last night...it was our second stay....I think they do a good job and the location is good...if you enjoy cowboy stuff and good steak your will enjoy.Smack dab in the middle of carnivore heaven- the Stockyards.  Within stumbling distance of all the restaurants and lil shops.  If you're a light sleeper- forget about it!  The train tracks are within a stones throw and the trains run randomly till the wee hours.  So unless you pass out from a drunken stupor I would not recommend staying here.Normally, I'd give this place three stars. However, I deducted a star b/c every time I stayed here, and walked through its doors, a smell of leather/cowhide would just punch me in the face. Gross.That said, the staff recognized me after a few stays (not sure if its b/c I'm probably one of few Asian regulars), and they were always pretty nice. Not the quickest of workers, but, still, pretty nice.This place is clean and has easy check-in/check-out. Important things in my book when traveling!  Plus great location and all of the staff that I encountered where very polite and helpful. Breakfast is exactly what you would expect for a free continental breakfast.  I did like that they had someone in the area assisting and cleaning up as the people grabbed their breakfast... definitely a plus that you don't always see.This place is ok. They have free apples.Great hotel, friendly staff, great and clean rooms.",,,,,"['wish', 'wife', 'passing', 'night', 'longer', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'stockyards', 'action', 'easy', 'short',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-fort-worth-hurst-hurst,Hyatt Place Fort Worth/Hurst,4.0,$$,20,"Great hotel with great staff. Hotel is very clean and room was spacious. We were traveling in for a Cowboys game and the staff let us check in early so we could rest up for the game. That was greatly appreciated. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because the breakfast wasn't all that great. I would recommend this hotel.We stayed here recently for a few nights. It's hard to write reviews when I have a mixed experience. The housekeeping staff were great - our room was cleaned and organized each day and I felt like they did a good job. For the most part, our stay was quiet, with the exception of an occasional slammed door. The elevators were pretty quick, granted we were only on the second floor. Breakfast was really good - there were lots of options, including breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal with plenty of toppings. Everything that I tasted was good. The highchairs were hidden, but I just had to ask and someone got one for me right away.For some reason, they have spotlights directed straight up in to the windows of the guestrooms. It wouldn't be that bad if the curtains closed all the way and didn't leave a gap in the middle for that bright light to shine in the room all night - no blackout for us. The thing that really upset me was when we came down to breakfast and sat next to a couple with a young daughter (she was maybe 2, but probably not even quite that old). The family themselves were fine, but when they left and their toddler had of course left a bit of a mess, an employee (whom I assume was a manager based on how I saw her interact with other staff) walked over and audibly said ""Oh my God!"" And then loudly called over to another employee ""Look at this. That is so disrespectful."" 1. Super unprofessional. There are a number of better ways she could have handled the situation. 2. It was a mess left by a toddler at a table there for eating at. It happens. It could have easily been my kids. In fact, I'm sure my kids probably left a mess. And I bet she griped about that out loud, in front of guests, to another employee, too. That really put a bad taste in my mouth for this place.Solid hotel at a solid price. Some of the design feels forced, and also as if this were a cheapo hotel that got a face lift and new name. The elevators are obnoxiously slow. Even the elevator doors seem to open slower than a castles gates. The breakfast the 1st day here's was on par, but when we hit the sellout weekend dates it lost quality and flavor. Parking is ample. Rooms are big enough. The staff cleans well. Overall it's hardly the best or worst hotel I've stayed in. Also the doors slam hard and loud. Thank god my daughter can sleep though anything.Some good points,  some bad. I wouldn't recommend and wouldn't stay again.Bad - Internet was 0.2Mb. Basically third world status and front desk didn't care. Completely unusable. Eggs and overall continental breakfast were disgusting and inedible.  Worse than any I've ever eaten.Good - Rooms are clean, spacious, and up to date.  They also have panels to plug in devices to the TV.  Bathroom is very tight but clean and nice.  Common areas are well decorated and up to date as well.Unwelcome stay at the Hyatt. Made a reservation for a king size room and got a two full size beds instead, when we brought this up to the front desk all they did was brush us off. Room smelled like urine and breakfast was mediocre at best.Very clean, and very comfortable!  A colleague and I stayed over night while we were in town for a gig at the adjacent convention hall.  The staff was very friendly, and the rooms come with free wifi and a breakfast buffet that was really pretty good!My family lives  in Hurst, this is a central location to all my relatives. Within fives minutes I can be in someones home. So of course it makes since to stay here! Easy to book, easy checkin and out, great rooms, very spacious, clean and fresh! We had fifth floor this time with a view, very nice! There is free breakfast, news papers, and for late nites a snack bar in lobby with fresh stuff!Staff is friendly, clean rooms, cental location.My family and I spent 2 nights (9 &amp; 10 Feb 15) and had a great time. There was a total of 17 of us in the group. They managed to get us on the same floor and our rooms grouped together. While we were visiting with each other, the management noticed that the lobby area was a little small for our group. So they opened up one of their meeting rooms and provided some snacks for us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food from their 24/7 menu was great! The breakfast that they provided each morning is the best I've had at a hotel. The rooms were roomy and clean. I really liked the sitting area in the rooms. If I'm ever in the Ft. Worth area, I would definitely stay here again.I had the pleasure of being the first guest in a newly renovated room.   The new couch has a sleek look, and the new tile design is fresh and clean.   This was a larger room and had a cafe table inside, and enough room next to the couch to store luggage for six people.    I love Hyatt Place anywhere, and was perfectly happy to be on a floor with lots of nice construction workers around...Nice rooms but DO NOT let them put you in the room 4 steps from the elevator and on the front side of the hotel.  The police station, construction, and the people talking coming out of the elevator make for 2 nights of no sleep.  Staff knew exactly what room I was in without even looking when I said ""thats a horrible place for a room.""  Did nothing but agree with me that it was a bad location.  Will not stay here again.I travel a lot. The Hyatt place hotels look identical on the inside. So far I have not found one different.Just spent a couple of nights here and was very impressed!  The room we stayed in was very roomy and very nice.  Breakfast was delicious and had a nice variety of foods to choose from :)Room was very average.   Hotel hallways were dirty and we stayed several nights.... they were never cleanedBreakfast was horrible. .. down right nasty.  Dirty dishes.... blehStay elsewhere.  There are two hotel right next door.Very Impressed.  Outstanding value.The hotel and rooms are clean, updated and quite modern.  Really like the separate seating area.  The breakfast bar was good quality with fresh fruits and decent selection.Service was also very attentive.  We will stay here again when in the area.I've had the opportunity to stay at multiple Hyatt Place's in and around the US. I've had the opportunity to stay at the one in Hurst/Fort Worth twice and cannot say enough about what a fantastic hotel it is.Both times have been before the Cowtown Marathon - although it's within 45 minutes to an hour driving distance, we prefer to get a good nights rest and get that extra hour of sleep. It's located off of 183 and 121, within 10 minutes from Downtown Fort Worth. All Hyatt Places were previously other Hyatt hotels that were completely renovated. All HP's have the same layout - walk into a nice plush lounge on the left side. The concierge desk is straight ahead, with a small bar and food area to the right. Rooms are fantastic - great leather L-shaped sofa in one room, that's also a pull-out bed. Small mini-bar and a desk also adorn this adjacent room. A 46"" flat screen adorns the middle of the room - visible both on the couch and the beds. A barrier wall separates the couch from the beds, just enough privacy if you're trying to get enough sleep. The beds are comfy, pillows plush. Nice granite countertops in the restroom with nice hardware. The soap is a step up above the usual hotel soap, as is the shampoo. It's not what you have at home, but it beats the awful normal hotel stuff that dries out your skin. The toilet and shower are in the same room - slightly smaller than one would like, but then again, you're not spending very much time in the bathroom.What sets the hotel well above any of it's competitors in terms of cleanliness, modernness, and amenities - the price. Regardless of where it's at, rooms average around $89 a night. I've spent a lot of time traveling for work, and stayed at various Hilton, Marriott, and Choice Hotels - none of them in that price range come close. Even their comparable hotels are at least $50-$70 a night more expensive. Hell, it's barely a another $20 a night over a cheap motel. You cannot find a better, newer, nicer hotel anywhere for this price. Regardless of where I go or stay now, I always look for a Hyatt Place. This place rocks!I just completed a three night stay and I wasn't overly impressed. We stayed Thur-Fri-Sat. The first thing I noticed is that the parking is quite good and the staff is quite friendly. My first impression of our room on the fifth floor was quite good. It was a fairly large and set up as a two room suite. It included a nice desk, small fridge, large sofa, big enough for comfortable sleeping and a nice coffee area with a sink and small stainless fridge. Quite a good first impression. However, as time passed we noticed issues. The carpet was dirty. The fridge couldn't get really cold but more than anything else the air-conditioning was loud and obnoxious. The bathroom is small, really small by American standards and the TV has too few channels. Then the breakfast Friday morning was almost inedible. Actually the worst I've ever had. Could it be that the ""good food was gone by 9:30? All the while we found the staff very friendly and very helpful so I think they are doing their part but I wonder of management or owners are trying to skim to much profit or have too much debt and don't spend enough money in some areas. Still there must be better choices.Very nice and beautiful hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. Very clean and comfortable.Excellent rooms, lobby, 24 food service, complimentary breakfast! It feels like a vegas hotel. Big screen TV, very very clean!! Love this hotelThis was the first Hyatt Place I have stayed at and I must say it is a really cool concept.  I've stayed in fancier hotel rooms and bigger hotel rooms but this was the coolest room.  Very modern furnishings and a large flat screen tv.  The staff were very friendly and helpful also.We were in town for a  reunion, and I was looking for a place that was close to our family. The staff welcomed us warmly and quickly checked us in. The room was decorated modernly and was plenty spacious. Breakfast is served every morning and is your typical cold cereal/bagel variety. Given that this is a medium priced chain, I was impressed with the atmosphere and level of service.",,,,,"['great', 'hotel', 'great', 'staff', 'hotel', 'clean', 'room', 'spacious', 'traveling',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-by-marriott-west-at-cityview-fort-worth,Courtyard by Marriott  West at Cityview,4.0,$$,10,"This hotel beats all others in the area on decor, customer service, and amenities. We had to stay for one night and enjoyed every minute of it. The beds were plush, the rooms were exceptional and the hotel had activities such as miniature golf to add excitement to your stay. I would stay here again any day of the week.Been staying at this Marriott while in Fort Worth and so far it's not bad. My room was clean and bed is comfortable. Now the pillows, that's a different story. For me they are too soft. I like some kind of firmness in my pillows. I just sink right into the pillow. Makes me feel like I have a big head. LOL The place is clean inside and freezing in the hallways as all hotels are. The one thing I do not like is their thin walls. I mean I could here the person from upstairs walk around, or they have a heavy ass feet. OMG it was annoying. It started to irritate me because this person wakes up at 2, 4, 6 am and stomp stomp stomp. UggghhhThe people here are friendly. Always greeting you and they serve Starbucks products. Quite frankly I'm not a fan of it so I go to the real Starbucks. They also have a patio in the back for you to enjoy. You are surrounded by so many choices of restaurants and there is a mall near by. Not the best mall but I'll save that for my next review. If the Hilton next door is not available, I will def be staying here again.Very clean. Great parking. Friendly staff. Putting green with a beautiful outdoor sitting area with ponds. The pool was heated and comfortable indoors. Our room was the executive king that had a sitting area with a pull out sofa. Bed and sofa sleeper was comfortable. The bathroom was a little dark however was a great size and very clean. Would stay here again.I'm somewhere between A-OK, and Yes, I'm a fan; but I don't have an option for 3.5 stars. So let me explain.The hotel staff are uniformly courteous and helpful. The facility is generally kept clean*. Parking is convenient and the location works because of proximity to my son's residence.Here's the ""but."" But, second to location I shop for hotels with hot tubs. This hotel's information lists a hot tub, but in three visits over six months it's never been hot. In the prior two visits the timer didn't work, but since has been repaired. I take credit for the repair since my previous correspondence to Marriott listed, among other things, the need for this timer to be put back into service. If not for me, for some other schmuck who might stay too long and have to be dragged out. The timer, i know, doesn't force the guest to use common sense, but is a reminder he or she has been in fifteen minutes.During last week's visit I again had to visit the front desk because the key card, following check-in, consistently would not open the door to the pool / hot tub area. Yes, in January, February, and now July, the key card opens other doors with card readers, but not the pool area. This is not necessarily a reason to look elsewhere, but why can they not get this fixed? It's likely a hardware issue with the card reader on that door, or the encoder at the desk, or perhaps, training. It's a nuisance and upon entry to the pool area reinforces my disdain for the non-properly functioning spa.Back to hot tub. I finally located a thermometer mounted in the drain cover on the opposite side of the hot tub from a sign reading ""Do not use spa if temperature is above 104 (degrees) F."" I was therefore able to confirm my suspicion of the spa's temperature being mid-90's via the ""hiding in plain sight"" thermometer's reading of 94 degrees. I suspect it's been no hotter than mid-nineties during the other visits as well.This past Sunday I again gained entry following the obligatory visit to the front desk whereby the very helpful desk attendant didn't go with me and provide access with his key card; he reprogrammed both my key cards (yes, I took both just to have a back-up). Reprogramming didn't work which forced another visit to the desk where this time, he gave me a third key which did provide access. The spa set idle with no working jets or timer. Visit the front desk a third time which resulted in a circuit breaker reset and the jets sprang to life, churning some fairly sudsy water.*After a few moments of watching suds I noticed bubbles with a gray colored spooge migrating to the top. The spooge grew proportionally to the increasing size of the bubble field, so at this sight, I left the area.I say all this to say I'll probably look for accommodations elsewhere during my next visit, and will encourage Marriott, if asked, to remove the spa from this location and fill it with concrete. Because ninety-four degrees does not a ""hot"" tub make, and whatever challenges are inherent with this equipment, it's too great for the resources of the all mighty Marriott Corporation to surmount.Also, fix the card access!Even though I had many questions Benjamin was very friendly and courteous and did his job with great ease. I would definitely recommend to a friend!I had a one night in/out business stay here. As others have noted the rooms can be noisy and I swear I could hear the person next door snoring. They do have a nice updated lobby, with daily drink specials and a Starbucks which is key. They must have also updated the rooms as everything in my room looked brand new. The room came equipped with a nice mini fridge and a new big screen TV. Their fitness center was clean and well equipped. Staff was helpful my check in/out was a breeze. One thing that did bug me was their Internet and business center network, both sucked lemons. Luckily I have a MiFi so I was able to work as their network access was slow. Their business center computers are running Windows Vista and I swear they are all infected and loaded with span programs. It took me about 10 minutes to pront out a boarding pass. I ended up just downloading my boarding pass to my phone. Hey Marriott clean up your network access and lobby PCs.  If you do stay here make sure you request a room not facing the Hwy. I have to return to this area later in Sept and will stay at this Marriott property again.In typical Marriott tradition they've renovated the lobby and did nothing with the guest rooms. I could hear the TV in the room next to me all night. The water smelled terrible. If train horns are not your thing you may not want to stay here. The staff was friendly.If you stay here go to the WoodShed across the street, great food.Clean, nice rooms. The foyer just had a makeover and the continental breakfast isn't too bad.. For the price Id come back here...One downside, the last time I stayed here the internet was dead slow. My 3g worked faster than their free useless wifi.I was here for a two night stay.  Perhaps my neighbors were just quiet, but noise was not an issue.  The room was clean and  had updated contemporary, comfortable furnishings in restful, attractive colors.  Excellent bedding.  Appealing lobby/bistro area.  Pleasant personnel. Attended a small conference.  Banquet food was tasty. Shopping conveniently located nearby.Minor quibble is that the in room information sheet states there is complementary morning coffee in the lobby, but that has been discontinued.  I felt for $99 it was a good value.Courtyard City View.  Great new format and nice new rooms.  Love the ""backyard oasis"".  Close to shopping and a free pass at the local gym.",,,,,"['hotel', 'beats', 'others', 'area', 'decor', 'customer', 'service', 'amenities', 'night', 'enjoyed', 'every', 'minute', 'beds', 'plush',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-fort-worth-fossil-creek-fort-worth,Residence Inn Fort Worth Fossil Creek,4.0,$$,10,"We stayed here during the Thanksgiving holiday to visit our daughter at TCU.  It is not close to campus, but most of the other properties close to TCU were booked, expensive, or not habitable.Overall a great experience.  The rooms are sized well, the living room, and ""kitchen"" area are clean and laid out well.  The bedroom/bathroom are sized well, and there is plenty of closet and storage space if you are going to be staying for a few days.The staff is friendly and efficient, there is a pool and small gym area.  The breakfast is not over the top with variety, but enough to satisfy everyones taste.There is are several restaurants and a movie theater within walking distance, and freeway access is very good.Highly recommended for business, family or leisure visitors.I booked a suite because I'm an early riser and my husband is not. I like the idea of being able to get up and move around without disturbing him. The room is nice and clean. A couple of drawers in the bathroom area are broken. It does come with a full refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker and a tv in both rooms.  Plenty of parking. Kara, at the front desk was very polite and helpful. There is a lot of construction in the area so traffic is heavy, at least on Friday afternoon.  We would probably stay again. Will wait to see how the rest of the stay goes.Poor customer follow up (Mary) from the front desk.  That is enough to keep me away for good.PROS-  Customer relations, Helpful staff,  Very comfortable bedding and pillows, decent shower water pressure. CONS- Outside parking under construction,  not enough garbage pails for a two room suite. room not serviced properly. The front desk was very nice and helpful. We wanted a room near the pool, they gave us one, but the key card mechanism for the door was not working properly. She apologized and since we had to get a room further away, she upgraded us to a two room suite for the same price. Everything was what a hotel should be including the front desk printing out my boarding passes for me. As stated above, parking lot under construction, but I didn't drive, so not an issue for me. Only problem (which may have just been miscommunication) I wasn't ready for room service so I had my girlfriend tell the maid not to service the room. When I was done getting ready for the day, I told the same maid that it was okay now to service the room, but when I came back to the room later only the garbage was emptied. The table still had some crumbs on it from our breakfast and the beds (that I made quickly and sloppy) were not remade properly. Also only garbage pails are in the bathrooms, so I had to keep running back to the bathroom or carry a pail around with me if I plan to make something in the kitchen or hang in the living room. But these issues are minor for what I feel is important for a good hotel, so I""m giving them 4 stars. Nice overall stay.I stayed here for a night while moving cross country and finding this hotel was such a relief after staying in a not so clean hotel the night before. The parking lot was big enough for our large moving truck and the room was very clean. The room even had a small kitchen and living area. There are also a lot of restaurants and a gas station by the hotel which is convenient for travelers. The staff was friendly, clean hotel that allows pets (hard to find!) and in a good area.We recently stayed here for a weekend while on a trip to Fort Worth for a bodybuilding competition in downtown.  The hotel was about 10mi away down 35 and we had no problems going to &amp; from.  The hotel lobby &amp; room was bright and clean.  Room had a kitchenette which was a requirement for us.  Nice little living room area to relax in then doors that closed the bedroom with an additional tv in there.  We arrived about an hour before check-in and the front desk clerk had no issues with finding me a room that was ready.  Great guest service.  Hot breakfast had a basic variety of eggs, sausage, biscuits, and diy waffles.  Overall a nice hotel for a very inexpensive price, would definitely stay again!This is the only place in town I could find that would accept pets. The staff was amazingly friendly and welcoming. 5 miles from stockyards.Surprisingly a nice hotel. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent room in a good area. Don't order food from outside establishments unless you have someone to help you carry it!! Had to run through a lightning storm to meet the food delivery guy at the front desk and was told by the front desk that it was for ""my security"". Oh really so running through a rainstorm and lightning crashing down around me is secure to you? All she wanted to do was argue with me about why it was for the guests security when it was a full blown sever storm going on. And if I wanted to pay for delivery and then yet walk to the front desk I would have just ordered take out and skipped the tip and the delivery drivers time. It's these little things that get on my nerves about the rules these places enforce. Would I go back Yes it was a above average stay. Next time though I wouldn't be running through the storm risking getting struck by lightning they could either deliver to the room or don't deliver it at all. Laundry facilitGreat place very friendly, very customer orientatedgreat place to relax after a long day @ work.would be 5/5 if:1. more chicken/turkey/veg options at evening snacks2. better wine/beer

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-fort-worth-lake-worth-fort-worth,La Quinta Inn & Suites Fort Worth - Lake Worth,3.5,$$,13,"I had to make a last minute hotel reservation and a lot of hotels were already booked. I don't think I've ever stayed at a La Quinta Inn before since in my mind I have never given that chain any respect. Well after staying there for a couple of nights I have changed my mind.I enjoyed my stay and the room. Although it didn't start out too well. They didn't have my reservation but since I've done a lot of traveling I'm accustomed to getting a confirmation number. My name was spelled horribly wrong. My last name starts with a D and the foreign sounding dude that took my phone reservation spelled it with an A with some new type of weird spelling. Maybe it was spelled using the Klingon language, it was that far off. Fortunately Larisa made everything alright. Larisa - You Rock!I had a king bed with a Jack and Jill bathroom with a gorgeous view of Lake Worth. There was a separate living room area with a pull out couch. They had free wi-fi. I never tried their continental breakfast so I can't help you on that one.I would definitely stay here again.One huge disappointment this time. The room was very musty and not fresh smelling. There was also some hair in the toilet and the sink. I do have to say the bed was comfortable, and it was very quiet at night which is very important to me. I was able to maintain a perfect temperature in the room. During the middle of the day I encountered a thug in the parking lot switching license plates from one car to another with a screwdriver. I called the hotel desk, I walked outside but the guy got away without them doing anything about it. There needs to be more security at this hotel.Overall visit was good. The girl at front counter didn't say much when she checked us in. Rooms were clean and nice. Breakfast was good but could definitely use some improvements. Would book again.This has been the absolutely worst hotel experience with regards to customer service. I travel a lot and trusted the ratings on this hotel. I work for a large agency that direct bills. Literally I was held hostage at the counter by a bullish employee. She made me wait while she called the general manager because I objected to giving her a CC on a direct bill. The wait was terrible. The wifi did not work. The TV remote did not work. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.Last night there was a power outage in our neighborhood,  we waited for a couple of hours with the belief that they would be out to fix it that same night, but as expected they didn't so I decided to get two rooms at LQ I tried to book it online and was unable to, so I figured I'd just do it at the location I had decided we would stay, the front desk clerk was on the phone with a guest when I arrived so I waited till he was done and told him I needed two rooms and need to do it with my return points so he proceeded to book the rooms and put a hold on my debit card for the cost of the rooms before he finished with my transactions I asked him again this is going on my reward and there won't be an actual charge to my debit card he said yes it will be removed at checkout. ... well it wasn't I spoke to the manager about and she told me you can't use rewards when you book at the location you can only do that online. . I asked now why would the clerk last night not tell me that her response was maybe he just didn't know how it works and I was absolutely flabbergasted what!! Why would you have someone that doesn't know one of the main things about LQ the rewards program,  not only was the room not up to standard but the manager only gave me credit for one room and also seemed like she really didn't care about my situation, so in order to get things resolved I had to call the complaint department to see if I could have the matter resolved. .. This has been the worst location of LQ I have stayed at and mind you the temps have been in the triple digits and I should have been able to have a good nights rest and a wonderful morning Stress Free but No early stress and a major headache.Very clean and a nice location. Staff was friendly and very helpful.The only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is that if you have a trailer you are going to find parking pretty difficult if the place is anywhere near full. And if you have a 5th-wheel or gooseneck trailer, DO NOT try to use the rear parking lot lower entrance or you will probably crunch your truck bed. Very steep entrance/departure angle.Other than that, I would recommend them highly! La Quinta's are my go-to hotel because we travel with our pet and I always look for them first for just that reason.It was an ok Suites but there were a couple things that take a star away.  The breakfast was a little lame for a Suites.  Just some rubbery egg patties and rubbery bacon.  Also, the first room they put me in had a great view...of nothing but the red roof of the entry drive.  I had to ask them to move me to another room.  The TVs are small and don't have a very good picture and the outlets are screwy.  If you turn the light at the entry way off, then all but one of the plugs next to the bed turn off, too, so you can either charge your phone or have the alarm clock plugged in, but not both.  It was clean and pretty and the staff were nice, it was just those little annoying things that dropped it down a star.Great experience.  Very clean and super friendly staff.  They gave my wife and I a chocolate chip cookie when we checked in (awesome after a long road trip).If you are looking for a budget motel for a night's stay in Fort Worth, this is a good spot.  Our room had a flat-screen with HBO, the bed was comfortable, and everything was clean.  They offered free breakfast, but, we didn't partake.They do allow dogs at this hotel.  We didn't hear any while in the room, but, could hear them while walking up and down the halls.Clean place.  Good condition.  Friendly staff.  Dog friendly but rooms are very quiet.  A+.First time staying at a La Quinta Inn.  I got an excellent deal at Booking Dot Com for a 2 Queen room for 2 nights.  The property is freeway close, and there are many close options for food, shopping, gas, etc.  The property is very quiet, and clean.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  There is a free breakfast in the morning.  Very basic, eggs, bacon, fresh waffles, juice, muffins, breads, coffee, but saves you money if you are travelling with a family.WiFi is available in the room and is pretty quick.  It is a no smoking property, so everything looks and smells very fresh.  There is an outdoor pool, but did not see much use even in 90 degree weather.Overall a very nice and comfortable stay at a great price.Very clean and reasonably priced.  The amenities were very good.  They ran out of some breakfast items one morning but we were eating out that morning anyway but heard some others complaining.  The pillows were ROCK hard.  I will stay there again when in the area.This inn is very clean and has friendly staff.  It is about 15 minutes from Fort Worth.  I recommend staying here.This place is new and shiny.  Everything is clean and neat .. great service.  Nice location.",,,,,"['make', 'last', 'minute', 'hotel', 'reservation', 'lot', 'hotels', 'already', 'booked', 'think', 'ever', 'inn', 'since', 'mind', 'never', 'given', 'chain', 'respect', 'well',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/extended-stay-america-fort-worth-southwest-fort-worth,Extended Stay America - Fort Worth - Southwest,2.5,$$,10,"Having stayed at several different extended stay hotels, this is the best bang for your buck. Full kitchen with oven and stovetop.  Fitness room with WORKING equipment and a nice clean pool. I got the studio suite whuch includes a recliner for my PM naps and a sofa sleeper for friends that come visit. Closet was big enough for a clothes horse like me and lots of drawers ladies. It could use an update but I bet once they do that they will be increasing the rate.    Have to take a star away for the multiple weeks of incorrect billing or somebody forgot to bill on the right day so I got billed for 8 days instead of 7. Just totally messed up my company reimbursement for the first 6 weeks. Once the new manager Jessica took over my billing I magically got billed correctly.  Thanks to her. Highly recommended. Thanks Fort Worth. It was fun while it lastedEnjoyed our one night stay here. I came to town to visit my son and made online booking here for a really good ""express deals"" rate from ""Priceline.com"". The couch could of been cleaned as it was dingy and the entire elevator and 3rd floor  smelled of cigarettes,  BUT other than that, the stay was perfect.I ended up staying here after getting a $33/night deal on Priceline. The room itself, a queen deluxe suite, was clean. The only problem I has was the room smelled musty and like mildew during my entire weeklong stay. We got rid of our used towels, bought a candle, and even propped open door occasionally but the smell wouldn't go away. I guess this is another example of getting what you pay for :(Easy to get to, clean, comfortable room. Right next door to Target. Breakfast is instant oatmeal, muffins, granola bars, and coffee. I did an Express Deal with Priceline for $36 and am extremely pleased with the room. Front desk is helpful and nice. Would definitely stay here again.The chair was split wide open, hopefully this gives you an idea. But it's right next to food carts. So this makes it hip.Here we are.  I am working nights and I did not feel like having Luis drive us back to our apartment in Arlington, TX and it is Luis spring break.  We paid $137.98 for (3) nights all in.  The first night we were given room 231.  The tv was too archaic to have hook ups for Luis new PS3 player and since it is his spring break this was really important to him to have hook ups.  Management transferred us to room 119 and it does have hook ups, but the room reeks of smoke:( Yuck!  We have to run the a/c just to circulate the smoky air.  Thank goodness we like to sleep in a cool room  The room has a large refrig.  We are keeping Cokes and oranges.  We have been going to Lone Star Oyster bar and Chipoltle.  I was able to get an oil change around the corner at Goodyear, $34, expensive, but convenient!  Tomorrow we are getting a serpentine belt and rear shock attention on the mini van and since Goodyear is right around the corner from Extended Stay the service fellow will drop me off:)  So far this location is working for us, but still have the smoky smell.  It is quite even though there are some little boys who run around the complex w/o supervision.  Sadly for the young fellas hotel livin is just not conducive for child raising.  Some guest has a pitbull here.  The dog is friendly, but come on, it is a pitbull.  Sometimes the little fella has command of it?Parking is ample here.  I will probably go to Central Market tomorrow. It is up by I-30 and this hotel is down near I-20.  It is 4.4 miles away.  The sheets are so cheap and plastic that i'll probably go to Anna's linens or Tuesday Morning and get some flannel sheets.  I really can't stand plastic sheets, but you get what you pay for.  There is a LaQuinta and Marriott Courtyard near hear, but I don't wanna pay there fees.  La Quinta is $109 after tax and the price goes up as their booking go up. I went to see a La Quinta room and the Extended Stay America room is much larger and more amenable for a claustrophobic person like myself.  The shower is awesome!   The water is plentiful and stays hot.  Luis said the water got cooler during his shower so you gotta take your shower in the middle of the day if constant hot water is important to you.It   is just like being under a rainfall.  The shower head is very high so you all of your body gets wet.   I left for work feeling awesome and happy.Well management WOKE ME UP ON THE TELE THIS MORNING!:(  They asked if I would be staying and they want another $68 if we are?  Huh! We told the check-in girl that we would be staying (3) nights and she said that wil be $137.98.  Well as it turns out today's managers want another $68.99 for tonight b/c the initial lady miscalculated even though we went thru our entire itinerary with her and told her that we would be leaving Thursday.  She only charged us for (2) nights rather than the (3) that she said we could have at this rate.  I wish I had a tape recorder.  She also quoted this price prior to our coming.  She told Luis that she only had (1) room left when he talked to her initially.  He was so nervous that we were gonna loose the (1) room.  I told him calm down.  I used to be in sales.  Well if you l like being low-balled then this is your hotel.  When the Goodyear people come to pick us up, then we are gonna go look at the Hyatt and LaQuinta.  I will be doing a yelp on the Goodyear as well.  Read that one.I would definitely stay at the Extended Stay America again b/c it is so close to the hospital that I am working at occasionally.  It was also quiet during the time that we stayed.  I did not have to walk very far from the front door to our room and I liked that as well.  I am searching some other hotels for a better rate though since I am just coming for work.Stop!  Do not book a stay here.  Some rooms have been updated but do not expect that updated room.  So many complaints about the stay.  The room was filthy, the rugs were stained, the couch smelled like a barn, the laminated floor was torn and both of my parents tripped and one fell.  I reported this serious incident at the front desk and nothing was done.  No report filed and no floor repairs made.  Mildew in the bathroom, fuzzy television reception and unlocked entrances to the hotel for all kinds of people to enter during non-business hours.   Dogs barking all night (pet-friendly hotel) and dog feces littered the hallways as well as a lingering fried fish smell everyday.  Massive wires hanging out from under the AC unit.  I went to Corporate and was able to vacate early but not without the hotel charging my credit card soo many times that my bank called me.  It took several calls and a lot of valuable time to get the charges credited.  Save yourself the hassle and do not stay here.Despite being overwhelmingly generic and in a lame part of FTW, this place was def both affordable and comfortable.  The downsides: hallways that reeked of smoke and bacon/french fry/something else smells, a broken treadmill, and undrinkable coffee.  The plus sides: a dvd player hooked up to every tv (yes!) and the mandatory free wifi.If you have a pet DO NOT STAY HERE!  They say they are pet friendly, but honestly not really.  They only clean the room once/week on the day you check in the next week.  So the 1st cleaning comes and oops the housekeeping staff does NOT show up.  So somehow it is my fault they tried to clean my room the next day and I wasn't there.  Someone touched my sleeping cat, and something happened.  Then that person refused to clean my room.  It took almost 3 weeks for someone to come clean my room.  I had to do it myself, change my sheets, get fresh towels.  UGH - the staff was NOT all friendly either - some were, others were not.  I had talked to manager and regional manager to arrange specific times for me to be there for a cleaning - and no one seemed to communicate that to the hotel.  It was annoying.  When I complained to corporate, that never was followed up on.  I did finally contact someone at corporate and she gave me a ""free ngiht""!  After a month with one cleaning and a lot of crap - not sure if it is worth it.  I will NOT allow my family or anyone from work to stay there.  NEVER, EVER !  Limited TV channels when you are staying there long term.  (I do give a positive to the corporate people for making me feel like this horrible experience may help someone else)I stayed at this hotel for four days and had a very good experience. The person working the front desk was very helpful when I let him know that I was not from Texas and wanted to find a good place to eat. He asked me what I was in the mood for and let me know exactly what was good, in the area and inexpensive. The room was very clean, had a flat screen TV and a DVD player attached. The wifi in the room was not free and I had to pay a one time fee to have the wifi for the whole week. The refrigerator and kitchen was very clean when I arrived but the one thing that had me scratching my head was that this was the first hotel I have ever stayed at that did not provide shampoo in the shower. The shampoo was available at the front desk by request there was plenty of soap in the shower but no shampoo, I do not know if this is the same for all extended stay hotels or if it was just this one but I was surprised to not see any shampoo.",,,,,"['several', 'different', 'extended', 'hotels', 'best', 'bang', 'buck', 'full', 'kitchen', 'oven', 'fitness', 'room', 'working', 'equipment', 'nice',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/towneplace-suites-ft-worth-downtown-fort-worth,TownePlace Suites Ft. Worth Downtown,4.0,$$,23,"I actually booked this room through the express deal on Priceline. Glad I did! The hotel was very nice. Front desk were all friendly and even gave us a late checkout despite being almost fully booked. I missed breakfast, sadly, so I can't comment on that. The room was neat and clean. I didn't realize this would have a full kitchen! Full size fridge, dishwasher and sink. Completely furnished with dishes and cookware. We got worried because we forgot a bottle opener and found one in the drawer! Life saver ;)Shower was nice. The head kind of sprayed too much and too wide. I prefer a more pressurized narrow spray but it still serves its purpose. Bed was lovely and tv had plenty of channels. It's satellite so we lost signal a few times. Parking is a little sparse but there was street parking which was not far at all.Chose to stay here while our house is being renovated.  Walls are extremely thin!  You can hear everything in the halls.  Doors slamming, people's conversations.  A loud train goes by every so often and its louder than loud.  We asked for the first floor because we have 2 dogs and the only two rooms left were by the elevator and the side door.  Worst locations ever!  People in and out all night, doors slamming, loud conversations.  My dogs barked at everything.  Also got stuck across from the loudest, rudest neighbors.We were going to stay two weeks.  We checked out at midnight and went back to our home.  Felt bad about the dogs barking and just couldn't take the loud neighbors.  I got used to the train.  It's not the hotels fault about the loud guests or the train.  Thin walls are thin walls.  We've stayed here before and didn't notice all the noise that time but we were on a different floor in the middle of the hall.  Location, location, location!Good things:1.  They have free breakfast and a buffet dinner two or three times a week2.  You can walk around downtown Fort Worth3.  Hotel is clean4.  Rooms are decent equipped with kitchen and full sized fridge5. A free bus comes to bring you to and from downtown Fort WorthI chose to stay at this hotel a few nights ago as I was coming in town for a good friend's wedding, and the parents of the bride had reserved a block of rooms at a special rate. I am not giving this hotel a one star review because of the cleanliness of the rooms, the amenities provided, or the location. This hotel is receiving the worst review possible because it failed to provide literally the only thing I expected, which was to have a room ready at the check-in time of 3pm so my girlfriend and I could get ready for the wedding.We arrived around 3:45pm, and upon arrival, were told by the front desk that our room was not ready since the maids were running behind schedule, and that we were in line behind 6 other guests. I was already irritated as it seemed it was pointless that I had reserved my room a month and a half in advance. We sat around and waited for an hour and 15 minutes, and by that time I was starting to get a bit nervous as the shuttle departed for the wedding at 5:30. Yet, still no room was ready. We ended up having to lug our suitcases into the bathroom in the reception area and change into our formal attire as quickly as possible, and then bring the suitcases back out to the car. The room was finally ready at 5:25pm, 5 minutes before the shuttle departed. We may as well have just driven straight to the wedding and changed in the car on the way.The wedding guests were also supposed to have a dedicated shuttle service to the wedding and reception afterwards. Instead, we had to over-crowd on one shuttle to wedding, and after the wedding the shuttle never even came to take us to the reception. They said they were busy shuttling other guests around, and we ended up having to pay for a cab to the reception.I called the general manager of the hotel, Allie Giraldo, on her direct line and left a polite message expressing my extreme disappointment in the way things were handled. I couldn't understand what the point was of booking a room a month in advance for a wedding if the hotel management couldn't even properly accommodate the guests in a timely fashion. She hasn't returned my call or even acknowledged the message two days later. We received no apologies for the way things were handled. The poor lady at the front desk had to deal with all  of the upset wedding guests who didn't have access to their rooms on time because for some reason there was no manager on-site Valentine's Day weekend, one of the busiest times of the year. This made zero sense to me.I'm sorry for the rant or if I sound like a bit of a snob, but I have stayed at Marriott hotels in the past both for work and vacation purposes and have never had anything even close to the experience I had at this hotel. I would absolutely never recommend this hotel if you have any sort of important time obligations, as it is clearly very poorly managed. I don't know if this is a one-off occurrence, but if this is how things are handled at Marriott hotels, I am honestly considering never staying at one again.I would definitely come back to this location. The staff was so good to me and my family. Its super close to downtown area. Hell it has me considering a move to Ft. Worth in that specific area. Breakfast could be better or at least some variation. The room was big and spacious and fully stocked. They even accommodated my request for a porta crib for my youngest and brought sheet set for it too. Pool stayed busy so I didn't get to try it out.Being a hotel that targets long stays, business/hospital related costumers,  it has some pretty competitive prices if you plan to book over Xmas break. The rooms are spacious and the king size bed is huge and easily fit my mum, myself and my (then 12 yo) daughter. There also is a pullout couch we didn't end up using anyways. (If you plan to use it, make sure to request extra sheets).The AC is quiet (unlike MANY other hotels).The TV is perfectly sized and hangs on the wall. The channels are enough to please each and all.Yes,  the walls are thin. But, you shouldn't allow that to count against the MANY pros.It is equipped with a full kitchenette (microwave, stove tops... no stove). A full size fridge (that may be too loud at times). There is a bigger than average closet.The toiletries are top notch and replaced daily.They ""go green"" (which means they will only change towels you lay on the floor, energy savers).The cleaning ladies are so nice and caring. If you happen to be sick or wake up late, you have up untill 3PM to ask for house cleaning. The policy for cancelation is till 4PM for sane day cancelations (i believe), otherwise you get charged for the night. There is late check out and early check-in. The location is by the beltway so you may wanna asl for rooma facing away from it.They have a rather cute swimming pool and, Monday through Friday they offer a free of charge happy hour with wine (red or white), beer, orange and apple juice, water and sodas as well as buffet like food (each day different offer among italian, mexican, chinese...)Included there also is a continental breakfast. There also is 24 hour concierge and a mini market right next to it.Though it is not exactly located downtown, you may choose to walk (10 minutes) or hop on the Molly the Trolly (which is ALSO free of charge). They also offer a free shuttle service throughout Fort WorthI was so disappointed in this hotel.We booked the rooms since we were in the military and traveling for business (and they offered the military rate).When we had to cancel last minute, they still charged us for one night stay in the rooms.I understand if we were going for leisure or if they did not offer the government rate, but they offer the government rate knowing that schedule changes occur and accepting that risk.So now we are seeing if the military can pay for the $600 they charged us or if that has to come out of our pockets. I am going to try to get the taxes back since Texas has a hotel tax exemption for government and non profits, but we will still have to figure out who pays the other $500+.Just so much hassle for us when we are already so ridiculously busy. I would not recommend staying here--they don't care about the people.Overall, this was a pretty good hotel.The day I arrived they informed me they didn't have a room for me even though they had my reservation - because a pipe had burst. So... rooms were unusable. I was shuttled to their sister hotel 8 miles away. That wasn't especially great... but I'm cutting them some ""act of God"" kind of slack here.Let's talk about the 2 out of 3 nights I actually stayed here.The room: pretty good. Well appointed, great thermostat, comfy linens, plenty of space.The complimentary breakfast: adequate. Stay away from the French toast. And the eggs are clearly out of a pouch. Bleh. Go for fruit, cereal, and maybe a waffle. :-)Service to downtown: you can walk there in 15-20 minutes or they have a shuttle that will drop you off at your DTFW destination. But the shuttle only runs Mon-Fri from 8a to 6p. However, Molly the Trolley has a stop right outside the hotel for other hours you may need transportation - and the front desk will call the trolley for you.Overall, it ain't the Omni - but for the price differential, it's a solid place to bunk in Fort Worth.Like the rest of the reviews note, it is nice, recently built, and in a convenient location. What I did like:The Paul Mitchell bath products, the fitness room, the room size, comfortable beds, quiet air conditioner, and it's within walking distance (half a mile to a mile) to a host of restaurants (or you can take that Molly the Trolly thing but I had a bad experience and gave up on that).HOWEVERThe internet was EXTREMELY SLOW. Come on y'all. Considering the size of this hotel and the business travelers that stay here, you need at least one wireless connection per floor. One connection for the ENTIRE hotel is UNACCEPTABLE. You can't even load basic websites. I just gave up altogether after the first night and relied on the 4G connection on my phone for everything internet related.Additionally, be warned that the walls are EXTREMELY THIN. You will be able to hear your neighbor cough and snore, even with the A/C on. All in all, I think I'll be looking at different hotels when I go back to Fort Worth next month for business.Jason made this place a FIVE star stay for our group. Super easy parking and walking access to Main st and the trolley Thank you Jason and crewI have picky criteria whenever I travel - location - is it centrally-located and accessible to a business district or running trails cost - relative to location, similar competitors, and hotel gradefood - is it free, or does it have a restaurant?fitness center - does it have one?wi-fi in the room and lobbyRate was around $149 p/night (weekend rate + tax + surcharge). Though higher-priced than what I normally pay, anything cheaper wasn't as centrally-located, and everything else in the area seemed more expensive; and though they were right at the edge of downtown, it was walkable for me (and foresee it to be walkable for those who are used to it).The place was kept spotless 24-hrs and you could tell.The breakfast buffet was decent with hot items such as scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and it also had a waffle machine. There were other typical items such as fruit, yogurt, cereal, coffee, juice, etc.They had a pool and a fitness room, which had weights and cardio machines.They specialize in suites, and mine was a good size - with bed, over-stuffed chair, kitchenette, and desk. Last of all, unless you know where you're going in the surrounding neighborhood, the place is hard to get to from the main road, and you kinda have to navigate some of back streets to know where to go. I got it in a coupla tries...(but not on the first!)Note that they are located really close to an intra-city overpass (i.e. not a freeway overpass), which kind of caused the debacle that I mention.My complaints - 1. Wi-fi was down in the room the whole entire time I was there (three nights), and luckily, I carry a hard wire most of the time, which is what I ended up using to net-connect. The error that I was getting had something to do with the router. I mentioned this to the night crew, and they checked their phones, and said, ""oh, wel...ours' works!"" and they kinda left it at that.2. Last of all, I drove in at 'round 11 pm one night, and the whole parking was full with absolutely no spaces available!Seriously, they should ensure that each guest room should come with a space!This was an excellent place to stay.  The hotel is in excellent condition - nothing shabby or worn.  The service was great.  A self-serve breakfast was available every morning.  And, although we didn't attend due to other plans, a free 'happy hour' with red and white wine, as well as snacks that might  suffice for dinner, was advertised for three days each week.  My grand daughter could tell you, their waffles are shaped like the map of TEXAS. I also like the fact, we have free internet connection! The location in downtown Fort Worth is great if that's where you need to be, but it is a bit away from any convenience or grocery stores.The toilet took seconds to flush.  Another plus!Negative for the doors, if you parked your car out in the back, you end up going the hallway to the front, and coming back inside to go to the back!  I'm saying, they have too many doors, sometimes you forget where the front or the back, until your last day!Us old folks usually don't have forgetful memories!Had no idea about FT Worth and booked this according to price and we were pleasantly surprised. It is newer and well taken care of. Staff was very nice and helpful. While it is not near anything there is a free bus that will take you to the fun downtown area in 5 minutes and we used it everyday. The front desk called them over even outside their normal hours. So we had the benefits of a downtown hotel but with free parking. Breakfast was fine for a free one with Texas shaped waffles even. The pool was too cold for some but a couple of us like a cool refreshing pool. Would stay here again.I stayed here for a few weeks when I first moved to town and I loved it. I will probably never book a regular hotel again. The room had a full sized refrigerator, a two eye stove, toaster, and all the cooking utensils you could need for your stay. It was clean and quiet and the staff went out of their way to accommodate me. They have free breakfasts in the morning, usually eggs, sausage, biscuits, make your own waffles, cereal, juice and coffee. They also have receptions on some nights with beer and wine and appetizers. The hotel is in a great location and you can walk to Sundance Square. There's also a free trolley line that will take you around downtown. I never heard a train, probably because of my location in the hotel.This place is the best great staff very helpful they have free shuttle comfortable beds and quiet location free breakfast and some days free dinner 5 star review!!!Most. Comfortable. Beds. EVER.This place is sort of hidden from the rest of downtown and is on the outskirts but still a great location nonetheless.  My friend stayed here and I didn't expect much of it.  It's pretty new (2008) and has a clean interior as well as clean rooms - complete with a mini-kitchen, full-size fridge, large desk/chair, couch, and marble countertops!  I was very pleased with the service that they provided - all of the staff here is really friendly.  Pros:Free hot breakfast daily - the waffle maker is in the shape of TEXAS!Free wifiFree dinner and happy hour on some weeknights - check the scheduleCons:None that I can think of!We stayed at this hotel for Advocare Leadership weekend. Everyone was very nice!!! Their shuttle service to near by stores and gym was so convenient for us. Justin and Duane were such a great help and became great buddies for us! Room was VERY comfortable and clean, the kitchen was such a plus for us. A full kitchen with every bowl, plate, spoon we could have needed. Will definitely stay here again!Showed up late but everyone at the desk was courteous. Room was super awesome and definitely more plush than I was accustomed to. They only downside to this place is how close it is to the train tracks. The noise isn't bad but it definitely shakes the building a bit.Great place in Fort Worth to stay in.I would say 4+ really.  If train noise bothers you, it's definitely not a 5.  They weren't running constantly, but I did hear more than one.The accessible room gets you a shower massage instead of a shower head (but don't tell anybody).  The bed was FABULOUS!!  The room was very clean, full size fridge &amp; microwave big plusses.  Breakfast bar had tasty biscuits &amp; gravy (hey, it was Sunday morning) and pretty good coffee and a local paper instead of the national one (U know which one).  Here for two nights while house hunting, which is not the most fun I've ever had, but the staff here has been exceptional and even though this one's a freebie from my Marriott points, there's not anything negative I can say about the accomodation.  Besides, I kinda like train noise.","Nice place to stay. Very clean and maintained. Close to downtown, a 1/2mile away. Sits on a quiet corner next to railroad tracks but there's a dividing wall &amp; we didn't hear the trains. Very popular w/ business travelers.Very clean and new hotel. I prefer the residence inn type hotels anyways, but this one is really top notch.  The staff was all very friendly and the location was great.We were in town for a wedding and this was the designated hotel. When we checked in, it seemed very nice and inviting. The front desk attendant was very pleasant and asked if we wanted to be on the same floor with the other guests from the wedding. Their complimentary breakfast was great. I didn't even need to get lunch, I was so full. I used their gym area and I was the only person there the entire time I was working out. I noticed they even had headphones, in case you forgot yours. All was well when we checked out too. It wasn't until we were almost home that I realized I wasn't wearing my Tiffany's necklace. We left before 7 am (and had but 5 hours of sleep) so we packed quickly and hit the road. I searched in every corner of my bags and purse. I remembered where I took it off exactly. I immediately called the hotel, around 4 pm. I explained that I had just checked out and realized I left a necklace behind. Before I could ever describe it, I was put on hold. The attendant suggested I call back the following morning since everyone from house keeping had already left. Ironically, our room was on the same floor as the housekeeping office and when I was walking down to the wedding at 5 pm....the door was still open and someone was at a desk. I called back this morning and explained my situation again. I was asked if I was here for the wedding party (not sure why that mattered) and said yes. Again, I mentioned it was a silver Tiffany's necklace and before I could go into detail, I was told it was not found. I know exactly where I left the necklace (left corner of the first nightstand) and find it hard to believe it wasn't found. As much as I enjoyed our stay, we will NEVER stay at a TPS again and if it was up to me, we wouldn't stay at a Marriott managed hotel either. I hope whoever has the necklace now loves it as much as I did.",,,,"['actually', 'booked', 'room', 'express', 'deal', 'glad', 'hotel', 'nice', 'front', 'desk', 'friendly', 'gave', 'late', 'checkout',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-fort-worth-downtown-fort-worth-2,Embassy Suites Fort Worth - Downtown,4.0,$$,49,"Love this hotel!The bed &amp; bedding is so comfy. Everyone is friendly &amp; helpful.Best comp breakfast ever!Comp happy hour also has some liquor. Room service has a great hamburger which was actually cooked medium as requestedElevators are quick. Definitely the place we will be coming back for our next staycationJust want to say that this is an EXCELLENT hotel... we normally stay at the Courtyard Blackstone right next door but decided to stay here this year... MUCH bigger rooms then the Courtyard and This Embassy Suites has a GREAT layout for Breakfast!!!If you get a chance to choose your room, I highly recommend choosing a VERY high floor and one that is AWAY from the outside wall near the roads and NOISE.  I had a 2nd floor corner room, LOVED the room, very spacious BUT.  ALL night I could hear traffic... I almost thought that the windows were actually open.  Of course my room was right about the entrance of the hotel where there was a lot of traffic but I really didn't expect it to be so LOUD!!!  Most Hotels that I have stayed in that were downtown in large cities have THICK sound proof glass.  This hotel doesn't have that luxury which made my night a living HELL. There is NO parking on site so unless you want to walk a couple of blocks to the closest Parking Lot, you have to use their Valet parking ($22+tax / Night)The Staff was AWESOME!!!  Very friend and professional Staff from the Front receptionist to the Valet and even the Starbucks Cafe personnel were always friendly and helpful.PRO:  Spacious rooms, GREAT FREE Breakfast and Managers Special at night.CONS:  Noisy Streets thin windows, Valet Parking only est $25/nightStayed here for one night for my bachelorette party. The only parking option they have is to valet your car. When I went to check out the next day, handed the valet my ticket, they could not find my keys in their key box. They finally went to the garage and confirmed that my car was there, they just lost the keys to it. They questioned me and asked me to search through my belongings after I told them I specifically told the valet they're in the cupholder when I got out because it is keyless start. They were out of ideas of how to help me and all they kept saying was it will turn up, its probably in one of the valets pockets from yesterday. They told me this continually like it was not big deal, this happens all the time. Luckily I was only an hour away from home and not from out of town so I was able to have someone bring my spare key. They called that afternoon to let me know one of the other guests found my key in their car and turned it in!!!The manager was not working that day and I have called multiple times to try to speak with him about this but he does not return messages. Worst experience ever and so glad it was not the keys of any of the other 6 cars from our group we had parked there that were all from out of town!I gave it 5 stars based on the breakfast and cookies alone! Pricey but definitely worth it if comfort is what you value. Parking on the street is free on weekends in downtown Fort Worth (It begins Friday after 6pm) so you can forgo the expensive Valet parking garage. The rooms and facilities are clean. Once again, make sure you get breakfast! The chef is a very nice guy who will make you a killer omelet. You'll enjoy your stay.I've stayed here several times for work. The Embassy suites is centrally located in downtown Fort Worth. There are many restaurants nearby and Sundance Square is only three blocks away. It's hard to get much better location wise for Fort Worth.The rooms are very spacious and actually larger than my studio apartment back in New York City. The decor is nothing to pretty vanilla but it gets the job done. My favorite thing about the Embassy suites is the complementary breakfast and the managers reception a.k.a. happy hour each evening until 7pm. At happy hour the serve up well drinks, beer and wine along with bar snacks. The managers lounge is a very relaxing place to wind down after a hard days work. The gym is pretty standard here and I wish the pool was outdoors but the Jacuzzi is quite relaxing. Overall this is a pretty good spot to stay while in Fort Worth for business or pleasure.I have stayed here a few times and been satisfied with the service.  The desk help is friendly but sometimes they seem a little distracted with paperwork or other stuff in the back office off to the side on reception.  One very good thing is that they do a great job quickly connecting to the valet to get your car pulled up very quickly.   The hotel has an excellent location, right in downtown Fort Worth, making it a short walk to restaurants and bars.There is a mini-Starbucks type coffee shop in the lobby as well as a Thai restaurant.  Like all Embassy Suites, they serve free breakfast.  For a free breakfast, it is pretty good.  They have fresh fruit, cereal, bread as well as a chef making omelets.  The rooms here are pretty typical Embassy Suites as well.  The rooms are always neat and clean.  I have never had a problem with the heat / AC either.This particular location doesn't have an atrium and we did not have a view from our room, but it is still a quality place to stay. We could not hear any other guests while in our room, the bed was comfy, and the Valet gentlemen were consistently friendly and prompt. The location is prime, and is walking distance to a variety of fantastic bars/restaurants/sites including the Flying Saucer, Del Frisco's Grille, Taverna ($1 mimosas at brunch!), Sundance Square, Bass Hall, and the FW Water Gardens. My favorite part of Embassy is the complimentary Manager's Reception (Happy Hour) every evening. A full bar is available, no limit to number of drinks, and a spread of homemade snacks (tortilla chips, salsa, pita chips, hummus, veggies, ranch, etc). The bartender was friendly and courteous, and he made the BEST Passion Fruit Guava Margaritas!Lastly, we got a fantastic deal on this hotel by using Priceline's Name Your Price Tool - check it out!Had a company retreat based out of this hotel - was excited to learn it was an Embassy Suites as I often stay at these and am never disappointed - until now.  Staff were brusque and unaccommodating, rooms were extremely noisy, water pressure in the shower almost made me jump around to stay wet.  Breakfast room was poorly lighted and arranged and there was no help in there at all if you had a question or needed assistance.  AND I'm a gold HiltonHonors member and they completely ignored my requests and perks - what's the good in being loyal if they don't treat you a little bit better than the average joe??  Anyway - much better accommodations in Ft Worth - won't be here again.Looking for some southern hospitality? Check!  You can find that here from the hotel staff, everyone is super accommodating and sweet! If you are looking for a modern/updated hotel, it's not that, but the staff and amenities offered more than makes up for it.This place provides you a suite of freebies! And who am I to object?- Free complimentary internet- Free made to order breakfast- Free essentials- Free complimentary booze and finger foods from 5pm to 7pmMy room was pretty spacious. I had a work desk, fridge, microwave, and two TVs. Also, it is walking distance from Sundance Square. Regular HH is from 12pm-5pm everyday, including weekends! HH includes a killer Bloody Mary for 5 bucks. I have had $13 Bloody Marys all over SF and still it is no match for ES's Bloody Marys. The only downside for staying here is the $22 valet. Given that I have paid $30+ at other hotels, that had little to no offerings like ES, I don't mind paying the valet in the least.All in all, if I am ever in the area again, I'll be staying at ES next time for sure!Embassy suits was a fabulous place to stay! The staff is awesome and super helpful. The made to order breakfast is fantastic. The gym and pool area are so nice! They have a Starbucks in the hotel. Our train doesn't leave until Friday and after we check out they're even going to hold our bags for us. The hotel is in perfect walking distance to several fun things to do in FT worth. I highly recommend this place.The staff is extremely nice and helpful.  However,  the two room suite was a disappointment.  We are a family of four ...the sofa bed is very small, and the two room  suite is extremely small.  There is only one bathroom and the vanity sink is inside the bedroom,  next to the bed. The toilet area is very small with a tub. It is difficult to close the door when you walk into the toilet area because the door almost touches the toilet. You have to walk through the bedroom to get to the vanity or,  toilet area. There isn't much separation between rooms.The hotel is old and this is probably why the rooms are so small.  I called the front desk to see if they had a larger suite and they said ours was the largest. .What an amazing hotel experience. Yes you pay a little bit more to stay at Embassy Suites but it is 100% worth it! The staff is very friendly &amp; accommodating! Plus you get a delicious cooked to order breakfast &amp; complimentary happy hour! What could be better than that?Phenomenal service! The staff was very friendly and provided us with excellent recommendations on places to visit. They always had a smile and greated us whenever we entered or leaving. Our car was always ready for us too.The rooms are large, the hotel is inexpensive and very clean. The breakfast had a lot of great options - made to order omelettes, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, grits, etc. The gym was also a decent size and was open 24 hours. The location is right in the heart of dowtown near Sundance Square. I hope to stay here again on my next visit.I stayed at the Embassy with all my bridesmaids before my wedding. I cannot say how amazing the hotel staff was. They sent us up a cheese tray and champagne. They went above and beyond to make the day perfect! After we checked out and went to the venue I realized that I could not find my husband's wedding band. They went through the trash and kept us updated every step of the way! (it ended up being in a random box that we had :/ ). I am so impressed with the staff and recommend this hotel for any events, or just for a random stay! They went above and beyond and I am so thankful we chose the Embassy!!!Stayed here the night of the Bob Newhart show during the wonderful ice strom.  Wasn't planning on an overnight stay but after taking 4.5 hours to get here from Mesquite I wasn't looking forward to the drive home.The staff were all courteous and very helpful.  The valet guys went the extra mile. They helped a couple of motorists get there cars moving when they got stuck by offering to push.  They also were keeping abreast of road closures and conditions on on the highways in the area. Great job!The front desk staff were also very nice and gave us a discount as we were stuck and not planning an overnight. Managers reception that night and breakfast the next morning were both well done and the staff were again very cordial and helpful.Why would I only give this place three stars then?  The room itself.  The layout of the room was fine and the bed was comfy-but I don't know if there was a weird plumbing problem, or what, but everytime someone upstairs flushed or used a sink it was louder than when we flushed our own.  It was quite loud and kept us up most of the night(the people upstairs had bladders the size of walnuts.  They were flushing every 20 minutes or so.)A second problem was the Thai restaurant in the hotel lobby.  We thought a bite from there would be the perfect way to close the night.  They had patrons inside and it was still two hours before the posted closing time.  When we went to get a table we were told they were closed.  I understand during the storm things may have happened, but when I told the front desk, just so they could be aware and suggest maybe posting a sign so no one else would get their hopes up- I was told that they have no control over the restaurant as the space is leased.  This really surprised me.  I understand that the space may be leased but it is in your lobby and, I feel, it reflects poorly on your hotel when a situation like this arises.  I would think they could have talked to the manager of the restaurant to at aleast find out what was going on.Will I gvie this place another shot-probably.  I think that the problems we had are easily fixable and that the vast majority of this establishment merit another stay.Have to say one the best hotels we have stayed at.  Everyone who works here are very helpful. Would come back again and stay hereIf your looking for a mid level hotel with a great location , great service and comfortable rooms this is it . I checked in without showing a credit card or drivers license and was met by a manager who already had my key in the lobby . Wow , that was impressive . I am asumming when I valet  my car they knew I was here and I had been here before . In walking distance of lots of great restaurants and sits right in the middle of beautiful down Fort Worth . Staff is super friendly . Will be back many times .Embassy Suites was the perfect place to stay.The location is wonderful, with easy highway access and plenty of destinations within walking distance as well (including the convention center).Rooms were spotless, and the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to take it home with me.  Breakfast is fantastic, with many of the hot items (omelets, pancakes) cooked to order.  The manager's reception in the late afternoon is a good, free snack to hold you until dinner time.As nice as the hotel is, the staff here raises the experience to a whole new level.  I've never been treated better anywhere.  Everyone from the valets to the front desk to the Bistro was friendly, cheerful, and did their jobs well.You really can't go wrong.I have stayed in Fort Worth a few times. Usually at different hotels. I will be choosing Embassy Suites from now on. The customer service was exceptional. I had a personal note in my room from the rep that took my reservation (Jesus). I told him that I really needed to have a great weekend and he delivered, as did the whole staff. The manager on duty, David, was there to greet us at the door! This hotel is in a prime spot in Downtown Fort Worth. Oh, and it also has an indoor pool/hot tub that is very clean and nice. It was the best weekend I have had in quite some time. Highly recommended!!!Perfect location, wonderful staff.  The work out room and equipment were better than most hotels, clean, new equipment.  The room itself was large, so no crowding.  Valet staff was helpful and courteous.  The manager was very visible, asking if we enjoyed our stay.  Definitely recommend staying here!","Incredible place to stay and great for business travelers. Best complimentary hotel breakfast and the happy hour is spot on. The bar makes great lemon drops, too. And the location is perfect. If I could stay here every time I come to Fort Worth, I would.Ok I booked this through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a>. to get a great rate for a one night stay, for a medical procedure the next morning. We got in late and my husband was annoyed that there is no self parking, except on the downtown streets. Valet was only option at $21 a pop. We head up to our room and its a smoking room, WHY are hotels still doing this?? Anyways, call to front desk, and inquire about changing rooms, was put on hold and CERTAIN, I was going to get some cock and bull story about hotwire res, or online booking doesn't carry over request for non-smoking room(Ive gotten that line from another hotel chain, HOWEVER, was pleasantly surprised to told that although the hotel was overbooked, they would gladly call sister hotel, HIlton, 2 blocks away, and get a non-smoking room, at our Hotwire rate, no extra out of pocket anything and we still could return in the morning for the free breakfast at Embassy. THANK YOU, Bradford, your customer service was excellent. They made it RIGHT, period. Now Embassy just redecorate and go COMPLETELY non-smoking!This is an awesome value hotel!  The rooms are comfortable  and spacious.  The staff is polite and friendly.  I stayed here for a convention and will never stay anywhere else.The room was nice and big. Very clean and the maid service went well. 2 big things were wrong with the room. There was no Full length mirror (which is a must) AND the only window was TINY.We stayed here during our Honeymoon from Feb 21-24. It was an all around excellent experience.The valets were beyond sweet and instantly made you feel welcome, while EVERYONE at the front desk was super sweet. Especially Jose who, while we were gone eating dinner, had chocolate covered strawberries and Chardonnay sent to our room.There is starbucks located in the lobby and that was our go-to place to sit and figure out where we were going for the day. The employees were very sweet and the area was never too busy to where you couldn't find a seat.The workout room looked very nice and it had a small pool. The breakfast was delicious and every morning I had a wonderful homecooked omelette. The night we came in there was free drinks and snacks on the 7th floor and they had a great Melon Margarita and any soft drink you could want. The location was perfect because our whole goal was to walk around downtown and Sundance square. We stayed 4 days and took our car out twice. EVERYTHING is within walking distant from the hotel and we did so when it was pretty chilly outside so obviously we could have chosen to drive, but there was no need. Overall, probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Reasonable prices for the location and fact we were on our honeymoon and the staff couldn't be beat!Great place.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.The rooms were nice, but the windows were pretty small and didn't have a view to speak of.The breakfast was really good with cooked to order omelets and various hot side dishes.The happy hours was nice too.  They had a craft beer on tap and a great outdoor patio to hang out on.  The patio made up for the lack of a view in my suite.I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.Great place to stay. We stay there every time we are in DT DFW. Great location and tons to do. Service is good but booking through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> was our mistake. Highly recommend.I have eaten here two times and the food is great. You also get free valet parking. I had the pad Thai and pineapple fried rice and both plates were good. It's kind of pricey but good.We were pretty much forced to stay here during the severe ice storm just before Christmas in DFW 2013, when we went to see Bob Newhart live. It was this hotel or our car. Since our car got stuck in the ice just in front of the hotel, my husband said, ""If their valet can get us out of this, we'll stay here."" So we did.The best part of the stay was the free alcohol during Happy Hour, as well as a buffet at that time, and the breakfast buffet. We had gone to the hotel restaurant and were informed that they were closing. This was over 2 hours early. When I complained to the restaurant manager, I was informed that they were not part of the hotel and he did not care if I complained to the hotel, since they would be leaving in 6 months when their lease was up. WOW!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!? I could not believe this and, of course, informed the hotel of the conversation. The rooms are nice and large, but that is negated when one is waken by the guest above getting up 20 times through the night to use the restroom and bathe 3 times. Grant it, not sure how many guests were in that room, but I do know that I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR IT!!!! Especially since I was without my seizure medication and needed the little sleep I was allotted. The breakfast was nice, although the omelets could have used a little seasoning. I was told the salt and pepper were on the tables. Seasoning after the fact isn't as useful. :(The front desk was as helpful as they could be, but even if they were 100 stars, I go to a hotel to get rest, not hear other guests walk to and from the restroom and then their toilet flush all night long. Even free alcohol through the night would not have helped.... (okay, maybe a little).This is what brought the rating down. The front desk was sympathetic, but there is nothing that can be done without physical changes to the rooms. I expect more from the Hilton name, and this hotel just did not fit the bill, (except in personnel). VERY SAD :'(A note to the Hilton Hotel Family: Please think of remodeling and adding better insulation in the walls and floors. (Especially around the pipes and drains)This place is absolutely amazing. I came here this weekend for a conference and brought along my husband and two little ones (a toddler and a baby) . Right from our arrival, they treated us like we were the only guests there. As you pull up to the valet parking, the manager meets you asks for you name before you even exit your car and by the time you have unpacked your car, your room is ready for you and another staff members has your keys waiting for you as soon as you walk through the door.Every staff member from the manager down to the bell-staff and cafe workers are always there to great you with a smile, remembering any and all preferences and as a parent, the fact that they played with my kids and didn't see them as an inconvenience was a huge plus. The rooms were well appointed and as anyone with toddlers can attest, we don't always leave the room in the greatest condition, but it was always spotless upon our return.We highly recommend this place to stay for all families visiting the Fort Worth area.Light sleepers beware! The windows are not double paned and the small street out front is oddly busy with loud vehicles (busses or garbage trucks perhaps).  I stay here frequently because of the other things mentioned in reviews. But when an interior room is unavailable I am miserable. I know they can't control traffic but they can honor room requests (for a crappy view) from loyal visitors of over 7 years. My stay at a NY hotel in Times Square was nearly soundproof -- it can be done!Have stayed at this location a couple of times. While the location is perfect for enjoying downtown Ft Worth and Bass Hall, the morning breakfast buffet is not typical Embassy standard. Food assortment is limited and not of the chains typical qualityI was very satisfied with my stay here.  The staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful.  The amenities were welcoming, crisp and clean.  The hotel is located in a lively part of downtown which is walking distance from restaurants and some shops.  I will certainly remember this hotel if I return to Fort Worth.Great one-night stay!  I highly recommend this location because the entire staff was top notch...from the front desk to the breakfast staff to the manager's happy hour reception! I have never experienced such flawless customer service during a hotel stay!This was an exceptional experience for an Embassy Suites.  We stayed here for 5 nights.  It was clean, easy to park at, well priced, and the staff was especially friendly and helpful.  Every morning they are out front to greet guests as they come down.  The room was very clean and spacious.  The fridge worked, as did everything else.The complimentary breakfast and manager's reception at night were pretty decent, and served our kids needs every morning.  I realize that this is hard to believe, but the staff was as courteous as the Ritz that we stayed at in Dallas.  Highly recommended for your stay in Ft. Worth.Truly spectacular service. It's so often the 'service' gets lost in the service industry that we get accustomed to the mediocre. We have had the opportunity to stay in some quite fabulous hotels and I don't recall ever receiving better service. From the time we got out of our car and were greeted by a staff member that assisted our check in, through our entire stay every staff member we encountered seemed anxious to make sure we were completely content.  A special thanks to Ms Mary Beth Lewis. I happened to mention to her I had left my remote for our Apple TV behind making it quite worthless. She tracked one down and had it to me in no time. The hotel is nice, the complimentary breakfast and happy hour are great, but it's the wonderful friendly attentive service that really sets this hotel apart.What a great hotel. I came here looking for Thai Tina's restaurant, and I stayed the night. I was in town for business and thought, what the heck. I was in turned treated to one of the best hotel experiences I have had. First of all, I got a great rate from the very fine staff. Everyone in the hotel was professional and friendly. From housekeeping to management. Second, free booze at the manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30. And I'm not talking about the cheap stuff. Call brand liquors, wines and local draft beer (Rahr's Red, which was a very nice Amber Lager). Third, free breakfast. Not continental, but cook to order from biscuits and gravy, to pancakes, to made-to-order omelets! And all the other usually stuff. Last and not least, the room. A really spacious two room,with two very comfortable queen size beds. Lots of electrical outlets, fridge, microwave, two big flat screen TVs. The couch even pulls out into a bed. No telling how many people you could get in here comfortably. It was weird being by myself..... It was also quiet and very dark.  Just what I need to get a good night's sleep.  And I did, which is rare when I travel.If I am ever back in Ft. Worth, I will be staying here, and oh yeah, did I mention the great Thai restaurant on the bottom floor?Probably the best stay in any hotel anywhere!Pro's:  Staff, cooked to order breakfast, Mamagers reception, Fittness center, indoor pool, size and quality of the room, and, did I mention, especially the staff!Con's:  Only one, to be expected in a downtown hotel, Valet parking @ $21 per day plus tax.Location:  In the middle of Sundance Square, within walking distance of everything! We walked to several restaraunts and stores without the need of driving.From check-in to check-out, this was the best hotel I ever stayed at. The prices were reasonable, especially considering the value you get for your money. The included ""cooked to order"" breakfast was simply amazing. It included everything you can think of for breakfast, from a buffet line, to cooked to order omlets, bacon, sausage, and pancakes. The selection was extensive, including cereals, juices, several types of coffees, teas, numerous baked goods, and so much more. The staff was simply amazing, keeping tables cleaned, offering help with everything, and ready to answer questions and make suggestions. The included ""managers reception"" (free happy hour) in the evening was equally impressive, including many choices of snacks, cheeses, several types of chips and dips, grilled veggies, and of course the drinks. The bartenders and staff were all engaging, helpful, and displayed excellent attitudes. The Fittness center was the size of a commercial spa, with a large selection of equipment, well equipped with fresh towels, headphones, and cold water. The rooms are all suites of course, large and well equipped with everything you would expect from a first class hotel. All the above being said, the really greatest thing about this hotel was the happiness, helpfulness, and positive attitude of the staff.  Everyone appeared to be happy, motivated, and very pleased to be of help. There are also restaraunts on site, with a good selection of room service. Overall a great experience!I love this place and it's my first choice when in town on business.  Free wifi, free breakfast cooked to order, it's great.  The staff is always friendly and available to help.  I highly recommend this hotel if you need to stay downtown.My opinion of this hotel has declined drastically and I have to unfortunately stay there again next week. The customer service at the establishment was awesome, but the administration is the worst I have ever experienced. I stayed there almost a month ago and my employer (government) mailed a check to cover my stay. The payment was more than my stay and at check out I was owed a refund. I was told that I would receive it in a couple of weeks. It is almost a month later and I still have not been refunded. I have called, my Program Manager has called, and my Administrative Assistant has called to check the status and no one returns calls. My travel reimbursement is being held up because the overpayment has yet to be refunded. I emailed and called the Guest Services Manager and received no response. I called again and she answered and said that she would check with the accountant and call me back today. I did not receive a callback. I feel that I am now forced to contact their corporate office to get some sort of resolution. I also failed to mention that on my last stay an authorization for over $1000 was placed on my personal credit card even though they had received the payment from my employer. The check for next week was mailed on 12/3 and they claim they have not received it, so I am sure I will receive another huge authorization on my personal credit card. This is a lesson well learned and I will be advising everyone within my organization to select another hotel when we have to travel to Ft. Worth.","I hosted a company planning event here and, largely, had an excellent experience.  The property is clean, our meeting facilities were nice and the service staff is pleasant and on the spot.  I thought the value was very good for a property so well located.  The only real issue I have is that our event planner did not meet a commitment that was important to me and, in the end, I felt like I was mis-lead in order to secure the meeting for the hotel.  Five star rating gets downgraded to three.My wife and I had a great experience with this hotel. Got a great rate online, truly enjoyed our stay.Embassy Suites is a pretty solid hotel.   In the context of the Metroplex, I'd give it 4-stars, but at a global scale (cross-referencing with Manhattan, Vegas, International, et al. hotels) it gets 3 solid stars.   The service was friendly, professional, and efficient.   No major compliments yet no towering compliments either.   All in all, it was a nice hotel with good room sizes.   That's about it.   The price was pretty hefty and didn't seem like a tremendous value.   I've stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for cheaper, though we didn't have much flexibility at the time of booking.   Can't say the room we had was worth the 400 dollar per night cost that we paid.Stayed here last weekend as a surprise after I was fooled by my wife into thinking we were gonna see Alicia Keys in Grand Prairie (that's another story for another time).  Anyway, she felt we needed a 'getaway' considering we've both been thru alot of stressful family issues for the past few months so she decided on this place after checking out a handful of other hotel chains.Although I hardly venture to Ft Worth unless its for a concert within Sundance Square or to there Zoo, I've found the downtown area to be a bit tricky to maneuver.  There's alot of one-way streets so at times you end up doing alot of looping around and driving an extra block or two just to get to your specific location.  Anyway, no biggie.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by there valet staff which were very friendly and attentive.  We were a bit surprised that the charge for parking was $14, however we managed to get that waived later on.  We were also able to negotiate a better price too which made the stay even more better.  How cool was that?   The rooms were spacious, clean and very very nice.  Our stay also came with complimentary cocktails (between 5 &amp; 7pm) and a complimentary breakfast as well. Reservations were made at an area jazz club and again, the valet staff was very helpful in printing directions right on the spot.  That's what I call excellent customer service!Embassy Suites has a new fan in me!  Thanks for a great stay!What started out as 2 star experience improved to a 4 star experience due to the diligent efforts of the night shift front desk staff.  We came up for a weekend stay for my brother's wedding.  We chose embassy because we have a 1 yeard old 4 year old and having a suite over a single room is a world of difference when you stay with small children.  My wife reserved a crib for our room in advance.  When we arrived there was no crib.  No problem.  We called the front desk and requested one.  It turns out we drew the short straw and got room 513 which is wedged in a corner of the building and is a tiny suite with a tiny bedroom which is fine for an individual or couple but far to small for a family of four.  We found much later that this was an atypical room and not the standard (read on).  So we left for the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.  We got back after a great evening and my wife confirmed at the front desk that the crib had been delivered.  So we go up to our room at 10 PM with sleepy kids and we find no crib.  At this point we got a little agitated.  The whole idea was to go up to the room and put the kids down.  So I decide to go down and talk to the front desk face to face.  I calmed myself and convinced myself that getting irate was only going to make matters worse.  So I approached the desk and was served by Bridget who had a wonderful demeanor.  I told her I had a ""small beef"" and described the situation.  She was very apologetic and eager to help.  She admitted that she had just confirmed for my wife that the crib was delivered because that is how it read on her computer screen.  It was clear to me that someone on the earlier shift dropped the ball.  She also informed me that we probably wouldn't be very comfortable in room 513 trying to squeeze a crib into that tiny space and offered to move us into a larger suite which we gladly accepted.  Bridget promptly got some assistance from her colleagues to man the desk and she personally went and got the crib for us.  She then had another colleague deliver the crib and help us move our belongings from our room to the new room.  They also delivered snacks for our girls and a pair of balloons that someone configured into animal shapes.  I can say that the efforts of these two staffers was no less than five stars but not enough to improve the overall experience to 5 stars.  Over the course of the weekend we did observe that nearly all the staff at the hotel was helpful, cheerful, and proactive.  The complimentary breakfast was pretty ok but I have had better.  The valet service was very helpful through the course of the weekend and housekeeping quitely did a fine job.  The gym amenities were very good for a hotel gym including an assortment of ellipticals, treadmills, other machines, and free weights.  We will stay here again if we have the need to stay the night in Fort Worth.Ideal location for experiencing all that downtown Ft Worth has to offer! This hotel is right in the middle of Downtown. Lots of shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. The hotel is classy and includes a complimentary cooked to order breakfast and a daily managers reception with complimentary cocktails, wine, beer and snacks until 7:30pm. I would recommend anyone who has it in their budget to stay here!Holy cowtown, this is the nicest Embassy Suites I have ever seen.  So, it is not in cowtown but in an even cooler location downtown very close to Sundance Square.  It is a 4.5 and I am almost tempted to give it 5 but it is not a luxury hotel, so I just can't.  But, I promise, it is that great of a hotel.  Apparently, Embassy Suites bought this hotel (a former Clarion), gutted this badboy and loaded it with beautiful, contemporary decor.  When we arrived, we got there just in time for the free appetizer and drinks welcome happy hour!  What a way to begin!  After a long night out, we slept through the free b-fast (in a very comfortable bed) but were pleased to find Starbucks in the lobby on our way out for lunch.  I know you are probably thinking that there is no way Embassy Suites is that nice...well, you are WRONG!  It is so nice and modern.  It almost made me feel like I was in a boutique hotel.  The service was great, even calling up to our room to make sure the accommodations were okay.  Nice touch.  The valet guys were great and got us a cab immediately to take us to dinner.  I would never hesitate to stay here...look out Worthington, you officially have competition.Awesome - first class all the way!  From the moment I was greeted at the door, it was warm and professional the entire time.  Thanks for one of the best stays I have ever had!My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary but we didn't want to go out of town like we had the past 2 years. So we decided to have a staycation and just go to Fort Worth for 2 days. We originally planned on staying at the hotel that we went to the night of our wedding but ultimately we decided on Embassy Suites. I had stayed here once to celebrate my bachelorette party. One thing I remembered about the hotel was the awesome breakfast in the morning. I'm so glad we decided to stay here! I had reserved a 2-room, king bed suite and was SO excited to see that they had upgraded us to a Whirlpool tub suite! The room was beautiful, the front desk people were very friendly, the breakfast was delicious, the manager's reception had free drinks, and I would definitely stay here again!!!!",,,"['love', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-fort-worth-downtown-hotel-fort-worth,Sheraton Fort Worth Downtown Hotel,3.0,$$,72,"Not bad but not a hotel to write home about.I stayed here for a night on a work trip. The biggest pro is the location! Right across from the water gardens and just down the street from the convention center. Another pro, comfortable beds! The room was set pretty cool and thankfully didn't have that hotel moldy lingering smell.I had so many hopes that my stay here would be great. I was welcomed very warmly by the front desk staff, and though they ran out of club level rooms, they did generously offer club access -- which I very much appreciate for the beverage selection they have and quick snacks. They have dedicated spots for SPG Elites to park in the garage. This was a first for me. And appreciated. I loved how easy it was to move from my car to my room. No valet here. I prefer to park my own car whenever possible anyhow.The location is fantastic right at the southside of downtown across the street from the remarkably enchanting Water Garden. I highly recommend checking it out - both during the day and night. Room itself was among the largest Sheraton rooms I've ever stayed in. I was thrilled when I walked in. Well appointed for the late 80's. Everything was in order and not damaged. Also had the the new technology for controlling the tv with your smartphone which I love. What ruined this stay for me was one very poorly overlooked room service cleaning item. I got out of the shower on the first morning of my trip and grabbed a towel. It gets gross from here. But needless to say, what I grabbed was a very dirty and soiled towel, neatly folded into the stack. It was horrifying. That ruined my stay. Attempted to bring it up at checkout, but I was rushed and didn't care to receive an apathetic response from the front desk staff, which by this time had changed quite a bit from the friendly staff encountered when I arrived.This hotel is central to almost everything. Best reason yet? It's right across from The Water Garden. The walkability this hotel offers to d/t Fort Worth is pretty awesome. Granted it's not in Main St. where all the restaurants are but this is pretty close by. I walked the d/t area from this hotel and I wasn't even tired. Their Starwood Preferred Floor is on the 10th floor as well as their lounge. You can get free breakfast at the Starwood Lounge every morning. Bacon, eggs, cereal, soda, lots of bottled water and juice. They also have two big tv's. A computer and a printer is ready for you to use as well.Great staff. Friendly and eager to help. They offer a special parking space for SPG members but that space is pretty much limited and can only park about 7 cars? Self park is $20/day. With the gift of two tickets for a free house wine at the lobby bar when you check in and bottled waters in the room the Sheraton is in some aspects better than other SPG hotels. Although this property is somewhat old and in need of a modern upgrade. The bathrooms are pretty small and dark but the bed is very comfortable. What I appreciate the most is that the television is placed where it should be. Right across from you at the foot of the bed and not to your right or to your left. Sadly their water pressure is annoying me. I want it stronger.Amazing service. I highly recommend this hotel. We stayed here Valentine's Day weekend. I had a lot of requests/complaints about our room and they changed it to a room with a better view. The hotel is very luxurious, we especially enjoyed the pool. They even found and returned our stuffed chicken, McNuggets, who got left under the blankets in the room. They wrote us the sweetest note thanking us for our visit; which we really did not deserve when we were such a pain. This experience will make me stay at Sheraton hotels again.Five stars, all for the front desk staff. The young woman who helped me today was incredibly patient and kind. Excellent customer service may not be all a business needs, but it sure does make up for many flaws. Thank you for your welcoming personality!Wonderful staff...very friendly and accommodating! The renovations made over the past year are impressive. Love the new look of the lobby. Comfortable room and bed.Very nice hotel for a Sheraton. The staff were all very friendly &amp; the room was clean &amp; comfortable, even though we had a view of a brick wall &amp; air conditioner or something. We are honors members, so the parking situation was good for us, but there is no valet...? Odd. The parking space was kinda hard to get out of &amp; its lucky they have foam pieces on the concrete beams so cars don't get scratched.Overall, a decent stay.I keep hearing that all sheratons are getting huge upgrades... someone forgot to tell this place!It feels outdated, not a fan. The rooms are clean, but the carpet looks like it was put there 20 years ago. Who thought brown was a good color scheme for a hotel room?The club lounge is very nice and spacious. The gym and pool are nice as well - that's the only thing saving this place!If you are SPG, this is your only choice around here, but just know that it won't be as good as other updated SPG propertiesThis road warrior thinks the hotel is so-so.  The hotel appears to have been around for a while and the decor is tired and mundane.  Definitely no wow factor in this place.  The restaurant/bar is equally drab and routine.  The rooms are standard and I hate their pillows.  I think you'll find a review that mentions the pillows and I will have to agree with that reviewer.Its located away from the downtown area, restaurants and bars. Not a walking distance either. You'll need a short ride into town and then deal with the lack of parking downtown.   I think you can catch a free bus service into the downtown area or ask the desk for the hotel shuttle.Permanent and very loud humming noise in 220, coming from an engine or a chiller outside. I informed the management and they offered to check the noise and eventually relocate us. After four hours I had to go and ask them once more to come and check, at which point they say they can't do anything because they don't have even a single room left. Please note this is a 499$/night room with a view over a dirty backyard and a wall! I have never had such a poor service and such unprofessional people at a Sheraton. Be kind to yourself and get a room in Omni, on the other side of the convention center.I had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay over the past week.  My room was kept up well over the duration of my visit, was always clean, and the staff were very friendly and warm, especially the wonderful TCU women working during the afternoon and evening.  They made me feel special and at home without crossing lines, which made the stay all the better. I will say that the business center is lacing greatly.  It's time to get rid of quota printing and crappy Internet...this is an inexpensive area to improve life substantially for your guests.  If I need to print six sheets, I shouldn't have to jump through 100 hoops and still have it not print.  Just have a printer available and let people do what they need to do - trust me, it easily averages out.There are other areas for improvement, but mostly requiring substantial investments in amenity upgrades.  This was an excellent mid range hotel experience.Nice location but more cons than pros.  There seemed to be a party on every floor so don't plan on sleeping as the walls are very thin and we could hear our neighbor's until 3am.  We also had family staying several floors up from us with the same problem.  No hot water in the shower and no working irons after trying irons from several rooms!I didn't actually stay at the hotel (I live in Fort Worth) but I stop by here often. You see, I'm a Volksmarcher (a noncompetitive walker) and the Downtown Fort Worth walk begins at the Sheraton.The staff here is super friendly. Even though I'm not a paying guest, everyone greets me and asks how they can help. When I'm walking out the door, they wish me a good walk; when I'm returning, they ask how my walk was. It feels like they genuinely care.This place is super clean. The restrooms are cleaned regularly The women's restroom is often cleaned in the two hours I'm walking. Today I witnessed both the bar being cleaned and vacuuming.The hotel is in a very convenient location. It's right across the street from the Water Gardens. It's only a couple of blocks from the train/bus station. It's near the UTA FW campus. The Bass Music Hall is just down the road. It's only a few blocks from all the restaurants and downtown happenings.The hotel is newly renovated. They changed out the colors and decor of their public spaces. It's much more spacious now with lovely groupings of furniture that makes it easy to meet-and-greet.While I have never stayed here, I do recommend it to out-of-town visitors. I feel safe here.So I travel the country doing photo assignments for various companies. Often the client houses me. This hotel is going under a series of renovations but still looks very dated. It will take quite a bit of money to turn this into a 4-5 star hotel. The check in desk is just 10 steps from the front doors. The length of the lobby is very narrow and very long. The lobby music is a bit loud. My room is nice but not as nice as it could be.  Plenty of room and ceilings have that popcorn paint. ( not sure what you call it). The workout area was moved downstairs and its it so lacking in weights. It only has dumb bells and some treadmills  and a bike. Not very user friendly and very claustrophobic in size. The pools is big but again it lacks style and the lighting is dull and low. I hope after the renovations it will shine. I hope. Now the bar and restaurant was fine and the food was good.Will not be staying here anytime soon. The service is lack luster all around.  First our room wasn't ready when we arrived and had to be called at leas an hour later to form back. Then went to the gift shop for Tylenol later and the girl was on her phone texting. She stood when I entered the store but kept texting. She finally told me that they didn't take credit cards at the moment. So we would have to put it on the room or cash.   She couldn't even find us on the room list so she went to get another list and left me in the store for a few minutes alone. Still not on there when she returned with another list. I had to take the medicine to the front desk and they had no idea that the gift shop couldn't take cc's. So this morning we go to have the club breakfast because it's supposed to be served until 10:30 via the website. We get there right after 10 and the lady says we just missed it. That it has stopped at 10 for years.  We complained to the manager and she offered breakfast at the restaurant but at this point we were ready to leave. We were celebrating our one year anniversary at the same hotel we staid at for our wedding. It's unfortunate but I think there are way too many options around the area to settle for this place.This place is kind of a dump.  And by ""kind of a dump"" I mean that it is a f*ing dump.  Granted, they are renovating, so that will help.  Hopefully they find a way to make the lobby feel less like a mental institution.  The pool/hot tub area is bleak.  Like, BLEAK.  The desk agent was very nice, and he upgraded us to a suite and gave us access to the Club Lounge, so that was nice.  Our room was on a floor that had already been renovated, so at first blush it was quite lovely.Then I noticed the popcorn ceiling (which always makes me feel a bit of mesothelioma coming on) and that two of the bed's four posters were shoved up against the sprinkler bulkhead (and that this heinous ceiling was quite low).  What really mattered, however, follows:1.  The bedding was awful.2.  The door didn't fit properly in the jamb so it was still pretty bright in the room with the lights off.3.  There was an adjoining door that seemed to be made of paper, because I could hear my neighbor's insomniacal TV watching as if I were watching TV myself.4.  The windows were so caked in mud you almost couldn't tell that the view was of a train yard.There were a couple of good things though:1.  There was a large and comfortable sectional sofa in the room that was great for hanging out in the room.2.  Basic WiFi is free and was sufficiently fast to watch Netflix. Not bad.I only stayed here because I was attending a wedding in Fort Worth and this was the closest SPG hotel to the venue.  Otherwise I never would have booked at this hotel.  Side note: we were upgraded so it's irrelevant to me, but they charge you more for a room with one king bed as opposed to two queens.  I've never seen that and it is stupid.  Also they charge for parking.  Lame.Venue Rental Review: We reserved a room for a baby shower at this location. The event staff was thorough in their communication and documentation. Diana answered any and all questions I had regarding the venue and menu request for the food. The kitchen did an amazing job with the food. The room rental was affordable. The food cost was a little high but the convenience of not having to bring anything in was beyond worth it. Thank you!This hotel was okay, but not the best. After reading some of the reviews below, I realize I had a better experience than most. The staff was nice and attentive, never had a problem with that. We got a king size bed suite and the rooms are pretty spacious! The place is nice, but some areas look like they could use new furniture. We only stayed a night, so we didn't have time to check out the spa, pool or hot tub. I did like the location of the hotel. Right across the street is the Fort Worth Water Gardens, which are pretty cool to check out. The room was a little pricey (well at least for a broke 23 year old). All in all not a terrible place to stay.This abomination of the Sheraton name, has ruined my vacation. My first impression of Ft Worth has been scarred by the disgrace of this hotel. For starters, check-in/check-out is an inevitable time suck that establishes the low standard. Then the overall hotel has a decade old design both inside and outside the rooms. The room doesn't not have a microwave, they have to be requested. Secondly, the cleaning crew starts early in the morning from the top of the hotel, as a ""wake up call"".Although the hot tub/pool along with the ambient music were both relaxing, my meditation was brutally interrupted when gorditas took it upon themselves to order pizza. The breakfast was expensive and insufficient. It would be best if you eat in an actual restaurant. Lastly, if you are from Texas, the gift shop is a waste of you time. The semi-friendly staff is not enough to substantiate the inadequacy of the hotel.I stayed at this property (September 13-19, 2015) for an entire week. Of all the properties I've stayed at, this is the only I felt like it was outdated. It needs a lot of upgrading with furnitures, decor, carpet (especially), and the windows need to be cleaned on the outside. I stayed on the 4th floor, and I could barely see out. When I arrived in my room, I realized that it was a handicapped room. I returned to the front desk if I could be moved to another room; I was told that I requested or was on my preferred list. The front staff told me that I would be moved the next and someone would call me--it didn't happen. At the end of my day, I stopped by at the front desk to see if I was moved. They had forgotten about my request. Eventually, I was moved. The pictures posted on the site seems to be misleading. The location is just outside of the downtown (or Sundance) area. There is not much around here unless you walk about 6 or more city blocks for restaurants, shopping stores, etc.","Nothing but problems from the moment I checked in.  I sincerely hope the manager sees this and reaches out to me for an explanation. The issues had nothing to do with the remodel taking place. I came into town for a friend's wedding, and requested an adjoining room with the other couple we traveled with. Called to request the adjoining room no less than 3 weeks prior to my stay. On that call, after being accidentally hung up on, put on hold for 7+ minutes, and finally speaking with someone I just had a feeling my request wasn't noted. So, I called again 3 days prior to my check-in. Low and behold my original request was never in their system. Good thing I called back (I thought)! I arrive to check in and sure enough, there was no adjoining room available. I said I'd wait for a room to be available and they'd call me to let me know. After an hour of waiting in the lobby, I went back to the front desk to check on my room. Sure enough, it had been ready they just forgot to call me! Casey at the front desk apologized for having to put me on the 'pet floor' to accomplish the adjoining room - at this point I could have cared less. I check into room, then 10 minutes later my friend checked in and they didn't put us in adjoining rooms. OMG what is so hard??!We marched back downstairs and Casey actually started to laugh at how ludicrous all the mix-ups were. The lack of professionalism was palpable. Finally, after more waiting we were setup in adjoining rooms after having to move all our stuff and completely change to the 'north tower' - no one even offered to help carry our bags after their mistake. The room 'refurbishments' simply meant they are now updated to early the 2000's. The rooms are still dimly lit, there are no towel hooks in the bathroom, or any fridge/microwave setup. For a hotel at this price this is something you'd expect. Not to mention the walls are paper thin so you can hear every door on your hallway slam shut. The vending machine ate our dollars.....literally there were problems around every corner. On the last day we checked out and asked that our bags be held...we came back an hour later to find our bags had been scattered all around the storage area where they were held leaving to panic that someone had taken our stuff (there wasn't exactly a 'system' in place - just one tag that went on 4 of our bags rendering it useless once they were separated!) DON'T STAY HERE.GREAT hospitality! The first time we stayed here, they accidentally double charged us! We had trouble getting the charges reversed. HOWEVER, then, the manager stepped in and provided us with a WONDERFUL complimentary night in a suite with champagne and breakfast. MORE than made up for our troubles! We WILL return and maybe even book the suite!I... can't. Not again. On a day that was plagued with unrelated customer service issues, the last thing I wanted to think about was having another difficult conversation just to get a semblance of what I had paid for, and at 10pm. Unfortunately, I was met with two queen beds instead of a king and in the morning, wasn't able to get a receipt after my rate was altered (I had found a cheaper rate on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> so Starwood matched the rate). Um, how am I supposed to get reimbursed for my business travel if I can't produce a receipt?Thanks guys, for making it my problem to contend with. It's very rare that I have an issue at a Starwood property considering their excellent customer service mission and my earned loyalty status, but here we are.We had a few issues when we checked in and it seemed to be one thing after another.  However, the management stepped up and solved all issues and in fact, they went above and beyond the call. Yes, I'd stay here again.  There have been complaints written on here and yes the hotel is being renovated, but that's just going to make it better.Special thanks to Helen and Crystal who were wonderful.This place was terribly loud!  The first night we stayed here I was awoken at 3 am because the couple next door was having a raging fight.  She's a ******** *****! and he was a ******* *******! For over an HOUR yelling, screaming...crap got thrown.  What the ****?! Do the world a favor (and your children) and get a divorce already.  It's too bad you couldn't do that BEFORE you were in the room next door keeping me from sleeping.  Then the second night, I was woken by drunk people yelling down the halls because it seems no one has any respect or common courtesy for others in public places esp. hotels where people might be oh, idk, SLEEPING.  Just when I think the last wave of borachos are passed out on their floors this woman starts banging on the door next to ours yelling for some dude.  Good LORD woman ever heard of a cell phone?!?!  Call him.  All of this was made worse by the fact that my dog thinks she's some sort of guard dog even though she couldn't hurt fly.  Every stomp, holler, slamming of the door was followed by BARK BARK BARK BARK.  I can't control her anymore than I can control the A**hats who stay at this hotel.  Never again will I stay here.  I value my sleep far too much.Been staying here on and off for the past 4 years and it's about time for their renovation. The Club floor looks fantastic. I also have to say they have the most spacious and well stocked Club lounges of any recent SPG property I've stayed at. Kudos to the team here.Checked in on June 1st, 2013 for a REX 2013 convention. Checking out on June 6th, 2013The front desk was very friendly and VERY efficient. I was checked in within 7 minutes. The lady also looked like Miss Texas. :-)The room was amazing. It was very spacious and the bed was very COMFORTABLE. I just LOVED the room.The only complaint I have is the vending machine. The one on my floor (12th floor) was sold out. I went to the other floors to get some Soda Pop, however, the vending machine did not work. Mr. Sheraton, please refill and repair the machines. This just drives me crazy. I need my Soda Pop fix ... :-))I was very pleased with all of my interactions with the staff at this Sheraton except for the young lady at the coffee stand in the lobby. I wanted to get a cup of coffee but she was too busy talking with her friends then serving me. After waiting for about 2 minutes, I just left as she did not acknowledge me and it seems her conversation with her friends were going to take a while.So I left and went to Omni Hotel. There is a Starbucks in the Omni and I was served also immediately there. My regular, three shots over ice in a Venti cup. :-))Mr. Sheraton, maybe you forgot but the smallest things make the DIFFERENCE.Overall I did enjoyed my stay at this Sheraton.p/s thank you so much for the Free WiFi in my roomGreat location directly across from the Water Gardens!  The rooms are nice and the staff was super friendly too!  The club lounge was great for breakfast - continental and warm breakfast options.  Love that my small dog could stay for free and was welcomed as a valued guest.My only complaint was that housekeeping knocked twice even though I had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door.Hotel is nice but they charge you $20.00 a day to park! I would rather them be honest and build that charge into the room fee rather than surprise you with it. I can see it makes all of the customer's upset. it's a wonder why this hotel has a poor Yelp rating. It is a nice hotel though, so they deserve 4 stars.Stayed here a year ago and didn't understand the terrible reviews. Now I get it. The only thing keeping me from demanding a new room -- or even heading to another hotel is that I've finally got my kid asleep after two hours. I sprung for a hospitality suite with a sofa bed because we're traveling with two children. But we can hear every word coming from the adjoining room - both conversation and the TV. Now, the occupants are obnoxious and don't seem to recognize they're sharing a wall. But the soundproofing is so bad that there might as well not be a wall at all. And the toilet doesn't flush. Dreadful. Staying in another Sheraton next week and already dreading it.Listen, this place is a dump. Beside from my opinion that this Sheraton is dirty, they have double charged my credit card on the past two stays.It's pretty f'n frustrating when I have to make repeated phone calls to this property, after they overcharge my credit card. I could understand one occurrence, but they double charged me twice! I won't insinuate that this is a common practice, but one could question their billing tactics.I wouldn't even stay here again if the room was free.General Manager Mr. Jon Yeoung and all of his staff helped to make our 15th wedding anniversary an experience we will not soon forget. We got the Champagne Package, which included an early check-in, a large suite, exceptional dinner, a bottle of iced champagne, breakfast each morning (made-to-order omelets!), chocolate covered strawberries, and great two nights, with a late check out, with the love of my life.  (NOTE: Love of my life not included in Champagne Package). We had the pool to ourselves and enjoyed the Water Gardens across the street. I had laid out silk rose petals all over the room. When room service came the second day, the arranged some petals on our made bed in the shape of a heart. All the staff was attentive and accommodating. Based on other reviews, I thought the trains were going to be a nuisance. I didn't even notice them. The bed was comfy, with clean linens and down pillows (my fave). If your looking for the Four Seasons (which I love), then go to the Four Seasons. If you want a solid hotel at a reasonable rate with excellent management from the top down, then this is your place.Thanks Sheraton!!!!Worst hotel in downtown Fort Worth now.  The staff just does not appear to be managed properly.  They seem nice and well intentioned but do not actually try to follow through with any part of their job.  The room was dirty at checkin and still had the last persons trash and hair products in the room and bathroom.  Everyday, after 4pm, I had to call the the front desk to let them know no one came to my room to clean it.  They nicely just kept telling me that I must have put the do not disturb sign on the door.  This was once a four star hotel but the management doesn't care anymore and the employees have followed suite.  I couldn't even get the front desk to follow up on simple requests.  It is slowly becoming  a one star hotel.  Stay anywhere else downtown.We had such a great stay here! Everyone was so friendly but not over the top. The front desk checked us in early without a fuss. When we got there, I saw one of the front desk girls - Autrey - get yelled at by a man in a business suit over wanting $6.00 ( yes - six dollars) credited to his room. She was still really nice to him and gave him what he wanted whereas I would have returned his attitude to him. The room was spacious and clean. Very quiet. Didn't get disturbed once by cleaning staff. AC worked great. We will definitely stay again the next time we are in the area!Clean but very noisy (trains) room.  Front desk staff a bit unfriendly at check in.  Bed not most comfy.  Deli staff would rather text than greet customers.  Overall disappointing.I will list the disappointments in the order that I experienced them. Firstly, the actual entrance to the hotel is not clearly marked; we drove around the entire hotel before finding the entrance. Then we were surprised to find that parking in the hotels parking garage is $20 per day even though we were checked into the hotel. From there we entered the lobby area and we were very surprised to see the entire lobby floor was under construction. After seeing photos of luxurious common areas with richly appointed decor we found ourselves staring at beige painted drywall in every direction. Due to the construction there was no gift shop, convenience shop or Starbucks coffee shop. After getting checked in we get to the room, which is nicely appointed, and a good size. Deduct points for lack of mini fridge. Then I inspect the bathroom. I would compare it to the lavatory of a commercial airplane. The door misses the toilet by mere inches. We leave our luggage and go to explore the hotel amenities. First stop is the pool, hot tub and sauna. The pool &amp; hot tub are indoors which is a plus but the area gives the first impression of a dimly lit giant beige painted cave with no windows, surrounded by drywall. You almost feel as if your in parking garage. We make a quick scan for the sauna and come up empty. From there we visit the Spa to make appointments for the next day. While in the Spa I inquire as to the hotels Sauna. This is where things get really odd. The cashier girl takes us through a maze of hallways and after 3 or 4 lefts then right we come to a key card locked door. She uses the spa's key card to unlock the room and low and behold the sauna is nestled inside. The ""Sauna"" is a portable 5x5x8 box, the likes of which you can order off <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FAmazon.com&amp;s=60e7c1d17ec1c8362999f69b5791e02482fddb677ddc238da7418daf522574ae"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>. This was really the biggest disappointment of our stay. We had chosen the Sheraton specifically because their website specified ""Sauna"" where other local hotels did not. Textbook definition of the ""Bait and switch"". If getting to the Sauna was not so convoluted with first working off the Spa Business's hours, then finding your way thru the maze of hallways, passing a dozens doorways and broom closets and then needing the Spa's key card to access the Sauna's room, you finally get there like some episode of Mission Impossible to find this little portable box. I'm already thinking about leaving but decide stay the night and see how it goes. The night was terrible. I had to use all 4 pillows stacked atop of each other to get my head off the mattress. They were akin to half filled sandbags. If I wasn't fist fighting my pillows I was listening to the various police sirens, fire trucks, garbage trucks, cars peeling out up and down the strip or various large machines cycling on and off throughout the night. It was like trying to sleep in the middle of Texas Motor Speedway during the Winston 500. The next catastrophic fail happened the first and last morning of our stay. We were comp'ed a free breakfast in the ""Club Room"". Now we watched the hotels TV channel that night and saw images of very nice and inviting Club Rooms where people are lounging about comfortably and chatting. Scenic views and the whole bit. So, morning arrives and we are looking forward to our free breakfast. We were told breakfast ended at 10:30 and we head out to find it at 10:00. The Club Room turned out to be room 1077 which in fact looked like two hotel rooms with the dividing wall knocked down. As for the inviting and comfortable images we saw on TV the night before, we arrive to find a partially decorated room furnished with tables like you might find in a Waffle House complete with little chairs. And to our surprise breakfast ended 5 minutes ago. Nothing left except the smell of bacon and eggs. We return to our room, call and the front desk and ask again when breakfast ends. They again tell us 10:30 and we explain to them it has already closed at 10. To solve the matter they give us 2 free vouchers for breakfast in the dining area in the lobby. We finally eat breakfast and try to decide what to do next. I have a mind-numbing headache from my night at the Speed Way and all I want is an Advil. Of course I forgot to pack them and since the Hotel has no shop I am forced to navigate Down Town Fort Worth for something as simple as a single pill. I opt to try to sleep it off. We return to our room after breakfast and try to sleep. The sounds of the city accompanied with the various electric drills and parade of maids up and down our hallway keeps me up. Then about the time I think Im finally nodding off for the first time since we checked in the day before, the complimentary hotel alarm clock on the nightstand goes off right at 12 noon. Apparently left set by the last poor souls who stayed in the room. Having no idea how to turn it off I am relegated to ripping it from the wall. Looks like I'm out of space to type so I'll close by saying we got massaged then checked out a day early. Never to return.The staff was pleasant and the room clean. Otherwise, I'll skip this location if I ever chance to be in Fort Worth again. It's more like a Four Points than an actual Sheraton flagship hotel. Noisy, dated and a bit drab. I have no idea why the word ""Spa"" is attached to the name.I didnt even stay here, this review is strictly written on the mistakes made by the hotel and how it was handled by the staff.I was supposed to come to Fort Worth for a wedding and had planned on staying 2 nights, life circumstances changed and I had to cancel my hotel stay altogether.  I called to cancel my reservation 16 days before my scheduled stay, got it taken care of, received a cancellation # and email confirming said cancellation that same day.  So, all is good right? Wrong.Today (the Monday after the weekend I was supposed to stay at the Sheraton in Fort Worth) I checked my credit card statement and saw 3 DIFFERENT charges to the hotel.  Reminder, I never was at this hotel at all, ever, and had my cancellation # saved in my email.I got all the emails together for reference and called the hotel, expecting an easy, quick refund and fix with an apology, and I would be on my way. After all, I had the cancellation # AND called armed with my original reservation confirmation #.  I was then told, by the woman in accounting, that I had reserved 4 rooms, and only one of them was cancelled.  4 ROOMS?! Why would me and my fiance need 4 rooms?! I tried to laugh it off and told her sorry that must have been a mistake, I even had my original reservation email here, showing 1 room, 2 nights, for 2 adults. The girl I talked too (I say girl because her immaturity was quite evident in her horrid behavior towards me) then proceeded to tell me, ""You are wrong, you reserved 4 rooms and only cancelled one, so this is on you."" I was a bit taken aback at this and, being in customer service myself replied ""I understand there must have been a mistake made somewhere, but as the customer it is certainly not on my end, I called to cancel my reservation with plenty of time to avoid penalty here is the cancellation #, I just want these charges to be dropped from my credit card.  If you cannot help me could I please talk to a manager.""  At that point, I was hung up on.When I called back to the hotel, I explained to the concierge what had happened and he replied ""Oh um, well hold on I'll transfer you to someone I guess"" and then I was left on hold for 20 minutes, during this 20 minutes I could tell the line I was holding on was repeatedly being picked up, and placed back on hold, as I could hear laughter and talking in the background intermittently during this time.  Finally, the line was picked up and I was promptly hung up on again.After this I called the Sheraton corporate line, where the customer service is actually wonderful and very helpful.  But while my corporate representative was helping me, agreeing that my reservation WAS indeed cancelled, and somewhere along the way my same reservation was entered into the computer 4 times, even though I only ever received one confirmation #, he also had to call the Fort Worth Sheraton directly.  At this point, they were unreceptive to even their corporate counterpart.  He had to place me on hold to converse with the hotel, and had to come back to my line twice to let me know he ""was being transferred from person to person, and could certainly see where my frustration lay.""Sheraton Corporate ended up handling this and resolving the issue, but I just want to reiterate how sub-par and horrendous I was treated by the on-site employees of Sheraton Fort Worth. When I head that way again, which I certainly will, I will not be wasting my money rewarding such behaviors and I witnessed.DO NOT stay here..bugs everywhere and service is horrible. Took us 3 hours 4 calls to get a blanket. Was there 7/9-7/11. I'm Hilton Honor Diamond member but my husband is the Elite for Starwood. My husband went back there this week for work and the air conditioning broke down in his room and the way they handled it was horrible. my poor husband was in his room with no air in a hour and had to go down stair to get a new room key and and then have to move everything by himself. This is the WORST Sheraton and DON'T stay here if you have a choice. I'm very surprised that the management has done anything to improve.  I think we will stay with Hilton for sure.It's a pretty no-frills (frill-less?) arrangement, and I had occasion to get to know these guys a little during a move: the spa part, though it exists, seems a little more in name than in posh actuality, and the rooms, though spacious and comfy enough, were definitely not as modern as other SPG properties where I've spent time. It's not exactly a sans-amenity hotel, exactly, but you'd be hard pressed to confuse it with a more ornate hotel environment. Situated on the edge of downtown, you're technically within walking distance of dining and nightlife, but know that it wouldn't necessarily be a comfortable walk, contingent on where you're headed. Nevertheless, the valet guys were super on the ball in my experience, and told me that with a couple of minutes notice they could always have my ride ready. And they did. Fortunately, I don't have to bunk at a hotel often in Fort Worth, but given that option, I'd certainly consider doing so here. I just most likely wouldn't expect the pampering experience of a lifetime.","I was at the Sheraton in Fort Worth for a business meeting. First the conference rooms--the rooms themselves were okay, but the food served was mediocre at best. Not enough vegetables, and the vegetarians were pretty much out of luck. Granted it's Texas, but still. And they had NO caffeinated tea, which is just weird. Usually it's the other way around...The room was okay. A bit small and in need of some TLC--trim pieces just missing in the bathroom, mold in the shower chalk. That said, the bed was comfortable, and the sheets reasonably soft. Overall, not bad--just not anything special.This place is pretty dumpy for a Sheraton. Not sure where the ""and spa"" comes from, the so called spa looked pretty sad when I walked by, and I certainly wouldn't come to this location for relaxation. The first room they gave me was next to the freeway AND a train line- can you say loud? I complained and they gave me a room on the other side, quieter but still dingy as hell. Fitness center is totally ghetto, not even a water cooler- but it does have a beautiful view of the railyard while you're walking out. Lastly, when you go out at night, it's in a sketchy area. In short, I'm staying elsewhere next time.I've stayed at a lot of Sheratons some really nice and some that are just what you have come to expect of a ""remodeled"" Sheraton.Stayed here March 2012I would stay here again if I was here for work as the quality of the hotel is average and defin. good for business travel.I was here visiting family so typically when you are on vacation we would stay at a Westin or higher.The pool is really nice (in-door), bars are nice and general hotel areas are nice. Has a SPA but obviously not as high end as you would expect for a hotel that actually has ""Hotel and Spa"" in the name. It does the job though.Staff are all attentive and nice and location is centrally located to downtown.Only complaints:1) Rooms feel like they are worn. I was upgraded to a corner suite but there are just little things that make you feel like this place has just been through a lot. Considering that I spend a decent amount with Starwood hotels you would think they would put me in a room that at least has carpets that don't have intense stains :). I've been to some bad Sheratons but honestly, how much does it cost you to deep clean or just change the carpet in the room. Or at least put your platinum in a corner suite that's clean. You should at least know which rooms have messed up carpets or not.2) Train. I think others mentioned this but if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room away from the trains. I didn't ask to change as we were OK with it but if you don't want that awesome freight train experience, get a room opposite the train side.Overall, good value and good place to stay if you are not here for a romantic getaway.Business trips are fine.3) Bring earplugs to the toilet. I usually commend on a good flush but these toilets might take you with it. Not much they can do on this but just an FYIStayed here a week for work and it was a fairly decent hotel in the heart of Fort Worth. There is nothing that stands out about it but I had no major problems with it. The rooms only had a couple outlets and the bar/restaurant is underwhelming. If you can get a deal on this place go for it. The staff was all very nice too.WoW! I am surprised at the other negative reviews? I was there for 4 days and I had a great experience. Loved the SPG Club Lounge snacking and drink options..very generous and tasty. The staff was awesome to me; super friendly. I wanted to go to the museums and they offered to take me and said to call them back when I was done..that they could take me anywere within a three mile radius for free and they sure did!!! I was treated like the Queen of Sheba. The Spa experience was amazing...I do a lot of traveling and have stayed at many hotels nationwide and internationally. Bed was super comfortable..but like any other place...must depend on who you deal with..employees, etc...???I am a long time SPG Rewards Member and always pick their properties no matter where I travel whether it's for business or pleasure. They usually have nice properties and in my opinion, the best hotel rewards program there is.I stayed at this hotel this past weekend. The valet, concierge, and front desk guys were very friendly and I was able to check in very quickly.Upon arriving to my room, I did not receive the Standard King Size bed that we reserved using our American Airline miles and paying the difference for the second night. Okay no biggie...for right now...It was warm when I entered the room but that is usually the case in Texas-heat so I turned the thermostat down to 54 so that it could cool off quickly. I turned the fan on high and there was no air blowing out!I decided to go take a shower before I headed out for a birthday dinner and after using the bathroom, the toilet did not flush. I thought it was one of those quirky handle things but it still would not flush.I got out of the shower and got ready and everything (approximately an hour later) and the room thermostat was still reading 79.I went down to the front desk as I was heading to a nearby store and asked that they have someone check the room. The front desk guy was the same guy that checked me in...we will call him Brandon. He apologized and said that they will send an engineer to my room and he gave me a $10 voucher to use at the deli-- which was overpriced-- a bottled tea and power-ade costs $8.37.About an hour and a half later, I return and the room and toilet are still not working properly. I didn't have time to try and switch rooms so I told the shuttle driver to remind Brandon about my room.We come back to the room at about 3 a.m. and it's still hot and the toilet didn't work. We immediately went to the front desk and they came up to the room to check it out and then moved us to an upgraded room which was a nice suite even though it didn't have enough towels and shampoo.The next afternoon, we received a knock on our hotel door and it was room service with a handwritten apology from management and a tray of assorted cheeses, fruit, and crackers.A nice gesture until I was reviewing my FINAL (not pending) bank transactions and we we were charged $28.65 for our ""complimentary"" fruit and cheese. Not to mention, my deli charge of $4.22 which was actually $3.24 on my receipt.Sooooooooooo, in a nutshell, the hotel staff (front desk, valet, concierge) are nice but that's about it. The lobby is nice too as well as the pool, spa (overpriced), and suites.This place has a very good location but that's about it. The rooms are not soundproof at all, the wifi is terrible, parking is a rip off. So all in all not a pleasant experience.Pretty bad Sheraton.  It's pretty loud and there's nothing in walking distance.  When I first checked in, I had some issues which and emailed the manager, who promised to make a better effort next time, but I just hope I won't have to stay again.I stayed at this hotel in early June 2012 as part of a family vacation with my daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren (ages 4 and 6).  I was in a room with my grandchildren and their parents were in a room down the hall. The room was average in every way. No standout features to recommend, and nothing to complain about.  The common areas of the property were somewhat less luxurious than expected for a downtown hotel one block from a major convention center.  The indoor pool area was dismal. The lighting was inadequate and the pool chairs were somewhat uncomfortable.  The decor was mostly gray concrete and the whole effect was like swimming in a parking garage. Room service was not up to par. I ordered dinner late one evening for the kids and me. My grandson had chicken strips that were obviously deep fried from frozen. My granddaughter had a grilled cheese sandwich that was toast and a lump of cheddar cheese that were nuked (if you have ever had microwaved bread or cheese you can imagine how inedible that sandwich was). My BLT was ok but the bread was hard. And, everything came with overly seasoned, soggy french fries that were dripping with grease.  The one plus about this hotel is its location across the street from the iconic Water Gardens. This hotel is probably best suited for business travelers who need a convenient location near the convention center and downtown with basic amenities.  However, i wouldn't suggest it for families on vacation. Overall i would give this hotel a grade of C-.When I go out to Fort Worth I have to get a hotel so I can get my drink on without worrying about the trek back to Big D.  The BF's mom works for Sheraton so she got us a discounted room at the Sheraton Fort Worth.The location is a little outside of the downtown proper area, but still conveniently located to wherever you want to go.  We were checked in quickly and they let us check in early which was nice.  And instead of valet we chose to park for free in the lot behind the hotel.  Free parking?  Nice.The lobby is huge and there is a bar, a gift shop with some actual interesting souvenirs, coffee shop, and I think there was a restaurant too.  I also saw a pool area and I'm pretty sure there's a spa there since it is in the name of the place...unfortunately I didn't get to partake.The hallways make the place look old with the dated colors.  However, the room was spacious and nice!  The bed was huge and I looooved the soft pillows and bedsheets.  There was also a flat screen tv, coffee maker with coffee and tea options, a nicely sized bathroom with the curved shower rod for extra room, a hair dryer, etc.  Pretty much everything you would expect from a nice hotel room.  The BF did mention that the shower head was extremely low for him to get underneath it so if you are tall you are going to have some problems. And despite the fact that there was a big student convention going on I had no problems with noise in the hallways when I was trying to sleep.  Who am I kidding?  I was probably the one that others were griping about when I came home at 2am that night!Overall a great place to stay as your home base if you are spending some time in Ft Worth.Dated property. Staff is friendly. Rooms are comfortable though could use a furniture refurb. Toilet uses a ""high tech"" pressure system that just doesn't work. Maintenance came in to replace a part - they were prompt &amp; nice - and they complained about how often they have to repair these systems (daily).Room service food was OK, not great. Self-parking is in an uncovered lot behind the hotel.Too many strikes against this property - I'll use the Marriott Residence Inn next visit to Ft. Worth.The hotel itself is nice and the location is convenient, however the room itself is in need of some serious maintenance and a little upkeep goes a long way. Our room was not very clean, the staff was okay they were not as helpful or welcoming as I am used to. The trash cans did not have liners and you could see all the streaks and such from whatever was in there for who knows how long? The phone and table were really dusty. Overall the cleanliness was by far the worst I had seen. It was our 5 year anniversary which was noted on our reservation and we didn't even get a happy anniversary at check in? I used to manage hotels myself and that just takes such little effort for a large impact on someone's experience. We will not be. Staying there again, we will be going back to the omni.I recently stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Spa in downtown Fort Worth for a weekend. My boyfriend and I were in town for his birthday celebration and I can't say enough good things about our experience at the Sheraton. The hotel staff went above and beyond our expectations to ensure we had a memorable stay. The front desk staff and valet always greeted us with a smile and positive attitude and they ensured we had everything we needed. We will definitely stay at this hotel the next time we are in the Fort Worth area.this Sheraton is right next to the water garden, which is a must go location.I really like the water garden....now back to the hotel,the staff is helpful, I was able to check in early.  (arrived at 1pm)the Jaccuzzi and pool area looks nice but I didn't have time to use it.we got up grade to a corner suite which is a very big room. the bed, I will agree with the other yelper is not very soft.If you are SPG gold/platinum member you can go to the club lounge on the top floor where they serve appetizer in the after noon and breakfast.  It's a huge area with comfortable sofas.very nice. the breakfast doesn't have many items but it's quite good.  I want to come back again and stay for more days in the future.I often find Yelp unreliable when it comes to hotel reviews. There are multiple x factors that mean two people can stay at the same hotel on the same night and have wildly different experiences. I realize this is true for restaurants as well, but it's in the hotel category where I've found this to mostly be the case. Maybe someone at the front desk was rude to you. Maybe you happened to have a noisy neighbor. Maybe housekeeping wasn't on top of their game that day and the room wasn't spotless. Maybe you are from a small town and your idea of what the ""ghetto"" is is completely out of whack.My experience with the Sheraton just happened to be a positive one. Check-in process was a breeze and they had no issue with our late check-in (around 10pm). Room was spacious and clean. True, it's not smack-dab in the middle of downtown, but there are bars and restaurants within walking distance. I felt completely safe at all times - no sketchy characters hanging about. The Cultural District and The Stockyards are both a quick car ride away. Pool and hot tub were nice, if overrun with noisy children, but that's not the hotel's fault. Downsides = in-room wifi was spotty. Parking is $18/valet, $12/self-park. The self-park area does look a little sketchy - it's behind the hotel, next to a train station, but it is gated and we didn't have any problems. Like Jaime said, be sure to check out the Fort Worth Water Garden across the street. It's really unique and well worth a look.First off, I don't do many reviews because I think that most ""Yelptards"" are completely narcissistic and confuse what is not a big deal to the end of the freaking world.  Like the person who gives a restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't have enough parking and they had to walk a little bit to the restaurant.  Boo-f*cking-hoo.That being said, this Sheraton is an absolute toilet. Why?1-Check in, room is 80 degrees and cold water is hot.2-Find massive roach, and I do mean massive, in the tub. It was like 3"". Change rooms.3-Call downstairs next morning to get my car. Wait for 20 minutes. We dont have your car. Oh wait, here it is.4-Call room service next day. No one answers. Call guest services.  No one answers. Call front desk. Answers after 15 rings. Tell them room service isn't answering. Says he will personally have room service call me within 2 minutes. 10 minutes later. No call.5-Call room service again and get ""Jose"". I want a bottle of wine. Fine he says, 20 minutes.6-30 minutes later no wine. Call down.  Its on its way up.7-15 minutes later. No wine8- Call room service to complain. No one answers.9-Call front desk. I will get right on that and call you back in 2 minutes.10-Think he called back?11-Went down to bar where Jose and pals jerking off to their phones.12-Order glass of wine.13-Get half pour.Screw. This. Place.Oh, and I am a Platinum Marriott member who was trying out SPG because of a loyalty program with Delta. Good work SPG.Nice lobby and large rooms.  Front desk staff are friendly and helpful.  Great beds but rooms lack some of storage space usually found in hotels of this level and the bathrooms are on the small side.  Somehow, the rooms feel slightly dated.  Request a room on the side of the building away from the railroad tracks unless you need an early AM wake up.  Fitness center is clean and adequate.Water gardens are right across the street as is convention center.  Some interesting restaurants are just a short walk away.Very nice modern upgrades to the Sheraton. Restrooms are very nice and clean. Free freshly popped popcorn and computers plus Wi-fi. They also have shoe shine service. This hotel service staff is always so courteous and helpful. With the well known Shula's makes the hotel at the top of my list to have a weekend leisure intown stay. Can't say anything bad of this hotel.Bottom line, not that great. The lobby was nice and that's it.  My wife called to ask a question and was placed on hold and then forgotten about. The rooms are rundown and the bathrooms need to be renovated (there was rust around the fixtures). This hotel is not within walking distance of anything. The pillows were very cheap and provided no support.  Valet parking was $22/day or you can park in an unattended lot across the street for $10/day. Unless you get a great deal online, pick a different hotel.Bah, Ugh, Ewww, ""Are You Serious?!?"" That is what comes to mind when I think of my stay at this Sheraton. I stayed here one weekday night as a little stay'cation with a friend so we could spend the night in Fort Worth. Check in was short and sweet. They got a point for that! Room: We reserved a room with 2 queens. The TV was placed right in front of one of the beds, making it hardly viewable from the other. I said BAH, I'm not here to watch TV anyways. Room service isn't available after midnight. UGH! Vending machines in the hallways, EWW *tacky* Received my bill in the morning, two calls to a 800 number costing $1 each were on there. I called the number listed on my cell and it was for a Days Inn reservation service. I've never stayed at a Days Inn, and don't plan on it in the near future. I presented my dispute to the Front Desk. The only buttons I pushed on the phone in the room were the preset ones. They rebutted by saying that phones are directly linked to the rooms and I was registered when those calls were placed. ""Are You Serious?!?"". $2 freakin' dollars! It's the principle for me. I don't get it. This place was horrible for me! Stay away if you can!","The Sheraton is generally a very nice hotel and the staff that I interacted with (front desk, valet, etc) were all quite friendly and helpful.The rooms are large with nice beds, comfortable linens and flat screen above a HUGE desk that was almost the length of the room.  I was very disappointed with the size of the bathroom and have come to expect hotels to have a separate area for the sink outside of the toilet and shower area.  The towels were a little scratchy.  Also, popcorn ceilings??  Ugh.  And the location of the hotel is at the southern edge of downtown so if you cross I-30, lock your car doors because it gets pretty sketchy pretty quick.Valet is $18 per night (unlimited in-and-out) and the self-park is $12, so my friend and I went with valet since it's convenient and in the garage as opposed to the self-parking which is an uncovered chain-link fenced area on the other side of the building, we were told.  It was worth the extra $6 to not worry about the car.A nondescript, aging Sheraton in a forgotten about corner of Ft. Worth.  I stayed in a nice, large King suite which had a wet bar but no fridge?  The club lounge was nice, but everything about the hotel spoke to its age and lack of refurbishment (especially the furniture).  I think there are probably much better choices in Ft. Worth.  The free Wi-fi was nice and worked well.  Not much of a view of anything for a Spa, and a pretty standard pool area.This past weekend I was suppose to stay at the Sheraton for a conference. Upon arrival the lobby looks nicely renovated and clean, but once you get to your room it is all over. The rooms say they are ""renovated"" but they look nothing like the pictures and are extremely dirty. The bathrooms are tiny, old, and unclean. I tried switching rooms, and was disappointed even more! The staff was rude and unhelpful. Then when I decided to check out and go to another hotel I was told my credit card would only have a $250.00 hold on it for 48 hours. Instead the put an $840.00 hold, which was the rate as if I had stayed my whole trip plus the $250.00. It was a mess! A number of my friends at the conference were also unhappy with their rooms! If you are going to stay in downtown Forth Worth go to the Hilton or the Omni! They are both exponentially better! I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!The decor is nice, but overall I'm pretty unimpressed. I didn't have too much trouble finding the entrance but I may have just been lucky. Bedside lamp in room is broken, hook missing from the back of the door and the showerhead is mounted so low as to be comical . It's at shoulder level for me and is completely immobile, so it makes showering into an exercise in flexibility. I made mention of it at the front desk when reporting the broken items in the room and they laughed it off and said no one had ever mentioned it before (really? becuase I found mention of it on flyertalk in all of a 3-second web search). I was inquiring whether or not they had some other type of room (disabled or pre-renovation, maybe?) with a shower I could use without performing yoga moves. They were unable to assist and seemed pretty uninterested in the broken items, although the desk clerk did half-heartedly offer to send someone up to my room to fix things (at 9 p.m. on a Saturday night ) which I declined. Additionally, I had two bad food experiences in the restaurant so I won't be returning! Overcooked burger with unmelted shredded cheese once (I'd hope, for the price, I could at least get a slice of cheddar rather than weirdly unmelting, orange shredded ""cheese""), bland, unseasoned and uncreamy ""cream"" of mushroom soup another time.  Overall overpriced.  The bartender was friendly but didn't want to inquire much deeper when I replied with ""eh"" to her ""how are your tenderloin tips?"" inquiry.   For what it's worth, I'm pretty sure no one in the back has actually tasted their $18 caesar salad with aforementioned blackened (read: caked with 5 times too much blackened seasoning) tenderloin tips and stale croutons, otherwise it wouldn't be on the menu.  I'm 99% sure they're using bottled sysco ceaser salad dressing because it had no flavor at all.  Quite a juxtaposition next to the way overseasoned beef.  I'm on the 11th floor and my wi-fi is chugging away at a whopping 1 Mbps as the signal is so low. This laptop usually can find a signal through a lead wall, so I'm pretty sure there's no access point on this floor.Wow, I sound like a bi#ch. Still, unimpressive.  The rooms are spacious, bathrooms aren't, and there's a ton of children running through the hotel.  I was going to enjoy a swim before bed but the pool area was overrun with little whippersnappers and there doesn't seem to be an adult-swim hour so I took a pass.  Hopefully it quiets down a little after the weekend.I really enjoyed my stay here... I'm a little picky when it comes to hotels, and I would stay here again.Now, I was here for a work conference with a bunch of students, and I did have to walk out in the hall and hush them.  That's what you get when you're staying across from the convention center.  I chose to deal with it myself rather than report them... I remember the days when we crammed 7 people into a room, too.  It was quiet as could be afterwards :)The room was spacious and the wifi was free and functional.  The bathroom was a little on the small side, buttttttt.... SPA products!  Love me some spa products in the bathroom.The towels were reasonable.  Bed was large and had decent pillows.  The room was very clean, but the TV seemed small for the room - it was a flatscreen, but it just seemed small.I didn't use any amenities during my stay, so I can't say much about the rest of the services.  From my experience, however, I'd go back.OH - but the reservation line was horrible.  HORRIBLE.  Totally incompetent.  Just call the front desk if you have questions about your reservation.  The college kid who answered the phone there fixed my reservation issue within 2 seconds.  No one I spoke on the reservation line could figure it out.I can't comment much on the rates, because I received a conference/corporate rate when we booked.  Enjoy your stay!Not the best place I've ever stayed in.  My room was pretty nice.  The bed was comfy.  The walls are paper thin though.  I could hear my neighbors every word.  Shula's was definitely not up to standard.  Drinks are expensive compared to the bar at the much higher end Omni hotel down the street.Really nice place to stay when you're visiting Fort Worth. I'd definitely recommend it!There was some confusion about what type of room we wanted, which keeps me from giving the full 5-star treatment, but once we were checked in, there was really nothing about the hotel itself that disappointed me.Comfy beds, decent bathroom (like the other review says, low showerhead!), nice TV, great view.If you find yourself with a little downtime during whatever activity brings you to the city, be sure to walk across the street and check out the odd but interesting Fort Worth Water Gardens.  Valet service could be a bit slow, but they're very polite and seemed to simply be understaffed, especially on Sunday morning right around checkout time.I'm a flight attendant and stay here regularly.  It never fails that I am disappointed here.  I'm agree with Wendy.  Every time I'm here the maids or other staff wake me.  Here it is, 8am on a Saturday and I'm bothering to write a review on Yelp about this situation, because the maids woke me at 7:30!  EVERY TIME.  And I'm on pacific time too.  This stinks  Saturday!!!  And if it's not their knocking on every door, or crazy vacuum next door, then it's the obnoxiously loud radios!  I don't have a choice wether I stay here or not, but you do... make a better, more quiet decision.Oh and I've contacted the manager about this ongoing complaint both in writing and phone, and received no response.I spend a lot of time on the road and a lot of those nights are spent at SPG hotels. I must say, I was not pleased with my stay at this hotel. Actually, I was quite disappointed. The location is good it is fairly central. However, I expected a lot more of the experience. I attempted to order room service and could not get someone to answer the phone. When I did get to place an order it took 30minutes then I had to send it back since it tasted very unpleasant. Then there was a broken fixture in the room. Maintenance came up and look and indicated that they would be back the next day but never came back. I usually do not have high expectations for Sheratons but overall this experience was just much less than I was expecting.The room was quite nice. The bed was very comfortable. My rest, however, was interrupted by housekeeping at 8:30am. Mind you I am still on PST. Housekeeping went through the hallway knocking on doors and loudly announcing themselves. Then when they entered and left the rooms they let the doors repeatedly bang close. This went on from 8:30am thru 11:00am. Now that I am up and dressed at 12:00 it is nice a quiet. But I am up and dressed and leaving!!  Room very nice, noise not so much.needs a facelift.Worst hotel experience I've ever had!!! The only reason this hotel gets two stars and not one is because it wasn't entirely the hotel's fault. First of all, this hotel is not really within walking distance to downtown. It's a LONG walk. My biggest beef? The walls are PAPER THIN! We stayed there while a group of high schoolers were in town for a competition and got to listen to the group of teenage girls who came back to their hotel room at 3 AM...we could hear their conversation as if they were actually in our room. Called security, taken care of. Less than an hour later, the alarm clock went off next door. Did they hear it? No. Did we? Yes, for 45 minutes. The air conditioner rattled all night long, even after we turn it off. We ended up checking out at 5:30 am and driving home so we could get some sleep. At least we had that option! In short, this hotel gets a bad review because it should have more sound proofing between the rooms--it was inexcusable--and because it just wasn't that great. There are MUCH better options closer to downtown that are probably about the same rate, maybe $10 more.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-fort-worth-fort-worth-2,Hilton Fort Worth,3.5,$$$,70,"This is a classic, historic hotel in Fort Worth. Walking distance to all of downtown. Very well-kept inside. Rooms are great.Of course, this is the historic hotel where John Kennedy spent his last night. A few tasteful photographs and a memorial on the mezzanine level.The restaurant is very good. And there is a Starbucks attached to The hotel.Again, great location to downtown. Very nice hotel.Great location. Beautiful lobby area. Loved our king corner room. Bathroom is in the back round the corner. Sink and vanity are separate from the potty and shower. Beds aren't bad. Curtains completely black out the room.  Bar on the second floor is nice-comfy lounge chairs and friendly bar tender.Couple things I thought could have been improved:Shower was low pressure and sometimes it would stop completely then start back up. It was either scalding or cold.Toilet seat was very old, yellowish and the was chipping off. Needed updating.Later in the night we ordered boneless garlic parmesan wings and the anti pasto. We actually received stale chicken strips with some barely melted cheese on top--no trace of any garlic or any type of sauce. The anti pasto also unimpressive. Yes we would stay here again because of the great location---but don't try the room service.We stayed here in early December and were generally underwhelmed by the experience. I get that there is a Starbucks in the lobby, but having a carafe of coffee is not an exorbitant cost to maintain. It's a small gesture that goes a long way. And the last thing I wanted to do after my exhausting flight, drive and check-in was to then stand in line at Starbucks for a $5.00 cup of coffee. I'm also not a fan of required valet parking. I don't mind if you require it, but build this into the hotel cost. Don't charge me an extra $25.00 a day for a cost that should be free. Overall, the hotel room was nice. We had a small sitting area which was a nice addition to the space. The room smelled kind of stale like you had a moldy room or just needed some ventilation - we couldn't get rid of the stink even after 4 days. There was also a buzz in the wall that would not stop... Finally, our housekeeper left our room open one day which was a less-than-excellent surprise to return to that evening. Fortunately, all was intact but pretty concerning. Would we stay here again? Probably not. The location was nice but there were cheaper and better reviewed locations nearby. We booked late and this was our option. On the positive side: Can I get an AMEN for that excellent happy hour at Ruth's Chris?? If I could have only worn my pajamas that may have made up for the rest of the hotel's shortcomings.Only came here to check out the JFK tribute outside where he gave his final speech and the photos inside the hotel where he spent his last night. On the second floor of the hotel are a few clusters of photographs of Present John F Kennedy and first lady Jackie Kennedy from their visit to Fort Worth.  I also checked out the banquet room where JFK meet with the Chamber of Commerce for Breakfast.  There are also more photos on the hallway outside suite 1530 (the room they stayed in)The tribute outside has a bronze sculpture of President Kennedy with photographs and selected quotes from a number of JFK's historic speeches surrounding the sculpture. It looks very cool lit up at night. Very powerful and well taken care of.This road warrior is impressed with this magnificent property.One of the better hotels I have stayed in. Very elegant and functional.  Rooms are huge, updated, clean and quiet. Beds are very comfy and you are bound to get a good nites sleep.The shower is the best part of this already awesome room.  Shower packs a punch.  I was on the 12th floor and even this high up the water pressure was intense.  Just blasts away the dirt and what not from the day.  The black out curtains are great. They do a fantastic job to make sure the early summer lights don't wake you up before time.Hotel has a Starbucks right inside it, so you can get your coffee fix before you walk out the door. Hotel is also located next to all the restaurants.  If you are in Ft Worth, and need a hotel. This is the place to be.Bottom Line: A lovely historic hotel in the heart of downtown Fort Worth but that does come with a hefty price tag.I found myself at this particular Hilton due to a whirlwind out-and-back business trip.  Aside from being a famous hotel since it's where Kennedy stayed the night before he was assassinated, the building itself is stately and the staff is top notch.  Adding to the desirability of this hotel is that it is within walking distance to many restaurants, a few shops and the convention center.  The valet and check-in processes were simple and quick which I appreciated after a long day of business meetings and travel.    I also greatly appreciated the Starbucks coffee/Starlight lounge voucher I received as being one of their selected ""guests of the day"" and the enormous room they gave me for an unknown reason.   I don't know if it was just coincidence or if the front desk staff looked at me and thought I needed some special treatment but these small perks brought me some comfort on a very tough day.  Aside from being large, the room was swanky and comfortable and I found myself melting into the plush king sized bed.  The next morning I enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant with very attentive staff and then grabbed my complimentary drink from Starbucks before pushing on to a business meeting. As alluded to above, the hotel atmosphere and staff are worthy of five stars but due to a hefty price tag for Texas standards ($200 for room with tax and fees, $16 for breakfast and $26 for parking) I can't give this hotel a perfect score.  However, I would definitely consider staying here again if I traveled to Fort Worth for pleasure.Great location between the convention center and Sundance Square. Updated rooms sparkle. You can valet for $25 or street park (free on weekends)It's easy to be very happy when your not paying for it! A large and very nice lobby meant it was never crowded even though there were a lot of people here. All of us had newly remodeled rooms that were wonderful. Attending the SCMA conference, we used several of their meeting rooms, all of which were cool and well lit. The steak dinner was very good, but the finger food at the meet and greet was excellent. Three cheers for the stuffed mushrooms and the meat empanadas! They have their own restaurant, but there is a Starbucks and a Ruth Chris steakhouse connected to the lobby. Yes, this place is expensive, but a very good historic place to stay downtown. Oh, no free parking. Valet only, at $25 per night. Just tack it on to that room rate!I stayed here for a conference and I enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. There's also a ton of history in this hotel.I stayed in a double room on a higher level, thanks to my Hilton Honors. The room was pretty big and more importantly it was very clean. View wasn't anything special but I'd survive.The location is very close to the revitalized Sundance Square and a many restaurants and bars. If you're like me and had a bunch of free time, these are major pluses.If you have a chance to go to the Presidential Suite definitely do that. It is the room where JFK stayed before his assassination and its plastered with history.This is a nice hotel if you are traveling to Fort Worth.I really wish they would take pride in their parking area. It is unsafe and disgusting. Unfortunately it is the cheapest...albeit not inexpensive, covered spot near my office. The only options for going outside are to go up the ramp and risk getting run over by the valets or walk up the disgusting, eerie back stairwell.**Update, this garage is no longer the cheapest, the price increased to $135 per month.  I no longer park there, but as of June 30, 2015 the issues still existed.This Hilton has earned the distinction of being the worst that we had stayed at. The sub-par experience started at check-in. We had made a reservation for a king room. When we entered our room after we checked we were greeted by two double beds.  We went downstairs to speak to the manager on duty and he explained that they were at full capacity - and while there might have been a king room available when we made the reservation there wasn't one when we arrived, so we have no options. Classic bait and switch and the manager could care less &amp; made it clearly obvious.  So on our weekend away, my husband and I get to spend the night sleeping in separate beds. Not acceptable. The refrigerator in the room did not work.    The room smelled foul.  The coffee pod machine was dirty &amp; only had enough items for 1 cup of coffee. There was hair on the floor of the room &amp; bathroom. We will be sending a letter to hilton's corporate office &amp; to the hotel's general manager. Terribly disappointed.Great hotel with excellent service! I will stay here from now on when I go to Fort Worth--it's the best of the options on Main Street!Best Hilton in USA. JFK suite is spacious, grand, and has Kennedy pictures on nearly every wall. My wife and we're thoroughly impressed.Hi All!Been reading the past reviews &amp; are seeing there were some past issues w/ the air conditioning in the sleeping rooms.Can anyone validate if this is still an issue??Thanks All!I celebrated my birthday here and I really like this hotel. The front desk staff was so friendly and accomodating. Wine and a birthday card was delivered up to my suite. That was such a nice touch. This hotel is a historic site. It's where JFK stayed and there are photos commemorating that event throughout the hotel. We enjoyed brisket quesadillas and drinks on the second floor at the Skylight Court Bar before going out for the evening and it was very good. That brisket was so tender and flavorful and made me so happy. The following morning for breakfast we went down to Cafe Texas. There is a self serve breakfast buffet and there is also a chef there taking omellette orders which is the route we took. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. It's beautiful, a little bit dated, has a friendly staff and I'm pretty sure its haunted.This is a beautiful hotel, with lots of pictures of JFK's stay!  Although the valet ($20/ night) can get you, the rooms are comparable (and even cheaper) than many other downtown hotels!  Ruth's Chris is connected to the hotel through the lobby... they have their own wonderful bar and lounge... the waitstaff to take your bags to your room are quick, courteous and oustanding.  The rooms themselves are large, clean and immaculate""!While we are Hilton Diamond members anyway, this is one of the better hotels we have stayed at.  I normally like the Blackstone Marriott, but they just keep jacking their prices up, and offering horrible service.  Hilton Downtown had just earned our business for all of our Sundance Square stays!5 STARS!Nice but way over priced! The location of this hotel is great, lots of food and entertainment around. The staff has been really friendly and helpful. I stayed on the executive level and the a/c fan was extremely loud when it kicked on. I had to shut it off to sleep at night. They need to upgrade their mechanical.I wish I could give negative stars for this hotel! My boyfriend and I checked in on Christmas Eve 2014. That is a tough night to work &amp; my heart went out to the staff members that night. We didn't plan to be in the downtown Ft. Worth Hilton on Christmas Eve, but as our truck's belt had alternate plans (get it, ""alternate"" plans :~))  1/2 way on our trip up north, we found ourselves in need of a room while the repairs were being made. The hotel was clean. The room was way too hot! With the air temp set at 60, we sweat all night. The clerk was nice.Unfortunately, the valet (named LT) parked our car and then immediately relieved me of my $300 pair of Maui Jim sunglasses &amp; my Christmas jewelry. I've only purchased 2 pairs of nice sunglasses in my life. The 1st was beautiful pair of Ray Ban's that I left on a toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom of Barton Springs Pool in Zilker Park when I had my 3 (under 5 yr old) godchildren with me in 2002. My 2nd purchased pair was relieved of me the night I checked into this nightmare hotel. They were expensive and beautiful, but the real sadness of the valet's relief of my possessions was with my Christmas jewelry. It was plastic &amp; coated brass. Jingle bells, I've loved like no one else could! What kind of a valet steals that from a late night guest?I called the hotel manager &amp; the valet manager. No one called back.Save yourself and stay anywhere in the DFW area but here! If you HAVE TO stay here, please keep your belongings with you at all times.Overall, a pretty good experience for a downtown historic hotel.  The negative is that they do charge a fairly high premium for valet parking and there's no parking otherwise. The rooms are plenty spacious and the interior remains comfortable, yet keeps with Fort Worth's heritage and the hotel's heritage as the Hotel Texas (where JFK spent his final night.)If you're a Hilton Honors member, they do provide free wi-fi, which I wish I had known in advance.  The front desk and the concierge in particular (look for the older gentleman named Papa Mike) try their best to be helpful.If I was going to mention one other negative, it was the guy at the front desk on our last night.  I asked for a late checkout as a Hilton Honors member.  He gave me the overdone faux courtesy and offered me an additional 30 minutes to check out.   Thanks for nothing for that.We stayed here a few weeks ago for business and the CMA awards.  It's close to several good restaurants and a short walk to the convention center.  If you are looking for a modern luxury hotel this is NOT the place for you. This is a nice hotel, clean, safe, and steeped in history.  Also known as the Hotel Texas then, Kennedy stayed at this very hotel before that fateful day in 1963. This is one place to put on the to see list in Ft Worth.","I got bed bug or flee bites.  I told the front desk twice and gave them a note for the manager twice.  I was told he would call but he did not.  Then I emailed.  Over two weeks have passed with no response.  The front desk did give me a free coffee.  Little compensation from getting bitten at 2:00 AM and tossing in vermin the rest of the night.I like an older hotel with their quirks and history. And, boy, does this place have history...thanks to the JFK slept his last night here business. I stayed here for almost a week for a conference...meeting rooms were good with a variety of sizes, only issue was climate control. It seemed like it was difficult to keep individual spaces just right. Rest rooms were appropriately sized on the meeting room floors and were kept clean and supplied. My banquet lunch offered a really tasty vegetarian meal (pumpkin ravioli) and others had steak to varying degrees of satisfaction. Some thought it perfect, but my dining companion thought hers was too touch to eat. I would think steak for 100+ banquet attendees would be difficult.My room was good with a vary comfortable bed and a good view of the convention center. The blackout curtains worked very well. The bathroom was a bit tired looking. There was no vent so steam filled the room. The toiletries were good quality.I only ate lunch at the hotel restaurant once and it was acceptable. I chose not to have the breakfast buffet for $14. The hotel bar was expensive and was staffed by friendly but really basic bartenders; the liquor selection was adequate.There was a starbucks and a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse attached to the hotel. You are not allowed to wander out of the Ruth's Chris and back into the hotel with a drink, even though they are connected by a corridor. That is just silly to this NOLA girl, but the bartenders can get in trouble so don't try it.Staff was very nice and our room was cleaned promptly. The only real issue was that the front desk staff messed up our bill and it took about 30 minutes to straighten it out. Of course, he blamed the guy who checked me in. There were lots of walkable restaurants and shops nearby.The elevators in this hotel have not worked since at least Friday.  My 82 year old mother and daughter in her wedding dress both had to take stairs for several floors at times.  Internet check in did not work. Bathroom in room was old.  Toilet seat and sink were cracked. Bathtub was a very slow drain.  Upkeep seems to be terrible.  Realize this is an old historic hotel but not worth the price.Very convenient to the convention center. Parking is valet only which is annoying. But the location is great. Good walking distance to Sun dance square. The concierge  is super friendly and always helpful.I have such mixed feelings on this hotel.....Here are the pros - Super Friendly and Helpful Staff (Stand outs are Andrew in Guest Services and Papa Mike in Concierge).  The location was GREAT and only blocks from Sundance Square and a ton of nice restaurants and Bars!!  The rooms were nicely appointed (looked like they may have updated them recently) and the black out curtains were awesome.  The bathroom toiletries were ""Peter Thomas Roth"" (if you don't know that name....it is a very high end brand and expensive....so that was a nice touch).  I have seen other reviews about the valet and being slow....we did NOT experience that at all and note that you CAN call down for your car (which we only did one time and it was there when we arrived downstairs).  The valet attendants were very nice and friendly and offered help with directions each time. Cons - The AC was almost non-existent in the room where we stayed (Room 937, so avoid that room if possible).  The front desk sent an engineer on the first night to check it and he changed the filter but it did not help at all (they gave us a free Starbucks Coffee and Pastry).  We stayed in that room for 3 nights and on our last night, we complained again and they offered to move us across the hall to room 938 and it was about 10 degrees cooler (that was a great move and wish we would have moved earlier.....but it was College Game Day weekend and I think they had a full house).  The other problem with the room (937) was the hot water, which was luke warm and there were no fans in the bathrooms.  I know that this is an older hotel but as a Hilton Brand, I would think that with enough complaints, they would start renovating the AC system in the rooms (and we heard that the AC issue was an ongoing problem and that a lot of people complain). We literally had the AC cranked to 60 degrees and it never got below about 80 in our room.  It would probably save in future energy costs too if they changed them out.  We would probably stay there again for the convenience to downtown but I would definitely ask for a room with an AC that was working well or asked to be moved again if it wasn't.Pretty solid hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, unlike the valet...All of the memorabilia throughout the hotel reflecting JFK was quite interesting and pleasing. It's nice to know that a hotel can be to chic yet still stay true to its history and the tradition surrounding it. There was a gala of some sort going on at the hotel on our second night, thus when we returned in our car to the hotel we had to wait in a line wrapped around the building just to get to the valet. Consider having a second line for hotel guests?Our 2nd stay... Very pleased both times. Great views from our room. Room service was perfect! Bed was wonderful! So comfortable! On the same block as 4-5 great restaurants! Hotel service was very prompt &amp; helpful... Front desk, valet , and room service!! Only request... Is slippers for the granite bathroom..This hotel is smack dab in the middle of downtown. The staff is friendly &amp; knowledgable. They offer water in the lobby as well as complimentry water in the rooms. The rooms are spacious &amp; the bed is comfy. Not sure if they offer complimentry wifi or if it was provided due to my status. There is a Starbucks &amp; Ruth Chris attached to the hotel. In addition there are quite a few restuarants &amp; bars around the corner from the hotel. Also the JFK memorial is across the street &amp; the hotel pays omage to the late JFK w/ photos &amp; notes as it is the last hotel he stayed at. The convention center is less than 2 blocks away as well. This Hilton is in my top 5 Hilton hotels I've stayed in. Def worth the money!I love downtown Ft Worth.  Our room was nicely furnished and clean when we arrived.  Maid service however was quite lacking during our 3 day stay.  Oneday they didnt show up and another there were not enough towels etc left.  Forget abt changing bed linens.  Other little things as well with hotel staff and constant banging noise.  Dont know if they are working on the hotel but quite irritating.  Overall just not what I would expect staying at the Hilton.I stayed at the Hilton in July for a week because I was working an event at the convention center. It was a perfect location since I only had to walk 1 block. I flew in from FL so I did not have a car with me but it did not matter. Everywhere was walking distance. This hotel was great due to having Ruthe Chris attached to it!!!            There were TONS of Restaurants/ Bars/ Pubs/ and entertainment all w/in a 5 block radius! The staff was extremely nice and the hotel was super clean! I also thought it was neat regarding the historical aspect of this being the last hotel JFK stayed in.          I highly recommend this place if you want a nice relaxing comfortable stay whether its business or pleasure!Room was nice. Air refused to cool room below 73. 25.00 to park your car when you paid 279 for the night is just ridiculous !! First and last tiTreated first class on our stay even though we were getting a discounted rate for a conference. Room was incredibly spacious with a very comfortable bed. Bartender was awesome. $25 for valet parking... You can park nearby cheaper, but I decided it was worth it for the convenience. We walked everywhere. Great visit to Fort Worth. Will stay here again.I stayed here on business over the last week and I'll be checking back in next week. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms are huge (&amp; I've been promised the same room next week) with comfortable beds and the housekeeping is brilliant. The bar is fabulous. Papa Mike the concierge is extremely helpful and has great. Gym is a downstairs in the basement but is large and had all the necessities. We had an event at the hotel and the events team couldn't do enough to help us out and the catering was great - everybody commented on how great it was!  Can't wait to stay here again.I was giving 5 stars but I have 2 points I didn't like Small area where valet take your car And customers sometime have problems with the cars ALSO $20 for the valet par night ??!!! Realy ? That mean 5 night = $100 for valet ? Naaaa  ALSO one hotel like that doesn't put a small bottle of water like welcome is very shame. - Room service lunch Was good but I didn't understand why my yogurt was already open ;) About the rest was perfect Scenario - restaurant - room - bathroom !all good . 90% good dealPros:Convenient locationBeautiful lobbyClean roomsGood breakfast buffetPeter Thomas Roth toiletries!Fast valet parking serviceCons:No fluffy robe in my bathroom and no complimentary breakfast which is a shame for how much I was paying per nightNo poolYou must park valet at about $25/nightService at the hotel restaurant was slow and a little sloppyNo refrigeratorA/C sounded like and felt like it was struggling to work.Overall, a good solid 3 stars.This hotel is nice but not close to luxurious.  It is really worn down in many places, from room doors that no longer fit to paint/drywall repairs that were done haphazardly.  The windows in our room were from 75 years ago: the single panes let in a tremendous amount of cold weather, buckets of condensation covered up the pathetic view, and they also let in too much noise for my tastes.  The staff are very nice as you would expect from the Hilton brand. Dinner at the hotel's Ruth's Chris steakhouse was the highlight of our stay, great food from beginning crab cake to ending cheesecake with salad and steak in middle.  The king size bed was comfy, and the room was spacious, although the bathroom was very cramped.  Sheets, towels and pillow were all nice and comfy.  Overall a very good hotel, but with the omni down street offering true luxury for similar rates, I doubt we will be back anytime soon.I gave up on Hilton Hotels many years ago. Fort Worth Hilton, you are a game-changer! I booked FWH so I could walk from the Amtrak Station - in 102F heat - but I'm Canadian and liking feeling  warm! As I stagger into the main lobby - cool, polished granite floors and calm, welcoming front desk staffers make the check in totally painless. But what are these lobby shrines to JFK? A bit spooky, as two days previous I had visited the JFK memorials in Dallas, and felt a chill, even though the morning heat was blasting us. Here I am, in the historic Hotel Texas - has the heat affected me? OMG - a punch of history! Other yelpers remark that this is the hotel where JFK spent his last night before the motorcade headed to Dallas, but how many have visited the Dallas site then ended up here in a very short time frame?Back to the present-day Hilton! The concierge was terrific; as the train was late getting into FW from San Antonio and that cut into my sightseeing time - a map was produced, along with walking instructions, so I could see my top picks before the attractions shuttered for the night. He secured my dinner reservation, and off I went to enjoy Sundance Square, along with some delicious ice cream.The room itself was large,elegant and quiet, facing the convention centre, and Texas stretched out for as far as the  eye could see! High level of cleanliness, lots of fresh, sweet-smelling towels, and Roth amenities (really, the best!) made this a great stay. Early morning breakfast at the lobby cafe. OMG! Mountains of bacon, mountains of strawberries, all exquisitely fresh. I opted for a bowl of oatmeal, and the server  returned to the table with an enormous bowl the size of a Texas stetson - and with a big smile, said, ""Mam, you know what they say, in Texas everything is bigger!"" Oatmeal topped with pecans, now that is a Texas breakfast. Very good coffee, the Wall Street Journal, and pleasant ambience.Nice!Formerly the Hotel Texas where President Kennedy spent his last night, there's quite a few photographs and placards reminding its guests of this fact. I thought it was interesting to see the old photos of the Hotel Texas with JFK, Jackie and LBJ exiting the hotel. You can still espy the ironwork on the building that held up the Hotel Texas sign. My stay at the Hilton was enjoyable. Service was impeccable. Both concierges were incredibly helpful. ""Papa"" Mike, who bills himself as a ""Journey Ambassador"", was especially helpful procuring taxis and maps. There's free Wi-Fi in the main areas of the hotel and in the Starbucks connected to the hotel. Despite an earlier review about being charged for Wi-Fi in the room, that was free as well. The rooms are incredibly spacious, with 42"" plasma TV, a desk with dial up internet access, WiFi, a King Size bed, a big couch for chillaxing, and a huge bathroom. I was super impressed, especially since this is an older hotel, that usually spells ""bed in a box""!The bar area was nice and open and actually had a good beer and wine selection. The Starbucks blends well with the hotel, but seemed to take a long time with orders both mornings I stopped in. At the hotel Mrs. Texas pageant finalists were parading around (with dutiful husbands in tow) vying for the crown. We missed the swimsuit parade, and I'm sad to report that the hair wasn't nearly as big as one would think, (clap-clap-clap-clap) deep in the heart of (Mrs.) Texas! But it was still entertaining to have around.A super convenient and safe location in Ft. Worth for your next stay ""Where the West Begins""!Smoking room posing as a non-smoking room = Meh. I've experienced better.I wanted to enjoy this hotel.  Especially given the history of being the hotel that JFK stayed in the night before his assassination.  Unfortunately the hotel has a dated feel to it once you move into the floors with the rooms and a strong chemical cleaning agent smell in the hallways.  I was hoping that this smell would only be present in the hallways, but upon entering the room, the chemical fumes were overwhelming and then beneath that was a strong cigarette smoke smell.  I went back down to the front desk and asked to switch rooms, but they claimed that they had no other rooms.  They did admit that the room was a former smoking room converted to non-smoking.  But clearly cigarette smoke isn't easy to get out.  So in the end I suffered through a night in the room and woke up the next morning with a scratchy throat.  I won't be back here again if I can help it.Went to Fort Worth for anniversary getaway and stayed here. Got a good deal on Priceline. Wife and I were impressed with the great service provided by both the front desk and also journey ambassador Mike. Our king bedroom was very spacious but I would agree with prior review that the bathroom is a little small.  While valet parking is $22, the location is easily within walking distance to various attractions and dining places. Saves the hassle of downtown parking. Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay here again.","Ol' Rooster picked well on our weekend visit to Fort Worth. A couple of blocks away from the Amtrak station if your so inclined to rail travel; this property wowed on all aspects and gave me a history lesson in the process. I obviously don't remember JFK but my mom recalls a unique perspective. In 1963 the President stayed here the night before his untimely death. He left what was the Hotel Texas on his final ride in a motorcade. My mom who was in middle school had time off for an upcoming visit later that afternoon in Austin. It never happened. The Hilton portrays this in memories all over the grounds and inside. A snapshot in time when circumstances became complicated for all Americans. I found Hilton's tribute to be tasteful while showing a snapshot of that terrible day. With that said on to less important findings. Out in the country I'm not used to such pampering so this is a well deserved rating. The Starbucks in the lobby became a nice spot to wake up and cruise down for some morning joe. Add in that it was graduation weekend and some loud guests two doors down were handily dealt with with the threat of expulsion without a refund. All devised by a mom with twelve girls singing to Livin' on a Prayer that she couldn't handle. Bon Jovi blaring during graduating class of 2011? Thought that would have been 198X, but I digress. The room on the 11th floor was clean and comfortable. LIGHTNING FAST elevators from a different time. Then, my biggest reason for the five star rating. Enter Michael ""Pappa Mike"" Goldberg who was our Journey Ambassador for our stay. The former title being concierge and Pappa Mike guided us and called ahead for some special treatment. Champagne followed all our meals thanks to him knowing this was our 4th anniversary. It was the ultimate touch in making this a memorable weekend. He added to his clout by extending our stay so we didn't have to check out early and drag our bags around before we boarded the train to come home. This Hilton was in a class all its own thanks to the staff and the accommodations. When it comes to staying in Fort Worth, I wouldn't dare choose another destination.Best lobby, restaurant, bar and lounge area in a downtown Fort Worth hotel. Beautiful exterior. A Ruth Chris Steakhouse and a mini Starbucks is attached. Located a block or two from all the best bars and restaurants downtown. Lots of rich history, and it is truly an American landmark. This Hilton beats the Embassy Suites and Sheraton by far. Only major downside was the room service. I splurged and ordered a 14 dollar pizza, which on the menu stated that it was a fresh, hand-tossed pizza. It was a frozen pizza, probably a DiGorno and I'm not lying. I was so irritated. Took 45 minutes to arrive. For the room, the mattress wasn't as nice as I hoped, but free WiFi is available, which is a rarity for a hotel these days. Nice view, lots of good cable channels and shower had good water pressure. The only parking option is the 22 valet, I wasn't too happy about that, but the service was quick and prompt. The hotel manager on duty the evening of December 7th was extremely helpful and gracious when I asked for walking directions to a nearby country club. He walked us to the street corner and gave us specific directions and we appreciated that. Thank you!!Ft. Worth Hilton rejuvenated my belief in the Hilton brand! They offered great customer service, from check-in to room service, I felt like an appreciated guest. The room I had was quiet, on-the-end, and spacious. Housekeeping did a great job keeping it clean as well. There's a coffee maker in the room, but no mini-fridge (which I like when I travel). On the first floor, there is a Starbucks (which if you want good customer service, look elsewhere...they were all grumpy) and their restaurant. Their restaurant was just okay and they preferred you to eat their buffet than order off their menu. Their bar is on the second floor. Aside from their food and drink options, the rest of the hotel met my expectations and provided a great place to stay!There is free WiFi for any Hilton Honors Members, but you don't get the complimentary breakfast unless you are a certain level member. Thanks for the free WiFi!!It's in a great location Downtown...We had a horrible experience the past few days. I will say the hotel was very clean but severely lacked in customer service! Even after they ask how our stay was when we check out, we told them a few things that made our experience not great ... They simply said have a great day! We were woken up every day promptly by construction at 8am but was never told there was construction happening when booking this hotel for a wedding party. The air conditions did not work well and when checking out the valet took 30 mins to find our vehicle after blaming us for not having our ticket that we had given them already then blaming us for not memorizing the number on that tag... Needless to say we will never stay here again and missed our flights.Overall the hotel is in a great location (close to train, restaurants, convention centre), was clean/tidy and the WIFI worked without issue. With the exception of a pool/whirlpool and a larger fitness facility I think this is everything you could ask for in a 4* Hilton property.A short walk from the Amtrak station lies the Hilton Fort Worth, the hotel JFK stayed at before he was assassinated. It seemed to take less than 5 minutes to walk to from the train station (Amtrak and TRE), which has a really cheap and convenient train service that runs to Dallas on the TRE ($5 one way to Dallas). The TRE was very spacious and reminiscent of the double-decker European trains in terms of having room for luggage, being fairly quiet, etc..Your first step inside the Hilton is greeted with a beautiful stone lobby, high ceilings, and a smiling individual who is the ""ambassador"" on duty. We had the pleasure dealing with ""Papa Mike"" who handed out his cell phone number and said to call us anytime, and he stressed anytime. There is an onsite ""pantry"" to get snacks/drinks from as there does not appear to be convenience stores close by. Our room wasn't quite ready (check-in was 3pm) but without any prompting the clerk gave us some vouchers to use at the onsite Starbucks or at the bar for free drinks while we wait. Definitely great service when you don't have to ask, these are the little things that should be done.As we were Hilton HHonours members we were given free internet (not sure if it's for everyone?) and our room was very spacious. It was a corner room and had a lot of natural light through the windows and all the space you could want. It was clean and tidy with no issues.The fitness facilities were just OK, they are tucked away in the basement and not very large. The equipment they have is in good repair with the usual TV monitors/headphones and such on the cardio and a very small selection of weighted equipment.The hotel is an easy walking distance to many of the restaurants. The Flying Saucer had a very, very large beer selection for those so inclined and there were restaurants that suited all your desires from casual to upscale. Jake's (two blocks away) was open for breakfast and had a good basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, pankcakes, etc) at a great price (under $10/person). Definitely worth checking out if you're in a rush as it is not busy and the basic breakfast food is as good as anywhere else.If you attempt to walk to the stockyards be prepared for a creative journey, it seems that partway there is no sidewalk and you end up walking through holes in chainlink fence under a bridge. We did not encounter any problems but from the beer bottles and such underneath it may not be something to try if you are alone at night or when it is late. Definitely worth a visit to the stockyards though!The hotel is great, good staff, nice rooms, good location BUTTHE VALET IS HORRIBLE AND I WON'T STAY HERE AGAIN BECAUSE OF IT!  Took almost 30 minutes to get the car, almost missed a wedding!  When checking out, took 20 minutes to get the car and the staff refused to refund the $22 for horrible service.  Best yet, the valet guy was made that I didn't tip him for under performing....ruined my experience....but don't worry, I paid $22 for it!We are holding a cash flow conference in the hilton ballroom and we found that the staff was very helpful in setting up the room and acquiring the needed materials in order to hold the conference.  Overall it's been a good experience, no complaints with it. The wifi is wide open so that has helped us out a lot.I will not return to this hotel.  The rooms are spacious and the amenities are better than average, but my experience was tainted by the mess at valet.  The hotel does not have its own self-parking lot.  Thus, be sure to plan ahead for the $22/day valet fee, plus the obligatory tip.  I have stayed in big city hotels in Chicago, Philly and San Francisco whom charge similar amounts, but their service is astonishing fast and professional.  The Hilton Ft. Worth offers valet personnel that are slow, seemingly lazy, and not solution-oriented.  If you are greeted at valet with a female employee, she does run, hustle and helps  I wish I got her name to share with the hotel, as she did stand-out.  The rest of the staff, from my experience this past weekend, should find new employment.  In conclusion, it took 20-25 minutes to retrieve my car each time when departing.  I also witnessed people waiting 20+ minutes to simply drop off their car.  I have additionally complained to the hotel management about this problem and before you stay in this hotel, I recommend calling them and aksing if they have corrected the overly expensive and extremely slow valet situation.I've never been to Ft. Worth, so I was excited when my boss asked if I'd want to come here for a workshop.  I was excited to see that we were being put up in The Hilton.  I was excited to see that this was the same hotel that JFK spent his final night.  I was excited to see that we each had our own room.  I was excited to see the huge, suite-like room (king size bed, 42"" Plasma TV with HD channels, a desk, and a couch for entertaining) that was just for me.  I was not, however, excited to see that they charge for internet service... that isn't even wireless.  It's $9.95 a day.  Every single hotel here in Austin has free wireless service... even the crappy ones.  I had to get an ethernet cable before I could even attempt to get online, only to be shut down by the fee.  Ugh.This hotel is in a great location.  It's walking distance to a lot of downtown Ft. Worth, including lots of fabulous bars and restaurants.  The staff was friendly, for the most part, especially the concierge guy, who was just a little bit over the top, actually.  Since I thought I'd have a roommate, I neglected to bring toothpaste, so I had to ask at the desk.  They had none, but the concierge had a single tube... just for me.  They also had a little shop for purchasing such items, but the prices were outrageous!Very annoyed by the internet thing, but I think I'd stay here again.  I'd just take my laptop to a bar or something.lovely rooms. valet is expensive. no vents in bathroom. no pool. like the convenience store.Hotel was decent.  The size of the room was quite large.  However the particular room I had, the toilet/bathroom was very tight.  The door swong into the bathroom just clearing the toilet by 1 inch.  LITERALLY!It was an unusually tight bathroom for a hotel room, with so much additional space within the room.  It just made no sense.Additionally, they only provided free internet to certain hotel members (those that were in the hilton honors club) which I thought was strange, and then had to call regularly to the front desk to obtain the password.  I've stayed at other hotels, and seemingly their WiFi was free and not with any hoops that had to be tackled.The hotel is known for being the last hotel JFK stayed at before being assassinated.  That was kind of cool, but for what the did not offer (not even a continental breakfast...I may not stay here again.Best place we have stayed in awhile. I locked the safe by mistake and they were there in minutes to unlock it. The executive lounge for Hilton Honors members was great. We will definitely stay here again!Last minute reservations made in a good location.  The staff was always pleasant and always helpful.  There is no self-park at this location, just take all of your valuables with you and get used to the valet scenario if you are going to be staying in Fort Worth. The aspects that made this more than just an average room were the Starbucks in the first floor off the lobby and the close proximity to the Convention Center.  Nothing special about the room.I had to organize a workshop nearby for 80 people, and I used the Fort Worth Hilton as the workshop hotel.  I organized the block rate through them and had an evening reception in part of the space near their 2nd floor bar area.  The sales and group bookings staff was really great to work with and responded to all of my inquiries and requests very quickly. I received positive feedback from the workshop participants about the quality and location of the hotel.Ok.  I thought this hotel was great.  I pricelined it...so I probably paid less than the norm, but I was really happy.  The room was clean and large.  All the workers was extremely friendly and helpful.  The bed was comfortable and I thought the room was reasonably nice for the price.When we got to the room, we learned it was a single and we needed a double.  They immediately sent two aero beds up.  One had a hole in it and we didn't realize it until late, but I'm sure that we could've called about that too.  i had some questions about my bill later, but they cleared it all up immediately with no complaining needed.  The location is also within walking distance of many great places.    I'd definitely tell people to stay here when they came to visit.The only thing I thought was ridiculous was the price of the valet, but that's pretty standard for hotels.  It's just Fort Worth parking is so cheap.  And there was water and coffee...but no fridge.  Fridges seem standard for a room like this anymore.First, the good news. The hotel is a great historic building. JFK stayed here the last night he was alive and is honored by a cardboard cut out and cool photos scattered throughout the hotel. I had a small issue with my booking that couldn't be resolved by at least three people I spoke with. They like to settle small issue by just saying ""no"" or saying the issue is fixed, then not doing a thing about it. To be fair, after I contacted the hotel manager, I was refunded the full price of my room, but this could have been taken care of with one phone call. I didn't want a free room, I wanted a great stay at a great hotel.One of the issues with this hotel is the relatively young staff. Historic hotels usually have older, experienced people working there. I did not see this here. As an example, at check in, the young lady said, ""You are going to love your room! It looks out on all the city lights and it is just beautiful!"" Then she said, ""Uh, that is not your room, your room has a view of... actually, it doesn't have a view"". Thanks a lot! Nice to know in our price catagory great rooms are available, but we didn't get one.The other issues are noise and security. The escalators up to the rooms are placed so that it is possible for someone to walk in and not be seen by the front desk. I don't know how the group of 8-10 very drunk people got past the front desk and into our hallway at 2:30 AM. The were partying loudly in the room next door until we called security. Seriously, they sounded like a parade coming into their room. After they FINALLY left, the couple that stayed started loudly fighting over the TV chanel selection. We called security again. We finally got to sleep at around 4:30 in the morning. The least thing a nice hotel should do is provide you with a peaceful, safe night's sleep.It is sad to see the decline of such a grand old hotel. I hope the Hilton Corporation puts a better management team in here so it can truly live up to it's potential. I wish I would have stayed at one of the much cheaper hotels in the area.I booked a room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> in July.  Reservation was for September 27th.  They accepted my bid without issue and I paid in full up front.  The day before I was due to check in I called to make sure everything was set (since there was a TCU game and I knew space was tight).  I was told when I called that they had overbooked (?) and had moved me to another, lesser quality, hotel.  No phone call from them or heads up.  The person at the Hilton Hotel that was on the phone with me did not seem to care.  I would have driven five hours to town only to have been turned away and shuffled somewhere else late at night.  It puts a bad taste in my mouth that the Hilton is so greedy that they would ""rid themselves"" of third party bookings so they could accept last minute, overpriced bookings.  I won't be giving the Hilton my business in the future.Whenever I'm in Ft Worth for business, I typically stay here.  Rooms are decently priced.  There are 2 towers, from my experience, the rooms in the main tower are much nicer than rooms in the 2nd tower.Wifi is usually dependable, but one of my last times I was there and stayed in the 2nd tower, they didn't have wifi there, which kind of ruined my trip as I had lots to catch up when I got home as I couldn't work at the hotel.  Their workout facility is in the downstairs area and is well stocked with machines.  Each of the cardio machines has its own TV which is always great.Location - great location downtown.  Ruth's Chris is connected to the hotel and Del Frisco's is right across the street.  Both get a thumbs up for me.Last time I was there they asked me if I was a Hilton Honors member, I said No, but that I might sign up when I checked out.  So they upgraded me to a room on the Honors floor free of charge.  The room was NICE.  It had a 36-40"" flat screen TV, a really nice bathroom with nice tile and marble countertop.  Nice bed with very soft linens.  AND you get access to the Honors lounge where they have a TV and a nice sitting area, and in the mornings there's free breakfast &amp; coffee.Dislikes - They have underground parking across the street where you used to be able to park your own car and pay when you were done.  But now parking is valet only, which stinks because their valet service is SO SLOW.  Even if we leave at 7am and there is no line, their valet always takes at least 10 minutes, and the parking garage is right across the street.Well, they actually followed through and ended up refunding one night's stay.  Quite a shock really.  I'm glad they followed through with what they said they were going to do and made it right.  I'll still avoid staying at this hotel again, but at least they've earned an extra star from me.I just spent five nights here and I have to say it's a pretty good hotel.Pros:- Great location, right in downtown Ft. Worth- Nice lobby- Friendly staff- Great gym downstairs (if you can find it)- Excellent complimentary stuff for Hilton Honors folks including breakfast and happy hourCons:- Valet parking is the only option and it costs $20 a day.  Even if you're here on the company's dime, I think this is a rip off.- Rooms are a little datedAll in all, this is a solid hotel.  Check out the restaurant Grace next door for some great food and drinks.","Only spent a night here last week, but had a great stay. It is quiet, cold, dark and has a mega comfortable bed. Can't complain about those...The breakfast buffet is decent. I'd prefer full sit down with waiters, but hotels don't usually do those things.Lots of history, great location, great prices. Good stuff.My experience here was okay. The room itself was decent. There were a few things that maybe they should look into fixing. Starting with the AC, sleeping through the night was uncomfortably hot. We had it set at a certain temperature and it would never reach that. Also, the bathroom doesn't have any vents. So when we showered it got so hot! The tv wasnt working properly as well and we had to call someone to come up to fix it. Good thing was that they did act on it fast. Lastly, as we're gathering our things together to check out, one of the employees knocks on our door asking us very rudely if we were leaving, we told her yes and asked if check out was was noon since it was 11 and she agreed but said we needed to hurry. Not sure what the point of that rudeness was about. So besides those things, they had comfy beds, most bars were walking distance and that was a huge convenience. So overall, it was all alright.Great service. Great staff, great room, great food, and a good price.Stayed here during the Super Bowl, service was attentive and friendly.  Rooms are a bit dated and not what I thought of as a ""Hilton.""  The only real downside are the hours of the restaurants.  The hotel restaurant I never saw open at all, maybe I just didn't notice it and Ruth Chris always seemed to be closed or only seriving drinks.  Good location if you're in Ft. Worth!!  I'd stay again, just plan accordingly for dining options.Very mixed revue on this one, but I actually had a very positive experience.I stayed at the Hilton for a conference and everything went fairly well!The people at the front desk got whatever we needed quickly, we were given a map and directions from another employee, and it was in a very convenient location. Everything was within walking distance! My room was very comfortable. King size bed, large TV, and decently sized bathroom. I have to say, I loved the housekeeping team. Every morning my bed was fixed, the place was tidied up, and I had more coffee packets, creamers and sugars. That may not seem like a big deal to most people, but it's a nice feeling not to have to call down to the front desk for a single packet of sugar. Oddly enough, I think the best part was the staff. As soon as we arrived we had someone help us up to our room, and the moment we left we were able to quickly have someone help us down with our bags. The banquet staff wasn't quite as friendly, but they did their job efficiently, so I can only be so upset.The worst part, for me, was the wifi. There is free wifi for the 1st and 2nd floor, but any higher than that, it becomes and issue. An issue that you may have to pay to have.I would probably stay here again.This place is an historical landmark because it's the old Hotel Texas.  Having wasted 4 years of my life on a degree in Politics, I understood the significance of this fact.  Those who aren't as deranged as I am would immediately notice it right away from all of the pictures, letters, and other singage letting you know that:""The hotel Texas is where President John F. Kennedy and the First Lady Stayed on November 21st 1963.  The next morning after a speech in front of the hotel and in the hotel ballroom, the President's motorcade departed, taking with it the final moments of a more innocent America.""Seriously, that message is EVERYWHERE in the hotel, and that's why it gets 4 stars instead of 3, for the unintentional hilarity of it. When I came to check in though, I was early and they could not find me a room.  Also, the elevators would skip floors, leaving some people standing in front of banks of elevators for ages waiting for one to decide to stop there.    Some fo the staff wasn't the friendliest I've ever come across.  Especially while I was waiting for my room.  Positives though, it''s very centrally located in downtown Forth Worth.  It was also well fancy to look at--totally worthy of a place that the greatest American President last boinked his wife.  The food for banquet I attended was the best hotel banquet food I've ever had. Making the experience (besides the morbid dead President stuff) is Michael the concierge who is just a trip--full of hilarious Texas charm and energy.We stayed for two nights for a relatives wedding in Fort Worth. Our room was nice, beds comfortable and above average and clean bathroom. Valet and desk staff very friendly. Quick service from valet as well, although it is expensive at $18/day! Main complaint is the 2nd night of our stay I got very little sleep due to a very obnoxious noise from our air conditioner, which we alerted staff to earlier in the day, but apparently was never resolved even though they said they would send a technician up to fix it. It was so late and I was so tired after the wedding when we got back to our room I didn't have the energy to complain about it..but ended up getting so fed up with the noise, I just shut it off and dealt with a warm room. I would probably look at other options, such as the Omni if I stay in FW again, but I can't say it was ""bad"".On a random trip to check out Fort Worth, we picked this hotel instead of driving back to a Dallas hotel. Reviews were very mixed at Trip Advisor but as a Hilton Diamond, they treated us right. We had a wonderful corner room on the 15th executive floor. With a room on the top floor, we had a crazy high ceiling. The room was also appointed with a big plasma tv (but no HD channels).Chrissy's review is funny - but across from our room was suite 1530, the JFK suite. Looking at the floor room map on our door, that is one big suite. Lots of JFK and Jackie photographs right outside our room and outside 1530.The valet parking is a bit annoying but not anywhere as annoying as the elevators set to announce every floor. At first I thought the Garmin GPS I had in my bag was announcing the floors. I guess this is a good thing for blind people - if that is the reason, then great idea.The executive lounge was ok - it was massive and on a Sunday morning every table had a copy of the local Sunday newspaper. The only local food flourish were some mediocre breakfast burritos.After the valets stole my rental car to take someone to Whataburger at 4 am, I decided I didn't really like staying there.(4/26/10)   The manager had promised me a free stay if I would give them another chance, so december of 2010 I was going to visit family and decided to take them  up on the offer of a free stay.  The manager who offered it to me didn't work there any longer and no one seemed to remember until I got in touch with one manager named Terry.  She remembered the incident of the Whataburger bags in my car and a receipt as I was leaving the hotel to go to a friend's wedding.  She said to call her with definite dates and she would take care of it.  Called back the next Monday and she was on vacation.  They finally booked my stay and then wanted to charge me when I checked in. Needless to say, I was not happy at all and was quite vocal about it.  If you offer to make it up to me for stealing my vehicle, please be competent enough to communicate and make the apology happen......I have told everyone who visits not to stay there.My initial plans fell through, and I ended up at the Hilton Fort Worth at 6:30am on the day of check-in. Knowing that check-in wasn't until 3pm, I left my name and number with the front desk and asked that they contact me in case I was able to check-in earlier. I waited and waited, but it seemed that hope was lost and I would have to wait until later to be admitted to my room. I had fallen asleep on the lobby couch for 4 hours when I was gently awakened by a few of the management staff. I explained my situation to them and they told me to wait a few minutes longer until they wrangled up a room for me (obviously having someone passed out on the lobby couch wasn't the best look for them). Within 10 minutes, I was upgraded to an executive king room and able to check-in by 11am. All the staff, from the valet attendants, to the front desk hosts, to the management was very hospitable. I truly enjoyed my stay and would definitely come recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Fort Worth area.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-worthington-renaissance-fort-worth-hotel-fort-worth,The Worthington Renaissance Fort Worth Hotel,3.5,$$$,107,"Truthfully, I'd give this hotel four stars, not five, but I'm throwing in an extra star for the check-in experience and for Pam, who brought the room service and who was positively charming. I also feel a few of the negative reviews are a little harsh.The hotel is beautiful and it offers great views of downtown at a reasonable price. I found the room very well furnished and spacious. As silly as this is, I especially like that the room had a digital thermostat. I've been in high-class places that still only have you adjust a dial on a window heating/AC unit. Just a nice touch.The mezzanine is huge, and pretty, and I again like all the views of Fort Worth that you can get from any floor.So this is without a doubt the nicest hotel I've ever stayed it factoring in the price (~$150/night) [excluding Vegas]. I'll go ahead an say it, things are definitely bigger in Texas. Saying that our room was spacious wouldn't do it justice. It was huge [that's what she said]. Super high ceilings and nearly floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of Fort Worth all lit up at night.  Beds are super comfy and the water pressure in the shower was bananas. loves. The fitness center is impressive and the pool, while small, is a nice touch. They also brew startbucks in their little coffee shop which is great. The hotel itself is in a nice little square with lots of shops and restaurants that are easily accessible by foot. Beds were mega comfy!Cons--no ventilation in the bathroom; our toilet handle needed to be jiggled to keep it from running; crappy satellite service in the rooms; tons of leaks in the hallway during a rain storm.Stayed here for work. This is a very nice hotel. The location is great, right next to sundance square. Rooms are big enough, nothing special. If you have status you can access the lounge which has great breakfast options. Unfortunately, Marriott thinks it's a good idea to have mini bottles of water instead of regular size. This is annoying because you have to take 3 of them to = a regular bottle. Way to be eco friendly Marriott! Hotel parking is painful. I prefer to park on the street (free 6pm-8am) in front of hotel. It's a lot quicker than waiting for them to get your car... And a lot quicker than the self parking garage that's a few blocks away from the hotel.Overall this hotel is better than my local spg hotel, but it's also a lot more expensive so I don't stay here much.Love this venue. The staff is nice and the room can be transformed with he right sound and lighting. We have a lot of fun proving sound, FJ and Lighting here.I stayed here for a week for a work conference loved everything about the hotel. It was cold outside so in the morning they had hotApple cider for you to take on the go. Great room service and nice accommodating staff.we were so lucky that our conference was booked in this beautiful hotel!! unfortunately the pool is indoors but it's in downtown fortworth so it's understandable.They also offer a gym, tennis court, basketball court, starbucks, and gift shopLOVE that they always had flavored fruit water in the lobby during the day &amp; snacks/chocolate before dinner in the lobby as wellall the food we had catered for our breakfast &amp; lunch meetings was pretty good!beds were SUPER comfortable, like sleeping on a cloudONE downfall was that our maid would come around 7 pm everyday when we were getting ready to go out instead of in the morning, so we never got our room cleanedDon't stay here if you like sleep. Paper thin walls. Street noise is bad. Hallway noise is worse. Just awful. Writing this review from the hotel after being awoken for the 50th time from drunks in the hallway coming home. It's like they are standing next to you shouting in your ear. Terrible.This is what happens when a fantastic hotel gets too full of itself... what should have been 5 STARS, ends up with only 2.  Things go wrong and we get it. How you respond is the experience I remember.  And I remember 2 STARS. (The lady at the front desk earned a bonus star). First, skip the $45.00/ night parking fee.  There's a free garage all weekend (after 5pm Friday) one block away.  My group (around 30 people, 8 cars) never waited for a car less than 30 minutes.  If you use the valet, you better call early... and still be prepared to be late.  No extra charge for being rude to you, but you are still expected to tip.I particularly liked being put on hold for 15 minutes when I called down from my room to talk to the front desk!As a guest of the hotel, multiple year Marriott Platinum Elite with over 1M points, I have seen a few Marriott's.  This one let me down.  I booked myself, my fiancee', my entire family (arriving from different states), her entire family here because we LOVE Marriott.  However, after the way we were treated I won't be staying here again.We were invited to complete a survey about our experience. After which we received an email from the director.   While he apologized for our experience, there was no atonement.  Even the most basic Courtyard will throw 10,000 points for a bad cup of soup or a burger.  I expect far more from Flagship Marriott experience.I booked here for my wedding expecting a 4-5 Star Stay.  I left saddened and disappointed!Mixed emotions like many who left reviews before mine.  I wish I would have read them before staying at this hotel one night last weekend.  The staff were all very friendly, but the noise level from the 4 elevators kept us awake all night.  We had planned on staying an extra night so we could spend more time in the area but decided to go home for a much-needed nap!  Thank goodness we live in the metroplex.You can't beat the location here. The rooms are spacious, tidy, a little fusty, but I actually like that with a Renaissance, which are known for their historic character.We had a charming view of downtown. You can also easily reach any of the area's famous BBQ joints (definitely check out Angelo's), Billy Bob's honky tonk (the largest in the world) and the cattle drive stockyard. The staff were wonderful here, too, and we had an excellent, comfortable stay. I would easily recommend this hotel or stay there again even without my pet.My favorite downtown hotel by far- I would take the Worthington over Omni any day!I few years ago I attended a conference at this hotel- all the service was impeccable. When you have 800 people in your facility and you can flawlessly coordinate breaks, snacks and rearrangimg rooms for three days straight without any obvious mishaps, its pretty impressive. I didn't get to stay in a room that time- but I was pleased none the less. The most recent experience was for an Elite event- again the organization and efficiency of the staff was  next to none. I did get to actually stay this time and I'm confident in saying that if I need a room downtown it will be here.I pulled up feeling lovely- got off work early to party like a boss with the yelp crew- and the Valets pranced up to the car and helped me out with some old school manners- grabbed my hand and held the door. I walked in and was cheerfully greeted by a peppy young blond who promptly checked me in and reminded me I requested extra pillows and a high floor. The room was phenomenal- I walked in, cranked the AC as cold as it would go- did my signature flying a squirrel move onto the bed that already had my extra pillows on it and rolled around. The bed was that perfect median between plush amd firm and the sheets smelled like they were line dried.The room itself was spacious and they use Aveda products- my favorite. The view was amazing. I had a downtown view- the windows spans the length of the room and I was right in front of Reata.  I would highly recommend staying here!What makes this place stand out is the excellent customer service. Everyone really wanted to be there to help you out. Felt extremely welcoming and friendly.Location- pretty good - close to sunrise square and restaurants Accommodation - felt it was pretty dated but clean and as expected- nothing fancyRooms are pretty big with big windowsRestaurant in the building - picked up lunch once- average food and looked minimalistic.If my room service gets food from that kitchen, I'd rather just step out and pick up food from elsewhere.If you make a reservation months in advance, double-triple check your booking, and provide your confirmation number upon arrival, there are still NO promises of getting your room. Why did we double-triple check these reservations months in advance? The rooms were for an entire wedding party to stay the night and get ready before the big day. Their excuse? The reservations were canceled online.. Right!!Did I mention it is a holiday weekend, pouring rain outside, and after 10 pm?Accommodations? A managers card. This hotel does not honor it's own reservations. Do not expect promises to be upheld here.This is a fantastic hotel in a prime location in Downtown Fort Worth. Probably the best location you could ask for! It gives you direct walking access to so many fab places, namely the new square and all the sweet restaurants that border it, like Bird Cafe and Del Frisco's! The Worthington Renaissance gets extra points for being in the best spot ever, but the venue itself is fantastic on it's own. Like... You should go hang out there whether or not you're spending the night! They've got a really nice floating bar on the second floor with some creative cocktail specials, not just your run of the mill wells. Plus, it's a cozy and dimly lit atmosphere that makes you feel all swanky and classy. Pretty good prices for a bar within a nice hotel as well.My room was spacious, sparkling clean, and very comfortable. I like my hotel rooms freezing cold, and I love when the air conditioner works well and fast! I bumped the air to 65 and was happy happy happy when the temperature dropped quickly. Luckily, I had a beautiful view of downtown through the giant wall-to-wall windows in my room. You should definitely request a view of downtown if you book here!The bathroom was super clean as well and had extra toothpaste, woohoo!! My only issue with my room was that my bed frame (or mattress?) was pretty loud and squeaky whenever I rolled over or moved around. The bed, pillows, and comforter were all great and cozy, but the squeakiness did bother me a bit. Of course, I'm the lightest sleeper on the planet, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.Every single employee I interacted with at this hotel was the nicest person ever. From the valet drivers to the check-in desk to room service to the bartenders... Everyone was extremely friendly, attentive, and seemed genuinely happy to help. It was refreshing and relaxing to converse with so many awesome employees. It's a seriously great staff they've got!I don't stay at hotels in Fort Worth very often since I live so close, but the Worthington Renaissance has much more to offer in addition to great rooms. I'll be back for their bar, and I'm excited to try out their restaurant, Vidalias. Amazing spot whether you're looking for somewhere to spend the night or somewhere to relax with a cocktail.Great room, with a king sized bed.  Valet parking is $25 but was included in our deal.  When we arrived, valet was ready and quick.  When we claimed the car, it was equally speedy.We entered the very beautiful lobby and were immediately greeted and were able to check in right at the counter by the door.  We only had one bag, so off we went.We were attending a function in the Presidential Suite on the 11th floor and they coordinated it so well that everyone who was attending and staying the night was on the same floor.  Very nice, considering it was a pajama party and I was prancing around in my new jammies and slippers!Our room had a decent view of the city, a well stocked bathroom complete with toothpaste!  Nice touch.They were able to accommodate my request for a late check-out, so we left at 1pm.Now, the Presidential Suite....it's two floors, complete with multiple killer bathrooms, a soaking tub, a separate huge shower and two balconies.  At this party, a bartender and service staff were supplied, and they kept the food and drinks coming.  They had adult-type drinks modeled in the slumber party theme, such as the adult milkshake (with Baileys) and the Pillow Talk, which was a vodka martini looking drink.  I stuck to beer and never had an empty!The views were amazing from both balconies and if you are looking for a place to host a seriously upscale important party, I would highly suggest you check this out!I get sent to many hotels from Hiltons to La Quinta hotels and I feel more like complimentary services of La Quinta are more appreciative of your business where higher end hotels will try to charge you for every little thing. The staff here though is very friendlyI grew up in Fort Worth and I remember when this hotel was the Americana and I did a report in High School about the hotel industry in Fort Worth. It was grand then and it to me it still is today.The past few years my mom has a staycation at the Worthington the week of the 4th of July. The rest of the family always goes down because the suite she stays in is luxurious with plenty of room and a great view of the city from the balcony and an even better view from the bedroom and living area of the 4th fireworks. We normally just hang out visiting all day and the next. The location is perfect and with all the changes downtown there's great shops and restaurants in walking distance, but the food at the Worthington is excellent. Whether you choose room service or the Vidalia's you won't be disappointed. This year we actually stayed in the room next door and it was lovely. We had the same awesome view of the fireworks. The beds were so comfortable I hated to get up. The staff was really nice and helpful. Wi-Fi is included depending on your room type we didn't have to pay and it was fast and about 10 people between 2 rooms enjoyed it without any lag time, lol.I love the Worthington and I'm looking forward to staying the next 4th of July.  The Worthington is just a great place to hang out.  The lobby is comfortable and inviting.  We noticed there were at least 3 weddings receptions that were taking place that Saturday and I have been to one and the service and the banquet room was really nice.Whenever some one ask a recommendation for for a Fort Worth hotel this is always where I advise.  It's in the center, the  service and price is worth it to me. I probably won't stay here again until next 4th of July but Vidalia's is a new favorite spot and that floating bar, yes a great place to relax, chill and take in the scenery.Originally we stayed here for a business event for the Country Music Awards.  Other people with us were placed at the Omni and actually requested to stay here.  Fantastic location.  Weather permitting you can walk to any restaurant or shopping, and there's so much to choose from.  They provided an absolutely beautiful breakfast buffet for our party, probably the best I've ever had with a large group.  The staff was pleasant the entire way through and the hotel is beautiful.  Missed the 5 star because I thought they could use a little improvement on the food for their restaurant and bar.Good quality hotel with an immaculate lobby. Good sized, well appointed rooms with comfortable beds, the king sized I had was excellent. Restaurant was a little substandard for such a hotel but there are plenty of options in and around Sundance Square.","I have no complaints about this place. None. I was in town for a conference and this was the conference hotel. 1. I used the mobile app to check in.2. I get there and they greeted me at the door. I gave them my name, and they said ""Ms. C, we have been expecting you!"" 3. I was able to check in at 11:49 a.m. YASSSS.4. I got to my room, and perhaps because it is Texas, the room was really big. And yes, it was a normal King size bed room. SCORE! I walked in and thought, ""holy crap, this room is huge!"" And it is not just a little square room - mine had some shape to it.5. The toiletries are Aveda. I HEART. Aveda. I really do. So, I am always happy to stay at a hotel that uses their products. Sadly, I didn't see any housekeeping carts to raid, or I would be even happier - ha.6. Did I mention the room is huge?7. The bed - a little firm for me, but it was great for my back. Also, the pellows were ohhh sooo flufffyyyy... I also adore fluffy pellows. And yes, PELLOWS.8. Check-out was super easy. Used the mobile app to check out, and voila, I was done! Left my card-key on the nightstand and was outtie.9. It is right next to Sundance Square, which has a Starbucks (a must for me), some little shops, and lots of food 10. Thank you, Worthington, for another great experience.As soon as I walked into my room, I felt like a baller. I belly flopped onto my comfortable king sized bed, hopped up, opened the curtain and was in awe of my view. I looked out into the Trinity Trails and the court building. I turned up some music, danced into my fancy bathroom, fully stocked with toilet paper, Aquafresh toothpaste, and Aveda hair and body products. I had plenty of towels and a little thing of hand scrub. The bed was sooo comfy and the sheets were very, very clean. The staff is also very friendly - the valet people took care of me, the people in the lobby made sure someone was taking care of me, and they're all very professional. I've come here twice so far - both for events. It's so beautiful inside. I love the fountains in the entrance and the view from the bar above. I really felt cool being in here! I would highly recommend it here for events or for pleasure. There's so much more to do around downtown and it's great being able to walk to everything. The coolest thing had to be the elevators to me. First, there's always one waiting for you on the first floor. Second, they're super fast!!!The Worthington Hotel is your best bet if you want to be in the middle of the FW action.If you are on Vacation, this hotel is right in the middle of all the attractions that Fort Worth has to offer. Walking distance to the Bass Performance Hall and Sundance Square.This is also a great choice if you are a local who is out and about and had a little too much to drink ;) The hotel has an amazing view of downtown, and it's surrounded by  great bars and restaurants.The staff is super friendly and everyone has a service oriented attitude. They want to make sure you have a great time.The rooms are beautiful and clean, the bar is nice and laid back, great to just have a drink and a conversation if you want to get away from the fuzz of the other bars in that area.Thank you so much to the Worthington Staff for your hospitality!This would normally be a five star review but one incident changed that.I loved the room. It was quiet, bed was comfy, good water pressure, etc. I had to ask for a robe because they don't keep one in the room. But no big deal. The location is also perfect. Lots of food nearby, but the restaurant in the hotel is decent too.I was staying here to take the Bar exam at the convention center. On the second day, on my lunch break, I came back to my room to get some allergy meds. The door wouldn't open. I went downstairs and got a new key. Back upstairs...still no dice. The receptionist gave me a third key and said they'd send engineering up. The person who came up couldn't resolve the problem himself and he had to call security. I had about 10 minutes left before I had to be back at the convention center and I was about to leave when security FINALLY got the room open. It was some kind of internal battery issue. Everyone was cordial and apologetic. All's well that ends well...but I shudder to think what could have happened if I'd come back to get something more important than allergy medicine from the room, or if security had arrived 2 minutes later.Overall, I think this is a nice hotel. But for what I paid, I don't think I deserved the added stress and worry of not being able to get into my room in the middle of an 8-hour testing day.What I hoped would be a 5 Star stay at a 4 star hotel is a 2 star stay because, and only because, the front desk manager is good at her job.THE VALET IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. ANYWHERE.-- DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PARK A CAR HERE --There are several other garages you can park your car free all weekend (after 5pm Friday) within walking distance of the hotel. I will not describe in detail the 8 HORRIBLE ENCOUNTERS my party and I had with the valet staff. Upon my arrive and turning my car over to the valet staff I asked how far in advance I should call for my car, I was told 10-15 minutes. The average wait time for a car throughout the duration of my stay was 40 minutes, which is ON TOP of the 10 minute head start. I will simply say the valet alone will stop me from ever staying at this hotel again if I have need of a car.There was a mix up with my reservations, which was made through their customer service 5 months prior to our stay. I was informed I was in a cretin kind of room at check in, I informed the front desk person checking me in that was incorrect. He left to go ""figure it out"", when he returned he informed me he was mistaken and the room was as I requested. When I got up to said room it was NOT. I had to call the front desk and wait on hold for 15 minutes to then be told ""That is the room you were booked into"", but they would figure it out and I was moved. The new room that was correct was wonderful, had a great view and was well furnished. I did have to have maintenance come in because the phone did not work, requiring me to walk half way up the long hall in the event I needed anything, including my car.After one of the wretchedly horrible experiences with the valet, which I already mentioned I won't go into detail about, the front desk manager sent up several bottles of champagne to my suite for our party. Which was a nice gesture, however I am allergic to champagne and none of the other people in my party drink. So it did nothing to alleviate the tension or upset feelings I had about the situation. Several days after our stay as a Platinum Elite member with Marriott I was invited to complete a survey about our experience. After which I received an email from the director of event planning apologizing for our experience with the valet. Which while appreciated was no incentive whatsoever to attempt to stay at this hotel again. I expect far more from a Category 6 Marriott hotel when a Category 1 will comp a full night's stay if you are not satisfied with your experience.As I already stated I wanted this to be a 5 star stay and if it weren't for the valet it would have been 4 stars hands down as 90% of our problems were created and stemmed from their incompetence which unfortunately greatly affected our stay. Enjoy your stay, just don't park your car.This is  a hard review to write. I had a really mixed experience here.I made reservations online about two months before my stay through the ""official"" lodging service for a moderately large conference. I requested a king bed then (and that's my preference on my profile with Marriott.) When i checked in after a three hour drive, I was told I'd have a room with two double beds (and was asked if that was all right.) I mentioned to the desk clerk that I'd requested a king. She checked, and validated that I actually knew what kind of room I had requested. She said there were no kings available, that they'd likely been booked by people who had made reservations before me.Originally when I booked my room for this conference, I'd booked at the Omni, which was the primary hotel for the conference, being right across the street from the FW Convention Center (and which is a *fine* hotel; I've stayed there multiple times before.) I changed my room to the Worthington, as I'm a pretty loyal Marriott customer (and in the first [bottom] tier of their ""elite"" membership program due to stay frequency.) The desk clerk fiddled with her computer a bit and upgraded me to a room on a club floor (with access to the ""club"" room with munchies and a bar in the evening and free breakfast in the morining.) Still two double beds, but a nice gesture and one I genuinely appreciate.The room itself was nice. Pretty roomy, decent view of a slide of downtown. Long walk from the elevator, but also therefore removed from elevator noise. I didn't notice until my shower the next morning, but there was no bath mat in the bathroom, so I created a nice puddle on the floor when I exited the shower.When housekeeping serviced the room that day while I was at the conference, they provided a bathmat, and had it on the floor in its normal deployment position. That's good. Moreover, perhaps they thought I should undertake some of my own housecleaning, since they left me a toilet brush on the bathroom counter, right next to my nicely laid out toiletries and toothbrush. Ugh. Time for a new toothbrush....The tub/shower combination is a little older; I prefer a standalone shower. On the other hand, there was great water pressure and I could take a fine shower. A lot of newer Renaissance properties have those fancy rain shower heads that look great but are pretty much impossible to use to take a good shower.Let's talk about elevators. There are four cars, but the wait for them in the lobby was incredible. The hotel wasn't slammed with people, but by the time an elevator car showed up, the elevator lobby was backed up with people waiting. On one trip down the elevator, with my hands full of bags and carrying cases I was carrying to my conference, i got rammed by the luggage cart pushed by an associate. When we reached the lobby, he made me get out before he did, though I was pinned between his cart and the back of the elevator car. Come, on...Club room was nice, apart from being completely out of leaded coffee on Monday morning. Not a good way to start my day. On Wednesday, they were out of sleeves for coffee cups, out of napkins, and out of glasses for juice. The place was far from full of people - quite a few open tables - how do you run out of basics like that? Do you not notice you're starting to run low?Marriott's usually have really comfy beds and pillows. Not here. The bed seems older and way too soft (and probably never gets rotated.) Too many small pillows. I've awakened every morning with a sore back and sore neck.Vidalia's restaurant is quite good (see my review.) I valet parked because I had a lot of crap to carry out of my car; Almost $30 a day for that, and I never took the car out in the five days I stayed there. Yikes.Not specific to this property, but perhaps my biggest gripe with Marriott's higher end properties is the $12.95/day or more for internet access. Come on, guys, you're not Spirit Airlines nickel and diming customers for things that really should be included in the base price. So - whatever rate you might get for this hotel, if you drive, you're going to be paying another $25-30 a night to park, and if you use the internet, another $13 or more for that. Stay at a Courtyard, Fairfield, or Springhill, and those things are included in your room rate. I don't get it.Worst staff ever, rude not willing to help, room was average, valet was more interested in talking to local drunks than parking cars!  Would never stay here again as well as the over priced !  Save your money stay anywhere else !OMG this place is amazing. Worth every penny, Feel like Royalty. I will come back to stay in Fort Worth just for the RenaissanceA great spot for a Downtown Fort Worth visit!FREE PARKING...Brunch. Get your park ing ticket n park in the multi story garage...in the shade.Sunday brunch was very good.Upscale,  quiet,  good service.Not very impressed with this ""high"" scale hotel.. If you want to get lost trying to find the elevator in a hotel or finding how to get to the parking from inside the hotel...well you will not be disappointed!!! I felt like I walked 10 miles looking for things. Rooms were ok.Very very nice hotel.Very clean and with a great bar on the 2nd floor (not too expensive either for hotel bars).Their centralized location on downtown Ft Worth is perfectly located for nearby restaurants, clubs, shopping and nightlife.The best, being a Marriott shop, are fantastic.  Soft and mushy but with enough firmness.   They provided plenty of pillows as well which was awesome.The only negative remark would be the lack of a refrigerator in the rooms. We didn't get a chance to try the pool but will the next time we stay and there Will be a next time.  Great place for a weekend-getaway or a short staycation.Absolutely gorgeous hotel! Their Sunday brunch, especially around Christmas time is superb and something you may want to make a tradition. I've been many times. Bring family and enjoy all of the decorations during the holidays! I also had the honor of attending a lovely Yelp event out on the terrace. We were treated like kings and queens by the hotel staff! It's without a doubt worth staying here especially since it's in the heart of downtown and near all of the wonderful venues around Sundance Square. Highly recommended.What a great stay! The hotel is within walking distance of great restaurants and bars. The pool is warm, the hot tub didn't work but I have children that can not swim so that did not phase me. Rooms were clean, pillows and towels were fresh. Requested two rooms both with a king bed, one with a crib in the room. We received what we asked for. The crib is safe and comes with complimentary baby shampoo, body wash and a rubber ducky. Most of the workers were friendly and the valet parking was quick and easy. The breakfast is great. Buffet is $16 per person. Maybe not worth that much if you're a bacon and egg person but, if you're not they have a chef that will make you omelettes, French toast, pancakes (even silver dollar pancakes for kiddies) and waffles. The buffet has already made bacon, eggs, sausage, potatoes, gravy, biscuits, oatmeal and boxes of cereal with yogurt and milk next to it. There's also fresh fruit, homemade muffins and all kinds of other things. Coffee is good and the chef makes a complimentary smoothie. Anyways, enough about food - the horse carriages pick up patrons right in front of the hotel. It's $45 for a 20 minute ride. The kids enjoyed it. The zoo is about six/seven minutes away from the hotel and it's a nice facility. I recommend this hotel and when we go back, we'll stay again. One tiny kick back was that We ordered two drinks from the bar, a Mint Mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea - $21! But, they were good and can't expect cheap drinks from a hotel. So, I still give this hotel five stars.Stayed here for a conference.  Our room was beautiful with a stunning view of downtown.  It was on the 11th floor and the walls seemed to be pretty thick as we didn't hear any noise from other rooms.  The thermostat didn't seem to work as we had it on 60 and it felt stuffy and the fan was barely audible so forget about any white noise in the room.  The bathroom was tasteful but there was no fan which is puzzling and troubling.  Housekeeping didn't replenish soap/shampoo so we had to get it at the front desk.  There was a pouch in the room asking to tip your housekeeper which was a first and IMO tacky.  The elevators are a mess.  The layout of the lobby and the mezzanine are confusing with minimal signage.  The front desk and lobby employees all seemed helpful and pleasant.  Cheaper parking is available nearby.  The location is terrific.Came for a yelp event and I must say I was blown away by the service I received from every employee at the hotel. Our checking with Jessica went very smoothly and i received great service from Valet to housekeeping, each staff member was courteous and friendly, and made you feel that everything you asked for or needed to know was important to them too. I was greeted by every staff member I passed in the hall or lobby and was welcomed with a smile during each visit to the front desk. The room was clean and beautiful. I would come back again!Awesome place, I have to leave a big tip the fellas upfront really took care of us. Beautiful hotelWe stayed here this weekend and I have pretty mixed emotions about it.The Good:Check-in went smoothly and the staff told us about things that were nearby we should check out.The bar-The bartender forgot what we had ordered and gave us a free round.  I ordered a pillow talk and it was very interesting and very good!Starbucks-No line and fast serviceGreat LocationThe Mediocre-The room-Not bad but not the best I've ever stayedConcierge Level-Apparently we were booked on concierge level so we had to put our key into the elevator to get it to stop on our floor and there was a lobby and kitchen area right when you exit the elevator but no one told me when you could take advantage of whatever they served there.  I guess I could have asked but who has time for that!The Bad:Valet-They parked my car overnight and left the lights on and killed the battery.  So as a result we had to wait an hour for them to get my car running again and then some young valet guy had the nerve to tell me that I should go have my battery checked to make sure it wasn't bad.  This experience was the first time in a long time that made me want to say the F-word multiple times in public.  To make matters worse the purpose of the trip was for me to go buy a new car and trade in that car which I was now worried wouldn't start again once I turned it off.  My husband and I ended up going to the auto parts store to buy a battery charger in case that happened.  Then we had to ask them to remove the $25 valet charge from our bill.  They did remove the charge but I'm still bitter.Amazing valet, great customer service, someone always and willing to help, at your room quickly if something is needed. Concierge is very knowledgeable. And the best part was seeing the Christmas tree and Santa from our floor down on Main St!! Will definitely be back!!I was very disappointed with my entire stay at the Renaissance, it is really so far the worst Marriott-Affiliated hotels I've ever experienced. The quality of service and the incompetency of staff members were beyond imaginable at this 4-star rated hotel. I checked into a King-size bedroom and was told the room was ready by the front desk. However, 4 hours later, when I went out of the hotel to get some fresh air, and came back 15 minutes later, I found two staff members in my room and the bed was stripped out of blanket. One staff member was talking in foreign language on the phone while the other staff member was somehow in a panic mode. I asked what's going on and they ignored to answer me. So I waited for the lady to get off phone and she used broken English to tell me that somebody thought the sheet was dirty but it was a mistake. Then these two staff members picked up the sheets AND PILLOWS that were THROWN ON THE FLOOR and remade my bed with the SAME SHEETS. So, was my bedroom ready and CLEAN at the first place? Or was the sheet dirty and they didn't change it? If it was dirty, why they did not change a new sheet and put on the ""old""one on the bed in front of me? I delivered those questions to relevant hotel personnel but I did not receive any answer in regards to these questions.While they made the bed with the old sheets, they were speaking their home-country language that I really had no clue what they were saying, but it was obvious that they were scared, and guilty. They never bothered replacing the $4.50 bottled water after I particularly requested to the service desk to replace it, and now this $4.50 water is showing in my charge that I only had less than half of the bottle before these same staff invaded my privacy and threw my water away.When I walked out of my room, I could hear the cleaning crew were in the hall way and one of them whom later on showed up in my room, was standing in the hall way. As I walked along the hallway, she entered a hotel room and right after I walked past the room she entered, she came out of the room and went to a different room. Her behavior in the hall way as well as her reaction in my room was utterly, suspicious.The horrific experience is not over yet. The next day, I put the ""A little Privacy"" sign on my door and called the service desk around 3pm to have the cleaning staff coming in and clean my room. I left the room and came back later in the evening, NOBODY came to clean my room and NOTHING WAS REPLACED. But INTERESTINGLY, the third morning at 10:30am, I had my ""A LITTLE PRIVACY""door sign hung at the door again, the cleaning staff knocked the door, TWICE. Is there any professionalism left in this place?As I was departing this hotel, walking out of my room, there was one cleaning staff in the hallway. For no apparent reason, she gave me a nasty, dirty look. The accumulated piles of unpleasantness finally trumped me to complain at the front desk check out.So this was my experience at the Renaissance in downtown Fort Worth, a ""crown joule""4-star hotel that was built by the Bass family back in the days. It is utterly a SHAME how this rude and unprofessional service erodes the beautiful old-styled luxurious furnishing and dilutes the elegant, classy presence of the Marriott brand. For customers who can tolerate these incompetency and suck up to unprofessional behaviors while paying 200 or 300 dollars each night and not afraid of shadiness, feel free to join this location. I have to say, the last blonde-haired manager that I spoke with, was probably the best employees of this entire hotel. She showed some integrity and handled my situation with proper measure at the end. But again, the entire experience was rather horrific than pleasant. Unless this hotel gets rid of the slackers that are sucking up their paychecks, I would never consider staying at this hotel again.","Solid Four Stars:  Large, clean, friendly, service oriented hotel in downtown Fort Worth.I stayed on the concierge level and saved having to go out to both dinner and breakfast- the selections were hot (oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage,)People were helpful and friendly, and southern courtesy abounded!  A nice retreat!  Great business hotel!DO NOT STAY HERE! I'm not sure why this hotel is rated so high.  We'll start from the beginning of our stay: When we first arrived all I noticed was how dated it looked, I don't think they've updated anything in 20 years. I went to check in and they lost our reservation, after waiting 15 minutes they found it. We get to the room and realized they DON'T have free wifi. It's 2015 - get free wifi. It's $15 a day unless you're a rewards member. Within 5 minutes the guests we share a wall with arrived to their room. How do I know? Because the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything. We were there for a wedding along with 200 other wedding guests staying there also.  One family got a suite so our group would have a place to hang out in between wedding festivities. We had a noise complaint both nights and they threatened to evict us all from the hotel. They suggested we hang out in the hotel bar and that they would be open late, we got there and it was last call. They refused to stay open any later. We later talked to management that night and asked why they didn't book the wedding guests on the same floor to avoid disturbing other guests and he said that wasn't his department. The next day we were getting ready to check out and called the concierge for more towels and were told they would be right up, they never came. Later we tried to go down to the lobby and get a luggage cart to bring our things down, but they don't ""check them out to guests"".  We went back to the room and tried calling to have someone bring us one and help with luggage but after 3 calls and no answer we gave up and dragged our bags down ourselves. We paid our bill and couldn't leave fast enough.I attended the FWSO Gala recently at the Worthington. The food was terrible! The main course was a nasty stew like dish - so distasteful that no one was eating it. One of my table mates asked the waiter if she could speak to the manager. The female manager came to the table and listened to the complaints and stomped to the side of the room. She and another suited Worthington employee stood be hide our table and talked about us and glared at our table for about twenty minutes. I called to speak with the hotel manager - John Klukan. I had to leave a voice mail with his assistant Claudia Hernandez. This was two weeks ago and I have not received a call back. Bad service = bad management.Swanky! That is so the term for this hotel and it's floating bar. We went here for an event and had a blast. All of the staff were so friendly, and the view of downtown! Man, I could live on that balcony with a drink in my hand. I like the location too, right in the heart of things. It goes on the list  for places I'd recommend family stay when they come to visit.I stayed here after a Yelp event a few weeks ago and loved it. The room was beautiful. I had a great view of downtown. The bed was super plush and comfy. You can request extra pillows and build yourself a fort! Jk. Maybe. The lobby has a little water station that had the most refreshing pineapple infused water available. There's a bar on the second floor that is open and allows you to people watch everyone checking in and out. The location of the hotel is right near Sundance Square, so you can walk to great bars and restaurants. I really enjoyed my stay.I was confused about where to get a carriage. I stood outside for about one minute total before someone came and asked if I needed help. The nice guy taking care of luggage told me where to catch the carriage, that the carriages, only take cash, and even told me that there was an atm in the hotel lobby if I needed one :)I was happy.Horse carriages are available in front of the Worthington after about 6 pm to 11 pm on Fri and Sat nights. Some of the carriages have reservations but many do not.We WILL be back! The bf and I took a wkend getaway, spending fri &amp; sat night's at this beautiful property. I scout hotels based on walk ability &amp; nearby restaurants/shopping/nightlife : and WOW, exiting the front of this building and walking across the street to Sundance Square?!? SCORE!! We ate, and drank, and shopped to our hearts' delights. I'll review those places separately, but in regards to this Marriot: two thumbs up, way up. I've been a Marriott Rewards member for 4 years, staying at their numerous chains in the Marriot family : and of all the properties I've laid my head down at at night, all over North America, I give these guys huge Kudos! Every staff member we encountered (front desk, concierge, room service, hotel restaurant, valet stewards): they were ALL so pleasant, and not just to be cordial - but because they seemed to genuinely enjoy their job, and interacting with us. We felt like appreciated guests, from the moment they took our car keys, to bringing up a fridge and bottle opener to the room (TGIF wine for me, beer for my Mister!), delighting us with our ordered breakfast to the room Saturday morning , the omelette chef charming us with humor at the Sunday morn brunch buffet, and the concierge gladly holding our luggage for us after we checked out but still wanted to walk the neighborhood. That stellar customer service, topped off with notable cleanliness, AND Aveda products/toiletries in the bathroom, combined with walk ability: well yes, yes I WILL spend less than $200/night (triple A rate, folks!) to stay here again. The Marriot family just skyrocketed up a few levels in my books, all because of this property.I have to say this was one of my biggest disappointments of 2014. This hotel charges around $300 a night but should charge around $75 a night. The first room I had smelled like cigarettes. It was awful. My husband and I changed rooms only to get a room that had dirty glasses, no robes and a shower drain that was totally clogged. We used the valet service which was the most mismanaged valet I have ever experienced. The hotel was not busy but the valet would take over 10- 15 minutes to get your car and then you would sit in bumper to bumper traffic in the carport because no one was managing/directing traffic. This actually made me late to the rehearsal and the wedding of my brother. Thanks Worthington. I tried to get ice on 6 floors and all machines would not work.The glasses that were in my room were dirty. When I called ""At your service"" I had to call 7 times before anyone would pick up the phone. I explained that the ice machines didn't work and my glasses were dirty. It took 45 minutes before someone showed up and all they had was a bucket of ice with no glasses. When I called down to complain about the drain, they said that someone would fix it. I told them I would be leaving the room within the next hour and a half and to please send someone while I am gone. Someone showed up within 10 minutes and I had to send them away. Every day I had to call at night to ask for the room to be cleaned because it would never be cleaned even though I would leave starting at 9:30/10am everyday and would come back until around 5/6. If this wasn't bad enough, I called, again,  to the lovely ""At your service"" button- After another 6 calls, I was told that the hotel was very sorry about our troubles and they would comp our internet charges. However, come time for checkout, these charges, of course, were on our bill. Once again, I had to wait and get a manager to take these off. Stay here if you want to overpay and wait for just about everything. I have traveled all over the country and have never experienced a hotel so mismanaged. Oh, and this is the one and only hotel that will not offer you coffee in the morning, instead, they will charge you to go to the Starbucks on the third floor. If you wanting coffee or tea in your room, good luck. I opened the box and there were two empty bags of tea and one coffee pouch. I would save your money and spend it at just about any other hotel. Thanks for making my brother's wedding that much more unpleasant.I got all fucked up huffing freon at my Uncle Larry's house, and he put me up in this fantastic hotel for a week so I could get my head straight. I was sober for about three hours, and then I started to mainline black tar heroin with a street urchin who went by the name ""Jimenez."" I stink fingered Jimenez for $50 and threw up on the bible in the nightstand. The cleaning lady who came the next morning was very helpful and found me a line on some barbiturates. I'm currently typing this review before I auto-erotically asphyxiate with the telephone cord. Room Service will be my spotter.Consistently a great place to stay with a very good location.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.Excellent service at this hotel. I stayed here for a week for work and was impressed the whole time. I had one issue in my room with the shower head. When I called the front desk, they not only replaced the shower head completely but they also left a basket of fresh fruit and drinks (waters, juice) in my room for the inconvenience. The hotel took care of all of our meals for breakfast and lunch for the week and I was highly impressed with their food. However, I felt just the opposite about the banquet dinner they served. We were served a salad with only 1 dressing choice (something uncommon) and they could not bring out a substitute other than a heavy ranch. The main dish was half chicken and half steak. The steak was terrible and tasted like chicken. Not even worth eating. There were some great potatoes with the dinner but not very much (4 or 5 bites) and a few carrots. The dessert was pretty good, but usually anything chocolate is.Reserved king size.  Arrived and they tried to give us double beds.  She was very rude.  When we told her we reserved a king size she responded with ""well it doesn't matter, we don't have any.  Then she was trying to charge us 40.00 more dollars for the crappier hotel room.  So we leftThis hotel has seen better days. Let me break it down...Room Reservations: I called the reservation hotline to inquire about rooms because the normal website I use (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>) was giving me the option of 1 King or 2 Doubles. That was all the reservation hotline could guarantee me, as well. But, she told me I'd likely get the King bed desired if I got there by 3:00 PM as that is the normal check-in time.Fast forward to check in and we got two double beds. No Kings. The lady offered to send up some ice cream (for my wife) and a beer (for me) to make up for our troubles. It was a very sweet gesture that would have been even sweeter had she followed through and actually send up the items.The rooms are fine. The beds are comfortable. The t.v. works intermittently - we found it only came on when the bathroom light was on. If you go on a busy weekend, be ready to drive nails through your eyeballs when dealing with the valet. It looks like the NJ Turnpike.I think I'll take a look at some of those boutique hotels popping up across Fort Worth...or stay closer to TCU at one of the cheap options next time around. Cabs to and from combined with the cheaper hotel works just as well.We were recommended the Worthington and now I see why. We were met with friendly smiles and warm hellos everywhere we went inside the hotel. The front desk was pleasant and helpful. We were treated like old friends in the lounge upstairs by Cody, who greeted us as soon as we walked in and got our favorite cocktails started. The room was comfortable and very quiet. We will only stay here whenever we visit Fort Worth, truly a great experience. Stephanie.I travel for business a fair amount.  Everything here was spot on.  Service, cleanliness, spacious, food and drink.  Next time in DFW i will drive across town to stay here. Well done - Thanks... A great example of why I stay at Marriott first.This hotel is absolutely beautiful. I stayed here (and attended a conference here) and was absolutely blown away by the quality of service and attentiveness. Staff was always there for any questions I had, and even went above and beyond to give me an umbrella on a rainy day. The gym is also phenomenal and is one of the nicest gyms I've been to (definitely the best hotel gym I've seen)! Hot tub, pool, a ton of weight machines, cardio machines, ab balls, free weights, etc. I highly recommend this hotel. Aside from the amazing rooms and facilities, it also has a great location!Mostly good but lacking in several areas; asked for a daily paper to be delivered, was told yes, but never received. Was told someone was stealing them? No HBO here! Loud parties going on late Saturday. The staff while kind and courteous, seem to have forgotten some of the basics like; how do we keep clients coming back.  My Marriott points have yet to post to my account, perhaps they are associated with the same department that delivers papers. I'll not make a point of staying here again.Nice hotel in a great location! Love all the little  extras.. Fruit infused water in lobby, toothpaste in bathroom and lots of electrical plugs. Complimentary breakfast on 8th floor. This is our second visit and I'm sure we will be back again.Very friendly front desk clerk asked if I wanted access to the club floor for $30 extra. I thought it would be nice to get a glass of wine and some hors d'oevres before dinner so I said yes. $300 room, add $30. Come to find out wine is not included in the $30 club floor charge. You pay extra for alcohol, even wine and beer, on the club floor!  I've never seen that before on a hotel club floor, very annoying. $12.50 charge for WiFi. Even the fitness center is an extra charge. Feeling nickel and dimed to death. Not classy. Room is nice. Comfy beds with nice comforters. Bathroom a bit dated. Can hear the tv from across the hall. Ok but not worth all the extra charges.If you have 25 people paying for your really overpriced drinks why would you do last call at 11:30? Not to mention why is your bar staff cleaning and doing inventory before close? Another 30 mins of business would pay for all your labor. It's Just bad business to shut while people are still in the bar.","This hotel is stunning. Beautiful lobby, excellent customer service, large rooms. I stayed here for a week for a conference, and this hotel is definitely made for large conferences and meetings. There are a couple different large ballrooms and multiple bars and food areas. If you're staying here for a conference or symposium, you're in a great spot! If you're staying here for a personal trip, you might want to think about going somewhere else. Wifi is $15 a day (gasp!) and there is no breakfast included. The walls are pretty thin and I could hear any commotion in the hallway all night.The hotel is in a great spot downtown so there is plenty to do in the evenings; I was able to find a new awesome spot to eat every day.After spending a week and a half here:- I thought the rooms were pretty spacious than expected. I had a double-bed room  and found there was more than enough room for me and my big luggage. I loved the bench, additional chair and ottoman which I didn't take advantage of since I was so busy with work. The beds were high and pretty comfortable. Not that anyone would spend time inside a hotel room for long periods of time, but they have quite selection of TV channels (AMC, F/X, and lots of ESPN) that most hotels don't normally have. - I like the fact there is a mini-Starbucks coffee bar thing and a gift shop inside the hotel (Mezzanine level). I ran out of toothpaste and was able to get another tube of toothpaste from the gift store. The coffee bar saves some time when it's raining out and/or you need a quick fix. It's open from 6 AM through 2 PM and only serves a fraction of drinks than a regular Starbucks (i.e. no frappacinos here). If you really need a Starbucks, there's one about a block and a half away from hotel. - The hotel bar is also on the mezzanine level. It can get crowded, especially when there's a wedding at the hotel (and this seems to be popular with weddings). They have the friendliest bartenders - must be that southern hospitality. Try the upside pineapple cake martini, if you like sweet cocktails. - I thought it was pretty convenient to most of downtown Ft. Worth's restaurants and local bars, and even a Barnes &amp; Noble. The only down side is it's a short drive to the nearest  Walgreens and Target. - It's a bit a drive from DFW airport. I would definitely leave earlier than you would think. - Another reviewer mentioned noise. Yes, you can hear people in the hallway and when your next door neighbor enters/exits his/her room as if it was in your own room. It sucks if you're a light sleeper. - I didn't try it, but I hear there is a decent gym in the hotel. - I wouldn't pass this hotel up if I had to come back, which hopefully isn't for awhile. No offense, Texas, but I'm done with work travel for now.I work by the worthington so I'm familiar with it. I noticed dirt and yellow tinted water coming from the faucet in one of the main bathrooms. That's disgusting. People wash and drink out of those, obviously right? So you'd think it would be kind of important. I notified the front desk and was given the business card of the supervisor. The # was no longer in service. Since I washed and drank out of it i was pretty concerned so i asked to be contacted by someone letting me know what they found. I never got a call. I went back and personally showed the guy at the front desk the yellow black specked water. He was very suprised. Still no word from supervisor. I went back days later and told the bartender upstairs. He was the only one that acted really concerned but I still never heard back from anyone.  A few days later I ran into the general manager, the one guy who should care about this. He humored me like he might be concerned but by the end of the conversion he just smugged me off.  I talked to an employee who works there and she confirmed that the hotel mgmt treats their employees equally as bad.  I hope this review helps you in your decision on whether or not you want to enable this type of company to continue its practices the way they do.ThxPA very nice, upscale hotel near Sundance Square. Here for a convention, I was impressed. The room was quite nice, as should be expected. I particularly like all the sitting areas. One day, we went hunting for cool places to hang out, and they are everywhere.A real highlight is the Mezzanine bar... A great place for a quiet drink and good conversation.My only complaints are my usual complaints about ""upscale"" hotels. No in room coffee. No free breakfast. Charge for parking. Charge for internet. Charge charge charge. It's sad that you could pay this much for a room, and still get charged for something they give away free at McDonalds (and dang near everywhere else.)All in all, 4 solid stars.This hotel was clearly designed with conventions in mind, and yes, I did stay here for a convention. (You can usually tell if a hotel is designed more for conventions by the lack of free coffee, LOL.) That doesn't mean you can't have an enjoyable experience here for personal travel or otherwise - just realize that sometimes conventions garner their own rates and perks. BE AWARE: This hotel has an unusually small number of rooms with king beds, something like 20%.  They will do your best to give you one, but they cannot always guarantee one.The place is huge - tons of meeting rooms, big and small, with plenty of lobby and mezzanine space for socializing, relaxing, etc. Besides standard, comfortable, rooms, there are many unusual suites. Some have balconies, some are multi-level. There is a restricted-access ""concierge floor.""  The fitness center is quite good.  That said, it does feel to me that some parts of the room design and decor are more show than form. For example, the closets and bathroom walls are at angles. It looks nice, but try walking to the bathroom in the dark!   The bathroom sink counter is deco, with fancy edges AWAY from the wall. Again, it looks nice, but it's very easy to drop things behind it onto the floor. There was no dresser in my room. The TV was on a multimedia cabinet with 3 smaller drawers.  The bed was extremely comfortable. Temperature control was quite good, but the air vent blew over the bed. Food and drink options within the hotel are limited. There is Vidalia's restaurant, a starbucks, and snacks at various concessions. But there are many, many restaurants either across the street or within walking distance.First time here and I gotta say this place lives up to the price you pay. EVERYONE staffed here is very kind and the dinner here is out of this world. If Texas de Brazil and Del Frisco had a baby, it would be the food here haha. I ordered the Valentines bundle which included dinner for two, valet parking, and one night stay in a king suite on club level with a later (2pm) check out time. You do pay a premium price  but once you settle in you'll quickly see why. My ONLY complaint is a bit embarrassing. My suite included a nice balcony with a couple of reclined chairs but after laying on one for a bit the fabric ripped :(. I reported it in the morning and was told they would take care of it but I'm really hoping they don't charge me out the wazoo :/. I did enjoy my stay despite the unfortunate chair incident. If you're looking for a special place for a special someone with a fun day/night planned out, this is where you would want to stay. As said before, yes it's a premium price but completely worth it. My significant other was very pleased and that's all that matters to me :).I think we picked a damn good hotel for a girl's weekend in Fort Worth.  The hotel is quite huge.  Our room was on the 7th floor and had a semi-decent view of Sundance Square, and we were right across the street from many bars and restaurants.We didn't really stay in the room other to sleep and have breakfast, but the room was quite spacious with a few seating options.  The beds were kind of small, but super cozy.The room was priced well, they have valet, and it was super easy getting off and on I-30.  Props Fort Worth!Very nice hotel. As part of the Marriott family, the attention to cleanliness showed. Will stay here next time. Walking distance to the Sundance Square.They were nice enough to upgrade me to a suite- very nice, two rooms, balcony, two part bathroom- overall, very comfortable and well maintained. Also, very well located in the middle of Ft. Worth, with all of the restaurants and bars in walking distance. Concierge lounge food is just so-so, but at least they have one. Supposedly the steak house in the hotel is good, but I didn't try it. Overall, much better than the Sheraton Ft. Worth Hotel &amp; Spa.When a King room is reserved and paid for, being placed in a double with the excuse that ""we have a lot of events right now"" is insulting and unacceptable. The room itself was generic, no better than a Holiday Inn. Common areas are nice enough and the gym is impressive, but this in no way makes up for the $25(!) valet and $14 Internet access. Completely absurd. This particular trip was for pleasure, but we won't be sending our corporate business to Renaissance Hotels either. Good riddance.We reserved a king size standard room.  When we arrived we were told we were upgraded because my husband is a platinum elite Marriott member.  We were surprised to walk into our room that had a living room, dining room, upstairs master suite, 2 balconies (one on each floor), and a bidet.  Crazy! There was a concert going on when we first walked in and on NYE the staff was wearing hats and they put together a candy bar for guests.  A fun place to stay with great service.  And every night there is a turndown service where they clean up your room and leave truffles on your pillows.  We will definitely stay here again!For a wedding, stay at omni or blackstone.  For business conference, stay at Worthington.  Do not stay here for a wedding, brutal serviceThis hotel is cool, but overpriced. No fridge in the room, not much counter space in the bathroom, and no real place to eat the super delicious room service. The steak is delicious, but watch out for all the extra room service charges. For 2 entrees, it added $20 onto my bill for the delivery. Very comfy beds and pillows. I don't think I'd come back to this hotel for my next visit, but I would go to the restaurant, Magnolia's.Good location. Not the cleanest room, open bottle of water on floor, broken item and a bit of garbage under the bed. I requested a King bed on the website I got a double room, handicap accessible, which has an annoying bench in the shower. In room dining closes at 11pm.We have been staying at the Worthington for a week now. The valets are very helpful, they've been keeping our cars on the front drive as we've needed them a lot. The rest of the staff has been very attentive to our needs. I must say I've stayed at many other downtown hotels and this is by far the best one. Location is great and all the amenities are there, gym, restaurant, shop, wifi, feather down pillows and comfortable beds. We will most defiantly be back!!!I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and was pretty impressed but it did have a few things that didn't make it a 5 star for me.  There were signs that the hotel would be getting an upgrade soon and I would definitely love to see that.  The beds were comfy (bonus, they have a feather-free floor) and the room and view were nice.  We ate at the restaurant for breakfast and it was pretty decent, especially for hotel food.  The staff was kind of hit-or-miss, sometimes it was the best customer service ever or they didn't pay attention to you at all.  Also, if you're a light sleeper be prepared, you can hear damn near everything in the hallway like it's right in the room.  Despite any drawbacks, I would still stay here the next time I'm in town.super clean, fancy hotels.it's one of those places that provide fruit flavored ice water in the lobby.i came here for free for a conference and felt blessed.this place is amazing and id comes here again if i could afford it.one thing though, you have to pay for the shows on the tv so it's sort of like the mini bar. approach with caution.The lobby bar up a few stairs is a great place to sit and have a cocktail. After resting with a few drinks we decided to have a bite to eat. The restaurant served us a great steak and perfect service this is a classic hotel in Fort Worth.Very nice hotel, with plenty of comfortable lounging areas, great views, and friendly staff.Excellent service, great room. I have stayed her twice, both times great experiences, this visit with my wife and daughter. Great location with access downtown FW, restaurants and TCU by car. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. Would recommend for either business or pleasure.","I was in Fort Worth on business and had such a pleasant stay here. Every single staff member I encountered was so unbelievably friendly and helpful, from the  valet attendants to the front desk to the people greeting you as you walked in the door. They had ice cold water with lemon and lime slices every day in the lobby which was very much appreciated coming in from the hot Texas weather. The beds were insanely comfortable also!Just a regular hotel that is in a great location of Ft Worth.....great service but nothing special with the rooms, older and out datedMy biggest grip is no wifi in the rooms--this is unacceptable these days, and this hotel needs to take care of this in order to stay competitive.The room itself was big, comfortable, and the stay was enjoyable except for no wifi in the room.My wife and I stayed at The Worthington Hotel in downtown Fort Worth the weekend of August 2-4 in 2013.  We stayed in one of the terrace suites on the 9th floor.  LOCATION:  The Worthington is in a GREAT location if you want to stay in downtown Fort Worth and be within walking distance of the different things to do.ROOM (950):  We had a suite with a balcony, living area, bedroom and bathroom.  The bathroom area was nice in that there was a separate vanity area outside of the toilet/shower room.  There was a small closet in the vanity area and a much bigger closet in the bedroom.  We had a television in both the living area and the bedroom.  The bedroom had a king sized bed which was very nice.  There was also  a safe for valuables in the bedroom.  The living area was roomy and had nice furniture and decor.  Our view from our bedroom and living area was fantastic.  The view from the terrace was also nice, but faced a high rise across the street.  That's going to happen in a downtown area :)  Everything seem up-to-date and in very good condition.AMENITIES:  Didn't really use much but the room during our stay.  I hate they charge for Internet connectivity, which I decided not to pay for.  The cable stations are okay, but the on-demand movies were also overpriced.  I think on-demand movies were over $15.  Kind of silly if you ask me.  The clock radio in our bedroom had an iPod docking station.  There were phones in the bathroom, bedroom and living area.PARKING:  I did not valet.  When I checked in the guys out front held my keys until I was checked in and had taken my luggage to my room.  I did self parking.  The lot wasn't very big (covered) but not very full, so it was fine.  Used the room key to get in and out of the lot for no additional charge.  You come and go as you please.  You have to walk a little was along the Mezzanine level to get back and forth to the parking area, but it wasn't too bad.SERVICE:  People were friendly.  Nothing over bearing.  Helpful when you need them.  Overall, I was very pleased with the service.CARRIAGE RIDES:  Okay, this isn't really part of the hotel, but the carriages (pulled by horses) were sitting out front on Friday and Saturday night.  My wife and I took one of the rides ($45 for about 25 minute ride) and it was very nice.  Got to admire some of the old architecture of other buildings as we sat and enjoyed a leisurely ride through the downtown area.PRICE:  Well, I paid a high price for that terrace suite...but what do you expect?What can I say, I like this hotel.I stayed here for three nights at a conference last weekend. It's a huge, cavernous hotel that, like many conference hotels, features rather counter-intuitively designed meeting rooms. That said, it was a great conference hotel: the hotel rooms were cozy and comfortable and really quite spacious; the hotel itself was quiet and efficient; the staff were extremely helpful. All the rooms, while difficult to locate, were exactly what we needed for our panels, presentations, receptions, and meetings. And while it was difficult to find your way from one meeting room to the next, the hotel staff posted themselves around the lobby areas and were very helpful in directing us, so that was nice.I highly recommend this for a large conference!Nice rooms, restaurant and at a reasonable price for this level of hotel for the business traveler.  It was 119 per night and they treated me quite well.I stayed here last week and the place was wonderful. I had a really pleasant stay and will definitely stay here again. We stayed on the 9th floor overlooking downtown. One minor complaint was that there was some spotting on the carpet by the bed, and the bathroom was of less quality than I would have liked, but otherwise it was enjoyable.The staff definitely makes it worth it though! Fantastic! Will definitely stay here again.For a huge hotel catering to the convention crowd, this place has a lot going for it.  The rooms are nice. The service is good and the amenities are high quality and plentiful.We had a snafu with valet (45 minutes to get our car) and it was not minor but I won't let it deter my opinion.Smiley faceGreat location in a nice part of Downtown. Very nice hotel with great facilities. The only complaint I can think of is that the hallways are suuuuper long!The last time I was at the Worthington prior to this visit was for a New Year's Eve party in 1995.  It was strange to be back in Cowtown for work, but the Worthington has held up well.  Still one of the nicest hotels downtown, with enormous rooms.  My room was comfortable, and everything seemed to be in brand new condition.  They have a great gym here, with all the same equipment as my gym back home, plus a hot tub and an indoor pool.  A great place to stay if you're in Fort Worth.I travel a lot for my job an I just this was my first visit to the Renaissance Fort Worth, the hotel it self is very nice and clean and well appointed but the service is very poor and the lack of free wifi in the room  was very disappointing. When I checked in I immediately noticed that no one was smiling. The check in experience was very similar to getting a physical at a clinic, VERY COLD AND STERILE, everyone I encountered at the hotel from the valet to the front desk seemed miserable. I was in town for business and I was going to run a marathon on Sunday so tried to explain that to the front desk person and she said ""company policy is that late check out is at 1 o'clock"" no conversation, no good luck on your business appointment or have fun at the marathon, it was just a update on policy. WOW, I have never been treated so poorly ever! Then when I got to me room a open the curtains to see I had a amazing view on the AC unit of the building next door, i should have expected that after the service I was given. Then the cherry on the cake was when I went to sign on to read my company emails, I noticed there was no free wifi in the room. When I called down stairs to see if there was a code or something I need to get free wifi in the room I was told ""free wifi is only available in the lobby"" that's no, no other solutions, no apology, thats it, just another VERY COLD AND STERILE response. I called my office to explain my problem and they said on the website that it showed free wifi was available, but I guess we should have read the fine print. My companies logistics officer greatly apologized and offered to move me to another hotel, WOW, the only good service I got that day was from my company. I told her not to bother, that I could use my personal cell phone as a wifi hotspot, but I did ask her to never book me at another Renaissance / Marriott again, I was scheduled to stay at one of Renaissance / Marriott hotels 3 more times over the next couple of months and she assured me that she would make sure that she moves me to a hotel that is more ""customer focused"". You really need to take a good look at the level of service you are providing your customers, of a hotel that is supposed to be ""4 stars"" is has ""2 star"" service.I grew up taking monster road trips with my family, ending a 16 hour day squashed in the car with two brothers to either a camp ground or my dad saying, ""look, Tom Bodett kept the light on for us""  (Motel 6).  As a result, I've always had the ""does it have a clean bed"" philosophy, especially since I don't plan to spend any time in the room.  But the Renaissance Worthington Hotel might just have swayed me to the other side.  There was a beautiful lobby, extremely friendly, helpful staff (thanks for the recommendations of photogenic places within walking distance!), and lovely rooms.  I'm not sure what the thread count on the sheets was, but I enjoyed sliding into the cocoon of comfort.  And the view was wonderful - the room was directly over Main Street, overlooking an early 20th century federal building.Something tells me the lights at a certain motel chain in Fort Worth might burn out before I visit them again.Pros: really fantastic gym, attractive decor, central locationCons: guests are nickel and dimed - $13 for parking, $13 for internet access, $4 for bottled water - and it's hard to enjoy staying in a nice hotel when you're slammed with extra fees at every turn; also, note says to save water &amp; energy by reusing towels (throw them on floor for change), but all were changed every day anyhow ... no recycling either ... booSpent a recent weekend here with some girlfriends for a getaway, and this hotel fit our bill perfectly.  Right in the middle of downtown Ft. Worth, it was within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go.  The rate included breakfast which was really yummy.  They even treated us ladies to dessert because it was my birthday.  (No one told them - they happend to spot a gift at our table and asked).  They gave us two adjoining rooms so we could visit back and forth without bothering anyone and supplied us with extra towels because, well face it, 8 women can never have enough towels!  This will be my hotel of choice if another night in Ft. Worth is the plan.P.S.  This review would have gotten a 5 if a demitasse size cup of coffee had been a little less than $9!When I travel I typically go for the cheapest hotel possible. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't book a hotel that looks like something out of a horror movie but my belief is a hotel is simply a place to sleep in. I'm completely uninterested in fancy rooms, excellent food, or any other over the top service. I need something within my budget that I can rest my head in. After staying at the Renaissance Worthington Hotel, my strong held belief was questioned.Two of my dear friends were getting married in Fort Worth and this was the hotel they chose to stay at the night before and after their nuptials. Some other friends and I flew down to Texas to witness the momentous occasion and they wanted to stay there as well. Upon hearing the jawdropping price of $199 per night, I was ready to object but I didn't want to be separated from my buddies plus it was close to the wedding venue and was in a great area in downtown Fort Worth. I gave in. Driving up to the Worthington makes you feel special. You have the very friendly valet gentlemen open your door and greet you. They did this every time we got the car and we received a nice welcome each time we came back. Of course they want to kiss your ass for tips but they played it off very convincingly. All of the hotel staff was very personable and helpful.The lobby is huge with a waterfall, colorful carpet, plush seating. Everything an expensive hotel would have. Our room was smaller than I thought a room costing $199 a night would be but the selling point was the bed. It was about two feet off the ground, the mattress was soft and made you feel you were lying on heaven, and the comforter was thick and warm. This had become my dream bed. I was very disappointed to part with it. The room also came equipped with a flat screen television, a radio that was MP3 friendly, internet access (for a fee of course), and a mini-bar. Aside from the bed the other amenity I fell in love with was the gym. They have cardio equipment, a weight room, free weights, a sauna, a whirlpool, and a pool. This hotel is definitely trying to get me. While I enjoyed my stay at the Worthington, I don't know if I would stay there again. Not because of experience but because of price. I'm a bit cheap but if you are looking for a luxurious hotel and money is of no object try the Worthington.I was repulsed by my stay here and I am an easy guy.  First, I showed up at 10:00PM and I get to my room and stinks like smoke, cigarette smoke to clarify.  I called downstairs and they said ""this is not a smoking hotel,"" I said, ""well, not everyone agrees with that.""  They switched me to another room.  Ok, I could let that go, but...  It is 2011 and we live in the world of WiFi.  This hotel does not have it, per se.  You can get it if you stay on the phone for a half hour with the tech service people and they can get you on it for one day form the business meeting rooms at 14.00 per day, sort of, as long as you don't leave your room with your WiFi device because then you have to call again and then again another half hour on the phone.  I don't know if the people at The Worthington give a crap, based on my phone conversations with them, they don't, and have no plans to get hotel wide WiFi.  You can stay at other places for the same money and get PAID WiFi, heck pay less and get free WiFi.  I am a Marriott's points participant and have stayed at a lot of Marriott's and this is one I will always skip.  Everything else was ok, nothing to blow my skirt up (I am not a cross dresser, not that there's anything wrong with that).Rooms actually look like what's advertised and are nicely updated. Nice staff. Love the Aveda products. Not a fan of low-flow shower.Our client for the weekend used the Worthington as their getting ready location - a very nice hotel! Spacious suites, great downtown location, and a helpful staff!I haven't stayed at The Worthington, but their Thanksgiving buffets are a family tradition.  Their Thanksgiving buffet is insane!!  If you ever have the chance, I highly recommend it.  It's not just one buffet, but there are ROOMS of tables with food.  I can't begin to describe everything they have spread through the rooms, but it's an incredible experience!  It's pricey, but worth it to splurge on Thanksgiving.Great gym and nice, but not great, rooms.  Halls are super long!","['truthfully', 'give', 'hotel', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'throwing', 'extra', 'star', 'check', 'experience', 'brought', 'room', 'service', 'positively', 'charming', 'also',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-fort-worth-hotel-fort-worth,Omni Fort Worth Hotel,4.0,$$$,118,"This review is based solely on room service...Venison chili... You want it. Great flavor and with jalapeno bread that is excellent. No beans, just tasty, and the bowl will fill you up.Texas Cobb: the lettuce part wasn't fantastic, but no one really looks forward to the leaves anyway. The stuff on top of it was good and makes a meal even without adding protein. I didn't since I had the chili and had a hard time finishing both. Jicama is some kind of onion type thing with a pear like consistency. It's weird, but it worked with the rest of the toppings. I would get it again, if I wasn't in the mood for chili.Beautiful hotel in a great location, walking distance to so many things, the convention center, shopping, restaurants and bars. The lobby has a welcoming sitting area with big comfy couches, leather chairs and a see through fireplace. I love the wooden walls with western decor on the shelf's and tables. I recommend getting a drink at the bar and sitting by the fire..very relaxing!I stayed here for a work convention and could not get over the fantastic serve they provide.There were welcome banners and signs throughout the lobby and check in area, even the hotel room keys even had the convention logo on them. Upon check in they notified me off some packages that were deliver to the hotel for me, they offered to deliver them to my room. I choose to pick them up from the concierge's desk (right next to check in) since I was taking them across the street to the convention center. If you need anything just ask the staff, they are willing to run errands for you or take you in their free car service (just make sure to tip)The room was spacious and well cleaned, if you are an Omni member you receive to free drink choices delivered to your room daily. Simply fill out your request and place it on the outside door with the time you want it delivered. I had soda,red bull, water and coffee. Also you can take this order form directly to Starbucks in the lobby for coffee and water.Great views  of the city from the outdoor heated pool, jacuzzi and tanning deck area, the lounge chairs were very comfortable while catching some sun. Lots of dining options onsite, Bob's Steak and Chop House (expensive), Cast Iron ( nice breakfast buffet), Wine thief (wine lovers) Starbucks, and my favorite and where I spent most of my time..Whiskey &amp; Rye ( bar/restaurant).Overall this was a fantastic hotel and I look forward to coming back.This was a very nice hotel that offered a great experience.  Everything was clean and amenities were plentiful.  Check out that sweet fireplace in the lobby!  There is one reasonable restaurant on the premise.  It serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Please know that if your in a hurry in the AM they also offer a Breakfast Buffet!  There is also a hidden, expensive steak restaurant... did i mention, expensive?There is also a Starbucks.. which is always busy, but super convenient for those who don't mind the wait. Lastly, there is a BAR.  I recommend sitting at the bar for fast drink service.  Drink service from a table takes an awful long time.  Also, if you choose to dine here.. no matter the time of day or the amount of folks that are here, be prepare to wait.....the food time is incredible long...  At first I thought it was a Texas thing, but its not, its just a Whiskey &amp; Rye thing.While this location is in Fort Worth.. it doesn't seem to be in the heart of all that is Buzzing.  But its certainly in walking distance from many bars and local restaurants. Also, this hotel is located directly across the street from the convention center.  Because of this, they have dedicated their entire second floor to conference rooms and meeting spaces etc.A beautiful hotel and a great place for a venue. We attended an event there last night as we have many times in the past. After the event ended, we knew getting our valeted car would take a long time, so a group of us went to the bar for a very expensive glass of wine. We were there for a little over an hour. We had to wait for our car for over 30 minutes. To make things worse, they charged $15 and we gave a tip. We should have used Uber. Faster and not that much more expensive. The Omni needs to rectify their valet parking issues. Maybe, they feel it's not an issue because they know people have no option. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a nice hotel and the service in the hotel is great!Stayed here for the livestock show in Fort Worth and this place is pretty Cush! Very close to the show grounds and worth every penny if you prefer the finer things in life. I will stay here every time I visit FW from now on.Very nice hotel with friendly staff and good amendments. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was because of the business center, they charge for it. 7.95 for every 15 mins to use the computer. Come on guys! You can do better than that. Even the Sheraton down the street has free computers to use.....Stayed here for work, and I would definitely return for a leisure visit as well as a work visit. The hotel was super clean and nice. The Valet people were very friendly and the car came out pretty fast despite my coworker not calling down for the car. There is a Starbucks in the hotel. The rooms are very nice and new. The shower was a stand up shower and it was large and clean. There is ample space in the bathroom as well as the room. My room looked towards the highway but I couldn't hear any cars. You could also see the pool from my room as well. The bed was comfy, room service and housekeeping were prompt to answer. I went to the pool and it was smaller but it was nice, there weren't that many people there on the week day. The employees out by the pool were great. I loved my stay and would come back no doubt. It was very Texas themed in the room, very cute.This is a great hotel for a great city.  The Omni definitely understood what Fort Worth was when they designed it.  It was rugged yet sophisticated, cowboy yet classy.  The lobby was tastefully done and does what any great lobby does, captures your attention quickly.  The entrance and the valet area have little to be desired though.  It is very chaotic since it is right off of Houston street, and the parking garage is a block away if you don't want to valet.  The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, just what you would expect for Omni.  The service was great and the staff is very friendly and customer focused.  I definitely would stay here again.The Starbucks in this hotel ROCKS! The staff is courteous, do a great job and always do a good job.  The hotel is clean and bright.  There was a bit of a problem with valet, they seemed to be understaffed and a bit confused; however when brought to the attention of the manager they worked through their slowness and I don't anticipate any problems on my next trip through.It's cozy. 9 stories up has nice view of Fort Worth. Big lobby. Big. Huge! Nicely decorated. Lots of throw pillows. Desk to work.  Bathroom is as big as my office. Hehe. It will do. Lol.My favorite Texas hotel. Great service, food, drinks and location. They know how to do it right, every time. Wish I could stay another nightBeautiful hotel, had to stay here during a Nissan conference. Bob's steakhouse is phenomenal. Very clean, nicely decorated rooms, excellent valet staff, everything you'd expect from the Omni Hotel name!My very first time at Ft. Worth and Omni is a gem!  Very classy and top notch! Great clean rooms with everything you might need and possibly forgotten to bring with you :)) happens to me sometimes during my travel.  Many thanks for allowing me to store my bags, as I was running late to my seminar.  Look forward to coming back here in the evening to enjoy a nice dinner at the restaurant.Nice hotel located right in Downtown Fort Worth. Convenient to many restaurants, with a few located right in the hotel definitely worth selecting for your meal. I did go to Bob's Chophouse and was very impressed by the food and service.Rooms were clean but outlets, though available, not very convenient to the bed. Check in was pleasant, staff very friendly. Valet parking on site, there is a self-park option around the corner from the hotel.Hotel is also pretty conveniently located near major highways. About a 35-minute drive from DFW, give or take.Classy...beautiful place to stay! I had to be at a conference here for work. Definitely a must if you plan on staying in and around the downtown Ft. Worth area. Not far at all from Sundance Square, there's a Starbucks inside and a restaurant/wine bar area for chillin' purposes. Well kept, and excellent valet service as well. For sure keep it on your list!On the positive, awesome location and nice property. The food is good, especially in the sport bar. On the negative, the sour attitude of staff and management. Paper thin walls.In town for the 2015 ACMA's we stayed at the Omni. Nice rooms with everything you need, not a lot of flash but well appointed.The service from the staff was top notch. Always there for you. The restaurants and the bar were some of the best I had been to in any hotel.It is a wonderful spot. The good news is the bad news. It is a hub of activity which can make for equal fun and frustration. But who wants to stay in a hotel that doesn't have any people in it?The staff is exceptional and save for a car valet delay once every need was met before it was realized. I look forward to coming back soon.The hotel itself is just fine... The in-room dining however is an absolute DISASTER. Just ate one of the most disgusting breakfasts of my life. The smoked salmon is has clearly seen better days (does cheaper, crappier salmon exist? Nope, didn't think so.), the bagel wasn't even a bagel - it's a bizarre super crumbly white flour disaster in the apparent shape of a bagel. Where can you even find this crap? The tomatoes are seriously disgusting cardboard...and tomatoes are in season so honestly WTF. No onion, no capers...bizarre. Also, first time in the entire world I have seen a place put scrambled eggs on a bagels &amp; lox... I skipped the eggs. Wth Texas, must you make everything drenched in cheese, eggs and sausage? Totally disgusting, no wonder this state is so unhealthy.I'm a semi-regular at Omni properties and this one is as well-run as the next. The place is well-kept; the staff is quite friendly; and the rooms are ... roomy and well-adorned.The check-in desk folks, albeit friendly and professional, were notably slower than normal on my visit (there were only 3 of us in line). The housekeeping staff, on the other hand, deserves major kudos for taking care of every little detail. Bravo to these ladies and whomever is managing them.","Consistency is the accolade that I would like to highlight here. Specifically, on account of the many years that the Omni has hosted my work's conference--a conference with 800+ college students, 300+ children, and 100+ staff.Not much else to say, as I could go on for lists and pages and paragraphs regarding the hotel specifics... so I'll just say a few things.The Fort Worth location isn't an ""experience-based"" hotel. You won't find excessive gift shops, restaurants, and amenities. Downtown Fort Worth is a slower pace of commerce, thus the hotels more-so focus on execution and conferences. One restaurant, one bar, one entire floor dedicated to meetings and the like.The one warning I will give, on account of my own mistake: the valet took money from my vehicle on 3 different occasions. Yes, fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice, shame on me... the managers were able to jump back on their feet after my expressing frustration, which I really appreciated.The basic two bed room was comfortable, well decorated, and had a great view. The food from room service was great! Loved the location.We absolutely love this hotel  we refuse to stay anywhere else in Fort Worth. The valet is the best we've ever experienced. The front desk personal is the nicest and most helpful we've ever seen. The in room service doesn't get any better than it is here and the housekeeping is the best and they are so friendly. This is our home away from homeNever staying here again. We stayed here for two nights, Friday and Saturday. Thin walls. Every noise from hallways or next door could be heard. For the price we paid, there's no complimentary breakfast. Valet is chaos! Took us 20 minutes for us to get to the valet and then 20 minutes to receive our car. Just overall disappointed with this Omni location.Four stars-  Clean hotel- great rooms!  Nice bath, with a TUB suitable for a bath- yay!Really great fitness center, with pool and great outdoor landscaped area on third level, out of the fray.Starbucks in the lobby, with two restaurants on site.  The room service was great- 15 minutes.  Very fresh delicious salad- love the healthy options and you can't always get them. The hotel is located across from the convention center and within walking distance to many great restaurants an bars.  A really perfect hotel if there was a little more customer  service-  front desk was only marginally paying attention to me on check in, the bell services missed me entirely dragging my two bags through a revolving door awkwardly---- There was no one to speak to to ask for directions or recommendations, though the restaurant experience was quite good.We booked 2 rooms months ago for Parents Weekend at TCU.  They gouged us  at almost $400 a night but we were kind of caught between a rock and a hard place since every other hotel in town was sold out.  Three days before our trip, we had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances so I went online to cancel our reservation but they make it impossible so you have to either call them or email them to cancel.  I chose to email them and they responded that we were still going to be charged, even though I gave over 48 hours notice.  Apparently, I should have read the fine print.  Because of Parents Weekend, they conveniently changed their cancellation policy to 30 days notice.  We have stayed at this hotel once before and, while we are used to staying at luxury 5-star properties and villas, I thought the Omni was at least mediocre.  But after this experience, I will NEVER stay at another Omni property again, even if that means we have to drive to TCU from the Four Seasons in Dallas.We arrived late and were accommodated in a room with two queen beds and a very spacious bathroom. For one accustomed to sleeping in a king bed, it was a cramped experience. The next day, we expressed our preference of moving to a room with a king bed, and the staff was extremely accommodating. I was here for a conference. The conference room accommodations were great. The food was great. We love the third-floor gardens and the swimming pool. The valets didn't keep us waiting, and there was almost always someone present to open the front door for us. What began as a less-than-great experience turned out to be rather pleasant!Beautiful accommodations sufficiently equipped and comfortable. Top notch view and very clean from the lobby to the rooms. Comfortable beds and unusually lighted bathroom...to the positive!  You can valet or you can park in the less convenient convention center garage at the end of the block. Great artwork fills the halls and your room. Great location, friendly staff~ would ABSOLUTELY stay here on our next trip to Fort Worth.First impressions are important and thus far the Omni hasn't impressed.  My first stay here, for a business trip.  Front circle was deserted when I arrived, so I brought my heavy bag in through the revolving door myself.  Valet ran up from somewhere at the last minute and attempted to help me.. too little too late.  Front desk was efficient but curt; her greeting was ""can I see your ID and a credit card.""  I was focused on getting to the lobby level starbucks before they closed; then swung by the front desk again for directions to the room.  Either I misunderstood or he directed me towards the escalator - either way, I ended up wandering around the meetings floor for awhile before determining that I went the wrong way.  Front desk folks too busy chatting amongst themselves to notice that I was lost.  Went to onsite restaurant Whisky and Rye for a drink and a bite - mediocre at best (see separate review for that experience).  Thus far, not impressed Omni.Another good stay at the Omni, this time in Fort Worth. I decided to join their loyalty program because 1. It's free 2. Complimentary morning beverage served to your room and 3. Why not? After my first stay at an Omni in Austin back in December, I decided I was a fan of the brand. Omni is often at a lower price point than the Westin, yet is on the same level as far as quality and amenities go (with the exception of bathroom products. It bears mentioning again that Omni needs to form a partnership with a decent spa product line such as Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, Bliss, Red Flower etc). Other positives:-big hotel group accessibility with services and outstanding customer service similar to that of a smaller boutique hotel-spacious gym with a good amount of weights, machines and cardio equipment that overlooks the swank outdoor bar and pool area-rooms are big and if you're part of the loyalty program you can indicate location preference and they will actually honor it if they can-Starbucks in the lobby-bathrobes, nice sized bathroom, dresser and closet with hangers (if you've stayed at an Aloft which is at the same price point, you realize these are precious commodities)I haven't yet tried the restaurant or room service (other than that complimentary am beverage), but being that this will be my hotel of choice upon future stays in Ft. Worth, I will update once I have.The strange:There's a mini bar in the room, however it was completely cleared out as though someone wanted to save me from myself - that is, save me from indulging in late night Pringles &amp; Champagne binges...This place is the very well done. Beautifully designed. A great place for corporate meetings and just a walk across the street to the Convention Center. In the heart of downtown.This was my back up choice for my weekend stay. I really wanted to stay in the Omni Dallas Hotel but they were sold out. This hotel is so not on point like the Omni Dallas...I will try my best to never stay here again. The location of the hotel makes for a hard time with valet..someone almost backed into me. Then, the receptionist had the worst attitude, really snippy and not friendly at all. Seriously...you work in a freaking hot chick...check yourself! Then comes the room...so small, not well laid out. You cannot enjoy the view because the bed is opposite the view. When you lay in bed and look out your window, you look at the building. There is no little seating area like at the Omni Dallas...the bathroom had a little teaspoon tub(where you put a teaspoon of water in it, you will flood the tub) and no tv in the mirror! And this was a premier room that I had...if this was premier I would hate to see the regular one. The room service was great...and that's the reason it got 2 stars and not 1!The room itself was very beautiful but I was appalled at the service. We ordered room service, three of us ordered the steak meal which was $35 and I expected it to be very delicious for that price. When we got it I ordered medium mine came out rare and so did my friends not to mention it was already cold and flavorless. When I called them back they said it would take an additional 2 hrs before they could refire our steaks. Are you joking!?! THEN when I'm checking out I told them my experience and all I got was a ""oh I'm so sorry....well! Have a good day!"" I had to get a manager who said she can comp one of the steaks but not all of them. Excuse me!? I'm not trying to get out of here cheap I mean the bar tab alone was over $300 for overpriced mediocre drinks but Really!? The pool closes early which is ridiculous when you're paying $250 for a room and have to leave the pool at 10 pm...on a weekend!Nice hotel in the heart of Fort Worth. They have an impressive lobby with a restaurant, Starbucks, and quality bar that prides itself in its whiskey selection. The convention center is right across the street and there's plenty to do within walking distance. Our room was well equipped and a decent size. The one complaint I had, and this is probably a city-wide problem, was the tap water. It tasted and smelled like dirt, which was particularly noticeable in the shower. It's hard to get clean when it smells like you're bathing in mud. What's with that?They've got a great outdoor bar that sits right next to the pool, which is a big bonus. However the pool is way too small (I guess I have two complaints). People were crammed in everywhere, and it wasn't even that hot out. Want a chair? Better get ready to swoop the second someone stands up! However there were some friendly attendants that handed out water and ice cold washcloths. That was appreciated.Overall we had a quality stay that was worth the price.In a few short words: this place is overpriced for what you get, but decent nonetheless. PROS:- Nice location in downtown Ft. Worth. Across the street from the Convention Center and a 15-20 minute walk from all the happening spots on Houston Street. - Decent pool area on the 3rd floor. Salt water. Feels secluded. Nice full bar and plenty of sunshine. - Great showers in the room, comfortable (firm) bed. CONS:- Rates are way too high for what you get. - The photos of the suite we reserved weren't at all like the room we actually received. - Toiletries provided are junk (and no body wash). Otherwise:- $15/night self parking in public parking garage one block from hotelBeing a frequent traveler who stays in hotels a lot, I can't say I'd choose this property again.Our daughter got married at the Omni this past July. We held both ceremony and reception in sections of the Texas Ballroom. During the planning process, I received quick responses to my questions and concerns. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Kelly Williams, the catering director, took all items I brought for additional decor and took care of placing them where I wanted them to go. Other than a quick 15 minute chat the day of the wedding, I was able to spend all my time with my daughter and friends enjoying the ""getting ready"" process. Kelly had all the gifts and cards taken to our room after the ceremony, and our room was straightened and organized while we were at the reception. Kelly even helped us with the crazy-hard bustle on my daughter's dress. The hotel took care of all set up, clean up and the cake cutting. There were even staffers downstairs directing guests to the ballrooms. Also, my daughter and her new hubby were given a complimentary suite and room service on the wedding night! Highly recommend this hotel, and as a bonus, it is directly across the street from the Ft Worth Water Gardens which is a perfect picture spot!If I could do half stars, I'd bump this up to 4.5! I recently stayed at this hotel for work and it was a great experience. The lobby is large and inviting and the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic. Clean, comfortable, and as a Midwestern gal, I kind of loved the Texas decor and art. The walls were a bit thin and I could hear pretty much any conversation out in the hallway. It's also right downtown, so you can easily hear the traffic in the morning. The comfortable bed and pillows, and the fact that the curtains actually kept the room 100% dark makes up for that, though. The valet parking was also quick and convenient. We were in and out a few times each day during our stay, and we never really had to wait very long for our cars. My room and the Starbucks in the lobby are pretty much the only parts of the hotel that I spent time since I was off-site for work during this trip. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity!So sad to cancel reservations here! Management doesn't respond or take responsibility for any problems.Stayed on a Saturday night as my girlfriend had a black tie event for her work in the Ballroom that evening.Stayed in #1110, upper floor king, looking east toward Arlington. Paid $159 which was a discounted rate tied to the eventThe goodWell appointed roomGreat shower and bathroomPrompt room serviceThe badPaper thin walls, could hear doors slamming, people walking in hallways, neighbors talking all night. Valet is $25 per night and a cluster, no way to call ahead for your car, 15-30 minute waitBanquet food just average at best, staff cleaning up before event was over, sour attitudes of staffI have had better, it really is a great hotel room but the noise level, the valet and blah banquet service tells me there is much betterI stay here two to three times a year for work events and I have to say I'm never really overly impressed. Upon checking in I never seem to get anyone who's very friendly. The last time I came in I actually stood around while a few employees had a conversation together. I nicely tried to wave hello in hopes that one would come over and help. One of the women saw me, continued her conversation then walked over about two minutes later and asked if I needed something. Yes please, Id like to get in to my room!Its also a pain that there is no self park unless you're a guest. I have friends that live in FTW. When they come to meet me for a drink at the bar or grab dinner at the restaurant they're forced to pay $25 to valet. Your only other option is to drive in circles around the building in hopes that someone will move from one of the 6 street parking spots. The rooms are nice but nothing overly amazing. The rooms aren't very sound proof. If your neighbors talk loud enough you can hear them. You can also hear everyone's movements in the hallway. If you're a light sleeper beware. There is a train that you'll hear every few hours.On a lighter note, the restaurant and bar areas are decorated beautifully. As expected, prices are a bit high, but you're paying for the Omni experience. There's definitely other restaurants I would suggest visiting first (Reata, Lonesome Dove, Grace, etc). Let the hotel restaurant be your fall back option. Over all this is an ok hotel. Its convenient to the convention center if you have an event to attend there.","Traveling with a one year old for husbands work. No hot water. Maintenance man was sent up to fix it and told us we had to leave it running for thirty minutes. A few hours later still no hot water. We called and asked to be moved to a new room. After we get all our things packed and ready for the bellman they call back and inform us the whole hotel has no hot water....  This is now 9pm and my daughter is exhausted. We ended up giving her a sponge bath in the sink, poor baby. I thought we might be offered something to make up for the inconvenience, but all we were was ignored, no apology!I would not stay here again, and definitely not with my daughter.It started out great w/ great customer service, but then I got a sour taste in my mouth. When you first arrive you are taken in w/ the nice lobby area &amp; friendly faces. The room is great, the bed is soft &amp; comfy. Nice look &amp; feel. As a rewards member you get 2 drinks of your choice per day. Once arriving in my room there were 2 bottles of water already waiting for me. Since I didn't get a card to fill out what time I wanted my drinks, I figured that housekeeping would replace it each day. Also as a rewards member you get free wifi, nothing super fast, but it's free to surf &amp; check emails. It was spotty to say the least as it would cut out here &amp; there. When it would work it would take forever to load pages. Upon returning to my room I noticed that the 2 bottles had not been replenished as I thought. I called down to inform the staff that I was a member &amp; I thought I should be getting drinks. They brought some up. The next day it was more of the same. It wasn't until my 4th day out of the 6 nights I was staying there did it finally get replenished on a daily basis. This bothered me since it states on the website what the members get. The gym is ALOT better than any other hotel gym I've been to. It's not stuffy, plenty of equipment &amp; free weights. AND it's spacious! They have an outside pool as well. There's a Starbucks in the lobby. Along w/ a couple places to eat as well. Minutes away from Sundance Square where there are tons of places to eat.Beautiful hotel In a great location.    The hotel is right next to the convention center.   The rooms are nicely decorated and clean.  The staff is fantastic.  Check in was fast, rooms were cleaned early and daily turn  down.   If you are an omni reward member, you get two drinks a day delivered to your room (coffee, tea or juice).  Or you can go to the Starbucks in the hotel and order the same.  Restaurants in the hotel are good and reasonably priced. The hotel is a little pricey but worth it.Thanks to the wide disparity between taking a flight from HSV to DFW at 6am vs 9am (a $600 swing), I took that dreadful 6am ride and arrived at the Omni at 8am on a Wednesday morning. Any traveler will tell you to expect a room to be made available by noon at the earliest with a 3:00pm check-in much more likely.I went right to the front desk and told them I was painfully early and would just ramble around downtown Ft Worth until my room was ready. The nice girl at the desk took all my info and told me she'd call when I could come get a key.No sooner had I finished my tall mocha at the Starbucks 100ft from the front desk than my phone rang. Yep, room was ready. That might be an isolated thing, and it would be made very unlikely were it a full hotel, but it was worth writing about.To me, this is an example of the kind of service you expect from a premier property like the Omni. Well done everyone. 4 stars.I have mixed reviews for the Omni Fort Worth.  In preface to my comments, I should note that we stayed at the Omni in downtown Dallas just a few weeks prior, so my opinion is somewhat influenced by the comparison of the two.Regarding the appearance of the hotel itself, it was great.  Excellent location in Fort Worth, within easy walking distance of Sundance Square, and just a short drive to the Stockyards.  The lobby was beautiful, and check-in was a breeze.  The staff was super-friendly.  Our room was lovely and perfectly clean.  Compared to the downtown Dallas Omni, I would have to say I liked the room a little better at the Dallas Omni - but that is simply personal preference for the decor and city view.  The shower at the Fort Worth Omni was FABULOUS.  Excellent water pressure, and I could have stayed in the shower forever!  The breakfast buffet at the Omni was also excellent.  Well-prepared, and everything was hot and fresh.  Now on to my only complaints:First, the pool.  And this is the same complaint I have about the Dallas Omni.  The pool is WAAAAY  too small for the hotel size.  It was impossible to get a chair to put our towels on, and in the pool we felt like we were elbow to elbow with other patrons.  Second, there was one exceptionally rowdy patron who was ruining a relaxing afternoon for everyone.  Management was definitely aware of the situation......the pool manager was standing nearby....but did nothing about it.  Second complaint:  the bar at the pool.  This could be a GREAT place to hang out and enjoy a drink.  However the bar was grossly understaffed for a weekend.   I waited about 20 minutes to get a margarita.  We have up after one drink and went back to our room. All in all a nice hotel.   But given the choice between the Dallas location and Fort Worth location I would choose the Dallas hotel every time.I did not stay here but attended a conference here and was so impressed. Staff,food, and facilities were exceptional.Stayed here for a professional conference that was being hosted onsite.  As my company picked up the tab, my review is based more on experience and less on value (I normally don't treat myself to accommodations this nice or pricey).Beautiful place and clean throughout.  Staff was very friendly and attentive from doormen to front desk staff.  Have valet parking, but did not take advantage.  Tip:  If you self-park, you will be parking at convention center parking and walking block and a half.  You will be given a badge at check-in to swipe in and out of garage.  Do not use the parking garage ticket or else you will be double paying!  This was one thing that was not explained well.Room with parking came out to $267 / night (and that apparently was the conference discounted price!).  I would never pay that much myself for a room, but would say you get your monies worth for the experience.  If weather is bad, they have 4-5 dining options on-site as well that run the gamut from bar scene, wine scene, steak house.  Last tip:  If you do decide to reserve a room, make sure you sign up for their preferred guest program.  Free to join and it gets you the wifi for free along with some other nice perks.  Saved me (or my company) $40 in wifi charges.We came to the omni for just one night and it was extremely crowded, our rooms were not ready and the pool was too crowded where you couldn't get a seat or much room in the pool to move around. We were very disappointed with the hotel and service-but it didn't help that there was a big crowd.I recently booked a night for my girlfriends 21st birthday and our stay was perfect. This hotel is beautiful, and accommodated every one of our needs. Jesse (the concierge) was incredibly helpful with anything we needed assistance with (shuttle service, directions, and even small birthday gifts from the hotel). The Whiskey and rye bar was also a great experience. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this hotel and will definitely return in the future!This is not my first time to stay at the Omni Fort Worth because RE/MAX holds conferences here every couple of years.  This is a gorgeous hotel, complete with a wine bar, sports bar, steakhouse, restaurant, and spa.  The rooms are nicely appointed and on my previous visit, I slept like a baby.  HOWEVER, on this stay, they put me on floor 5 and there is a train station a block or so over, so basically every hour on the hour I was awoken by the sound of a train.  Not what I needed after driving 5 hours to get there earlier that day and then driving 5 hours to get home the next.  I complained to the front desk and basically all she could do was comp breakfast for me.  Not really what I was looking for.  After completing a survey that was emailed to me though, in which I complained about the stupid train, the Omni Fort Worth made it right, so they are getting 4 stars.The other complaint I forgot to mention is that, upon arrival, I had to unload my own bags ... the valet didn't bother because he was too distracted talking to a co-worker.  They made up for this upon departure though my having my car to me very quickly.I have only eaten at the breakfast buffet, so I do not know if anything else is good there and I only partake of the omelette station.Service in the sports bar is slow, but they made me a killer tea w/vodka ... those could really do some damage.Wine bar has a nice selection, but I opted for a cocktail there instead.Overall, this is an excellent place to stay with lots of nice amenities and service that is typically very good.  I obviously will be back, since RE/MAX will hold another event there in the future I'm sure.We often stay at this Omni when we want a weekend in Fort Worth and have noticed that the customer service, unfortunately, has been steadily decreasing over the last six months. Sometimes it's just really busy - which is understandable - in a big hotel like that sometimes you are 1 in a thousand guests.....but when the staff treats you like 1 in a thousand it makes for a much less enjoyable experience. On top of that, be sure you watch the Best Rate Guarantee they offer online. We usually book through the Omni website and for an upcoming stay they actually lowered their website price by 50.00 for the exact same room we had already booked. When I contacted them to have the Best Rate Guarantee honored, they said it only works if you find the better rate through another company's website....which seemed totally ridiculous. All in all, it's a nice hotel and the location is great in Fort Worth, just don't expect to be treated well - from hotel staff to corporate guest relations it's below par. It's surprising since they just bought Barton Creek in Austin - you'd think they would be all about wanting people to like the brand more, but the opposite seems to be true.I recently stayed here for a work event, and I can't wait to come back!The room was incredible. Clean, lovely, spacious. The in-room climate control is almost silent, so I asked the front desk for a floor fan for the noise; they ran one up immediately. The bathroom is luxurious--beautiful shower, fluffy towels, good lighting (for makeup application!). The meeting areas were easy to navigate, and our concierge provided refreshments and other materials that made the long conferences enjoyable. We visited Whiskey and Rye and the Wine Thief, each having a unique atmosphere and some impressive beverage selections. Our final night, we had a private event at Bob's Steak House. The food and service was absolutely top notch. There's also a Starbucks in the hotel itself--I certainly appreciated this feature (conferences? caffeine, please). Omni's location couldn't be better, especially if you're one of the many needing to visit the nearby convention center. There are also countless dining options within walking distance if you'd like to venture from the hotel. But with its great customer service and comfortable accommodations, you probably won't want to!I was pretty impressed with this place! It has a classic Texan feel while maintaining a luxurious atmosphere. The restaurant inside has gotten mixed reviews and I have heard from the rest of the people in my party not to go there. The staff of the Omni are exceptional and have been extremely hospitable. Whether it's the valet rushing to get your car or the staff at the hotel pool asking to make your stay better, I have been thoroughly impressed. Perhaps the greatest part if the hotel is the location which has an easy way to exit with your vehicle and rentable bikes across the street! The gym is pretty nice too and I was able to go for a nice jog easily without waiting on their treadmills.To say I was disappointed with the treatment I received while at the Omni Hotel would be the understatement of the year.  From the moment we checked in, we were greeted by rude staff (except the three at the Starbucks- they were wonderful and helpful!) , and it only got worse from there.A couple of us had chosen to stay here because of its upscale ambiance that was promised to us by many who had stayed here before us.  It was my bachelorette party weekend and we wanted a classy vibe from beginning to end.  Honestly, we were treated with more class at 'The Library', a downtown bar, than we were at this hotel.  Those at the check in desk were slow, short and very nearing rude- but the real gem came when we ordered room service.We called room service when we arrived back to the hotel room around 3:00 AM.  When I attempted to call back at 3:50 AM to check on where our food was, my call was not answered.  I tried again immediately after and was not answered again.  Finally, I called the front desk who.  The attendant at the front desk was not interested in hearing what I had to say- as soon as the words 'Room Service' were out of my mouth, she directed my call to them.  I didn't even get to finish my sentence.  When my call was *finally* picked up by the kitchen, and I asked why our food hadn't yet arrived after an hour of waiting I was told that we had absolutely NOT been waiting an hour and that we were NOT the only people at the hotel and we would have to wait- our order would be up within 10 minutes.  I couldn't believe the way I was spoken to.  We waited another ten minutes- the amount of time she quoted us, and then I called back.  Same song and dance- no one answered when I called room service directly, called front desk, finally was patched through and spoke with the angry lady again.  She said our food would be there within five minutes.  So, here we are waiting, it's been an hour and five minutes since we ordered (this was not a complex order- it was three orders of french fries, an order of wings and an order of queso.)  I decided I was going to call the manager and complain.  I pick up the phone, had to *again* deal with the very rude lady at the front desk, and was able to get ahold of the manager, Shawn.  As I was voicing my complaints to Shawn, our food FINALLY arrived.  I told him as much, and we got off the phone.Wouldn't you know it... the food was ice cold.  The queso was a congealed mess, the wings looked like they had been sitting under a heating lamp for hours, and the fries were dry and stale.  Surely, it couldn't have gotten in that shape on a five minute walk from the kitchen to our room- *especially* when it was covered.I immediately picked up the phone and spoke with Shawn again.  I told him the queso was a congealed mess, the wings were cold and the fries were 'barely edible'.  I told him there was no way we were paying for this and I told him exactly how dissatisfied I was.  He stated he would go talk to the cook and see what he could do.  4:30 AM comes and goes and Shawn calls me back to tell me that the cook will cook more immediately and bring them up- it would be another 15 minutes.  Having seen how 'quickly' this kitchen works already, I declined, and told him I only wanted a credit, I didn't wish to stay up until 6:00 AM trying to get a late night snack.  He assured me we wouldn't be billed and we hung up the phone.The next morning, my friends bill, who was paying for the room as a gift,  does not include the charges for room service.  We are still dissatisfied, but this takes away the sting a bit.  Lo and behold, She checks her account with her bank and the charge to my credit card was higher than the bill was for.  She called the hotel to find out what the extra charge was for... and they billed her for the french fries!  Because I had stated on the phone that they were 'edible' they took that to mean that it was okay to charge me for frozen french fries!!  She immediately called to have the charge removed and she has been getting the run around all day.  She never received a call back from the manager, nothing.  They twisted my words so that they could nickel and dime her over $19.00.Needless to say, this is the most dissatisfied I have been with a hotel in my entire life.  I won't be staying here at any time in the future.  If you're a fan of friendly service and hot food, I recommend you take your business elsewhere too.It's hard to beat the Omni for events in Fort Worth. I've stayed here, and I've also enjoyed Whiskey &amp; Rye for frivolity. The staff is professional and courteous; the food is tasty and diverse; and the location is extremely convenient. Valet parking can be a pain if there is an event going on, but that's about the only down side.The room service at this hotel is horrible. They give misleading information and their food is not good. Very disappointed and will not stay here again.Celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary and really loved the hotel experience. Service was excellent and they even surprised us with a bottle of champaign and chocolate covered strawberries!Great room with a view. Room was very clean. Hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. Valet parking was fast and with little wait time. My room didn't have a microwave other than that I would definitely stay and recommend this hotel again.Girls weekend out! Had a great time! The hotel car took us to meet the horse drawn carriage and the ride though downtown was awesome! The hotel driver even gave us his number in case he needed to come pick us up afterwards! The live music in the bar was good and the wait staff was friendly and quick ! We will definitely be come back!Wow! Was just here for 3 days for the 2012 Cyberstar Summit and can't say enough good about this hotel. Following the advice of another attendee, I enrolled in the Omni Loyalty program prior to reserving my room. This entitled me to a lot of freebies including 2 items pressed for free, one pair of shoes shined at no charge, 2 robes in the room, free wi-fi, 2 complimentary bottles of water each day, plus 2 complimentary drinks of our choice delivered by room service each morning (juice, tea, etc). On the second night of my stay I ordered a croissant with the complimentary juice. Was extremely impressed when a lovely tray was delivered with the juice, 2 croissants, jams, butter, and a pot of freshly brewed coffee, all for $2.82! (Croissant was $2 + tax). It seems this hotel goes above &amp; beyond (2 complimentary apples were delivered w/the complimentary juice the 1st day) and it really made me want to stay here again.The hotel itself is beautiful. Had a quick lunch in the bar/restaurant the 1st day and a steak dinner at Bob's the 2nd night. Both meals were delicious and the service was outstanding (besides providing great table service for such a large group, separate checks for a party of 40+ was ""no problem""). I also appreciated the inviting lobby with fireplace, the spacious &amp; well appointed rooms, the tasteful artwork throughout, and the available  fitness &amp; business centers. All this, combined with the incredible service and fabulous attitude of every employee I interacted with, truly merit a 5+ star rating!","3.5 stars.I enjoyed our stay at the Omni Fort Worth.  After staying at the Aloft in Austin, coming here felt we were commoners being elevated to royalty. The staff at the Omni were very accommodating and put our group into two adjoining rooms, which made getting ready in the morning/evening much more fun.  The rooms were spacious and well appointed... about half of the square footage was devoted to a monstrous bathroom.  We didn't really spend too much time in the rooms-- only a few hours for a quick nap once we arrived in Fort Worth, and then the few hours sleeping through the night.JF and I decided to attend the free yoga session provided by Omni FW on weekends.  We wandered around for a while looking for the location, and were directed to a conference room (the pool area was being renovated) by a helpful spa employee.  Unfortunately, the yoga instructor NEVER SHOWED (even after a few assurances by the hotel staff), which was a total downer!  I hate when people renege on their promises.OVERALL: an unremarkable stay; the higher rating is biased due to an average to slightly-below-average stay the few days before at the Aloft in Austin. PS - Parking will cost you $25/day if you valet; $15/day if you self park.  We chose to self park, and were directed to the large convention center parking structure about a block away.  Make sure you take you parking ticket to the Omni front desk, where they will switch it out with a hotel version so that you have in-and-out privileges.Top Notch Hotel!!! We've also stayed at their Dallas, and Nashville locations, and the Omni has become our favorite hotel! Hotel is gorgeous, and the rooms are off the charts! Kudos!!!I've got a son who goes to TCU so I've had a chance to stay at several places and I have to say this place has it all. Everything you need is here. And it's reasonably priced. I see absolutely no place to stay anywhere else.Smiley face and a starAwesome hotel.  We took advantage of a winter sale and went on ""vacation"" 10min from our house.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Gorgeous views from our room.  Free champagne and chocolates in room because I mentioned it was first time out of house as a couple for several months.  Water gardens are steps away and although I've lived here for over 15 years I've overlooked this gem of a park until today.Was here for 3 nights/4 days for a work conference, and definitely left impressed.3 year old facilities were GORGEOUS and seemed new still. I had a king room with a beautiful large shower in the bathroom (friends who stayed in double queen rooms had lame tub showers). Anytime I needed anything (room service) the staff was quick to respond. One time they overcharged me on my beer, so when I mentioned it the next time I placed an order, they sent a couple free beers as an apology. Quality customer service!!! If you are part of their fancy shmancy frequent stayer club thingy (it's free), you get free coffee and orange juice in the morning - delivered at whatever time you want. Classy. The conference facilities were adequate - nothing fancy. Our water pitchers were always full, the catered meals were delicious, they brought more chairs in when we needed them... blah blah blah.One night had a lovely couple drinks out at the pool bar with friends. Nice, chill, atmosphere. If I'm ever back in Ft Worth, I hope it's at this great hotel!!!!!!!!!Simply put; from the valet parking, to reception, to friendliest staff ever, to an amazing and cozy room, to the onsite Starbucks, this Hotel is among the best we've ever stayed in. We chose this resort to celebrate our 10th anniversary and we are so glad that we picked this place. Walking distance from family friendly night life. You don't need to leave this place for nothing. It includes all the services you can imagine. Had breakfast at the cast iron and our experience was unforgettable. Food was delicious and staff was incredibly kind. Would've loved to experience their spa but they were booked for the day. We will definitely recommend this resort for your stay in Fort Worth. Simply one of the best hotel experiences. No negatives whatsoever.What a nice luxury hotel in a great area! The hotel room was very nice and comfortable. Great facilities in the hotel such as a shop, Starbucks,  2 bars and a restaraunt. The bars were great and provided a great place to conversate and watch football. Nice spacious lobby and frindly hotel staff. The courtousy driver was a great knowledge of stuff to do in the area and responsive to our requirements to come and go.The area is great, right across from the convention center, half a mile from the newer part of Ft Worth and a 10 minute trip to the historic part. A great area to be in!Ohhhh, luxury! This hotel remained in a constant hustle and bustle; they have the system down to get people in and out without a hitch. From weddings, to college football fans, to conference goers, this hotel accommodated us all!The lobby is dimly lit for a warm and intimate arrival. There was a fancy wine bar on one end and a sports bar/tavern on the other side, with an upscale restaurant in the middle. They even had a mini museum indoors too. For you coffee lovers, there is a full Starbucks in the lobby too!The bedrooms were luxurious and spacious. The turndown service was nice...although their tv station/music was very outdated, but seemed to fit the Ft. Worth/western theme nicely. They have an ottoman that was covered in faux cowhide that was a bit creepy, but overall the decor was nice.I like! This newish hotel offered some great rates and turned into home for a few days this past week. I found the staff, the rooms, the dinning choices, everything to be in good shape and more than a great value! Actually, the bellmen and management were top notch, better than most places that I stay . SO- I checked in, checked out my room, and all was good. High floor (my preference), King bed (non negotiable because I like to sleep sideways on them- a benefit of being short), and large bathroom. The room itself was in good repair- a bonus, large enough for my needs (when you travel to NYC 15 plus times a year, you do not get too picky on this issue), nicely fitted, and- if you like to watch yourself sleep or whatever- a HUGE mirror is posted directly next to the bed. I have to say, I felt kind of bad for the cleaning crew. The bathrooms feature these wonderful showers with HUGE GLASS walls. I kept thinking about what a PITA it would be to clean! BUT- they came through, my shower walls sparkled every day. (My mother would have kept a squeegee in the shower just so you could wipe it down at the time- but she is a bit freaky that way.) Free wifi and free coffee and diet coke in the AM (just for being a member- nice) was a definite plus! I wish all of my hotel stays were this posh/clean/friendly. I did not have a chance to check out the pool/spa/anything fun- but- hey, for my work life, this was great!Charlie Short greeted us with so much warmth and class. Everyone was so personable and treated us beyond our expectations. They did so many extra things to make us feel special. This was the best hotel I have ever stayed at. LOVE LOVE LOVED it. Thank you Charlie for the complimentary bottle of wine for our 20th Anniversary. You are the best!Great service, great employees, great rooms. So impressed with the Omni. The valet may be a little pricey ($20 /day) but your car is safe and you don't have to walk 2 blocks to get it in Texas heat. BUT, the valet will not be able to find your keys ever and you'll have to look for yourself.The facilities were superb. I went to a reception there and to Bob's on the ground floor of the hotel. Both, were impeccable. The food was delicious at the reception and out of this world at Bob's.Stands to reason that I'll likely never be able to encapsulate this hotel for all comers from all corners...but for the sake of the way the pyrotechnics explode into a summer sky here when the weather turns temperate, and, well, the fact that I wandered up just enough to staple myself onto the pool bar, well, I'd be remiss not to share at least a little of the general juju that prevails when you catch the Omni from a choice angle among its many preferred ones, and shake it 'til an experience comes out.Ultimately I popped in on a mission with plenty of wiggle room for misunderstanding: they host a legit pool party upstairs, and on a day that posed the harmonic convergence of Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucky Derby, how wrong could you possibly go by staking your claim on a barstool at a genuinely lofty spot in downtown, where they understood the value of a flatscreen but seldom to the point where it interfered with their blended cocktail. There was breeze, and should you make your way to the The Water Horse, chances are you'll find yourself just ducky with where they hang their hat. It's a pool bar, but they're not suctioning flunkies in: in fact, you can make the argument that when one rails against the dyling of the light, shouldn't he or she do it where the sky remains infiinite? That part's still possible and we'll see. In the mean time, new friends and some good brews to boot.My wife and I were in Ft. Worth last weekend for the Cowboys Classic college football game &amp; stayed at the Omni.  In addition to the football game, we also used the occasion to celebrate my wife's birthday.  My situation was a little different however.......I had broken my foot previous to the trip, so arrived in a wheelchair and crutches.  And how did the Omni accommodate us?  They hit a big time grand slam.......tremendous customer service from the get go, starting with valet and front desk check-in, to make absolutely sure we were taken care of.  The Concierge Mgr, Stephen, went above &amp; beyond the call of duty to not only make sure our room was set up with birthday flowers and chocolate, but also arranged to have a stool placed in the shower to help out with the broken foot.  We also enjoyed the Whiskey &amp; Rye Bar inside the hotel and turned out to be a great place to enjoy local craft beer and watch college football.If you're planning to be in the Ft. Worth area and looking for a great hotel, look no further than the Omni.........I'm sold!Smells like Soap Happiness Everywhere...and it is pretty...nice staff...great decor.I have stayed at this Omni twice now in the last 3 years and I love it!  The beds are amazingly comfortable as are the pillows, the rooms are always clean and smell great.  The check-in and check-out process is smooth along with valet.  Room service is top notch as is the Cast Iron restaurant.  This past stay we had a great view of the city.  I love Omni and feel like I'm at home when I stay here.Superior quality rooms, excellent on-site dining options and management that truly cares about their guests! Best hotel in Fort Worth!The best hotel in Fort Worth.   One of my favorite hotels in the US.I come to Fort Worth at least once a month and this is my go to place to stay.   They have fantastic service, a nice gym, reasonable room rates, and a great preferred guest program.  Rooms are large, clean, and new.We checked in on 7/3 for a two night stay.  The check in was easy and they gave our 2 year old son a toy.  They also told us there was a free, tip not included, car service for us to use.The next morning, we asked about the car service.  They said we could not use it because they did not have a car seat.  It would have been nice if they had said that while they were telling us about it knowing we had a small child with us.We returned to the hotel at 11pm on July 4 and were locked out of our room.  We called the front desk and someone came up to let us in.  When we got in the room, the maid service had not been there.  The front desk called us and told us we had just checked in that day - which obviously we had not.  They offered to send a maid, but at this point we just wanted to get in bed.  They did give us complimentary breakfast for the next morning.We checked out with no issues.  However, today I am reconciling credit card bills and there is a random charge on my card.  I called the hotel, and they are charging us additional money over what we already pre-paid for the stay because ""Hotwire did not give us enough money"".  They are researching it, but having this happen on top of everything else is just icing on the cake for me.  I will definitely think twice before staying at the Omni again.A good time spoiled by incompetent, unapologetic morons at the valet. Pros: Well decorated hotel, subtly blending what you'd expect from Ft. Worth flare with Omni elegance. Nice restaurants and bars attached. Good walking proximity to local restaurants and night life. Cons: 1) Walls are paper-thin. I literally woke up 20 times with random bumps and creaks. It's hard to blame a hotel for loud, drunk guests staggering through the halls at 2:00 a.m., but when you're brushing your teeth the next morning and are able to eaves drop on the people in the adjacent room as though you were separated by a Japanese rice paper screen, there's a problem. 2) The valet was pathetic. they forgot to put a tag on our keys and we proceeded to sit for 30+ minutes, all the while dealing with their insistence that someone had the keys and was on his/her way. Finally they asked us to find our keys on the peg board, which we found in a few seconds. No apologies. 3) The pool is an afterthought. Small and borderline useless, plus the western winds of North Texas gust at around 40 mph, which isn't exactly fun.Clean rooms with nice amenities.  I would definitely stay here again!","Stayed at the Omni Fort Worth about a week after it opened. The hotel's grand opening was earlier than it should have been--the pool area was unfinished and some of the room's fixtures seem to have been constructed in a hurry. (Speaking of the pool, it is TINY. We walked all the way up and down the third floor before we finally spotted the pool, which was dark and about the size of a bathroom.) The rooms are otherwise very nice and spacious. One thing that stood out was the empty minibars--instead of being full of beverages that you can use as you please, you call down to the desk and request that it be filled with whatever you want to order. It seems to be a mix of room service and just having a minifridge in the room. We just drove out and bought our own drinks. Valet parking fees are high, but we ended up finding free meters within a block or two. We came out to visit with friends and relax, so we didn't do much sight seeing in Fort Worth, but the water gardens across the street were pretty entertaining. The downtown area is very cute. The staff was wonderful--absolutely everyone we encountered greeted us and were very helpful. Now that the hotel's been open a few months and gotten adjusted, I wouldn't mind staying again. I'd recommend it for a quiet getaway.Not happy with Omni FW Hotel right now! A guest &amp; I transferred reservation over phone  last Sat 3/22, put room in my name &amp; my credit card--removed her completely from reservation for 4/3-4/7/14. When I called Omni to cancel reservation yesterday afternoon, as another guest &amp; I are combining rooms, they had no record of me, still had it in prior guest's name with her card so they wouldn't talk to me or let me cancel. When she called to cancel they told her they are charging her one night penalty because we missed 12 pm deadline, which I knew nothing about as they never emailed my confirmation. If any of you have booked, canceled or transferred rooms at Omni--double check &amp; make sure you get email confirmation. Seriously how much money are we bringing Omni with our WV Travel Agent convention of 10,000 guests &amp; they do this!? Not to mention some of us have clients booked here for Final Four &amp; College BB finals next month &amp; we're tempted to pull our reservations &amp; never book at this hotel again! So much for their customer service guarantee!Wife was here for a convention, I picked her up from motel to move to a Sheridan for a night in Dallas before swinging onto our vacation.   I travel a lot - about 14 weeks a year, I'm partial to Sheridan &amp; Westin because of the MUCH better fitness facilities &amp; healthier dining options. The Omni was ""ok"".. but for the $300 / or so a night, definitely not worth it... I would never buy it, but it was convenient for her needs this time.  I'll stay at the Westin anytime instead.Staff was mediocre at best, mostly incompetent at the lobby desk and sometimes rude. We didn't get a receipt when checking out, and... staff didn't seem to think anything of it.   Wife called the 800-number to get a folio.   Really, really unprofessional.After the Omni, we stayed at the Sheraton on Canal Street in New Orleans.   Over-the-Top service, over-the-top luxury.I was really excited about coming to this hotel. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected.I came here for a 3day/2night business conference a couple weeks ago.  This hotel is beautiful. From the hotel rooms to the ballrooms, it's very nice. One thing about this hotel is the parking is NOT connected to the hotel. No big deal, I was going to get valet anyways. I came to the hotel looking a little frumpy, since I was planning on carrying several boxes from my car to the ballroom (thankfully the employees of the hotel did it all for me). When I came down later in the evening to get my car, valet made it a point to tell me how nice I looked in my business suit. That's always nice.So, starting my very stressful 3 day business trip I decided to check in and take a quick shower. While I was in the shower I noticed something on the shower floor, a contact! A used one no doubt. That was pretty gross but I decided I would just ask the hotel to clean the shower when they do room service. After looking around the room I noticed a half empty water bottle and some food in the mini refrigerator. Something else to let room service know about. That evening I had an opening reception to get to and forgot all about the cleanliness of my room. When I came back and checked my room, they had cleaned it for me and took the throw pillows off of my bed and pulled the sheets down.Day 2 of my experience at the Omni hotel. I was on a time crunch and trying to get some lunch before I had to get back to work. I went down to get my car from valet and was told it would a few minutes, okay no problem. 15 minutes later I finally went and asked what was taking so long?? I was told they couldn't find my car! What?? No apologies from the lady, just that they were looking. Okay. So I sat back down and 10 minutes passes and the supervisor came up to me and explained that they have 3 parking garages and he has employees in every one looking for my vehicle. FINALLY 30 minutes later my car arrives and I am stuck having to go back to work hungry since this ordeal took so long. To make it up to me, the supervisor gave me a free night of valet. All in all, the appearance of the hotel is very nice, the staff is friendly, but they are lacking in service. Room service, valet service. These are 2 major things I look for in a hotel. On a last note, once I was home and unpacking my things what do I find on my shampoo bottle??? That damn contact! Disgusting.Hotel is nice and elegant. Rooms are standard but nothing fancy. Staff s nice but I had trouble with my room keys, not once but twice. Cell phone service blows while in the hotel along with Internet service. There are bars and restaurants at walking distance. I'm not that impressed.The beds, staff, ambience and decor is amazing!Beautiful, new hotel in Ft. Worth. Right across from the convention center - which makes it a convention hotel. Check-in smooth, valets on top of it.  Sign up for the rewards program before you arrive which gives you free wi-fi in your room, corner room (if you want it), 2 free launderings, turn down service and free coffee or tea delivered each morning.The free morning coffee and wifi was a plus. The delivery for the chosen time slot got slow as the hotel booked up. The room was very nice, bathroom beautiful. Bed, sleepable!Hotel bar was very cool with decent live music and treated my group well.....we were there for a week, they got used to us.  Restaurant offers a nice Sunday Brunch.  Be sure to read your hotel bill before checking out. I was charged for valet parking for 2 nights - did not even have a car.  Staff took it off at check out without me having to yell, but I think its bad to be asked ""did you have a car"" what happened to honesty?  Starbucks in hotel lobby...but lines got long when the hotel was full and during the afternoon as convention folks came over for their afternoon fix.The Molly free bus stops right in front of the hotel. It runs until late night...takes you down to Sundance Square a few miles away which is full of restaurants, shops (which close at 6ish) etc.We had a lovely hotel experience. Brandon and his staff really know how to give great service. The hotel is beautiful and new. The room service  and menu were wonderful. They seem to have anticipated and prepared for every need. We felt spoiled and refreshed by our brief stay. I will definitely try other Omni hotels in our future travels.I highly recommend the Omni Fort Worth.We just can't seem to get it right in our city! Out of all the ""Omni's that I have stayed at this one is one of the smallest. I'm am not impressed by this one at all! There desk clerks are not up to a 3 or 4 star standard quality. I expected better...So I stayed here for a few nights for a wedding that I was in-much better than the Hilton!! I paid up a bit extra for a premier king which was so worth it-great view, and the room and bathroom were really spacious! I'm a huge fan of the walk in shower. Ordered room service a couple of times, and it came quickly and was pretty good. They even let me order something that wasn't on the menu, when I rolled in from the bar at 2 a.m. and had the drunk munchies. Pretty hotel-it's huge-good rooms, and the hotel bar-Whiskey and Rye-is nice. I'd definately stay here again!!After a bad experience at the Sheraton across the park I switched to the Omni and could not have been happier. Though the room was not especially large it had everything I needed and more! All of the finishes in the room were top of the line not to mention the comfortable beds and pillows. Our room even had a mini fridge and spacious closet for us to use while we were there! The staff was helpful and pleasant always offering to go the extra mile. They even had a courtesy car that took me to Target to pick up something free of charge, you just tipped the driver! It was close to the convention center and restaurants. Even had two great places to eat right in the hotel. I have never stayed with Omni before and will not look for it during all my future travels! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Fort Worth!Planned special weekend for me and hubby for his birthday and after researching a couple of local hotel options, I chose the Omni. I requested early check in via phone when I booked the reservation and web (when I went online and did the actual early check in that apparently means absolutely nothing). When we arrived one hour before the regular check in time, we were told our room wasn't ready and they would call us. Slightly annoyed, we went and had a $30 sub par lunch at one of the restaurants in the hotel. Two hours later, more annoyed and very apologetic to my understanding birthday hubby we found the pool which looked like a pond full of chlorine that was over it's people capacity. We sat on one of the couches by the pool that smelled exactly like an ash tray. At that point hubby and I decided we'd had enough and went to the front desk to cancel our reservation. It was just  another example of poor customer service. It doesn't matter how attractive your hotel may be on the outside if you don't deliver on the inside.I sent the following email message to the Guest Services Manager on 1/22/12.  Today is 1/29/12. I have not yet received a response.  Not even an acknowledgement of receipt.I wanted to take the opportunity to comment on my recent experience staying at the Omni Fort Worth on January 14, 2012 through January 16, 2012.  Like you I also manage employees and always appreciate it when people take the time to provide me feedback on the results of their performance.  I feel that the information helps me improve the performance of our organization as well as their personal performance.  I travel relatively frequently and primarily stay at Marriott properties.  However, for the weekend of January 14 I decided to stay at the Omni since it was close to my daughter's cheer competition and I had not stayed in an Omni in some time.  I have stayed at both the Mandalay and Park West locations in the past and had very nice experiences.My experience for this weekend in January began when I arrived.  I had received an email prior to my arrival giving me the option to check in early (my card would be charged immediately).  I took advantage of that option because I thought I might have a better chance to get my preference of rooms.  I specified during the check-in procedure that I wanted the highest floor possible and a room at the end of a hallway.  Upon arrival I went to my assigned room only to find that it was right next to the elevator and only on the 9th floor.  This was not what I wanted by any means. I value quiet and don't like to hear all the conversations that occur while people wait on the elevator.   As a result I went back down to the front desk while my family waited for me.  I was reassigned a room much closer to the end of a hallway and was told a room at the end of a hallway would be available the following day.  Why wasn't I assigned the room closer to the end of the hallway in the first place?  Strange.  Of course I didn't move to a room at the end of a hall the following day because that would require moving all our belongings.On the first full day of my stay my family and I wanted to do some shopping that evening so we went downstairs to get my car from the valet.  I was then informed that the valet from the previous night had left my lights on all night and they had to charge my battery.  After waiting about 25 minutes my car was delivered and I was told it should be ""good to go"".  We drove about 15 minutes to a shopping area.  When I went to start my car it wouldn't even turn over.  I called the hotel and asked for the valet.  I was put on hold for 15 minutes (I timed it).  I hung up and called the hotel back and asked for a manager.  I was very ticked by this time.  I talked to the front desk manager who said she would talk to the valet and get someone to call me as soon as possible.  About 10 minutes later I received a call from the valet manager, the valet manager.  I told him where I was and he came out to jump start our car.  He arrived fairly quickly.  He followed me back to the hotel and filled out an incident report.  He was very professional and I appreciated him taking the time to document the incident without me having to ask him.  Our plans were to go out to dinner that night but those plans were ruined since I could not count on my car to start if I took it anywhere.  Mark asked the valet to keep it running to ensure the battery had a chance to charge.  Next I went inside to talk to the front desk manager again.  I apologized to her for being upset when I spoke with her earlier.  I did not say anything inappropriate but was upset at the whole incident and then being placed on hold.  She was very nice but I guess I was just looking for some understanding and acknowledgement regarding the situation.  She said she was sorry about it.  I guess I was at least expecting an offer of complementary valet service at a minimum for our trouble.  Not hearing that I just asked for it and she said they would do that.  I guess the point is, I shouldn't have had to ask.  Having had our dinner plans ruined we were fed up and just stayed in the room and ordered room service which I guess worked out well for the hotel since we spent more money there as a result of this fiasco.  When we ordered the room service we were told the wait would be one hour.  Tolerable given that the hotel seemed fairly crowded.  We recieved our food after about an hour and a half.  Although we ordered four entrees and two desserts we received three place settings.  Needless to say, it was not a stellar stay at the Omni.  Fortunately, upon checkout my car worked fine.  It would not be fair of me to be 100% critical.  The employees were friendly, the room was nice and quiet (even though I would have loved to have been on a much higher floor), the complementary juice in the morning was exactly on time and a nice touch.  The WiFi was excellent.This is the NEWEST place to stay in Fort Worth. Not to mention it's a great addition to the downtown skyline. Our room on the ninth floor was CLEAN and COMFORTABLE. Beautiful decor throughout the hotel, not just the lobby. There is a lot to offer in one place at the Omni; pool, gym, spa, business, kids activities, etc. Booking our stay during July 4th weekend was discounted because of a special we got through the Omni's website. So, if you're planning on staying here you might want to check the web often. Try the beyond tasty breakfast buffet at the Cast Iron Restaurant. Enjoy attentive service in the Whiskey &amp; Rye bar. Also, the Omni has a fantastic Kimbell Art Museum gift shop and Wine Bar.I stayed here for the 2012 CyberStar Summit in January 2012 and I can tell you that this is truly a great hotel.  The rooms are gorgeous and the service is excellent.  Tonight we had dinner at Bob's here in the hotel and with at least 60 of us the service was impeccable and they actually allowed each of us to be billed separately.  No matter where I've been in this hotel, service has been outstanding along with the facilities.  This is simply a great place to stay and it's directly across the street from the Convention Center.  The steaks tonight were cooked perfectly and no matter what anyone ordered at Bob's it was cooked perfectly.  You can't miss coming here.  It's well worth the cost.I just returned from a Cyber Stars summit and had the good fortune to stay at the Omni while there. From check in to check out, every detail was thought of. My room was a comfortable temperature when I arrived, the pillows were FANTASTIC, and the staff helped me every time I had a question. Many times, lunched at meetings are sub-par but not at the OMNI- they were great! Tasty, well balanced and enough to satisfy my appetite. On site, the restaurant we ate at was comfortable, staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was good. The concierge services were very helpful too. I already signed up for their ""points program"" and I suggest you do as well! I would certainly recommend the Omni Fort Worth and would stay there again.Fantastic stay, super guest service, perfect location near the Stockyards and a great overall experience. The hotel staff took care of our conference and everything was done well. Great free wifi in the rooms and our connection in the meeting rooms was solid. Lots of computers and networks in this group and the system handled it with apparent ease. Would definitely stay here again!!We stayed here because we needed a weekend away, nothing too special just a change of scene. This was the perfect place to do it, everything from when we first pulled in to when we left was excellent. A very friendly and courteous staff, the bellman even helped me find my watch that I had forgotten! We used their spa services as well, and the staff there could not have made us more comfortable. Even with it being a busy weekend for the hotel it was still a nice relaxing weekend for us. Priced very well for what you get.Key demagnetizes, not a single vending machine in the place and staff made it seem like it was an inconvenience to get helpGot a great rate.  Room was spacious, clean, and functional.  Good breakfast, albeit expensive.  Only real knock was that the hotel bar touts their specialty cocktail menu...what a laugh.  When I order a Sazerac, and you serve me a drink with 3 lemon wedges and no bitters in it...well, you get the picture.  Anyway, you will not be disappointed you stayed at the Omni.  As far as I can tell, it's the best hotel in downtown Ft. Worth.","['review', 'based', 'solely', 'room', 'service', 'venison', 'chili', 'great', 'flavor', 'bread', 'excellent', 'beans', 'tasty', 'bowl', 'fill', 'lettuce', 'part', 'fantastic', 'really',
