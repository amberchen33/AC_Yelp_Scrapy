http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-columbus-dublin-dublin,Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Dublin,4.0,$$,15,"Stayed at this hotel in a block of rooms for a wedding. They held arrival gift bag behind the counter and provided it to us when we checked in. This location is either unique or I have not been to a hotel like this before. The reception desk is directly in front of you as you walk in but it is slightly pushed back. This allows you to take in the lobby experience on the right and left. There is a restaurant area on the right with what looked like a bar. This makes it a very nice open set up for a location in suburban Ohio.The room was nice, we had a King bed as well as a couch that opened up into an additional sleeping spot. I'm not sure if the wifi was slow or if they cap upload speeds but I was not able to upload a video to YouTube here. There was also some confusion about my room being cleaned as I was still in the room when room service came. I told them they could come in while I was there but they never came back. Check in and check out is simple nowadays with the bill slipped under your door the morning of.Just stayed for one evening. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. Very clean both outside and inside. My room was spectacular with super comfy bed. I have stayed here in the past and it has been a great states have visit. The Hyde Park Chop house is close by, highly recommend. Also, you are close to downtown Dublin and a variety of other restaurants and taverns.Friendly staff, clean rooms. Workout facility is small with 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, Dumbbells that go up to 30 I believe; a bench and a stability ball. The pool looked nice though I didn't use it and the breakfast area stayed busy even though I did not eat there. Bed was very comfortable... I slept like a rock and the AC blew Ice cold which helped me sleep so soundly.We made reservations to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn for the week of Christmas.  I have to say that Justin (who works at the front desk) was so very nice and helpful from the time we made the reservation, answering questions when I called back twice and when we finally met him at the front desk.  He even called us on a day we kept the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door( and didn't get the room cleaned), to make sure we didn't run out of anything we may need.  He was even nice enough to bring a box of kleenex up since that was the only thing we ran out of. The hotel is super nice.  I understand that renovations were recently done and it shows.  The lobby is gorgeous.  We checked in with no problem whatsoever.  We stayed in a king room on the fourth floor and the room was really nice.  Very modern decor.  When we walked in, there was a cute towel display of two swans on the bed.  The room was clean and mostly comfortable.  The bed was a challenge for us since we are used to a memory foam mattress at home.  There is a mini fridge, microwave and mini Keurig in the room.  Pods, cups, creamer and sugar are provided.  Nice touch.We stayed seven nights and enjoyed our time there.  The staff is very responsive, friendly, approachable and caring.  The front desk personnel, the ""restaurant"" (more like a cafe) employees, housekeeping and maintenance were very helpful.  We stopped at the front desk to let them know our room was cold.  The maintenance person went to our room right away, we were having breakfast in the hotel and he was back to us before we even had a chance to sit down to eat.  The issue was ours with the heat, we had the settings incorrect.We used the hot tub and pool once during our stay.  It was very nice in there, very clean.The only criticism I have is the breakfast food/cost.  I liked the waffle I made for my boyfriend and I, the fruit they serve is fresh.  The coffee isn't very good and the cost for what you get seemed a little high.  Including tip, the breakfast was a little over $20 for 2 people.  That is regardless of whether you have a cooked breakfast, or cereal and fruit, or a muffin and a banana.  So if you are going to partake, make sure you are really hungry and get your money's worth.  Don't pay $20 for two people to have coffee, a muffin and share a banana.  There is a Kroger nearby, I suggest you pick up some food that you can keep in your room.Place is clean and rooms are nice.  The Wi-Fi is terrible.  Took forever to get the hot water to reach our room and it was hard to control the shower temperature.  The breakfast was NOT free and they did not make that clear.  There are too many other good Hilton properties in Dublin and we will not be staying here again.  Feel defrauded by the breakfast situation.My girlfriend and I decided to get away for the Christmas holiday and made a reservation for 8 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn.  We read a lot of reviews and looked at a map before we decided on this place and we chose a winner. The hotel is conveniently located near the freeway, plenty of restaurants near by as well as grocery and other shopping.The staff at this hotel are extremely nice and helpful.  Even with suggesting restaurants and such.The hotel itself is clean, updated and comfortable.  We even used the pool and hot tub one evening and it was enjoyable.  We liked the Dublin area, there are plenty of places to shop, eat and see.  Even though we didn't go, it is close to the zoo (in case you are looking for a place to stay near there).We will stay here again if we are in town again, and hopefully we will be!!Greeted warmly at the front desk. Easy check in. Free wi-fi and Keurig coffee. A pleasant stay.We stayed here for a friend's wedding at the beginning of April 2014.  Let me start by saying that the hotel was being renovated when we arrived and was clearly torn apart in many places.  They were busy and it sounded like they didn't have any rooms left available for walk-ins.  The woman in front of us was having one heck of a time with her check-in but luckily, ours went very quickly.We left the front desk and headed to the elevators.  There were two elevators and one of the doors opened, only to find out that the elevator would not move...Strike 1.  We waited forever for the second elevator to come down.  We finally got in it and went to our floor, the 4th floor, which was nicely renovated.  We walked to the room, inserted the key card, only to find a man occupying the room...Strike 2.  He looked just as shocked as us and we apologized and went back to the front desk after a long wait for the elevator.  Another family that was waiting to check in when we were there were back on the elevator.  They asked what was wrong with our room.  We told them someone was in there.  We then asked what was wrong with theirs and they told us it was torn apart and not acceptable to stay in.  We finally reach the front desk and explain the situation.  They were very apologetic and assigned us a new room and also gave us free breakfast for the next morning (we were just hoping the room was completed).  We once again waiting forever for the elevator and made it to the room (which was completed and not occupied).  This left us with 30 mins until we had to leave for the wedding as it took 30 mins before we could get to a good room.The rooms were decently quiet so that was good.  The parking was horrible as they had construction equipment blocking some of the spots and of course the hotel was busy...Strike 3.  Strike 4 actually happened the next day at breakfast.  The food, it just wasn't that great.  The eggs looked unappetizing and our ""waitress"" even said so.  They kept running out of stuff too.I stay at Hiltons a lot when I travel and this one just did not live up to the other ones I enjoy.Good hotel but first room smelt like cigarettes. Went to the front desk and instantly got a new room. This one was nice. Decent Hilton. Good for the areaService was top notch and price was good too  one thing I really liked was that the lamps beside the bed had phone charging options. There was TV channel guides available and my tv even had MLB Network on it. I was so happy to be able to watch the cardinals game. It's located in Dublin which is a nice and safe area. Definitely recommend this hotel. It's not often I give any place five stars.I stayed two nights in this hotel. The night before my wedding and the night of my wedding. It happened during the great Derecho of 2012 and the power was out for half of my stay. Still, given the circumstances the staff handled it well. Night one was in a 2-bed room on the second floor. It was fine but had lots of minor problems - peeling wallpaper, knicks all over the bathroom walls, tiny cramped bathroom with a door that wouldn't stay shut, etc.Night two was in a much nicer 1-bed room room on the 4th floor. It didn't have any of the problems described in the room from the first night and was pretty comfortable (aside from the fact that the room had no AC, not the hotel's fault though).It would seem that the quality of the rooms are not all the same after all.Stayed here for a week for business. The gym here is very small and no free weights. If you care about working out while travel, you prob should check out another hotel. The rate is good around $110 a night for corporate rate. It is next to a kroger for shopping groceries. There's also jasons deli and a dry cleaners near by. The air conditioning us very loud and can bother you if you're a light sleeper. They have happy hour from 6-8 daily.Cheers!It's just a run of the mill Hilton Garden Inn. The front desk operators were very nice. I was greeted nicely and received my room key with no hassle, even though I arrived before the check in time of 3:00pm. Unfortunately, the room was not ready even though I was told it was. When I walked in the sheets were off of the bed and there was trash everywhere. I went back to the front desk, they apologized and quickly gave me another room. This one was much better. After two nights of stay, I only wish that there was a bar at this hotel. I did not try any food at this hotel.As a recap, I would only stay at this hotel if there were no other options available. Next time I'll have to try the Embassy Suites next door. Also, the water temperature control was backwards in my shower. Very nasty surprise. I must congratulate the front desk staff however, they were very courteous and polite.Are you a fan of beige, nondescript, sterile hotels in suburban office parks? If so, look no further! All joking aside, this hotel is a very serviceable option in Dublin. Close to a lot of retail and shopping, but not downtown Dublin, so you'll have a hike to the city center. My room and bathroom were very clean, the beds were comfy, and the staff was gracious. My sole complaint is that the shower ran icy-cold on me a few times. That certainly kept me awake. I'll chalk it up to bathing during morning rush hour, but one would think they'd plan for the whole place to be showering at once, no? Breakfast is decent, with an omelet station, a waffle iron, and healthy options like oatmeal and fruit.Very nice hotel. I'd suggested it for the business traveler as it's away from the town (Dublin) center. I did see two wedding parties there and people with children though. The service is great. The rooms are very nice and so is the breakfast bar. They have a small pool and a business center (small, but it's functional). I would've definitely given the place 5 stars....but they decided to replace the mattresses in a few rooms. Not really a problem....unless you keep two slightly soiled mattresses outside in the hallway for two days! That was not a pretty view to enjoy. I checked the mattress in my room and it was super-clean. The entire room was sparkling, so I don't think soiled mattresses are a norm there. The hotel also has wireless Internet, a small fridge, a coffee maker and a microwave in every room. Did I also mention that they are about 40-50% less expensive than other hotels of this class? I wouldn't mind staying there again.",,,,,"['hotel', 'block', 'rooms', 'wedding', 'held', 'arrival', 'gift', 'bag', 'behind', 'counter', 'provided', 'checked', 'location', 'either', 'unique', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/marriott-columbus-2,Marriott,3.0,$$,13,"Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a bit dated. However, the service and attention to detail more than made up for that! We are Marriott Gold members and had access to the M Club Lounge. The woman working each morning was friendly, warm, funny, full of info about Columbus, and on her game with the breakfast foods. (I really regret not getting her name!) On one morning we inadvertently left our ""privacy please"" tag on our door. The next day, Jerri Lynn made it a point to speak to us and ask if we'd like the room cleaned. When we returned that evening we received a handwritten note from her to let us know she left extra towels and shampoo for us. (We joked with her earlier about our teenage daughter using all of the shampoo.)Very easy, quick access to downtown Columbus without the parking costs. We will stay here again when in the Columbus area.This place is dated so beware but is very clean and friendly staff. See pictures attached.Very nice place - close to the airportThese people are truly exceptional.If an Undercover Boss goes and check , they can see the true picture.. comes -true good nature would be seen.that's the case withGood work -by Patrick - front desk -he is so young, quick, sharp, willing to travel extra mile- very nice person..Willing to do what it takes..he is like my son's age...- Emma - Housekeeping-she is super conscious, highly ethical, professional etiquette-follows through if there is a door hanging-even though she is well experienced, she wanted to wait.-Kim - River City Grille - she is fantastic- highly customer service -she wants to travel extra mile. Very pleasing and really dedicated.Ick!!!! Do yourself a favor and stay in Easton and shuttle in. This place is a typical airport hotel. Looks like they are renovating so maybe improvements to come?????? I won't be back.I was bumped by Delta, and this was the hotel they booked me at.The check-in at the front desk was easy; the staff was very warm and welcoming; yes, the coming around the desk to give you your keys and walking you to the elevator was a nice touch.The shuttle service was easy for me coming and going.The most important part of the stay for me at this point was THE BED.  It was supremely comfortable, and on my travels quite recently, I've tried a few.  This one might have been the best, and I loved the (feather?) comforter and pillows.  Wake-up calls were on time, food was 'eh' in room service, but oh well, I wasn't there to eat.I don't know how much a room runs in this location, but the room was beautiful, and as mentioned, so was the bed.  I don't know if the plane noise is loud during the day, but it was a fairly quiet location after 7 PM.The rooms are a bit of a trek from the front desk (at first glance, anyway....), and from seeing the pool, it wasn't much to write home about.  For my stay, I enjoyed it.  The Wi-Fi also worked well.I have stayed here before and although a bit outdated, the convenient location and great service brought me back. The cockroach scurrying past my feet this morning will ensure I don't come back. Come one Marriott, disgusting! And if you see one you know there are any more.Awesome service awesome hotel!  So good to get away for a weekend with Ms. F!From check-in to check-out we had a fabulous weekend here. Everyone was so helpful with local directions and local restaurant recommendations. We were in town just for the weekend but I cannot tell you how helpful everyone was from breakfast server to General Manager!Note:  Platinum member review using free nightsPros:  Close to a number of highways and the airport (but not much noise from either).  Super dooper comfortable beds (soft but firm, nice bedding).  Good workout center and indoor pool, whirlpool and sauna.  Concierge Lounge open Sunday evening for snacks, drinks and desserts and Monday morning for decent breakfast.  Full service restaurant.Cons (and these are pretty snarky on my part, so I'm not downgrading my rating, just whining):  no upgrade available even though I'm Platinum.  Concierge Lounge closed all-day Saturday and Sunday morning.  Sprawling 1st floor layout, so it is a hike from the lobby to the elevators (recommend you park at the far side of the parking lot and go in the door to the right of the pool for a quicker way to the elevators).This hotel under-performs just a little bit from what you would expect on a number of fronts, nothing serious, but for this chain I expect more. Two of the main hot items in the buffet breakfast were cold two days in a row. The hotel is very spread out with the check-in and restaurant quite a hike from the elevators. The temperature in the conference room was too cold all three days I was there, even though we asked for it to be warmed up. Our room was cleaned very late in the day each day, and not at all one day. The bathrooms could really use an exhaust fan - they steam up from the shower and do not dry out for hours. Each of these issues was relatively minor but they added up to 3 stars for this hotel. On the positive side, the staff were uniformly friendly and courteous. Everything was clean and in good repair. When we asked to get a different room, away from the elevator, the staff obliged with no issues. The conference room was well stocked with coffee and snacks.This is a McMarriott standardized format hotel that's common in the Ohio area.  It looks the same as others including the one in Cincinnati.  If you like things to be the same everywhere you go then you'll love this place.  I tend to like to stay in a diversity of places that don't look alike, but hey... to each his own.  The other reason I don't like it, is that when you travel as much as I do, you wake up and totally forget what city you're in.  Not good for me.The staff is VERY nice and professional.  I like how they step around the check-in desk to hand you the key and direct you to the elevator.  Good pool and cardio area.  Has a sauna and this is very, very convenient to the airport.  But you'll have to have a car to go anyplace interesting to eat and/or hang out.Went to Ohio to watch a sporting event.  They overbooked.  Threw us into another hotel of lower quality.  Gave us the same rate.  Gave us nothing for our inconvenience.  We booked our rooms MONTHS in advance.  Guaranteed with a credit card.  What can you do for us?  I asked.  Nothing they said.Very nice hotel in my opinion. We were in town to watch North Carolina A&amp;T play at the Shottenheim Arena against Ohio State and were very pleased with the room's cleanliness and amenities. My only complaint would be with the beds (way too soft), but this ""pillowy"" style in beds seems to be the trend wherever you stay these days. A bad back forced me to sleep on the floor, but at least I felt at ease that the floors were clean, too. (chuckle) A very friendly staff and convenient shuttles to and from the Easton shopping district all helped make our stay enjoyable...despite A&amp;T's loss to Ohio State. Oh well, can't have it all I guess.One of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel.  The customer service is weak at best, and the condition of the rooms is run down and a little sad.  The atmosphere is unprofessional, and the lobby area is very loud, both with music blasting through the speakers and the people traffic.  Even the fountain in the lobby smells due to an overdue need to be maintained.  The mattresses are super soft, and the support staff seem to be understaffed, sullen, and unhelpful.I chose this location specifically because I needed proximity to the airport, as well as shuttle transportation from the airport.  Prior to my arrival I called twice to confirm the procedure for securing a shuttle.  When I landed at 8:30pm, I called.  The phone rang and rang, but no one picked up.  I had to call back a number of times to finally secure a shuttle.  Another gentlemen was waiting with me (and had also called).  When the shuttle finally arrived, 40 minutes after my original call, he didn't apologize.  Instead, the driver aggressively told me I should have called for the shuttle (!)  When we got in, the shuttle reeked of smoke,  and it was clear to me -and the other passengers- that we were left waiting so he could have his smoke break.When I got to the front desk, there was no one there.  We waited until a very green employee signed us up.  The room I was first assigned had a very soft, very old mattress.  They tried a different room, but all had equally old mattresses.  We finally settled on a room with a king that wasn't so bad, but I needed a new room key for my new room assignment.  It took them 30 minutes to get the keys to me.  When I was finally settling in, I discovered that the pillows in my room too were old, soft, and pilling with wear.  I called down to get pillows.  Again, 30 minutes to get them to me.  The woman who delivered them was downright rude about it.  By now it was 12:30am.  I hadn't had a moment's peace, and certainly wasn't getting my money's worth in any respect, so I chose to leave.I ended up going to the Embassy Suites next door.  At the same exact price point, the experience was like night and day.  Their accommodations, suites, and free breakfast (which the Marriott did not have) were excellent. I called a few days later to speak with the general manager at Marriott, and was dumped into her voicemail.  I was told by the front desk that the general manager doesn't carry a mobile.  Surprising for a general manager of a hotel this size, but not really when you consider all of the above.I have stayed at MANY hotels, for both business and vacation, and this is not representative of my previous experiences with Marriott.  However, in this case, buyer beware!",,,,,"['yes', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'bit', 'dated', 'however', 'service', 'attention', 'detail', 'made', 'gold', 'members', 'access', 'club', 'lounge',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-grove-city,Drury Inn & Suites,4.0,$$,13,"Update: Second time we've stayed here. Even better than before. For some reason we were able to get one of the rooms on the 7th floor for $5 more (maybe because it was a off day) and its huge! This would be perfect if you were traveling with kids. Again, very comfortable, clean and quiet. First time we've stayed at a Drury Inn, and regret that we had not given it a chance before, because it's been one of our better hotel experiences yet. After a disappointing stay the previous night in a different hotel, it became quickly apparent to my wife and I that Drury Inn really understands how to satisfy their guests. My wife loves how there are a variety of pillows in the room, as opposed to them all being the same. Some are super fluffy, some a little less for example. The bed is super comfortable. Everything worked, AC, fridge, hot water, lights (yeah, we've had experiences where that wasn't the case). Ice machines and soda machines on every floor, but there's a free soda fountain downstairs. There's a free evening meal (nothing to brag about, but it's free. Hot dogs, baked potato, Mac and Cheese, free drinks).  Free breakfast, but we opted to go to Bob Evans next door. There's also a Texas Roadhouse next door as well. Both within walking distance. Drury Inn topped off the experience with a 100% guarantee. That's right, you just read that. If you're not pleased, they'll make it right. We've stayed at places before where we had a bad experience, and complained to management that just blew us off. Staff here are friendly with a sense of humor. Place is very clean with one exception that's not worth mentioning. Shower has this ingenious body wash / shampoo / conditioner dispenser to save on all those little plastic bottles. We'll seek out Drury Inn in other towns we visit from now on.I like this place! Let's calculate: Free breakfast per person let's assume this benefits you at least 15 to 30 dollars; free evening kickback meal ( means you don't have to eat out forget taste think price) why this will benefit you 10 to 20 dollars; free drinks ( you get 3 plus pop tea coffee) now I'm not a drinker but this I know is a major benefit for drinkers...heck I wanted communion after I heard this... Because price can be a deterrent for the wise consumer and his dollars. So i will estimate the savings at 15.00. Never have I seen a hotel work so hard to get your money....Amenities that have aleady been named in other reviews indoor outdoor pool hot tub.I have one complaint change the washing solution the towels were gard...however I could exfoliate my skin with them... This is a consumer smart hotel especially if you have a lot of kids....or if you want a romantic weekend without losing all your savings.... And on top of that you still can get deals.  Best rate value and suchWhen I heard that I was booked at the Drury Inn &amp; Suites for my recent stay in Ohio, I could not help but think of the Muffin Man. You know, from Drury Lane.  Let's get this out of the way now. I don't know the Muffin Man and I am not the Muffin Man. Just call me the Melman because I always deliver.  Hah!! My travel department booked me here for week and it's just your basic hotel.  This type of room would normally cost about $25 in Laughlin, $50 in Las Vegas, and $150 in Los Angeles. So, I figured that the price of about $100 is just about right for Drury Inn.Some amenities that this hotel has includes, a pool, small fitness room, a restaurant that for breakfast &amp; Happy Hour, and room service. I think the food from room service is actually delivered from somewhere else, but I could be wrong. As for the employees, great staff here, I had an issue and forgot one of my work assignments at home. One of the employees went out of his way to help me print a new one.  The check in process is also easy here.One last thing to point out about the Drury Inn. It's conveniently located near a ton of restaurants and shopping.  Everything is walking distance from the hotel, which is also a huge plus.We have been dedicated Drury fans for at least 5 years now. We have stayed in at least a dozen. This Drury is mostly the same at first glance. I think the prices of all of them have gone up about $40 in the last year or two. This Drury has the most expensive price tag of any we've stayed at so far. I didn't blink at first, because I thought it would be the same experience. The bed sheets are a bit thin. And there is a dried blood stain on the sheer curtain. I always have trouble sleeping on a trip, and here I go again. 3am, and I can't sleep. I see a lot of reviews complaining of smoking smell. I was told that this hotel is now non smoking. And there is a clear sign in the room saying they will charge you $250 if you smoke in the room. So that's good! Our room has no smell of smoke. The dinner was the same it always is. It's ok to eat vegetarian. Not particularly great if you're vegan. What can we do though, it's ""free"" food. I expect the breakfast to be what it always is, too. The staff at the front desk upon check in was nice, friendly and efficient. They also brought us an extra blanket quite promptly. I wonder if this location will soon be renovated. We stay in 2 other Drurys the next 3 nights. Hopefully they will be what we remember and expect from all of our previous stays. PS - I would still pick this chain of hotels for this location. However, I think we will try a known location we have stayed at several years now - another Drury in a nearby area - on the way home instead of this location. It had the same price as this one, so we'll see if its quality has gone down at all yet too. PPS - Drury is very proud of those JD power awards - 9 years in a row now. I wonder if that will continue if the quality is starting to go downhill?Great room, clean and updated, our hallway smelled like and old mans dirty laundry hamper. I assume that was because of water damage. There were multiple large fans in the hall. Aside from that the facility was great. I was surprised that the tv programming didn't seem to be HD on a nice HD television. I also would love a guide button so I can look at a list of programs like I do at home. It's frustrating now to look through channels one at a time. I'm spoiled by technology. Your breakfast (for a complementary) was second to none. It had everything I wanted and it was always kept neat organized and full. My kids also loved the indoor/outdoor pool although in the back of my head I couldn't help but think it wasn't very energy efficient. The staff was courteous, helpful and always smiling. I also loved for 10.00 you could bring your dog. I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the water damage. I hate to not give them a 5 but my experiance was perfect except for that.My boyfriend and I just drove across the country and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the best one yet! By that I mean friendly staff, great beds, HBO, very clean and they allow dogs! I hope to have the chance to stay here again.Been there.  Done that.  Will again.  Friendly service.  Free food and drinks in the evening.  Free hot breakfast in the morning.  Nice rooms.  Comfortable beds.  Great location without having to stay in Columbus.We stayed here on 9/15/2012 just for a night away from the baby and it was only ok. I wanted to it....but the room smelled like smoke...even though it was a non smoking room...and the bathroom was only moderately clean.... And the hot tub in the spa are had broken tiles and some green mold...... Not so attractive. We did enjoy the breakfast that was free....but there were not healthy options.... Some more fruit would have been nice...i don't think i would try it again...but i will say that the beds were very comfy and they had a nice flat screen tv in our suite.Leaving off a star because when we pulled up at 1AM the check-in person didn't want to leave his conversation with the security guard watching TV in the lobby to open the door.Has suites, takes dogs, has breakfast that generates a lot of individual serving style trash.First time staying at a Drury, will not be the last.   For the price it is a great deal.  Very clean, comfortable bed, courteous staff, nice pool and hot tub - did not use, breakfast was very nice and better than expected, evening kickback really nice - good food overall, free soft drink &amp; popcorn in the lobby, what am I missing??   About ten to fifteen minutes from Columbus.  We would stay there again.Dear Drury Inn,I would like to love you, but I don't.  I am a Marriott fan, but I couldn't resist your billboard offering a room for $89.00.  In fact, I was almost giddy with excitement!   I had stayed at your Dayton location a couple of years ago and was quite pleased.  However, I am not so sure your Grove City location aids you in your quest for adding more J. D. Powers awards to fill your corporate trophy case.  Sure, billing me a room rate of $114.95 is an easy mistake.  But having to endure torture from Ms. Perky Pants to get my issue resolved was almost more than I could take!  Also, maybe you need a little bigger serving area for your free snack and free breakfast buffet.  Don't you realize that some people go crazy at the sight of free food and could hurt themselves?  I am totally forgiving you for the cheap and worn sheets and the stained hallway carpet, because I am sure it's tough to keep up on that stuff.  But aren't you in the business of providing a clean and safe room for me to stay in?  Just a little something for you to work on....Regards,Julie D.This hotel is a wonderful place to stay.  I travel for business and I find this hotel, clean, comfortable, welcoming, and the staff very friendly.  On my last visit, I left a jacket hanging in the closet.  I called the hotel and spoke to a friendly voice who took my name and number.  She called me back within 30 minutes, said she had found my coat, and if I give her an address, they would send it in the mail.  I received the package two days later.  It's nice to stay some place where the staff understand customer service.Great hotel! I had screwed up and booked the wrong Drury and they were able to accommodate me without a problem - they put me in the LAST possible room, a meeting room (i.e., a hotel room with a big meeting table). Everyone was super nice and helpful. I love that everything was free - internet, long distance, breakfast, a ""kickback"" happy hour (with 3 free drinks!), etc. It was a GREAT deal and very clean and nice. I loved it!",,,,,"['update', 'second', 'time', 'better', 'reason', 'able', 'rooms', '7th', 'floor', 'maybe', 'day', 'huge', 'perfect', 'traveling', 'kids', 'comfortable', 'clean', 'quiet', 'first',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-dublin-3,Hampton Inn,4.0,$$,13,"We stopped in after a day of driving around 2am just to get some sleep. I was so pleased with Chuck at the front desk and our room was so clean and nice. The bed was so comfortable we fell asleep right away! Very friendly staff during breakfast and the food was good. If we were driving back that way I would definitely stay again!New, clean, good location in Dublin. A little hidden until you're right up on it. Breakfast included. Free WiFI. I'd stay again.Located close to plenty of restaurants and just off I-270 which makes it a very practical place to stay. Add to it that the rooms are clean and the Internet runs at a reasonably good speed and you have a winner. This property also has loads of parking space available.This hotel was great and if you don't know it is there you would miss it - Quiet with awesome cookies out each night.The internet was sufficient and served as home base for 5 days on a business trip.The Fitness Center Treadmill is HORRENDOUS and probably dangerous as the belt catches and when incline is used it becomes wobbly.  Hotel would receive 4 stars if treadmill was replaced as it was the second worse treadmill I have had in the past 40 weeks on the road.Overall it was a pretty good experience. The room was clean. The bathroom was larger than I expected. The biggest downfall was that the two twin beds were very small. With my husband sleeping with one child on one bed and me sleeping with one child in the other bed we were all very crowded and very cramped. On the other hand, the continental breakfast was pretty good and had quite a variety. I would stay here again but would ask for two king beds or two queen beds were at least confirm it was a room without the tiny beds.clean, modern, friendly-staff, great hot breakfast buffet, free internet, nice location. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars was because the work-out room didn't open til 5am (when you're jetlagged and wake up at 2am, this matters) - but they were kind and explained the reasons for it. Would absolutely stay here again.Happy surprise to arrive at this well kept hotel on a cold night in Ohio. Loved the small touches like yellow stickies on the headboard like my mom used to leave me: linens are fresh for your arrival. Also appreciated nice white bedding and thick towels. Dont really want to visit Ohio again (yikes its cold and grey!) but if I had to, I would happily stay here.First trip to Dublin, first time staying at a Hampton Inn.  I am impressed with this hotel so far.  The lobby and grounds are super clean.  My room is simple but seems superbly clean!  It has everything I need and again, extremely clean (and i'm very picky!).  What really makes me happy is that they offer free coffee/tea/hot cocoa any time you want it in the lobby.  One more thing, this is in a great location!!  So many things are right around the corner, shopping, a cinema, restaurants - and let me suggest giving the Mellow Mushroom Pizza a whirl!  Thank you Hampton for a great night's sleep!One of the best Hampton's that I have stayed in. Clean , neat , newly modelled, very pleasing staff and a great cook for a real hot and nice breakfast...On the top , my room had mini refrigerator and a microwave also. Last but not the least i love cookies in the evening at the front desk...I am a Hilton fan.. a Hampton fan.. and this Hampton fan..Great location. Clean rooms and nice property.How can I not give them five stars?  In addition to offering the usual consistent quality I have come to expect from Hampton, the friendly staff cheerfully offered terrific recommendations for local dinner and nightcap spots.  Cudos!They just finished a remodel, and it looks fantastic. Clean, spacious and looks upscale. Had a last minute reservation and was on the side of the hotel that faces 270. It was a little on the noisy side from trucks, etc. Breakfast options looked decent, but no one was hungry at the time to actually eat anything.Love the Hampton Inn's because you always know what to expect.  This one is no different.  Clean rooms, friendly staff, comfortable bed. Fairly recent remodel. This location is close to many restaurants and convenient to 275.",,,,,"['stopped', 'day', 'driving', 'around', 'sleep', 'pleased', 'chuck', 'front', 'desk', 'room', 'clean', 'nice', 'bed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-columbus-n-i-270-worthington-worthington-6,Holiday Inn Columbus N - I-270 Worthington,3.0,$$,15,"Well, we got a smoking deal on this room and it had an indoor pool and fresh linings  and hot shower. Pro-Indoor pool, great staff, and comfy beds,walking distant to mallCon-Confusing lay out, several large meeting rooms (all in use on a Tuesdays night, limited parking) and the poor restaurant is in need of update and staff help Didn't like that the pool was in the main hallway with lots of windows that  'visitors' could stare in, made me uncomfortable for my kids to be leered at. Also the off ramp is under construction, and is very hard to navigate ( a guest told us it has been under construction for 2 years)Ok, so it's a big old Holiday inn. Rooms and all are large enough and in decent repair. Just not spiffy or new. What gripes is the $10 per person breakfast charge for a buffet.Ok, so this review only counts for the conference part of the Holiday Inn, but it's great! I've attended a conference here two years in a row and it's always a nice experience. Many rooms for break-out sessions, a nice big ballroom with good acoustics and viewing for keynote speakers, and tasty food!Recently stayed at this hotel. The staff is polite at first, but becomes less so when asked to solve a problem.  Most of the walks especially the doors away from the front lobby were left unshoveled and stairs were covered in ice.  Beware the 2 axle breaking holes in the back, they were partially obscured by snow so no opportunity to avoid them.  Staff solution for slippery floor due people tracking through the snow was to put down 1 mat and leave it even when it was soaked and slippery.  Hot water is spotty at best and shower adjustment is sooooo touchy you either par boil or freeze.  It also will vary temp all on it's own just cause.  The room is comfortable, clean and has free wifi.  There is an onsite restuarant and the food quality is very hit or miss.  Soups, which they claim are homemade are thin, salty and lacking in flavor. Fries are abundant with no grease, salads are a mix of fresh greens and ones that are wilted and brown.  When the wilted greens were pointed out to the server, the response was ""Oh"".The room I stayed in had BED BUGS!  My friend was eaten alive!  I couldn't avoid giving this place one star...REALLY!This HI need to be remodel, some of the rooms have that ""old hotel"" smell and look, some room will have microwave and fridge, and some will not. The only thing i like about this hotel is because it's next to a ""mall"" ( more like a ghost mall) and next to a Kroger, if you do not like to waste money at the hotel's restaurant, then the supermarket, and a couple of restaurants are across the street, just watch out for the cars though!As part of a large wedding party all our needs and wishes were accommodated by the excellent staff. The rooms were very comfortable and had all the hookups needed. Brunch was really good and is very kid friendly. The pool and exercise room were great. Highly recommended!I recently attended an overnight conference at this hotel, and so experienced the conference spaces, hotel rooms, and dining. Conference spaces: well set up, but AC was so loud in some conference rooms that attendees turned it off, leading to very warm rooms. I appreciated that there were pitchers of water available in each room, and plentiful pens. No problems with AV equipment. Hotel rooms: very very meh. Badly needs updating, some odd smells. Very bizarre layout, so not suited to large groups, and definitely do not recommend to guests with mobility issues. I would not choose to stay here again. Food: the breakfast buffet is $10, which is a huge ripoff. The warmers were not stocked, so I had no bacon; the sausage was almost too rubbery to slice, eggs did not look very appetizing. There is a waffle iron, and the potatoes were very good. Service was very slow (waitstaff seats all guests, and gets their beverages). The conference I attended provided the breakfast buffet for free, so I would think the restaurant would have expected a crowd. Instead, there was a wait for tables to be bussed, and even longer waits for coffee and OJ. I would not recommend the breakfast buffet unless it is included in your room/conference rate. There is a Panera across the street where you can get a much better breakfast. At the conference, we had two lunches, one dinner, and various snacks. The snacks were all great--plenty of variety of pastries. The lunches and dinner were all pretty mediocre banquet food--nothing spectacular, nothing too offensive.My very first impression of this hotel is the staff is very helpful and friendly. There is no doubt about. From the van driver to the front desk to the housekeeping. All wonderful.  Workout room , nice indoor pool. Free internet even.   There are a few restaurants around and a huge grocery store across the street,(Kroger) that has everything.The rooms are nice and clean with big soft beds. Very nice and reasonable price.  Even free hotel parking, you won't find that on the west coast.As far as Holiday Inn's go.. this is okay. Its clean.. updated and has a friendly, nice restaurant. Near nothing. The airport shuttle can be slow. Decent gym.. good beds.. works for me.This review is primarily for the food in the restaurant, the hotel was OK, in fact we thought the people working there were helpful. Husband and I arrived at the hotel late (after 9pm) from all day flying, we were hungry and didn't want to go out searching for dinner. We were the only table, manager was courteous, brought over our drinks promptly. Husband ordered the rib eye steak ($18) medium rare. The salad and onion rings were the high light, the steak was a total disaster. It was paper thin, very tough and well done..... I had the baby back ribs ($12 for a half rack) , they were decent and that's what we shared. The price was not bad if we could at least get a half decent piece of meat, it was so bad to the point we thought it was comical. DO NOT order the steak.The room and grounds are great. This hotel is located in a convenient and nice area. The breakfast however is horrible.I hosted a large reunion event at this hotel for about 90 guests. The staff was nice during planning and very helpful. Once the event date rolled around however, all of the overpriced extra's we paid for were nowhere to be found (like the 50 dollar audio hookup which was just a cable). So the entire event schedule was thrown off because we had to keep tracking the manager on duty to figure out where our services were. The wet bar was also a joke. Our bartender was great and was ontop of his game, however the back of the house kept choking him on supplies so we had to keep waiting for the manager to sign more alcohol out of lockup or track down more mix. Ridiculous. We were also shorted a comped roomThe worst part however is the fact they overbilled me $127, then took almost two months to refund the money. Finally after three emails the rep got back with us and said they had resolved the billing problem, and credited us for the inconvenience and phantom room.... for a total of 127. When i asked him what was the value they put on the sloppy service, since he only refunded us what they legally owed us they never replied.I'd rather host our next event out of a Chuck E Cheese.If I could give this place 0 stars I might very well have done it.  Where to start?  We had a group of 4, when arriving at the hotel dead tired and ready to pass out we find that instead of the 2 queens we reserved we have a room with just 1 king. Instead of any sort of apology, Ralph the front desk guy (who eerily resembled Lurch from Adams Family) merely offers a gruff ""that's all we have available"", he clearly seemed like he couldn't care less.  Since we only had one bed we requested a rollout bed as well as some pillows and blankets.  After waiting over 30 minutes we call the front desk to learn that the guy with the key is at the airport?  WTF, why would he not leave a key there, or why would a room with extra blankets need to be locked to start?  He was ""5"" minutes away though....  So about 30 minutes later our stuff finally arrives, yay!  Next morning, while about to take a much needed shower to my dismay I see that we are inexplicably in a handicapped room.  This means we get one of those god awful fake showers that has a portable shower head and stands about 4 feet tall at its peak.  So my choices are to use the shower head like a garden hose or bend down the entire team, fun choices!  To make things worse the shower was super sensitive with regards to temperature.  Moving the temperature gauge a millimeter meant changing the temp from scalding hot to cold, a good median temp was virtually impossible to find, halfway thru the shower when I had decided on scalding the temp decided to start fluctuating on its own, epic fail.  We were hoping to get some sort of basic foods or coffee for our trip ahead.  All that was available was a breakfast buffet for $10, no free continental breakfast, no thanks...  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that the setup of this place is an absolute clusterfck.  The only thing near the lobby are all the conference rooms, the rooms were a 10+ minute walk from the lobby, for a 1st room floor no less.  It really seemed like it was some sort of funeral home converted to a hotel.  The entire hotel stuff seemed grumpy or disinterested.  This whole place seemed like bizzaro world, the best part of this experience was getting the heck out of that nightmare.  They gave us a slight discount but quite frankly we absolutely should've got it comped after this experience.Comfortable hotel, attractive  well set up rooms, surprisingly upscale  upscale made for a pleasant stay. Nice bed. With a $10 buffet the only option for breakfast, we did not try the food.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-and-suites-downtown-columbus,Comfort Inn & Suites Downtown,3.0,$$,15,"A great place to stay. Affordable and in the heart of the brewery district , German Village and several other areas. The hotel is just south of downtown. The rooms are nicely furnished with a fridge/microwave   Their us an outdoor pool, funky lobby and clean. I will stay here my next visits to this areaIt feels like this place has had some renovations in the not-too distant past, and I generally like them. The rooms are spacious and clean and the beds are comfortable. The staff, especially the owner/manager, are very friendly. Breakfast is pretty much what you'd expect from a Choice Hotel in terms of waffles, pastries, eggs and meat. The hotel is in a convenient location - it borders the western end of German Village, and it's only a few minute's drive to downtown Columbus and Short North.Parking is challenging here, as the hotel's primary parking lot is limited. But they have plenty of spillover space in an adjacent parking lot. The amount of space you have to drive through between the spaces on the left and the entrance is quite narrow and 1-way. They can and do have cars towed which park inappropriately (I approve).Wi-Fi here is good. They have several domains to which you can connect via password.This hotel is pet-friendly. I learned that when I discovered that other guests located about 3 rooms down left a small, neglected yappy-type dog alone in their room for many hours last night. I wish I could give those people 1 star.Get Ready People here comes the pros&amp; cons of this Hotel......The Staff is Amazing!!! The Breakfast Was Pretty Good, The Closet Only had one Door so when my guests came to visite, they were able to see my belonging inside, Not!! cool, The Closest Mirror was horrible, looked like it was cleaned with pledge instead of windex, The pillows were amazing, bed also Comfy, but Sqeeked All night, The parking was horrible, free wifi was a plus, the elevator was slow, smelly&amp; looked like it was painted by a homeless man, but it had a fridge&amp; microwave in the room so we loved that....in conclusion If I came back to Town I would stay there again because of the affordable price.I don't recommend this hotel. The updates they have done are good, but the room was not clean at all. First our room smelled like a smoking room, and then the toilet was not clean. It was covered in what looked like men's hair that had been just been shaved and a bunch of yellow goop. I could add a picture, but I won't. It's just gross. This lead us to wonder if even our bed linens has been cleaned. The front desk lady never apologized just gave us a small discount for the problems. We even sent the pictures as requested by the front desk last to the owner and the SMALL discount was all he felt necessary. We were told by another worker the room would be free and this never happened. Spend the extra money and stay at the Hampton Inn.Very nice stay.... Hotel employees are very nice and helpful.... Great morning breakfast... VERY clean and comfortable bed!    Only thing bad I can say is that the elevator smells horribleMy boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel last weekend. We were in town from Chicago for the all-star game. I understand this is not a five star hotel but our experience at this hotel was horrible. We were fortunate enough to have pulled back the covers and take a quick look at the sheets before getting in and we were horrified to discover that our bed sheets were completely filthy and full of hair (short hairs and long hairs) all over; it was disgusting. We asked to have our room switched as well as to speak to a manager but the manager was not around and the front desk lady told us we need to speak to Renee or Nash. Anyway, we went into our new room and cautiously looked at our sheets once again and this time our sheets were fine but the comforter was gross. There was a huge yellow spot and spots of blood. We took the comforter off and just slept in the white sheets. The next morning as we checked out we asked for the manager, Nash, and he again was not around. Renee was at the front counter and we explained our dilemma and how unacceptable the uncleanliness of our room and bed was. She seemed uninterested and kept telling us that there was nothing she could do without Nash around (for a comp or a discount on our room). I showed her the pictures I took of the soiled sheets and she requested I sent them to her cellphone. I refused since I found that inappropriate. She wrote down a gmail address but again I was not sure if that was her personal email or not. We left our name and number with her for Nash to call us. I also emailed the email address on the Comfort Inn business card and never received a reply. We did not stay in that hotel another night but went to another hotel down the street. We called Nash the next day, he was not there and no call back, we called the hotel Monday, and then again yesterday, and we still have not heard back. The front desk girl, I believe her name was Brittany was no help and even said, ""I'll pass along the message but can't promise he'll call you."" It's Wednesday and no call back or reply via email. I will never stay at this hotel again or Comfort Inn. We are talking with the third party in which we booked our stay and they thankfully have been a major help and going to investigate the issue.I was VERY pleased with our recent stay. We were in town on vacation for a couple of days with the intention of exploring Columbus with our kids. I searched for weeks for the right hotel, but in the end, the Comfort Inn was over 50% less than other downtown hotels. I was preparing for a mediocre experience, but was really surprised. The location was great. Right in the middle of historic German Village, you could actually walk to a lot of the great parks downtown in just a few minutes. And everything you couldn't walk to, you could catch the free(until Dec 14) CBUS and it was a quick bus ride to all the great downtown locations, including Short North. The hotel room was great, clean and the staff was actually really excellent. We had a few issues trying to ask for early check-in so our kids could nap, but after that, everything was great. The breakfast was not great, but it was what I expected from a Comfort Inn breakfast so it didn't leave me super disappointed. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an incredible value.I've stayed at comparable places, not very clean, things old and broke down, but I  didn't have to pay $100.00 to stay at those other places. Every mirror in the room looked like they were cleaned with Vaseline, there was a giant greasy looking stain on the couch, the toilet seat was loose, there was masking tape holding up the trim around the corners, the down elevator button didn't work on the 3rd floor, there was no plate to sit things on in the microwave just the rack that holds the plate, the coffee pot was dirty, and both nightstands were greasy and sticky. I had to put hand towels on them so I could lay my phone and glasses down. If you don't mind these things and you are okay spending a hundred bucks then you will be happy here. I have to work 5 hours to make a hundred dollars so I wasn't happy with this place. On the up side, they didn't have a lot of guests so it was quiet.I accidentally booked a room via a third party website and on top of that, the wrong day (talk about needing a day off). However, Nash at the desk was so helpful even though they were fully booked and didn't have a room for me. He actually wanted to call me but he showed me the papers the third party sent and they dont even send contact info, just a name. So since the third party already took my money, he set me up with a discounted room nearby and set things up so that i didn't have to spend extra money to make up for my and the third party's mistake. I can't speak to the quality of rooms since I didn't stay, but from what I saw, everything else was very nice. The customer service was above and beyond, especially for someone who didn't even stay! Nash is someone who really wants you to be happy and help however he can.The rooms were clean and spacious with fairly comfortable beds and pillows. We stayed in this hotel on out way to and from Virginia this week and both times the deadbolt locks did not work and both nights were in different rooms.  I have to assume that most or none of the deadbolt locks work in this hotel. My sister and I were traveling alone so this was a big issue for us. We had to push a chair up against the door. Overall the experience was good but security should be a bigger concern for hotel management.This place is gross.  Completely gross.  My friends and had bug bites all over us the next morning.First of all, this place is now a Comfort Inn &amp; Suites.Secondly, this place is great.Last year, we thought we hit the deal of a lifetime when we got two cheap four-star hotels from Priceline. However, the exorbitantly high parking fees at each hotel forced us to hunt for free or lower-priced parking, which turned into a big hassle, especially when we were dealing with the inherent stress involved with my wife taking the Ohio Bar Exam.We were going back to Columbus so that I could take the Ohio Bar Exam. We didn't want to deal with finding parking, so we looked for places that had free parking. We got a great deal from Hotwire on this place. I was a bit nervous about the fact that it was a bit farther from the bar exam site than the hotels in which we stayed last year, especially given that I have immense trouble getting *anywhere* on time!Fortunately, everything not only turned out well with getting to the bar exam, but also with this hotel. My experience here made the entire bar exam process go MUCH easier. If my exam results turn out like this hotel did, I'll be a very happy Yelper!To be honest, the ONLY quibble I have about this place is that they advertised that they had a circular bar and a fitness center and that neither one was in operation when we went. The bar is permanently closed but the liquor is still there, and this sorta reminded me of the bar from the hotel in The Shining. Also, the fitness center is temporarily closed, but I was told that they're getting new equipment.Everything else about this hotel was fantastic and was either as good as or better than the four-star hotels in which we stayed last year. The continental breakfast was free, wonderful, and had a full array of breads, meats, cereals, and eggs. If it hadn't been for the bar exam, I'm sure I would have loved it even more--hard to eat when one's stomach is in knots! The room was clean and spacious. The television had almost as many cable channels as we have at home and had some of the rarer channels like Bravo and Hallmark (Sheila F. loves The Golden Girls!) too. The outdoor pool was great. Best of all, there was plenty of free parking. The hotel's lot is small but they allow you to park in an adjacent lot that's quite close. Oh yeah, there's free WiFi too! I have no idea why this place isn't more popular....free parking, cheap rates, and an abundant continental breakfast make for a fantastic stay!This place was kind of blah.  The hallway had a persistent wet-dog aroma and the room smelled like a gym locker-room.  There were some beer cans in the stairwell that remained there for the entire three days I was there, also some dirty linens sitting on the air conditioner in the hall.  One of the towels in the bathroom had a long black hair hanging off it.  One morning there was no hot water.  On a positive note, the guy at the front desk was super nice, the parking is free, and the area around the hotel is really cool.  It's next to a neighborhood called ""German Village"" or something like that, and it is absolutely gorgeous, just walking around in that picturesque neighborhood was awesome.  There are also a few really good restaurants and bars in the area.  Definitely enjoy the walk from the hotel to Schmidt's Sausage Haus and get yourself some incredible schnitzel.  I really love this location, but personally I'd rather pop the extra money for a nicer hotel around there next time.This review is based upon my in-laws staying here while visiting us while we were living in German Village.This by far is you cheapest ""name brand"" hotel option in the downtown area. The price of what they paid is comparable to the room and service they received.The room was spacious, with a generous seating area. While the decor was done in country floral, I've seen worse hotels for the same price. The area around the hotel is full of tons of food and shopping options, being sandwiched between two historic districts (German Village and Brewery District). By the way, avoid the clarmont restaurant next door... it sucks..I stayed here for a week during November 2008.  The hotel is not very fancy, but the room was indeed clean and spacious.  Our room even had a sitting area, complete with sofa, chair and coffee-table. **Insider tip: forgo the coffee in the hallway; it's bitter.  Opt instead to use the tiny coffee pot in your room.  Run once with water, first, to clear out any  potential dust from not being used.  It works just fine.",,,,,"['great', 'place', 'affordable', 'heart', 'brewery', 'district', 'village', 'several', 'areas', 'hotel', 'south', 'downtown', 'rooms', 'nicely', 'furnished', 'fridge',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-polaris-columbus-2,Hilton Polaris,4.0,$$$,30,"This is a top notch place.  Very clean and quiet rooms with nice amenities. The 9th floor has a nice executive lounge (I was in room 918). Front desk staff was very friendly.  The front lobby is very modern and hip looking I would definitely stay here again.Probably the BEST Hilton I have stayed.Fresh look, very modern amenities, and the staff is above and beyond the competition.We did not try the restaurant and/or the bar, but the pool and hot tub were wonderful.The room is great, it has a fridge (which I am finding more and more uncommon in rooms), has a very  spacious bathroom and a great view.  The complimentary Wifi is great, and the complimentary 5 mile shuttle is a nice touch.  The biggest problem is the worlds worst shower.  It is the most low flow shower head I have ever seen.  It was really hard to take a shower, and I'm a guy, idk what a woman would think, but it would probably be twice as bad for them.  The spa is nice, I used it for a massage the last time I was here.  Rates are fair and the service was good.  If you want a cheap, quick massage just run up to the mall and get one up there.  The hotel is pretty far if you want to go downtown Columbus, but perfect if you are just visiting the area.  The mall is awesome and there is plenty to do in the immediate area, and great places to eat too!I can finally share the truth. So you would think this hotel would be lovely to get married yes, just the building itself is good but I'm not talking about the service here. I cannot recommend this place anymore for any bride or groom after my experience during my wedding.I went in for 2 taste testings and you would think the hotel would get it right on the wedding day. Nope, every guest came up to me and said how all the vegetables were barely cooked. You could barely cut up your brussel sprouts. The chicken was not flavorful. They only thing that was actually good at my wedding was the cake which didn't even come from the Hilton Hotel.Later on that evening we got the complimentary room. Although we did not need a phone call saying the champagne and strawberries are late do you still want them? My husband says sure and we only drink less than half the bottle and give it away. Let's just say, I was being nice and not telling them how I really thought of my overall experience at their location.The bar and restaurant food is wonderful. Great people, great food and great waiters. We stay here a lot but we also just come for the restaurant.Stayed at the Hilton Polaris July 24 -     July 26. The hotel is located in a great area and, the mall is right next door and there are its of restaurants nearby.  The lobby is very modern, Our room was very spacious and clean and the bed was comfortable.   I would definitely recommend.(I'm staying here right now as I write this...I have three young children with me.)You can tell the true character of a place by paying attention to what happens when something goes awry. Our room service delivery guy dropped a glass of lemonade, and the glass broke, sending tiny shards of glass all over the carpet of our suite.I asked if he was alright and immediately began helping him clean up. He graciously objected to my help, but I insisted.  As we patiently picked up the tiny shards together (he handled most of it), he asked why we were in town and where we were from.  (Cleveland.  A youth basketball tournament.)When he finished, he hurried downstairs to bring us a new lemonade. He also returned with some energy bars for the kids to put in their bags for the basketball tournament. And even though I repeatedly told him we were not inconvenienced, not bothered, and understood that accidents happened, he wouldn't let us pay for our breakfast.  Which, by the way, was served hot and delicious. He was one of the nicest, most courteous, thoughtful, and service-oriented people I ever met.  And he remained that way throughout what may have been a stressful situation for him.  We're here for a couple more days. I will never choose a different hotel in Columbus.I really enjoyed my stay here.  It was a pretty last minute reservation, and they were still able to accommodate my fragrance free room request. The price was very reasonable. The sheets did not smell, which is very important to me.  They still gave me toiletries, but I just removed those from the room.  The lobby has a beautiful fireplace, and great seating for just hanging out.  The rooms are updated, modern.  The water pressure was AMAZING. It felt like a waterfall. Seriously.  I'll definitely stay here again.Had a luncheon and they ran out of food. Gave me a small what looked to be half eaten vegetarian plate. When I explained that I had paid for a full meal they said sorry and walked way.. Never been treated so poorly by a staff in my travels. They're are better options close by.PROs:Really quite a lovely hotel. Lobby is fashionable and comfortable upscale decor.Services thus far have been good but we haven't asked for much.Check in was easy enough and staff has been quite friendly.Room is beautiful. Nicely appointed. The bathroom is quite nice as well. It has an amazing magnifying mirror.We are very pleased at the decor and ammenities.Location is fantastic. Mall and a million restaurants right next door.CONS:Disappointed that Hilton doesn't have any sort of welcome pack for the kids...no activity book, wiki stix , crayons, snack, tub toy...nothing.So many hotels are wonderful about having a little something for their smaller guests. Sad that Hilton hasnt thought this was important.The sensor light in the bathroom was a nice touch until you need to go to the bathroom in the middle if the night-blinding!The beds and pillows flat out suck. I have never had such a bad nights sleep at a hotel. If you can bring your own pillow, do so. They are a mushy lump that flattens over time leaving no support what so ever.The bed it self is flat and jiggles every time anyone moves. Every time my husband rolled over and moved in any way the whole bed shook and woke me from sleep.The bathroom door is heavy and solid to muffle noise but the main room door isn't. You can hear every conversation of passing people.The floors are not well insulated we heard footsteps above us like a herd of elephants. I spent most of the time telling my kids to walk softly as to not disturb people below us. Breakfast was ok. Clearly the dining room is a bit small for a hotel this size.The Buffett was fair. I've had better scrambled eggs and it seems like the mixed berries were frozen prior.I would love to stay here again based on its location and decor but the bed and pillows were so bad and I value a good nights sleep far more.Hotel bar maybe the most inviting place I've ever stayed. Beth the bar tender was gracious and quite entertaining. Loved my expierence!!!Nice clean and spacious . They have free internet in all the rooms and the staff ia really nice. Especially Kathy! Shes awesome. They have a shuttlw that will take you within a 5 mile radius of the hotel and give you a lift from the airport. The convention rooms are nice and large, but the rooms are freezing so be sure to bring a jacket!Hilton Polaris Hotel looks from the outside like any other Interstate hotel.This is a well-run, clean, modern and hip hotel with friendly and helpful staffModern workstation area (pics uploaded). Usual comfy Hilton Beds.Wi-Fi works reliablyExecutive Lounge offers a happy hour. Mix of beer, wine and booze at reduced prices compared with the bar area. Complimentary simple breakfast is offered with fresh fruit. During the day, the lounge is open for complimentary coffee, snacks, water and soda.Tip:  Check out the Polaris Grill for dinner, nearby at 1835 Polaris Pkwy, as recommended by the Exec Lounge Staff.If you think this review with photos is useful, funny or cool, I'd appreciate your feedback by clicking below.Very nice, clean rooms.  The standard rooms are a bit more spacious than you'd expect.  Lots of room to move around.  The beds and pillows are quite comfortable.  I found the staff to be a little less friendly than I'd expect.Stayed here with my husband for his birthday. The pool and hot tub are very clean and the exercise equipment is well maintaimed. The rooms are clean and the staff friendly. A very pleasant stay.Such a beautiful hotel and meeting facility!  Kind of sad that I was in meetings all day and couldn't really enjoy the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and the Polaris mall is right next door!Conveniently located less than a mile from the Interstate. And also next door to a huge mall. Front lobby is nicely decorated and a fireplace in the winter months makes it cozy.Like the reviews say, they have a very nice lobby.  I stayed here for a work trip.  Service was above par.  Although, the front desk agent didn't offer any assistance with my luggage even though it was noticeable my hands were full.  But that was no biggie.  My room was clean.I would stay here again.I booked a room for my husbands birthday so we could get away from the kids. The room was very nice and the bed was super comfy. The staff was very friendly as well! We also ordered room service and the food we ordered was excellent. They also brought has a wine opener since we had brought our own wine and forgot our wine opener at home. Overall the place and our stay was excellent!Great hotel. Great management. Without question this hotel is one of the best, if not best Hilton Garden Inns in the brand. Outstanding location. Highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Polaris","The bar at Hilton even though has excellent drink choices and an excellent menu, the ambience is dull. The bright lights with no background music makes this great bar into a poor waiting area bar. I wish they could change it up to be more of an upscale lounge, I would frequent this bar.This hotel is excellent. It's across the street from the mall. The room was clean and everything in it worked. The indoor pool is cleaning and functional. The halls are quiet. The bar restaurant is amazing. Service at the front desk was fast and easy.I wanted to love this hotel. It was pretty on the surface but the lack of service and cleanliness was shocking. Here's a few things we noticed:-rolling papers stuck to the guest directory in our room-long dark hair in the sink-eye makeup on the towels-long hair baked into the cookies we ordered-nasty, funky smell in our roomMy favorite part was when we took the guest directory to the front desk with the rolling papers stuck on it. When we returned to the room, the book was back in the room, but they left the imprint of the papers on it....they didn't even clean it off...pretty nasty!When we (very nicely) spoke to the front desk for a second time about our issues, we recieved no apology, just a  ""We can't move you, we are all booked"". It was very dissapointing and I would not recommend this hotel for anyone.I spent last Saturday and Sunday night at the Hilton Polaris while in town for my sister's wedding. Here are my impressions.The hotel itself is very new and looks so both inside and out. My room was well furnished with a flat-screen TV, king side bed, and desk. It was clean and the AC worked great as well. The only drawback was the location of the room, which was right by the elevators (meaning that I could hear all of the conversation and running around in the hallways late at night). While I didn't dine in the restaurant(s) downstairs, I did order room service on three occasions -- twice for dinner and once for breakfast. Not only was the service lightning fast (my orders each arrived with 15 minutes) but the quality of the food was awesome. I enjoyed the club sandwich I had on Saturday night so much that I had the same on Sunday night! The bacon and egg breakfast on Monday morning was just great as well. I've stayed in tons of hotels over the years while traveling on business and this one had the best room service I'd ever had in terms of the quality of food and the speed and courtesy of the service.There is plenty of great shopping and dining in the area as well, although I didn't have the opportunity to sample any of the local eateries.I would highly recommend the Hilton Polaris in Columbus.The hotel has a great location. The rooms are very clean and new. The hotel has an excellent bar and restaurant inside, however many tastey places are located close by. I definitely recommend staying here.I have stayed in MANY Hilton Garden Inns, and this was by far the best one yet! The room was spotless, the bed comfortable, and the breakfast tasty, but the thing that really made the visit special was the staff. Every single person was unfailingly kind and friendly. We were stressed from car trouble on the road, and their sympathy was much appreciated. There were guests up late watching a bowl game, so the staff kept the bar open late, which have us a chance to get a much needed drink before bed. They arranged late checkout so I could relax in the room while my husband took the car for service. The restaurant staff handled my food allergies with aplomb, and even put my breakfast on a silver tray so I could take it up to my room. Altogether, this was an outstanding visit! I would unreservedly recommend this hotel to anyone, and if I'm ever back in Columbus, I know where I'll be staying.First my big complaint - lack of power outlets.  While the lamps on the work desk were stylish, I would have preferred ones with electric outlets.  My other complaint about this hotel, and many others, is there air conditioning preset - 67 degrees.  Haven't they heard about energy &amp; climate problems?I got a pretty good sized suite, with a separate living room and a large bathroom, at the end of the hall.  This hotel is new and doesn't show any wear.  I ate dinner at the bar, and lunch in the restaurant, and both were decent.I also presented at a conference there, and the conference setup was pretty goodAs 2 stars indicate, I've done better.  For less money. The rooms are quite nice.  Clean. Cleaning crews at a civilized time and quiet. However a decent breakfast is important to me. In that respect, the Hilton Polaris fails miserably. Start with whoever laid out the restaurant should be fired. 4 walls, as one would expect, 3 with access points (doors), 2 on the far wall are the kitchen and those doors are lined up with the 2 main aisles. It's like sitting in Grand Central Station.  Acoustics are terrible, high ceiling, hard surfaces. The decor is a mess.  It can't be described, it's just a mess.When we travel to Ohio, we like to think of it as a trip to the country. You know, farms, fresh food, good stuff. In all honesty, our party had not had as bad food since we were all in college over 40 years ago. The eggs had pee like yellow spots for yolks.  Fortunately they tasted of nothing. Espresso made with powdered mix and terrible. The coffee it was replaced with was burned and acrid. Sausages were filled chemical derived favors and the meat itself was simply garbage.  Butter, what's that?  Though it was called butter. Dinner, we took a peek as we were curious. Same mess with noise and activity.  The food we saw brought back memories of college cafeteria food.  No compelling smells. How in the world a place surrounded by farms can't get decent food is beyond me.What's really weird is the Hilton Garden Inn across the street has a very good breakfast, good coffee, great staff and costs less per night. And I may as well join the AC chorus. Yes the rooms are freezing, turning the thermostat takes about a day to effect any temperature change.  It's also noisy and runs all the time.  Bring some needle nose pliers, you will understand why when you get there.I stayed at this Hilton for a work trip, and I thought it was great!  The hotel is modern and has very nice decor.  The lobby and bar were great for me and my co-workers to chat after our conference.  It is also conveniently located (as long as you don't mind jogging across some busy roads) next to a pretty nice mall with a lot of restaurants.I ordered room service for dinner the first night I was there.  The portions were larger than I expected and they brought it up very quickly.  The rooms were really quiet.  I was near the elevator and am a very light sleeper, so I was pretty nervous about that.  However, I didn't hear anything from either the hallway or other rooms.  The best part - the staff was super friendly and accommodating.  The shuttle driver to and from the airport was pleasant to chat with and literally ran around the shuttle to open and close doors for people.  The front desk made sure that I had a shuttle at the exact time I requested to make my flight to the airport, even though I could tell it wasn't very convenient for their staff.  Walking around the hotel, the staff always made eye contact and smiled, which I appreciate.    I really enjoyed my time at this hotel!Beautiful new Hilton. Close to everything: shopping and restaurants.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-suites-columbus-columbus-3,Sheraton Suites Columbus,3.0,$$,37,"Stayed here three nights for business.The staff was friendly and helpful, check-in and check-out went with no issues.  The room was a king-bed suite, and it appeared to be clean and tidy.  The linens also appeared to be clean, with no issues there.  I didn't notice any off-putting smells in the room.  The room was also mostly quiet (I could hear the shower running a little bit from the room next door).  I admit that I like to keep the fan running in the room at all times if possible, because it adds a bit of ""white noise"" to help block other sounds, and I was pleased to find the HVAC controls in the room allowed for that.  In fact, I could choose from low, medium, or high speed, which was pretty nice.  Temps in the room stayed constant with no wild swings, and the water temp &amp; pressure in the shower also stayed constant with no fluctuations there either.My room had a microwave, fridge, and coffee maker.  There were also complimentary bottles of water provided.  Free wi-fi was available, and it seemed to work just fine.The hotel is located in an area with lots of restaurants within walking distance (or a short drive).  There's no reason to go hungry in that area.  It's a very short drive to the interstate, despite the road construction that's been an ongoing project for quite a while.I did not sample the in-house restaurant/bar, fitness room, or pools.So a couple of points to make which lowered my rating down to three stars:While the room itself seemed to be overall clean, the carpet in the hallway needs to be cleaned. There were several fairly good sized stains in the carpet, and there's no reason not to address those.  Also, some of the trim around door openings (especially at the service elevator) is worn and in need of replacement.  Minor thing, but it's all about appearance.Also, the couch had some sort of white stuff on it.  Not really sure what it was, but it was ground in.  Again, like the carpet and the trim, not a huge deal - but it's a matter of appearance.Again, some might see this as a nit-picky thing, but those who are safety oriented will understand this comment.  There were quite a large number of padded chairs stored at the bottom of one of the exit stairwells.  The last place anything combustible should ever be stored is in an exit stairwell.  This has nothing to do with anyone's stay, unless you need that stairway in an emergency.  That's a life safety/fire safety issue.  Hotel management should seriously reconsider that practice, as it's also against fire code in many places.Overall I was pleased with the stay, and would not hesitate to stay here again.- Friendly staff- Decent rooms- The A/C works well- The breakfast buffet is below average- Only three treadmills in the gym and one was broken and another's tv didn't workNo issues with check in or check out (a couple of mess ups on their end but nothing that ruined my stay).  They made a few errors but fixed each one--annoying.  My key cards kept malfuctioning which was annoying and the elevators can be slow at peak times.  This place is in the middle of nowhere and a hour bus ride to downtown Columbus.  Food was fine.  Best part was they give you a five dollar voucher for use at the restaurant if you don't have the maid clean your room and that was awesome--the veggie wrap for lunch was really good--all other food was fine.  Friendly staff all around.This hotel was awful!! We stayed here one night and that was one night too many. The staff was rude and when we went to then to address our concerns they told us that we were only staying there one night so it wasn't there problem. I have never been treated so poorly at a hotel ever. We will never be staying at this hotel again.I booked a night at Sheraton Suites through Hotwire. The rate was ~ $75 per night after fees and taxes. I had a pleasant stay at Sheraton Suites and would definitely return given the low rates.The first thing you should know is that the hotel is located just outside the Outerbelt (I-270) in the Worthington suburb, which is about 15 minutes from downtown Columbus. With that said, it's a quick drive downtown and Sheraton Suites is conveniently located next to the freeway. With that said, there are plenty of chain restaurants and shops within driving and even walking distance. For example, there's a Chipotle, Bob Evans, a Japanese restaurant, a German restaurant, 2 steak houses and multiple bars within stumbling distance. The rooms are suite style with a single king bed, 2 TVs, a convertible sofa bed and a bathroom accessible by both the bedroom and living room. I would estimate the overall size of the room to be about 300 square feet. The suite can easily sleep 4 without any issues.I found the suite to be clean. I had no noise issues, even though the hotel seems to attract a steady stream of business and sports team travelers. There is plenty of free parking in their lot. My only gripes are the lack of free Wifi in the rooms and the lack of a complimentary breakfast. However at $60-70 per night, I shouldn't complain. I would definitely come back!What a nice surprise! Great location, spacious rooms, clean, and bright. Dogs allowed, as with many Sheraton / SPG properties. Club Lounge was fantastic, though we weren't up early enough to take advantage of breakfast. Coffee maker, microwave and fridge in room. Lots of places to eat around the hotel; most of them close by 11:00pm.We just stayed here again and as before, overall this place is a winner.  The suite setup is kind of posh-- a living room with sofa, mini-fridge, microwave, flat screen, dining table; open a pair of french doors and enter a bedroom with a king-size bed, another flat screen, nightstands.  It allows both the early riser and the night owl the appropriate options for peace and quiet.I cannot recommend the restaurant however; we had breakfast again there, and it was just mediocre to below average food for the buffet selection.  It was so unappetizing that I passed on the buffet, and we had a breakfast coupon that had the breakfast in the room rate.  My wife confirmed however, it was a poor attempt at a buffet.  Other than this item, we enjoyed our stay and will absolutely return.  I'll just have to find a nice breakfast joint nearby, which won't be difficult.My wife and I were traveling last minute and needed to find reservations on the road. Based on a few previous experiences with Sheraton Suites and the competitive price for the busy weekend we settled on this one. $125 for the room, but read on...Upon arrival the staff seemed friendly enough, but the parking was limited. Our room was spacious enough for a suite but the finishes seemed outdated. The bathroom looked clean but smelled dank and moldy.  The couch in the living area had a substantial food stain in one of the cushions and was worn--along with all of the other furniture in the area.The worst part of the overall experience was the cost. The staff were sure to explain the use of a debit card was not the best choice as a hold would be placed on funds to cover any extra costs incurred. We are not big on room service, so we assumed this wouldn't be an issue. The next morning we found the breakfast cost an additional $14 per person and it consisted of about what I would consider average for a holiday inn breakfast. In addition we used the coffee and tea provided in our room to the tune of $4 per person and a bottle of water in the fridge for another $4. We are regular travelers and this type of shady tactic is the opposite of what I expect from the ""hospitality"" industry. Needless to say, we won't be returning.Between the bartender, and the customers we encountered here... I'm not sure I've encountered a more rude atmosphere. Will never be back.I'm definitely not pleased with this place, this place is outdated and the price was 209.00 for a Saturday night with a AAA discount! I paid less at the beautiful Sheraton downtown Columbus just last week on the 4th of July!!!!!! And we had a view of the capital. Don't waste your money here,the customer service wasn't great either.Had a great stay.  We got a fantastic rate with a wedding group. There are a number of good bars and restaurants in easy walking distance.Traveling with children was no problem and the hotel was very accommodating. The hotel supplied a crib and it was both sturdy and nice. The sound insulation between rooms was excellent so we didn't have to worry about a fussy baby bothering our neighbors. We ended up leaving some clothes in our room after departure.  The staff found them quickly and got them Fedex'ed to us the next day.This place is horrendous. Constantly overbooking, very rude to people, and they do not communicate anything to their guests. Overbooked by ten this weekend and had very angry people. I would not stay here even if it were free. The only good thing about the hotel is Sammy the bartender. By far the best in town.We stayed here for 2 nights and would not recommend it to anyone. Upon walking in our room the smell was overwhelming. The bathroom stunk! We had to shut both doors connected to the bathroom (to the bedroom &amp; to the living room) just to make the room smell somewhat okay. We requested air freshener but they never brought us any after they said they would. We avoided the bathroom at all costs it was seriously THAT bad. I think it was either a plumbing or mold issue. We chose this hotel because it was dog friendly but the grass area was limited and covered in poop. The pool is supposed to be heated &amp; said it was 85 degrees but the water was freezing cold. We will not return. For how much we spent we could have stayed at a much nicer hotel.I like this hotel.  When we travel we don't spend a lot of time in rooms, the extend of our stays can be summed up as we close our eyes, wake up and leave. I can see if you had to actually spend some time here how the suite thing would work nice. The room has 2 tvs, a desk and a comfortable sofa. We travel a lot for work, but even then so we only stay in a hotel once, maybe twice a month. The problem for us with travel is that I have a finicky back and my husband has a sensitive neck, so comfort is a big thing for us. I love Sheraton beds, they are plush and super soft, while at the same time firm enough to not wreck my back. The hotel is clean, updated and modern,  and upon check in both clerks were friendly and helpful. Parking is free, and the hotel seems to be in a quiet location. A movie theater and some restaurants are in the surrounding area. I refuse to pay $14 for a Sysco hotel breakfast, but the restaurant and bar area looked nice.Nice, clean hotel in the greater Columbus area.  We booked this hotel through Hotwire for one night while relocating cross country to Arizona.  The price was great, rooms were clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Everything that we could expect, and honestly, even a little above.  The suite included a fridge/freezer, as well as a microwave. A nice touch that was quite appreciated. The large living area with separate couch provided a nice little respite after a long drive from NYC. As another reviewer said, this hotel is definitely NOT near downtown, but no more than a 20 minute drive in no traffic.  Also, they really should offer free WiFi.  However, if we should ever be back in Columbus, we would definitely stay here again!I would never recommend this hotel. We too booked it on Hotwire as we were driving cross country. After 10 hrs of driving we just wanted a hot shower and a clean bed. We got neither. They put us in a handicapped room with one of those horrible plastic handheld shower things. My husband called the front desk and they offered us a room with two double beds. We should've taken it! The shower was ridiculous. It barely sprayed, kept falling down and I didn't feel much cleaner for having taken it. When I got out and grabbed a towel to dry off with, it was dirty. You could tell it had been washed but somewhere between the laundry and our room it had come in contact with something black. It was all over that one towel. Thankfully the other two towels were clean though.      The furnishings in the room were just as pictured online, except about 10 yrs older! The couch was so stained and worn out. We didn't even sit on it. The desk had no shine left on it and felt grimy. Both my husband and I stepped on a staple or nail coming up from the area that had once been carpeted in front of the bathroom. There was a big patch of carpet missing there. The linens on the bed were nice and clean on top but the sheets and comforter underneath were stained. The comforter was yellowed and also had what appeared to be blood from a small cut on it.       Just gross and disappointing. Stay away. There are so many hotels in Columbus.Nice suites. It's about 300 sq ft so it's not bad for 2 folks size wise. There's a separate living room area with TV and a small desk. They also provide a fridge, coffee maker, microwave and iPod dock. The bathroom has access to both living room and bedroom. The bedroom has its own TV. The area is pretty decent. It's right next to other hotels/motels and there are a lot of restaurants too. They have their own restaurant and a decent entree selection for room service.I have never stayed at this hotel, but from a customer service stand point, I have had a terrible time with Sheraton Suites, as well as their main chain Starwoods Hotel. I have never been spoken to with such a lack of empathy, lack of concern and harsh condescension in my life. When I tried booking a room through one of their sister hotels, there were several problems including; double booking, booking at the wrong hotel, as well charging my card immediately (for both rooms). I never even received a confirmation email. Due to the laundry list of problems that occurred, the only thing I can think happened was a computer error. I called frantically, and was completely disappointed in how I was treated. I was told the only explanation for all of the mistakes was that I did everything wrong. I was sent through the ringer with several employees, promised phone calls I never received, until finally speaking with the hotel cancellation manager who finally agreed to give me a complete refund, only after warning that I ""need to be careful in the future"". One week later and I still haven't received my money back. I am in the customer service industry and have never given a bad review in my life. The only thing that I can take away from this terrible experience is to always do as much as I can to accommodate my clients, so they never feel as inadequate and frustrated as I feel/felt. As well as I will never stay at this hotel chain.Good hotel in a pretty convenient area. We picked this hotel because we were bringing our dog and we also have a 4 month old. The suite layout is great for us when traveling with our son because when he goes to bed at 8 we aren't forced into bed. We can easily put him in the bedroom with the doors closed and watch tv in the other room and still access the bathroom without going into the bedroom. Total win! The rooms are also comfortable, I love the beds and pillows and sleep so good. The room comes with a mini fridge as well. Pool was nice as was the hot tub and when we were there was empty. My old reason for the lower rating is the front desk. It seemed as though we were really bothering them when we went to check in, like it was taking away from there fun time. They quickly checked us in and gave us our room keys all while saying MAYBE 2 sentences to us. Bad impression right away and definitely not a way to welcome guests.This hotel has a convenient location basically right off I-270 and US23 (although you have to snake your way back to it on the side streets).  There are movie theatre and lots of restaurants nearby. All of the rooms are Big (all suites, hence the name :). Free computer &amp; Internet access in the lobby.  There is both an outdoor and indoor pool, although they are pretty small considering how many rooms there are.  The weekend we stayed there, there were multiple kids sports teams staying there, so it was pretty crowded.The lobby restaurant is just OK.  I would recommend the Bob Evans restaurant nearby for breakfast, or there are lots of dinner choices within walking distance.","I won this on Priceline for $45/night, and thought I got a steal of a deal.  The suite was well-appointed (two flat screen TV's, for instance) and modern, and the bed was very comfortable.  As expected, wifi wasn't free in the rooms, but it was in the lobby and this was sufficient for me.Customer service was great.  I had a random craving for milk in the middle of the night, and the guy at the front desk went into the kitchen to get me a small carton at no charge.Only a couple of quibbles: First, shower water pressure was lacking.  Second, the fitness center was unimpressive.  It's more of a cardio center (plus a few dumbbells), and the elliptical machines weren't set up to operate correctly.Check-in was okay. We were in on a Sunday afternoon and the front desk associate seemed generally uncaring but not rude - this didn't bother me terribly, but I know up-front service is a big deal to some so just an fyi. We requested a crib and it was brought up to us promptly.We stayed in a king room. The layout was lovely with nice french doors separating the living space from the bedroom, with a flat screen in both rooms. The outdoor pool space looked like it would be an awesome area with a grill and a bar, but it was closed the day we were there and we had a baby with us anyway. Cool environment, it seemed. The pool was a pool, area was kept clean, no complaints there.Our room smelled like cigarette smoke. I didn't request a room change because it didn't really bother me. The fact that a pet had recently been in that room did, however. I understand it's a pet-friendly hotel so I'm not docking points here. Dander is hard to get rid of. Apparently so is cigarette smoke. The other downer is that while the room looked to be recently updated, all the furniture seemed kind of shabby and beat up, as if that's where all the partiers stay. There are so many options at this exit to stay at, I may or may no stay here again. The reason we chose this property was because of the rate ($79) and it was close the zoo and we were only taking a mini-vacation with our daughter. If I were to stay here again, I smell-check the room first.WIth the limited Starwood properties in Cbus, I figured I'd give this a shot (after almost always staying at the Westin -- which sucks). Super cheap rate.  Hotel is in an area of town around, seriously---20 other hotels and at least 20 restaurants (all in one-ish square miles). Old property.  Really, really in need of lots of work (but I can't complain due to low rate). Spacious suite-style rooms.  Plenty of room for a family if you're on a budget.  I have to stay that staff were a tad rude and not that helpful.  Wireless was down for half of my stay and they didn't seem too concerned about getting it back up.  Overall, ok stay.I have stayed at this hotel nearly every week for the last 8 months, and I've simply had enough.  The staff at this hotel (with the except of maybe 1 guy) either do not try or do know how to be hospitable.  I am just so fed up with the staff, I have to call it quits.  Sure, I'll miss the SPG points and status, but it's just not worth it.Besides the staff, the facility itself also leaves much to be desired- poor internet quality, gross couches in the room, a poor excuse for a workout facility... but it all came down to the staff not being responsive to the needs of the guests and not being able to think outside of 'policy.'A couple of clowns run this hotel. They booked my reservation, took my money and then sold out the damn hotel. Crooks and bums. Stay far far away!! Zero interest in making things right for customers.This was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in, I've stayed in roach motels at the beach that were awesome compared to this. I was here for business over the past week and there are so many different things I can list. At first impression it looks like a great hotel: Corporate side - there's no free wifi, it says there is but there is not and it's $10 per day per device to get Internet in the rooms. There is no continental breakfast, the restaurant down in the lobby charges outrageous prices for a small glass of orange juice and bagel.Hotel Side - the rooms looked clean when we got there but everything steadily went down hill fast. The person I was rooming with and mine own keys kept locking us out of the room and would not work, by the end of it we only had 2 mix-matched keys that would work after 3 days of having them reset 4 or 5 times. The shuttle service was pretty much useless since nothing (including the airport) was within 3 miles, and they would not pick me up from the airport so I had to take a $40 taxi. Some of our groups rooms were not cleaned even when they asked them to be cleaned. Every time I went back to my room my bag and stuff had been moved to a different location and I don't mind my room being cleaned but don't move my stuff. My roommate and I got placed in a handicap room, needless to say there was no bathroom door because it was a small thin sliding partition; and when rooming with someone you have never met before that makes for a very awkward event showering or going to the bathroom. Our company had contracted for the hotel to make us lunch so we could all eat together, the food was a joke and was terrible; I had fast food across the street that was better. Some people who were supposed to stay the last night for flights out of the city the next day ended up having no room, they were clearly booked in the system and there were records of it being from monday to saturday but the rooms had been double booked out from under them on the last day, so they had to go to a different hotel the very last night. And probably the worst thing is after staying there for 4 nights I now have bites all over me where my skin touched the bed, I don't know if they are flea bites (they allowed pets in the rooms) or bed bugs but I am very disturbed by it.Conclusion, if I could give the score a half star or no star at all I would. I will never stay at a Sheraton again.I DID NOT STAY HERE BUT.....I have to give a review and five star awesomeness to the staff. I was having a horrible allergy attatck and my hotel, the Hyatt Place, did not have a gift shop or sell medicine. I called around to a few hotels in the area that were walking distance (Doubletree and one more I forgot) and the Sheraton was the oly hotel with a gift shop and Benadryl. But oh nom that is not even the best part. So i walk over there (like a 7 minute walk, I can see the hotel from the parking lot of the Hyatt) and when I get there, the manager working the front desk whom I spoke to on the phone had the medicine there waiting for me! I am only really happy about this because it was the last one and he saved it for me which I appreciate greatly. But wait, it gets better!The manager then tells the shuttle bus driver to give me a ride back to my hotel!!! I wasn't even staying at the Sheraton but he asks the driver to drive me to MY hotel! I thanked him and told him i did not mind walking since it was just around the corner, but he insisted, saying that my allergies could get worse and I should stay inside.OMG!!! How nice they are!! The driver was so sweet too, she was very friendly and would not even take a tip.So I had to give a review for their niceness :-)Good deal on Priceline for 50 bucks a night (not including internet access).  This is a great hotel for a business traveler, lots of restaurants within walking distance and a short drive to Polaris Mall.There is an indoor pool and restaurant in this hotel as well.  Bed was very comfy.I am normally nominally annoyed/aggravated by hotels and their staff.  this was completely different.   The young lady at the front desk was so nice- found my rewards number that I'd lost, even looked through a few addresses to see which one it was I'd registered with (and failed to update) and applied my stay.  I was particularly flustered after a day of house/apt hunting and in no mood to deal with a hotel check in, but she made me laugh and told me a story about a relative's hard time with a house too.  She even offered me a few amenities ( I chose the loofah thingy)  and wished me well on house hunting.  the room itself is nice.  bed comfy and after the last 3 hotels I've stayed in that have smelled oddly of urine and animals, this was a welcome respite.  I did not have to buy benadryl to sleep due to thin walls, heavy tollbooth traffic, etc.  Very nice for the area.  Only real con is that a 24 hr wifi block cost $9.95.  No free surfing. :-(  but didn't really matter since i could sleep and didn't need 24 hrs of Netflix to live.If I weren't the only one staying in the room, perhaps I'd have felt claustrophobic.  The bedrooms are separated from the main living area, and both are well-appointed.Staff is very helpful and cordial, and were shocked that I was there, driving during some level # snowstorm, something this visitor from Phoenix had no idea what the hell it meant.  Close to a bunch of stuff, but as Ben mentioned, it's more conducive to driving than walking, though during my stay there was no way in hell I was going to be out walking in sub-zero temperatures in the snow (something I hadn't seen for 4+ years).No free internet (boo) but there's a Panera close where you can surf the net to your heart's content.  Also has both an indoor and outdoor pool, but I obviously only used the indoor hottub to try and defrost my body.I was travelling to Columbus on business, to attend a training class and was quite pleased with the Suite that I had (being SPG Platinum boosted me up to the Executive floor)Rooms are very well insulated, floor was quiet, staff was friendly and efficient. They are about the size of the Homewood Suites ones I have stayed in, perhaps a tad smaller, but not noticeably so.The hotel has an ATT Wi-Fi network which you can use as part of a regular subscription to any of their roaming partners, so wi-fi was covered as well.The breakfast buffet was about average for a Sheraton. Not a lot of imagination, but had most of the basics. You can order omelets or take a look at their more extended breakfast menu if desired.This Sheraton does not have a club lounge, but has three private-access floors.We don't travel to Columbus to sightsee.   We're here for business or to visit extended family.  As such, it doesn't matter to us that this hotel isn't close to the Zoo, OSU, the Brewery District, Polaris, or Easton.It's quiet, there's plenty of kid-friendly dining options nearby, and there's a big movie theater close by, too.  The suites are nice- there's a tv in the bedroom and one in the living area, so my husband and I could shut the door after the kids were in bed and watch a movie without disturbing them.  There was plenty of space for them to move around.  They LOVED the indoor pool.  It's not huge, but it's conveniently close to the elevator and was very warm.  Towels were available poolside.I'm thinking the other reviewers are accustomed staying in cardboard boxes underneath an overpass.  About the only redeeming aspect of this place is that it is cheap.  Otherwise it is old, frayed and utterly incompetent.To begin, we arrived late in the evening with a confirmed reservation which, for unknown reasons, the hotel had canceled without notifying us.  The front desk clerk was utterly unhelpful, implying that it was somehow our fault that our reservation was not coming up on her computer -- perhaps the problem was that she didn't really speak English.  We finally got a manager to find us two rooms side by side (one for us; one for the kids).  But there were only rooms on the ""Club Floor.""  Initially, the manager wanted to charge for the upgrade.  Eventually we convinced him that canceling our reservation was his problem, not ours, and he relented, giving us the club rooms at our original rate.  I'm not sure what made this floor so special; the rooms didn't seem any different from others' in town for the wedding.As for hotel amenities, the HVAC in the rooms was pathetic (overheated in one room; freezing in the other), the WIFI was like molasses (and they charge for it), and the bathroom space was minuscule.  Finally, sometimes it is the little things that are really annoying.  The room had a small ice bucket with tongs, but the hotel's ice machine produced crushed ice.  You can't get crushed ice out of a bucket with tongs, and the bucket was too small to scoop ice up with the glass.  Really frustrating to be in a place with such pretension at luxury but which so utterly fails to meet the mark.Dysfunctional landscape: Exhibit A. You're in a car, or trudging across a dreary space that acknowledges nothing without an engine. There was one sidewalk in the area, about a half mile away, that was conceived and aborted within fifty yards. I would pay bodily limbs if we could go back to 1945 and re-develop out nation.This, of course, is not the fault of the Sheraton. People were nice. There was a suffocating presence of back-slappy commerce (JP Morgan conference). Two flat screens: one in the bedroom and one in the front room. I guess that's good for maximizing SportsCenter. But, of course, you pay for your internet. Thankfully, the Hilton nearby was not so greedy.All-in-all, good place to sleep, bad place for existential considerations.I stayed here over the weekend. Nice cozy suites with room service and a great restaurant. There is a cinema and some nice eating joints including Bob Evan's around this Hotel. Courteous front desk staff. My suite had 2 Flat Screen LG TVs.The bedrooms are separated from the main living area, and both are well-appointed. Only thing on flip side is charge on WIFI. In this digital age, WIFI is a free must have.Needs some major updating.  Carpets in the common areas were a disaster.  Suite was okay but again could use a little updating.  Bed was comfortable enough.  Hey it's Columbus!Very Disappointing. I have stayed at this hotel about a dozen times.  Twice I have been bumped because of over booking at this location.   The first time I assumed a fluke and it could happen but twice is a pattern of bad management.  These are not very good odds of actually getting a room when you book a room at this hotel.  When you get bumped you will be sent to a very low standard hotel in the area which is very frustrating experience for a customer.  The hotel I was sent to last night did not even come standard with shampoo or blow dryer in the room.   After last nights experience I will be staying someplace else in the future.   There were at least three of us last night with reservations that were all bumped at the same time.  I wonder how many more customers had the same frustrating experience.  I didn't even really hear an apology.  We were just told there was nothing they could do because it was over booked and they had no rooms available.  I would avoid this hotel if you really want a room when you arrive.  In my option the chances are not very good.  There are plenty of nice hotels in the area.  I will try another one in the future.  This is not the standard I would expect from a Sheraton.",,,,"['three', 'nights', 'business', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'check', 'check', 'went', 'issues', 'room', 'king', 'bed', 'suite',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-columbus-dwtn-capitol-square-columbus,Holiday Inn Columbus Dwtn-Capitol Square,2.5,$$,31,"I'm a man so I only judge hotels on 4 criteria.1) Are there beds? Yes, and it was comfy. There's a star.2) Is there a TV? Yep, a flat screen.3) Is there a fridge to keep my Scottweisers cold? Yep4) Is it in a solid location and easy to find after a night of clowning around with pals in the city? YepAdd that plus the cleanliness, how awesomely nice the man at the desk was when checking in, and throw in the fact that they had a pool, I am a very happy camper.Cons - The biggest problem was that they charged me $10 for parking and the parking gates didn't open and close. I could have lied and said I walked and could have avoided a $10 charge.Besides that, yeah, I'd stay here again and again and again!As a business traveler and expensed, this hotel isn't bad.I had a room that had the upgrades.  Towel and linens quality is much better than average.  They have a coffee maker and fridge.It located downtown away from the cluster of hotels that are near Nationwide arena - that is about a 25 minute walk.Not too many food options nearby, not as many as the hotel cluster.They have a FREE shuttle to take you to and from the AIRPORT.  If your working downtown, there really isn't much of a reason to rent a car.They have a restaurant, bar and heated pool - never tried any.I recommend this hotel.  But it seems overpriced - but this is downtown Columbus with very low hotel vacancy rates.The only fail is that they didn't have a suitcase stand in my room, and apparently not one available in the hotel.Also, they try to mess with you mind with the elevators - 1 elevator had the buttons on the left, the other on the right.This place had everything I'd want in a hotel stay. Convenient location to downtown. Free Wi-Fi in rooms though it was shotty at times. The rooms are big and included a desk. A big bonus is this place had a free shuttle within 3 miles until 11 p.m.Meh. Decent room with nice upgrades. However, there were a few ""holes"" in our flooring/carpeting and I could not find an ice machine to save my life. Also, no coffee available in the lobby. Definitely not worth the $110 I paid.We stayed here one Thursday night and got a great deal on the room. We noted that this was an older building but it's been done over so our room seemed newer. It  had coffee maker, fridge and cable TV (everything on the small side, but we aren't complaining). A big surprise was a pool and work out room! Everything was more than adequate and the location is good for the Columbus Art Museum and Kelton House which we came to see and which were in walking distance. Room was quiet, water was hot and without exception, all the staff were friendly, helpful and conversational, without being intrusive. We had a great breakfast in the cafe/restaurant as well as a light supper in the bar area in the evening when we arrived. Everything quite tasty and good enough. We'd stay here again on our road trips to the midwest and of course the whole place is wheelchair accessible (since the rooms are small though, if you are wheelchair user be sure to get a larger room).Throw another log onto the fire. The place needs work. The lobby is nice, but the room was meh. The room I stayed in had a one inch gap between the faucet and the wall in the tub, like you could see the pipe and water was flowing backwards out of it. The ceiling had a cover that was painted over, but it was opened since and the paint was all cracked around the opening but was never repainted. And lastly, there was a long ass hair on my bed sheet. I was sleeping alone and I have short hair, yup it wasn't mine. Lol Overall, it kinda seemed like they didn't care to maintain the room. On the bright side, the comp breakfast in the morning was pretty decent. They cover for whatever you order on the menu, you just pay tax and tip. Not bad.This is a review for Holiday Inn Capitol Square (March 30th).So where to I begin. I'm hours away from check out &amp; I thank The Lord I didn't go crazy in this building. My co-workers booked this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> because it was the best price in the downtown area. This hotel has taught me sometime cheap isn't always good. Can I get an amen? From the peeling wall paper in the hallways to the broken toilets in your room this hotel is a constant reminder that what? SOMETIMES CHEAP ISNT ALWAYS GOOD. Don't get me wrong staff was very professional however I don't know they could give a room to a guest with a broken toilet? It's beyond me. The hotel is perfectly located near the Short North area and the Holiday Inn provides a free shuttle to any establishment in the 3 mile radius. Overall the hotel wasn't horrible but I feel like if we put a little more effort into our search we could of found a better place to rest our bums.Lobby is nice. Rooms need work. Located in kind of a lousy area if you want to walk around. No restaurants around to walk to, along with a lot of bums asking for money. Located close to highways though so I was able to quickly get on highway and find places to eat. Nice workout room and pool. Charge $12 to park every night, this brings price even with nicer hotelsI sure wish I could give zero stars. First, the hotel cost was $189 plus tax per night. This was because it was the weekend of ""The Arnold."" Unfortunately it was also the weekend I had an interview in Columbus. So, after overpaying and fighting the crowd to check in, I found that there was absolutely no hot water.After a lukewarm apology and assurance that the water would be restored, I decided to roll the dice and try again later. Ultimately, I came to find out that this happens ""every time"" the hotel is over carrying capacity. How unethical is it to abuse the laws of supply and demand, mark up the rooms, all along being FULLY aware that they cannot support all of the guests. I rarely get this furious with an establishment, but this is corporate greed at its worst. Please do humanity a favor and never stay here.We travel enough to know what to expect and Holiday Inn met that expectation and more.  It is my understanding that they are remodeling.  The room that we had - 2 Queen size with city view was very nice.  Ultra clean.  The desk clerks at check in were professional and friendly.  They also answered any questions that we had.  They also have a shuttle that will take guests anywhere within 3 miles of hotel and we used the service.  The restaurant is nice - portions are big.  Kevin friendly but flighty.  The down side is that they do not offer continental breakfast so need to buy in the cafe.  Small fitness room and decent pool.  Small business center.  Location great within walking distance of German Village and downtown area.  I'll definitely stay againI agree with Ryan, definitely a low rating.  I would rate them between 3.5 to 4.  There were some issues with check in where they assigned my room to another person but that was smoothed over in 5 minutes.  They don't include a fridge or microwave, and they didn't have a closet so that was a bummer.  They offer free Wifi--I always recommend bringing a wireless card just in case.  They have restaurant included inside the hotel--it's pretty much comfort food.  It's right in down town, minutes from CVS on High Street, many Subway restaurants near by, and the Columbus Commons.  They are pretty cheap compared to other downtown hotels.  Just a warning, if you do bring a car they charge $10 a day for parking, and if you smoke in the room they will charge a $250 fee.  There are many parking areas that may be cheaper if you are staying there long--check the one off Town Street and Grant Avenue.  It will be a walk but may be cheaper if you're staying more than 5 or 6 days.The last time I checked, Holiday Inns are supposed to be great options for the traveling professional... sadly this place made me feel like a misplaced gnome. First I was curious as to why Sarah lied to my face by saying ""your room does not have a refridgerator because another room in your party requested an extra one"" (which she did, for medical reasons...  but that should have no effect on my stay) which seasoned rep Heather later apologized for, and promptly (sorta) switched our rooms half-way through our stay, only so that we could enjoy granite counters and a broken toilet, <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feww.com&amp;s=d967eb25da16c01df9e4a08147548d80a4c75f92403dc7800665d35b1341c8da"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">eww.com</a>. P.S. If your menus in the room say dinner is until 11pm, why was there no food options at 6pm... questions to ponder I suppose.Dated but undergoing renovations. Ice machine didn't wok and I had to go to a different floor to get ice.Very friendly staff.Plenty of space in the room but I was expecting something a little bit nicer.I stay at this hotel regularly, and have a number of issues with them.First and foremost, if you're arriving after 10:45 PM, you can forget the complimentary airport shuttle. Occasionally you'll get a driver who is nice enough to come get you after 11 PM, but generally they won't. This is really frustrating because if they stayed on an extra 30 minutes, they could service the last flight into Columbus.Secondly, as I come in late frequently, the fact that the hotel only serves food until 10 PM leaves me in a bit of a limbo when it comes time to find something to eat. Fortunately there is a decent bar down the street that serves food until 1 PM so that helps.The lobby has a strange odor to it. Not necessarily bad but unique and off-putting. The front desk staff is generally friendly, depending on who you get. The elevators are hopelessly slow, and if you hit the call button sometimes only the service elevator will open, while the two main cars never reach the ground floor. In this case just take the service elevator as it is appointed the same way as the guest elevators.Regarding the restaurant, I've had much better. I ordered a Caesar salad, however the plate was piping hot, thus wilting the lettuce. It was also served without croutons (they were out) and had a mess of mozzarella cheese on it (which doesn't belong on a Caesar). Service was acceptable but the food wasn't.There is also a lot of noise in this hotel, likely due to the fact that is is undergoing renovations, but I can't hold this against them. The hotel is in dire need of renovations as it looks quite tired and dated.One thing they do have going for them is FREE WiFi in all of their rooms, though it will kick you off the system if you are idle for a short time, which is only a slight annoyance. Parking in the on-site lot costs $10 a day, when it should really be free. The complimentary shuttle service is nice during the day and they will take you anywhere within 3 miles for free.Basically, I would not stay here if I were booking the hotel. But because my organization pays for my rooms, I stay where they tell me.Update: The hotel has removed their complimentary business center for things like checking in for your flight and printing boarding passes. Also, I finally got to stay in one of their renovated rooms, and it is clear that they tried to cover up a tired hotel with a thin veneer of high end finishes, but it was not well executed.We stayed in this hotel for 28 nights last month. Jan 25-Feb 22, 2015. My husband was working and I stayed in the hotel 24/7 with our dogs. The staff were amazing!! We travel almost 1/2 our lives and this was one of the BEST staffs I have ever encountered. They treated me and my dogs as family. The restaurant and room service were OUTSTANDING!. My only complaint was the structure. About half the days there, there were issues with the elevators. Usually just one, but one particular Monday, BOTH customer elevators AND the service elevator. The stairs had to be use. One Tuesday, myself, my 2 dogs and another guest were in one when it would not move. For 20 minutes. The last 2 weeks, there were signs 'out of order"" and men working on them all the time. The Thursday before we checked out, a man worked on it all day, he left, and 5 minutes later I had to tell the front desk it was stuck again. After checking out and responding to Holiday Inn's Guest survey, I was told someone from the hotel would be contacting me about this within 24 hours. They have not yet. I called today and told my review was rejected because I mentioned said elevator troubles and this was considered a safety issue they did not want published. I am offering this to other guests so that they may avoid this potential issue. Also to ask if other guests at the time can confirm these problems. I am very disheartened by Holiday Inn's response to my issue.I wish negative stars were an option.Charged a smoking fee to our room when clearly no smoking could have possibly occurred. The windows are sealed shut to prevent suicides, if someone smoked a cigarette in that room, THE WHOLE FLOOR WOULD REEEEEK. Also video surveillance would show me and my friends going outside multiple times throughout the day/night. I'm disputing it now, but what an irritating hassle. From my research it seems that it's common practice for hotels to do this to people because the likelihood of someone wanting to take this to court is slim.Don't be a patron to this fraudulent, thieving enterprise.NOT friendly staff!As a business traveler, my time is money. While the hotel itself is middle of the pack as far as amenities, time is something that they might need some help on. Figured I would try their in house restaurant so I came down from my room right at 5 pm hoping to get a quick meal in. Needless to say I walked back up to my room at 5:15 with their closed sign still up even though they were supposed open at 5. This is frustrating. This is the second issue I have had with this hotel in 2 visits. The first involved an early morning hotel shuttle. I needed a 5:00 am shuttle to the airport. I called down the night before and was told that it would be unavailable to me even though our corporate contract with the hotel states it should be. I ended up booking a taxi instead.When I arrived at the front desk, I noticed a shuttle and a driver hanging out chatting with someone. As I waited for my now late cab, the driver asked if I needed a ride to the airport...... I said yes and off we went. Frustrating! Another hour taken out of my time off to relax to get a cab scheduled all because one person gave me bad information.Clean rooms and a great location.We had an excellent stay at this Holiday Inn. My fiance and I reserved a king size room a few weeks in advance. When we arrived, there were plenty of parking places and the employee who checked us was very helpful. We were in town to attend an Andrea Bocelli concert, and we accidentally left our tickets back home. After checking in, we conveniently printed our tickets using the business center's printer. The hotel room was very clean. The bed, the pillows, everything was very comfortable and both my fiance and I slept wonderfully. During check out, the employee at the desk was very helpful and he checked us out quickly. The next time I'm traveling in or through Columbus, I will be staying here again. I highly recommend this hotel.","We were torn between this hotel and another hotel down the street but what sold us on this hotel was that during the time of our stay they were offering a promotion where if you stay two consecutive weekend nights you would receive a 75 dollar rebate.I am so glad that we ended up choosing this hotel. The location was perfect, it was in downtown but it was kind of in a secluded location from the ""nightlife"" downtown scene but walking distance from all the night life. The rooms were very clean and the lobby was very nice, it was obvious that the hotel had been renovated because the feel of the hotel was like a ""today"" feeling, not like some hotels that are still stuck in their 70-80's ways. The front desk staff was very friendly,nice and accommodating. However, parking was not free, it cost $10 to park each night, but they did offer free WiFi to their guests. If I am ever up in Columbus, I know where I will be staying!I've gotta buck the trend here and post a positive review. A two-star average is just too low for this hotel.I stayed here for three nights at a Priceline rate of $46 + tax. Sure, the rooms aren't spacious suites, but they get the job done. They are clean, and housekeeping does a fine job of keeping them that way.The room I stayed in was certainly lightly furnished. You've got a bed, a cushioned chair, a desk, a desk chair, and an entertainment center with an old CRT TV. There's a coat rack with a few hangers, but no luggage rack. The bathroom was especially small, but also passable. The biggest plus was free wifi. Others have complained about the speed, and I too experienced some variability. It ranged from broadband speed (first night) to about half broadband speed (third night). Never did it approach ""dial up speeds"" mentioned in another review...I suspect that's an exaggeration. Considering I had friends staying at the Doubletree who paid $12/day for slower Internet, I'd say things aren't so bad at the Holiday Inn in this department.Neither is the $10 parking fee. You're downtown - you're going to pay to park. $10/day was the lowest rate I found anywhere nearby - Hyatt and Doubletree were both $20+ as a point of comparison.The lobby was recently renovated and the public restrooms are of very high quality. The restaurant downstairs is a couple dollars more expensive than I'd like, but turns out to be a good value because of their huge portions. My chicken sandwich was so big I had trouble finishing it. Overall, this is not the perfect hotel, but it's very underrated on this site. I would probably give it three stars, but the two-star average is ridiculously low, so I'm bumping them up to four...which should serve to make this a 2.5-star property on Yelp.The   ***loading***Slowest    ***loading***Internet    ***loading***Ever!!!!    ***loading***Other than the dial up speed internet, the hotel is...meh...ok.  rooms are clean(ish). beds are fine. laundry on siterestaurant on sitewalking distance to downtown, although a bit of a walkthe one huge plus is it is located one block from DIRTY FRANK'S hotdog place.  Great dogs and bar!We make an annual trip to Columbus every Labor Day weekend. This is the 2nd year we've stayed at this hotel. Last year the stay was great; our only complaint was a long wait to be seated for breakfast in the restaurant &amp; a long wait to receive our breakfast. They were short staffed. This year, the complaints were many: It took 30-40 minutes for us to receive a crib to our room (TWICE). It took us 20 minutes before someone answered the phone for room service so that we could place our order. Our receipt was not received under our door on the morning of checkout &amp; we had to call the front desk twice to receive it. And the same issues in the restaurant for breakfast as last year. Redeeming factors: We expressed our complaints to the manager on duty. She was very nice &amp; apologetic. She comp'd our room. She got us seated in the restaurant for breakfast immediately, had our order put at the top of the cook's list so that we could eat and make our flight, and also comp'd our meal. Overall, we'd give this hotel ONE more chance before staying somewhere else.Despite the location, I had high hopes - based on the newly-renovated interior - that their service would be similarly spiffy.  I was disappointed.Although pleasant and friendly, the staff and service were extremely slow.  I tried to grab a quick breakfast but was told it would take 10 minutes to get so much as a bowl of instant oatmeal.  Later that day when the wi-fi was crawling and I suggested a reboot, I was told that ""sometimes it just be slow.""  Clearly. If you don't need anything from the staff, the property itself is fine - not in the best area but not too terribly far from some fun restaurants for dinner.This is probably the worst cleaned Holiday Inn I've stayed at. I almost didn't shower this morning because I didn't want to use the towels and have my body touch the curtain.I'm pretty sure my room didn't use to be a room. It's large and empty and the bathroom looks like it recently had construction done. I can tell from the shoddy work and loose fixtures. I'm typing this now so I don't forget, but I have to go to check out of this dump.This hotel really sucks. There is essentially nothing to walk to and frankly you probably wouldn't want to in the evening regardless. The rooms are OK, but are essentially standard older holiday inn rooms. No more, no less.  The whole place could really use an overhaul.  Furthermore, the restaurant in the hotel is a trainwreck. I was sitting at the bar and couldn't even see a menu for over an hour because the bartender couldn't find one.  Any time anyone so much as ordered a drink, we all had to hear about how overworked she is. Truthfully, I think the average bartender could handle the job in their sleep.  On the plus side, the front desk staff were very pleasant, but that's about all I can really say positive about the place. I ended up leaving after 1 night and finished my trip at the Blackwell on the OSU campus.This place sucks. New, fresh Holiday Inn logo. Same turd hotel.It goes without saying that this location isn't the best.  Not to mention the place is ancient.  But in my opinion, it has a nice quirkiness about it.... 'time warp' comes to mind.  I found the rooms to be very clean, neat and nicely put together.  I think they were renovated not too long ago.  The lobby itself wasn't and that shows but don't let that scare you off.  The food was quite good- glorified pub food with a few really nice dishes.  I was not disappointed.If you want to stay downtown, you can get a good rate here as it is sort of the underdog hotel.  But I typically root for underdogs so that is just fine for me.$10 parking, weak, most everything else was passable. no flatscreen tv's. the remote control was weird, i had to manually turn on the tv. what sucked the most was that the shower was cold-cold-warm-scalding-cold-warm-cold-fucking freezing.  fix that shit.Kind of funny - I feel the opposite of the other reviewer here.  I was pretty impressed with the lobby.  Perhaps they have renovated since then.  However, the elevators didn't get updated and the rooms are clean and comfortable. It is an average Holiday Inn and just fine for a good location at a good price in downtown Columbus.  They treat their Priority Club members very well there as well and my check-in process was great - the guy at the desk was friendly, funny and very helpful.",,,,"['man', 'judge', 'hotels', 'criteria',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-lofts-columbus,The Lofts,3.0,$$$,27,"Our experience on 1/23/2016 was beyond our expectations.....  Easy check-in, reservations made at a great restaurant (during restaurant week), free shuttle to the restaurant and back, complimentary breakfast and valet parking.  The hotel is modern industrial and my husband loved it!  Go for the Bed and Breakfast Package that includes the parking.  Definitely worth the bang for your buck.  Will revisit!Stayed here for 2 nights for work.  This has more of an apartment feel than a hotel.  The decor is modern industrial.   Has brick walls, open ceiling, wood beams, etc.   was cool because it had a separate living room with TV, and huge bedroom.   Bathroom was also roomy, clean, and modernly decorated.  Overall was nice and would stay here again.Having stayed here for three nights, I will say that there is some truth to the reviews about the walls being ""thin"".  However, I can't say with any certainty that I have stayed in ANY hotel that is perfectly quiet and doesn't have noise coming from an elevator, ice machine, or kids running.  I can say I had none of that noise here - I could hear my neighbors walking above my room once in a while, and I could hear some city sounds.  However, I am staying downtown - hello...The facility is a very unique hotel and provides a very neat atmosphere that you won't get at a lot of places.  There are exposed wood beams throughout the rooms on the walls and ceilings, providing a very neat viewpoint.  The rooms are huge - I literally had a hallway leading into my room.I found the rooms to be clean and well kept, the bathroom was very clean and had nice amenities provided.  I had an excellent view from the room of downtown and it made the experience very nice.  I did read in a couple of reviews about the fact that the room uses wooden blinds and not curtains - I didn't think the usage of blinds caused any more light to enter the room than curtains would, but then again I have these at home.Overall a very pleasant experience from check-in onwards.  If you are looking for a unique hotel experience while staying in downtown, I would highly recommend you stay here.  You will be right in the center of everything, and within walking distance of a lot of great dining experiences.Stayed here for a night last weekend when we cam into town for some live music.  It was my first trip Columbus so I wasn't sure what to expect.  This hotel, although a little pricey, was a really cool unique place to stay.  It was walking distance from all the downtown entertainment venues, and some very nice restaurants.I see a lot of reviews claiming it was dirty, but we did not experience this.Nice, clean, roomy rooms with a great shower = 4 stars.I have stayed here a couple times and have funded family member visits.  In all of my stays the hotel has been in good order and the rooms have an industrial / warehouse feel, like others have commented.  But the front desk service staff have never impressed me, I have overlooked it in past encounters but after a very recent experience I am to the point where I will no longer be staying there or recommending anyone I know stay there.  The front desk staff is not helpful and bill incorrect credit cards, take liberties with room service and have no power or willingness to correct mistakes, it goes to their accounting department.  Its a hassle to deal with and there are better managed hotels in the 1/2 mile radius.I can imagine people complain about the noise. It is noisy. You can hear your upsairs neigbours walk around the room and you can hear the traffic. But living in the center of a big European city next to a trainstation I think I'm numb. Don't hear it, doesn't bother me.Stayed here last May and this week. Both the same room, or at least the same lay-out. Big spacious room with a big bed. No curtains but wooden blinds. So if you prefer a very dark room: don't go here. A nice bathroom with only one real complaint: the water pressure is not so high and if the neigbours take water or flush the toilet you're out of water.And both time we had to wait a long time for the valet. In May to leave the car, this week to get our car.And excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that's not bad enough, Apple keeps changing the English words into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you guess right, my first language.""""Artsy-Artsy hotel with a great location"""" ""Expensive, but a great place to stay"" ""Unique Warehouse design !""  I would definitely return. The reasons are the following: 1-Great service 2-Beautiful Hotel &amp;  the room was sort of artsy 3-Best Location (downtown Columbus right across from the Convention Center) 4-Very nice staff &amp; very helpful. 5-Very courteous valet parking &amp; service The best I liked from the hotel was the comfort of the room and views. I think is a great hotel for adults especially and if there are kids around you won t notice them. I hope this answers all your questions.This hotel is 2 stars. No professional staffs, not maintained well. I will not recommend to anyone or I will not come back for sure.Total disappointment. First we paid WAY too much for a room that would have equated to something much nicer up near Polaris and should have just done that. The room smelled like urine and cigarettes so if you're into that this is your spot! You can't rent movies on the tiny TV mounted from the ceiling that is so high you can hardly see it. Then they trick you by advertising a pool and fitness center but it's actually located in the neighboring hotel and both are a complete dump! Funny because I think this is considered one of Columbus' premier hotels and if that's the reputation the city is going for, well I'm damn glad I moved. Smell ya later Lofts!I wish I can choose no stars. I just checked out this overrated overpriced hotel. My room was made up and no complaints. But I opened my ""closed luggage"" and found one of house keeping's damp rags inside. A few of my worn clothes were wet and stank. It was HELLA NASTY!!!God only knows where that rag has been used. Upon check out, I gave the rag to the front desk in front of customers checking in. I let them know upfront I don't need any complimentary things because I don't plan on staying here ever. Word of mouth news spreads the fastest so count on me on spreading the word. The floors and walls were very thin. You can hear above tenants walk wherever. For the most part, I did have a good stay at the over priced hotel, but never again.Tiny little boutique hotel, certainly as the pics show; however dirty beyond belief. The carpets in the room were stained beyond belief, the tray table meant for patrons was dingy and most certainly had never been cleaned. I didn't care for the gloomy rooms, as the lighting in a room with such high ceilings is hard to illuminate if not done right. The wooden ceiling joist, although giving a stylish feel, made for a noisy nights sleep. I was on the 2nd floor and unfortunately could hear every step taken from the room above! The lobby is literally 20x10ft. if that.. Don't expect much. Certainly a level of disappointment.To start I would like to say what a nice room I had at the lofts. Large, well appointed, modern and a good bed. I'm afraid my experience there did not go well however. With all of the money that was spent on this building, nobody thought to insulate the walls or ceilings. My upstairs neighbor walked around until midnight. My neighbor had their tv on at a reasonable volume until I moved rooms at 3am. It was as if their tv was in my room. The blinds were insufficient, which would normally not be a problem except that the hotel faces the convention center which is lit up like a Christmas tree all night. I think I slept for a total of 4 hours and I was in bed for 9. It was brutal. DONT STAY HERE IF NOISE OR LIGHT BOTHER YOU AT ALL!!!!!Also the breakfast place looked terrible. I walked over to the hilton downtown where they have great food. I would recommend staying over there when ever your in town. It's much better.We loved our stay here. Very cool place. The room was fantastic. Valet parking couldn't have made it any easier. Thank you for a great nightI wanted to add a couple of things. Day 1: I found very late at night that i was allergic to something in my room on the 5th floor. Maybe the big plant in there or the wood or brick, not sure, but i could not breath, so if you get allergies don't stay on the 5th floor. However, when i called to tell them, they asked if i wanted to move and i said no... the man actually brought me up Alkezelter Cold medicine and Unisom to my door so that I could get some rest...  Day 2: the second night it was even worse with the allergies, so i had them move me to a room on the 3rd floor and they did it right away, as soon as i asked, they had a bell man come help me take my things to the new room and the next day made sure I had complimentary breakfast and free internet for my trouble..  Day 3: I needed to wear jeans for a charity day on Thursday (that part was ok) but I sent the only pair of jeans I had to the laundry on Wednesday and was told I could get them back the same day, not the case. After calling several times, they were able to call the laundry service and have them make a special trip back to bring me my jeans in the morning which was a good solution. So that is a good thing.Day 4: I needed to get to a party around the corner, but it was freezing out, so they had the shuttle take me around the block and the guy brought me right to the door.Day 5: In the morning I called and had them take my bags to be checked, so that i could head to the office and pick them up later. Then they drove me in the shuttle to work. When i got back, getting my luggage was a pain because a giant bus filled with rude people pulled up and they all wanted to check luggage. I tried to tell people i was trying to catch a plane, but they were not interested.. finally i caught a valet and told him, he called a airport shuttle 20.00 flat fee plus tip (not bad) and got me my bags so i could go change into my travel clothes.. they got me to the airport and i am writing this review from the airplane via wireless by gogo inflight..  COOL HUH :PVery nice business hotel rooms.  The problem is with the service.I walk up to the check in desk. The girl at the front desk is on the phone and looks down as i approach.  I wait patiently for about 3 or 4 minutes and she doesn't acknowledge me.  SMH.  I sit down in a chair because she does not plan on acknowledging a guest  until she has completed her call.   Several minutes later she gets off the phone and asks if she can help.   She didn't even pretend to care that it took her almost ten minutes to acknowledge or assist me.  She gave me my room key and I was off. I think she said maybe ten words to me the entire time.  I was only there one night but the next morning when I was leaving at 7am, there wasn't anyone at the front  desk.I had to call and get an emailed receipt.  The room was almost 200 for one night after tax including valet parking.  Although the room was spacious and clean I will not return for that type of attitude.There are a couple of things that are definite positives about The Lofts: the rooms are HUGE. And fairly inexpensive. And it's in a lovely historic building. The brick walls and high industrial looking ceilings are lovely. The service was friendly and helpful.There are also some definite negatives: the grout and caulking in the shower was black. And not intentional black. Mold/mildew black. In fact, the bathroom was one of my biggest issues with the hotel. The tile was in bad shape and there was just a feeling of creeping uncleanliness.Basically, this hotel, as far as loft-style boutique hotels, is a swing and a miss. The decor seemed haphazardly placed, and cords were visible everywhere. Neighbor-noise was distracting and forced you to wake up whenever the person walking down the hallway or walking around above you decided to get up. Street noise is noticeable. It isn't a terrible place to stay, but I'd probably choose something else next time I'm in Columbus.Although I had a really great stay here, I'm only giving it four stars because we didn't take advantage of all of the amenities, so I can't say whether or not the full experience would change my rating.We booked a room here for our wedding night because we were putting the honeymoon off until we had cash to take a really nice trip.  The check-in person was friendly and helpful, and the room itself was gorgeous.  The bedding was nice, there were a really good amount of pillows (not the two little flimsy ones you usually get in a hotel), the sofa was nice, the bed was *huge*, there were two good-sized televisions.    Even the bathroom was nice, with Aveda products rather than the generic hotel stuff you'd usually get.  It's a definite step up from generic chain hotels.We did order room service from Max and Erma's.  The food was okay, but I'm wishing now we would have saved ourselves the money because I wouldn't ordinarily eat at Max and Erma's.  If you like chain restaurants like that, you'll probably be very happy with the food; places like M&amp;E, Friday's, Applebees, etc, I tend to avoid like the plague.  But hey, it was our wedding night--gotta order room service on your wedding night, yes?Parking was a little on the expensive side; we self-parked in the garage and I believe it was about ten dollars for the overnight.  With it being so close to High Street and within walking distance of a lot of eating and entertainment options, if you're visiting and you don't need to drive, you can save this expense either by not renting a car or by finding cheaper parking options and taking a cab or the bus until you need to retrieve your car.All in all, it was a great stay, and we plan to return sometime when we're not so exhausted and can enjoy ourselves more leisurely.Ok, I suppose. Artsy, cute, decent location near to short north. Regardless, the parking was a shambles. Vale parking shared with the hotel next door, cars going in the out and vice versa, bottleneck an delay was unacceptable. We did score a free bottle of bubbly on account of it being our anniversary but he parking thing was a major pain.The check in was smooth.  The staff was friendly.  My issue was with the decor.  Maybe I'm just used to the Vegas posh decor, the luxuries of NYC, or the bungalows in Beverly; but I was highly unimpressed with my room.  I'm just not a fan of the exposed brick.  I was okay though.  I walked through the room to the bedroom and loved that I didn't feel cramped.  My pillow cases were not clean... Lipstick or blood stains, which made me wonder if my sheets were clean.  I decided ignorance is bliss, so I slept on the couch with a coat and hiked up the heater.The bathroom seemed small to me.  They did have Aveda bath products.  I just didn't like the black and white tile.  When I hear luxury, I just think of something more.  After talking to others, I realized that I'm just a west coast girl.Overall, I would have given this place 4 stars, but visibly dirty sheets are inexcusable.Best. Hotel. Of. Our. Stay! Free wifi. It is a connection to the Crown Plaza, which is great. We had a HUGE, GINORMOUS bed. Big flat screen TV. Tons of space. We had a hallway with a sitting area. Floor to ceiling windows. Aveda bath products. Stay here when you are in town.","My girlfriend booked us a stay here on a Friday night for my birthday, even though we are locals. I've always heard about this little hotel and wanted to check it out. I read some so-so reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. We used the valet because it was part of our room rate(breakfast &amp; parking package). The valet was quick and friendly and offered to help with our bags. The guy checking us in could not have been nicer or more friendly. He offered us ideas of places to go and things to do, until of course we told him we lived here. But a nice gesture. Also, even though we booked the cheapest room type, he upgraded us to a superior king room with no hesitation.The room was awesome. Very contemporary and what you would expect for an industrial/loft theme. There was a sitting room with wetbar, sizable bathroom and tons of room in the bedroom, with more seating and a decent desk. We were right next to the elevators, but we never heard them. These are rectangular-shaped lofts with the beds being farthest from the door, so it's not like it's right next to you. The bathroom amenities were all Aveda, the soap, shampoo, cond and lotion, not just the soap like someone else reviewed. The bed was really comfortable, as were the pillows. You can also connect your iPod to the clock radio. Since the breakfast was included we ordered it room service style, and yes it is from Max &amp; Erma's. I too typically avoid those types of chain restaurants like the plague, but the breakfast was actually pretty solid. Ok eggs, great potatoes, ok toast and Minute Maid OJ. We definitely plan to stay here again, it was an overall great experience. Good job Lofts!The rooms are pretty.  That was the only positive with my stay here.  I'm appalled at the service.  Yesterday I had 6 different people for various reasons knock on my door  (picking up old trays - there were none; rose petals turn down - Wong room.. etc)  Room service was bad and I don't just mean the food...  They forgot things every time.  Sometimes I had two peppers no salt, I had to eat a float with a fork, they forgot my drinks... the list goes on and on.  My advice, go out.  The front desk was to arrange a massage for me and ended up just not calling me back to let me know they were booked.  I found out many hours later when I called them to see what was up.  They also were to have the restaurant manager call me about the horrible service and that didn't happen either.  I better call back to make sure my cab will be here so I can leave this wretched place.I would never stay here again.  I thought this was an upscale hotel.  I was misinformed.I'm seriously disappointed in the lack of detail and thought in... everything.A very nice boutique property in a great location - walkable to Arena District nightlife, prompt and attentive housekeeping service, and an exceptionally unique room in a historic property.  Exposed brick walls and luxury accents including Aveda bath products made my stay a pleasure.  The towels were thick, plush, and I daresay DELICIOUS.  Room downside:  Thin walls!  Normal conversations from the neighbors, as well as TVs, alarm clocks, music, etc were all audible.A *tremendously huge* problem with this hotel was the valet service, which is shared with The Lofts' sister property, Crowne Plaza.  Valet staff were difficult to locate, seemed generally lackadaisical about their duties, and seemed generally understaffed.  (For appearances alone, how about you boys try RUNNING at least until you're out of eyesight instead of sauntering off to get vehicles offsite?  And with not one but 2 wedding parties plus an entertainer and his entrourage as guests, how about adding a few extra staff to the night?)  At check-out, valets simply refused call-down service - instead requiring all guests to queue at the valet desk while cars were very slowly brought up.Attention seemed to focus on inbound guests and luggage assistance than with expediting retreival of vehicles.  For $21 a day, a guest needn't wait over 20 minutes for a car to be retrieved.  Not even at a large convention hotel in LA do you wait this long.Should I stay again, I'll go with the much cheaper self-park option.My poor valet experiences were not isolated - Over 3 days I retrieved my car 9 times - and each retreival was met with similar delays.The Lofts has the potential to provide a very attentive, 4-star experience.  They just need to tighten up the service aspects a bit.My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night. We chose the Lofts because our wedding guests could stay in a block of rooms at the Crowne Plaza. It was so convenient to have our people close by for a night on the town with our friends but far enough away we could enjoy our wedding night! The rooms are beautiful. Our room had exposed brick, a view of the city and a HUGE soaking tub as well as a living room in addition to the bedroom. Aveda products, plush towels, and fluffy robes were the icing on the cake.My only complaint was our neighbors left their room service outside their door to be picked up and it was left in the hall during our entire stay- 6 pm to noon the next day. Pretty gross no matter where you're staying, but especially in the environment the Lofts seems like it is trying to create. Oh, and don't even think of putting your room key next to your cell phone when you put yourself together to go out. You will deactivate your room key :(All that aside though, this was a really great hotel. I've done a bit of traveling and I was impressed with our choice. We even plan to stay here to celebrate our anniversary. It's a wonderful place to stay even when you're not leaving town!I was initially excited to stay at this place because I love boutique hotels and had read about this place. Unfortunately, whoever wrote that article probably didn't stay here. What they have is halfway to boutique - if you count exposed brick, loft-style rooms, etc. But unfortunately whoever did their interior decoration made off with 80% of the money or just had very little discernment when it comes to quality. The robes, bedding, towels, etc. were really substandard. Anyone with a bit of taste should be able to pick this up. I prefer not to wear cardboard after my shower. The bed was so uncomfortable (again, did they pick this up at a yard sale?) and the HVAC system so loud and so ineffective, that I can say, of the 45 or so odd nights I've had on the road this year so far and it's only April, I definitely got the WORST sleep here. Oh, and thank you for the wakeup call both days at 6:30 AM that I didn't order. After the first day of staying here, I told them that I got a wakeup call at 6:30 and to please take it off. I was hitting 3 cities in four days and was exhausted. But no, thank you for waking up again the next day. This made their neutral, nonexistant service go to terrible in my mind.Honestly, anyone here on business should avoid this place because you're just going to end up tired at all your meetings. This is my first 1 star on yelp and I wish I could give zero. Next time, it's back to the Hilton by the airport - at least there I was comfortable.The Lofts hotel is located inside a building that used to hold the old waterworks. I'm not really sure what the waterworks was, but my Grandpa was really impressed with the conversion.The Lofts is in prime time downtown. On the corner of Nationwide and High its less snooty than the Crowne Plaza, not cookie cutter like the Hyatt, and classier than the Red Roof Inn. Its unique and hip. The lobby is tiny but decorated in art deco and staffed by a person who is cheerful and not too enthusiastic.The rooms are marked by the mile high ceilings and artsy decor. Each room has its own theme. Staying in the econo version I was impressed by the Aveda products for the bathroom, and the million thread count towels. The Lofts also offers free ( for the night) terry cloth bathrobes. The bed is impressive with so many pillows and covers you could get lost inside of them. There are a few downsides to the Lofts. The walls are paper thin. We heard the neighbors coming home from their night out and celebrating. Our other neighbors were caught enjoying the hotel's room service porn. (I hope) You can hear the elevators opening and closing seemingly all night long. The hotel itself is also very small. Realizing we had forgot toothbrushes forced us t go next door to the Crowne's concierge.These little flaws were minor and overshadowed by the staff's service. Finding out we were newly engaged the hotel bought our breakfast and champagne. They even provided us with a free cab the next day to take us a few minutes down the street to our home. Bring earplugs, but be prepared to have a really nice hotel to stumble home to after a night out downtown. Just don't forget your toothbrush.This place is great.  Nicely laid out - the rooms are all unique - and they have free WiFi and wired internet access.  It's close to the Convention Center and you get free breakfast at the Max and Ermas downstairs.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-columbus-downtown-columbus-3,Residence Inn Columbus Downtown,4.0,$$,31,"I stayed there for more than 6 weeks between 2014 and 2015 and would stay here again if I get a chance. Excellent service, they remembered me by my name. High points include:- About 20 items in the lavish complimentary breakfast. - Provided me with laundry supplies (free). shaving Kit (free)- Really quick and friendly valet service - Free light dinner served 2-3 days a week- Every room is a suite and has a FULL kitchen- Great location, right in the middle of downtown- Friendliest staffBeat that?I love the historical aspect of this hotel. It use to be a bank and was converted in 2008 into a hotel. There are pieces of the bank history all over the downstairs lobby area. The breakfast here was good and I like many others liked that you had to go threw the vault door to reach it. Our room was nice even though when you pulled out the sofa bed you could barley get back threw to the kitchen or the bedroom. What really bring the rating down for me is the bed. The point of a hotel is to sleep... Well I spent most of the 2 nights I stayed here tossing and turning trying to get comfortable on a bed that was anything but comfortable. It was squeaky and hard and just felt like an old rickety bed. It would have been a much nicer weekend had the bed not been stif as a board.We stayed here for three nights as part of Cosmos Tours. The hotel is going through a refurb in the lobby although they limit their working hours so that there is no work going on at night. Our room was very spacious, clean and equipped with towels, iron, coffee machine, toiletries etc. Actually the coffee machine was really good! We were on the 5th floor over looking the freeway. It wasn't too noisy and I actually quite liked looking at all the traffic at night time.Make sure you don't park on the street overnight.  Your car will get towed. And the staff will fail to warn you of this, even though they watched you park.  Thanks, staff!  Next time, we will fork out the extra money we spent on getting our car back on a nicer hotel.What an awesome hotel in Downtown Columbus!  We got so lucky to land this place using Priceline!  Located right in the heart of Downtown, we were so close to everything to walk to!  The hotel has $20 Valet parking with in-and-out privileges, a big plus.  Rather than do the hassle of paying for the different lots and meters, we just did that.  It seemed pretty reasonable, and it was one less thing to worry about.The staff was extremely friendly, and the hotel, being inside an old bank, was STUNNING.  The lobby and first floor had all the old charm of the old bank, with high ceilings, old signs, and other little things here and there including the vault door which I loved.  We ended up getting a studio suite for our room, with a full kitchen including a dishwasher.  We didn't need that much space, but no complaints here!  The room itself was modern and very nice.There was free Wifi, complimentary breakfast, all that good stuff.  This was seriously a great 3 star hotel in Columbus.  It is very well managed and well maintained!Had a wonderful stay at this cool old bank turned hotel. The desk staff were very helpful -- we asked about stuff going on around town and when we came back to our room a few hours later we found a note and print outs of their favorite restaurants and events. Comfortable room and bed. Breakfast was free and offered much more than the average continental hotel breakfast. Conveniently located for us. We were able to walk to COSI and out to dinner. We had a car to explore some of the sights that were a bit further away.  Would definitely stay again when in Columbus!The room is pretty amazing. But the walls are thin. And the house keeping is loud. Tried to sleep to the sound of vacuuming.Okay, this hotel is hands-down the coolest hotel I've been in years.So I'll start off with the obvious, that I love the decore, ambience and style of this hotel. The building has been repurposed from its original use of a bank to A very unique hotel. This tickles a little part of my heart for businesses that repurpose old buildings instead of tearing them down and building new ones. From what I was told the city put them on a slightly restrictive leash regarding what they can do with these spaces for a three-year period. So when you come through the main entrance and come into the lobby the room opens up into this grand hall and the further back you go the cooler the place is. They use lighting that really shows the beauty of the original architecture.They have brilliantly used old parts of the bank for instance the bank vault door is the entry way to the food area for breakfast. The place is kept immaculately clean, and when there are periods of slow traffic there is someone always cleaning or making sure everything looks perfect. My experience with the staff here was absolutely amazing. There was no big event that sold me just the consistency between all the employees, their concern that I was happy in all areas of my stay, A smile on everyone's face and thank you, my pleasure at the end of every conversation. I was only staying for a night so I chose the smallest room available. It was actually about the size of my first apartment. The room smelled clean, all the appliances were very clean, no dust no stains....Breakfast on the other hand was fine but just like every other hotel eggs sausage biscuits waffles the usual. Which is fine because that's what all of the residents inn's serve.The exercise room was smaller than most but still had two treadmills and elliptical trainer and a seeded bike. They did however have a great lounge area. a TV to watch movies on, a large couch and a full bar with a great bartender.The only downside I found with the hotel was parking. The only reason why I did not take away from the rating was because all of the hotels downtown have the same problem. You either have to find a parking garage or park somewhere nearby yourself or pay for valet parking. The valet parking here was $20 but your car is being stored under ground in a private secure a lot. What sold me on making this not a negative was that the valet team here gave you the ability to send a text message or scan in a QR code or call the front desk at any time you wanted your car and if it was through text they'll even update you when your car is ready or is it about to be ready, Technology baby!!Overall of all of the Residence Inn hotel chains, courtyards or any other Marriott chain that I've stayed in this one is the best!#Marriott #Hotels #ResidenceInnThis Residence Inn has set the standard for all other Residence Inns that I'll likely ever stay at. So, I guess, sorry to all other Residence Inns. I was a bit in shambles when walked up to this stunning building to check in. I just stepped off a flight and basically wanted to crawl into a hole because I felt so sick. Sinus infection + turbulent flight = horror. The very nice staff member behind the desk, Ashley, was sweet enough to get me into a room right away (at 10am) and even walked up a print out of two local family practices within walking distance. As for the room, I actually checked into a handicap accessible room, which may or may not be larger than the typical guest room. Regardless, I was impressed by the large sitting area, generous kitchenette, desk, comfy bed and large bathroom/vanity. The comfy bed and flatscreen LG were a welcome respite at the end of the day when I still felt like death warmed up. A couple of other notes to keep in mind...1) The location is fantastic. Right on Gay street with great access to plenty of restaurants and coffee shops. 2) I wasn't well enough to check out the workout area, but it is open 24 hours. 3) Typical buffet breakfast is served off the lobby each morning, so that's always a plus. 4) My room had a pass through door to an adjacent room, which was surely locked on the other side (just like mine). The gentleman next door must have been under the weather as well, as I heard the poor guy coughing about every 10 minutes. Clear as day. When I find myself in Cbus again, the Residence Inn is high on my list!Great hotel with great staff and a good honest breakfast! Built in an old bank that is really cool!Little to do and hotel is old and dated. Rooms are noisy and staff is not helpful. Grandview heights or short north areas are much nicer!Quite pleased with the service of the hotel staff. The hotel is in a great location of downtown Columbus. And if you plan to visit COSI the hotel is less than a mile away. The east view from the 12th floor gives you a nice picture of the tall buildings in the city. My family and I will definitely be staying here the next time we are in the Columbus area. Also, if you have children the history behind the hotel is neat. Each morning breakfast is served from within the old bank fault. The kids will love it. Vaulted ceilings and portions of the old bank still present give visitors a sense of the good ole days in Columbus!Excellent location and the rooms were very spacious.  The kitchen was well stocked, and even the breakfast was great.The 5th floor was great.  I wish the view of the city was better.Walking distance to a Starbucks, and across the street is a nail place and restaurants.  The only reason for the 4 stars was the ""Happy Hour"" was a little misleading. I thought we'd get free muchies, like trail mix, pretzels, or something to go with our drinks.  Many hotels offer free soft drinks, but I had to pay for my pepsi, and it was a ""used"" opened bottle (so it was flat).Valet is $20 per day, and some people posted their cars got broken into.  Mine didn't but it still made me worried.Resident Inn was class all the way. This hotel is actually built in an old bank, and it keeps the giant splendor of it. Monstrously high ceilings, gold leaf everywhere, the iron bars still on the window (in a really nice old-school way). It's an impressive sight from the first moment in.Even the elevators have old school buttons. That's so cool.You do get this classic feeling in the lobby, which is why I was semi-disappointed when I got up to the hallway and that all disappeared. It looked like your normal hotel hallway and then my room was a normal hotel room. I wish they could have kept up with the 1940 bank theme throughout, but I'm sure this was cheaper and easier. Ah well.My room was nice though. I actually had to walk up two stairs to get to the door (making it feel like more of a home than just a room) and inside was spacious and classy. Bed was comfortable, view was nice. All around solid.Parking here is an issue. There's valet for $20 a day or you can park down the lost for $9 for 12 hours (so if you're staying for a full day and have nowhere to drive to, I'd suggest the valet). Complimentary breakfast is served in the morning and there's even a little mart in the hotel if you need to buy anything. Rooms are about $150 a night and worth it. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.As a couple of the other reviewers already stated, I've never quite seen such a unique Residence Inn location anywhere in the U.S. The old bank location which now houses this beautiful and modern hotel was a SUPERB idea and made me think a little better of Marriott these days because they saved such an historic building.The rooms were amazing! I opted for a one bedroom suite. I couldn't believe how clean it was and I didn't find one thing out of order. I'm a world traveler so hotels are very important to me because I tend to get use out of the accommodations. This location really satisfied me and I'll definitely be staying here again when we return to Columbus.The layout of the rooms, kitchen amenities, linens, bedding, towels, etc. all above average and usable. One evening my coffee pot stopped working and someone immediately brought me a new one out of the box. Another evening I didn't have a corkscrew for some wine (I was told there was one in the kitchen drawer). Immediately someone came up with a new one. Awesome service! Wifi is free in the rooms and unlike many hotels, the wireless connection was powerful and quick. I worked in the room several of the days during my stay and downloaded everything I needed without a problem.The breakfast buffet in the morning was one of the best buffets I've seen. The food actually tasted great! And they served some really delicious biscuits and gravy that I never get! It was a real treat!In summary, this is definitely my Columbus hotel location for future trips. The value, space, modern amenities, breakfast, service, all add up to a very, very nice stay in a superb location in downtown!Great hotel.  Great staff.  Awesome ambiance in this historic property.  Would return in a heartbeat.Nice hotel for a business stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was really really really quiet when I stayed, almost like a ghost town.  Valet was super convenient.  Wish they had a restaurant and room service.  Would stay again.Beautiful historic hotel in an old bank building. Rooms nicely appointed with kitchenette/living room and separate bedroom/bath room. Hot breakfast- nicer than most hotels (cereal, oatmeal, waffles, eggs, meat, etc) was served from the old bank vault. We stayed for our anniversary and used Marriott points, so not sure on the value for money. We loved the old style and found it a lovely hotel. Would and will plan to stay again!5 stars is hard to come by for me. I love Marriott and whenever i travel i try my hardest to stay at one, so when I went to Columbus Oh for a convention I was thrilled to know I had my choice of three different brands of Marriott. I picked this one even though the other was closer and didnt even have a restaurant or pool (which are key for me). The decor of this hotel was something I needed to see and I deff wasnt disappointed. I was surprised by the fully stocked kitchen and loved how the place was set up; it felt really homey. Being 8hrs from home, feeling at ease made things so much better and I was able to enjoy my week stay that much more. We had a few mishaps but like Marriott always does, our problems were solved with ease. Location was key for us and I loved my stay so much I made another special trip to Columbus just to re visit the area. My husband and I fell in love with the city, and I sit here now writing this review to say Ive now moved here to Columbus and part of the reason was the homey-nes I felt from the very first stay I had with Marriott Residence a year ago.The rooms are wonderful and so are the staff. The breakfast is a decent breakfast as far as complimentary hotel breakfasts go. This is a nice hotel if you are looking for a little bit more room but not trying to pay too much for that extra space. The kitchenette and closed off bedroom are a bonus. The location is close to downtown and a short walk from the convention center and Short North. Loved it !","As a true business traveler, it's pretty rare for me to rate a hotel 5 stars, but I truly enjoyed my stay here while in town for the weekend.We chose this place because we were traveling with our two dogs, and Residence Inn accepts pets with a non-refundable fee.  The building is gorgeous inside and completely unlike any other Residence Inn I've ever seen.  The room was a little on the small side (queen bed, no king), but still comfortable.  New bathrooms, new kitchen, tasteful granite, nice cabinets.  The breakfast is pretty good (yogurt parfaits were my favorite!), and the internet is free.  It's a good location to explore most of Columbus.Just about the only thing I can complain about is the expensive valet-only parking.  You can park in the garage next door, but if you stay over on a Sunday, try for a meter out front and park for free!This is, by far, one of the best Marriott properties I've ever stayed in.  As other folks have mentioned, the breakfast is great, the old building is beautiful, the rooms are clean and spacious, and the staff is delightful.PROTIP:  Parking behind the hotel!  Take the immediate right turn after the hotel (if you're on Gay St) go through the little alley, and turn on your next major one way.  The garage you'll park in is on the right.  It's $10 overnight, but since there is no attendant, it's only $5 if you leave first thing in the morning.  PROTIP PROTIP:  Be cautious of street cleaning.  The hotel side of the street is cleaned Monday Morning (if you're parking overnight on Sunday) from Midnight to 6am and the side opposite is done on Tuesday Morning (if you're parking overnight Monday) from Midnight to 6am. Failure to move your car will get you a $25 ticket.  Also! Parking is now metered until after 10pm.  It should be criminal!PROTIP PROTIP PROTIP:  Pay your ticket.PROTIP:  There's ""Cafe Brioso"" next door -- they make some of the best effing coffee I've ever had.  Seriously.  It should be criminal to stay at this hotel and not go for coffee next door.This is a great place to stay if you are going to be here for a little while. Clean rooms, great kitchen space and supplies. My only issue is that there is not a lot of late night eats in the area. Other than that., this is a great place for the business traveler.This is one of the coolest hotels I've ever stayed in.  Anywhere. The building used to be the Buckeye State Building and Loan, and they converted it into a hotel!   I love staying at hotels that have been converted from a previous use(an old river paddle boat and a grain silo being the most notable).  I mean, who wants to stay at a boring cookie cutter hotel that is the same exact layout in every other city? Lame!   Pushing my way through the revolving door I had no idea the cavernous lobby space that awaited me... I could only stare in awe, mouth agape at the beautiful mason-work of the massive ceiling and walls, every detail borne out with the flood of natural light from huge windows.   To the back of this giant lobby is a sort of loft area holding the hotel bar and lounge(happy hour during the weekdays!), the workout room, and a meeting room which they will furnish with food and beverage at your request.   The kitchen is on the main level in the freaking vault! And yes the vault door is still there(that thing is seriously beefy). Complimentary breakfast everyday consisting of eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, biscuit/tortilla/croissant, cold and hot cereals, make your own waffle station, make your own yogurt parfait station, bagel, toast, english muffin, fresh fruit, coffee, and juice. Plus they have complimentary dinner nights a couple times a week with such themes chili dog or fiesta(tacos, nachos, etc.).  Basically they give you the hookup on food...  While the building itself may be old school, all the amenities are definitely modern and definitely chic. The decor of the rooms are as nice as any Vegas hotel, plus you've got a full kitchen with range-top, dishwasher, sink, fridge, etc.! Plus every room has a flat panel HDtv and HBO.   Bottom Line: Great experience in a an awesome old building! Aside from two separate run-ins with a rude kitchen staff member, my stay could not have been any better. I can't think of any reason to stay elsewhere in Columbus!OK so I've stayed here the last two times I've been in Columbus OH and it's a really solid spot.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and the breakfast is awesome since they change it up just enough each morning.The building is pretty beautiful as well, especially the main lobby interior although the only thing that was a little funky was that our room had a vague hint of armpit smell.  Not sure what that was about but it was just faint enough not to be bothersome and we kept forgetting to ask them about it.  Obviously it wasn't enough to make that much of an impact on us as we'll definitely be coming back!Decent place not 5 star but practical and adequate for a business traveler who needs a kitchen for three or more days. Good points: full sized fridge microwave dishwasher and pots pans etc. lots if surface area to spread out your papers: desk sofa coffee table dining table ottoman etc. cramped but I am here for work so these are all useful as work space.  Bad points are crummy scratchy old towels and so so bedding but like I said it is not supposed to be 5 star. Ditto others who have praised staff for friendliness and genuine warmth and competence.  Especially Paul i think his name was. Parking mandatory valet at $20 a day seems pricey but all the downtown hotels charge this and while there are cheaper lots nearby they do not allow repeat entry during the day and the area is creepy to walk at night so i believe it is a good value. Gay Street is the most walkable street in all of downtown by far. There are coffee and tea shops three great restaurants. Other parts of downtown are run down deserted and scary even in the day.The good:  The staff are super nice and the rooms are great (flat panel tv; couch; free wifi; kitchen; frig).The so-so:  Breakfast is free, but kinda gross; There is a gym, but it is too small to really use (fortunately you can go across the street to metro fitness, which is another story); The bad:  There is no hotel kitchen, so room service comes from the way overpriced Due Amici from across the street and there is few delivery options otherwise; the hallways typically have a strange odor; no pool; and the bar is always empty.Great hotel with a central downtown location. I was skeptical when the host hotel was sold out for a convention and I typically stay at Marriott's but this is a very cool re-do of a older Columbus property. Staff was more then courteous to solve a problem with a gym associated with the property and room was very large and clean. $20 valet fee not fun but typical for downtown property. Would stay here again no problem.The hotel is in a beautiful building, and the rooms are spacious, having the exact same decoration as every other Residence Inn.  I stayed on the 15th floor, and my only complaint was that there was a constant banging noise and rumbling feeling either from the ventilation system or the elevator shaft.  When I checked out, I mentioned this to the staff at the desk, who (disingenuously) acted surprised.I'm staying in this hotel again in two weeks, and I hope they've fixed the problem.I stayed at this hotel for work-related business.  Supposedly, the hotel opened 9 weeks ago after being vacant for 10 years..bc it's haunted (maybe).  Who knows?  Anyway, the building is beautiful!  The inside of the building is very detailed and the builders did a great job transforming the bank into a hotel.  They even left little detail like the original elevator buttons and the vault.  They serve free breakfast in the morning and it's actually inside the old vault.  The hotel staff are super friendly and respectful.  The rooms were perfect...not sure if this is bc it's a new hotel, but I honestly found nothing wrong.  You have a frig, dishwasher, kitchen, living room area, separate bedroom area, nice vanity area, and decent bathroom space.  In the rooms, they left the old bank windows, as well.  After work, I usually try to find things to do in new surroundings, but hey...I was in OH and just came back from NYC...there really was nothing to do or go see.  Thanks to my hotel...I had an enjoyable time relaxing!The staff is really good. Everyone is very helpful and friendly and offer excellent service. The rooms are awesome and spacious with a flatscreen TV and free WiFi! They also have free breakfast with a variety of food. There is no restaurant inside the hotel though and there are hardly any people in the bar. The fitness center is pretty small but you could work out at the gym nearby.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-columbus-3,Best Western Plus,2.5,$$,23,"I haven't really encountered any staff, but I am very pleased with the cleanliness I /did/ encounter. I also appreciate all of the accommodations in the room such as the microwave and mini fridge. And I was pleased to find a bible in the night stand drawer.First thing I'd like to say is. Our room was clean. Now for the rest of the hotel. From the minute we walked to our room we smelled a very strong marijuana smell and the hallways stayed that way during the two night stay. The bar area was dirty and we waited a very long time to make an order. After ordering our drinks we were ignored and didn't receive a drink until we saw another employee who had no idea how to pour a vodka and cranberry on the rocks. There were also people yelling in the hallway most of the time. It seemed more like a crack house then a hotel.This was literally the worst hotel I have ever stayed in period. For starters the where roaches so we told the manager who said he would move out check out to 1pm and switch our rooms (we did not want to unless we saw another one) which we where grateful for. Later that night my friend put some towels on the towel rack (4 to be exact) and the towel rack fell off the wall I wish this was the last problem but sadly I was not that lucky. The room service worker could not speak English (I don't have a problem with this) she then kept trying to get into the room (which she did) and we kept saying not to then she tried to force her way into the bathroom while my friend was in the shower and you can hear it running when you are in the room. The next morning when we woke up the room was so hot and we couldn't figure out why so we go look at the heater and when we got close we found out why. It was freezing by the heater because it was literally falling out of the wall so it would turn on every 30 seconds. So we stay one more night and began packing at 11Am at 1:10 pm we get a call saying they called the police because our check out was noon. They never called at noon informing us about this and we told the woman that the manager gave us till 1Pm she wouldn't listen to us. My advice don't stay here you will surely regret that decision.NO FREE BREAKFAST !!Only reason I go to best western is for their free food not to mention you have to pay 6 bucks for the same food you get anywhere else.The food at the bar was Chinese which sucked I paid 13 bucks for a plate that didn't even get me full my drinks where over price the rooms need more of a facelift the Bruce Jenner.All in all this best western sucks and I only stay at best westernsThis was a minimally serviceable hotel at a very low rate, with a reasonably good location.  I really don't need to elaborate much more than that, but I will add a few more details. Its close to 71 off 161 so there is good access to most of northern columbus from this location.  Its not an awful part of town, but its not the best either.  The staff was ok, pretty unmemorable.  I had to get two rooms for my group - my room was clean and generally fine, but the other room smelled like an old man rubbed his face all over everything.  The price was very, very low.  So the value was pretty good all things considered.  If you need a cheap room and good access to the highway, this will do.Our stay was a horror show. The inmates were running the asylum. We saw hookers in lobby while checking in. I was afraid to go anywhere near the bed for fear of bed bugs. The mattress had a huge crater as if a truck or bus parked on it. I could go on, but what's the point?I was so afraid our car wouldn't be there when we woke up...be afraid, be very afraid!Don't waste your time staying at this hotel. The staff is extremely rude and not helpful. I felt they were doin everything in their power to make our stay miserable. The hotel smells like old dirty mops and cigarette buds. I book a room for Friday thru Tuesday. When I get there Friday my room was book for someone else and I had to wait several hours to get a room! I would have been better off sleeping in my car! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!!You get what you pay for... I found a good deal from Priceline but didn't know all Best Western's are not the same.- No breakfast- Rude Staff- Someone on the top floor making noise late night- Another room had loud music - creepy people- Late checkout should have given me 30 minutes but the key stopped working at 12. The front desk warned me that I will be charged extra even if I stay a minute over 30 minutes after 12.- Ok, for a one-nighter but I would not recommend long term stay here.Going to start throwing clothes in the garbage if people can't respect that other people need the washer and dryerNot very good.  Hallways had offensive skunk smell.  Bathroom not very clean and out of date.  Bedding was clean and television was nice.  No free breakfast.  Was cheap and on sale with priceline.  Wouldn't go back.The positives: clean room, modestly appointed, decent for the price. Quick check in and friendly staff. The negatives: Although the rooms on the floor were all non smoking the hallways smelled heavily of smoke. The layout was industrial feeling and the doors had an unnerving "" break ins are all too frequent "" feel to them. Window pane was broken and window was wide open on entering room.Bed bugs and fleas. Awful hotel. Never again.My wife got the room and I didn't realize she booked it here. The place is not a 5 star hotel to begin with, so my expectations were that of a 3 star hotel. The neighborhood the hotel was in didn't look bad to me, the fence that separated the hood from the hotel looked adequate. My car wasn't broken into here, but parking was at a premium because some ""jack wagons"" were parking their car and taking up 4 spaces in the process. The tree clearing business that was apparently staying there did the same thing, so about 30 spots were occupied by 6 vehicles. Nice people. The rooms were a good size. The bathroom was small, but I wasn't thinking I was going to be throwing a party in there. The door to get in and out DOES slam often, announcing your arrival every time. Also, every time I left the room, the hallway wreaked of cigarette smoke, but all the rooms were clearly marked NO SMOKING. I'm not sure what was going on there. I think the biggest complaint is that there is free continental breakfast advertised and it is also in the rooms guest book stating a free continental breakfast. It's not free, it's associated with the adjoining Spain restaurant and it's discounted for hotel guest. That's not free. My wife did not like the beds. More specifically, the plastic sheets, which are presumably to combat both bed bugs and bed wetters. The business center was small, but I was able to use it when I needed to after hours without issue. The room was cleaned daily otherwise. Would I stay here again? Probably not. I think next time I'll opt for another location. However, I can see some of the other Yelpers points. It was very convenient to the highway, restaurants, and even a bowling alley.I'm reviewing just the fitness center. I'm a local and I go here in the winter months to run on thier indoor track.  The fitness center is a 10 ft walk out the front door from the hotel and is free for hotel guests.  I get just a 3 month membership since I'm a runner and this is one of few fitness centers that have a track and don't require a long term contract.  The place is ok, looks a little worn, but everything seems to be functional. The place is frequented by a bunch of local boxers so you have to dodge people lifting weights while on the track or kids who sneak up from the pool below.  But it beats running on icy streets.After running I hit the pool. Its a nice 25 meter pool with about 6 lanes. In the winter many evenings it is rented by a local youth swim team so everyone else is crowded into one lane. This is  a pain if you want to swim laps.  The steam room works well and their is a hot tub and its ok, but I have my own so I don't use this one. All if all its worth the $75 I pay for 3 months.   Again, free for hotel guests.From the pics I saw on line of the place, I thought it would be cleaner than what it was. When I pulled up, w/ my daughter and niece, there were men hanging out in the parking lot. The lobby was dirty, there were people hanging out on the stairs, barefoot kids running around like it was a playground. The only good thing was a clean room. The bed was hard and uncomfortable, hallways were like a maze. Thank God we didnt have bed bugs, because from looking at the lobby, you would think there would be.This place is VERY dirty.  Nasty.  Breakfast stops at 9:00 am.  Crap joint.  Should be kicked out of best western franchise.DON'T. DON'T.DON'T.In case my comments above MIGHT not be clear DON'T stay there. Rooms are OK, but our car (despite being parked under their security cameras) was broken into. Everything was gone through and stuff was stolen. It was reported to the hotel staff and they could not have cared less. NEVER heard a word from them as follow up. As if that wasn't bad enough the Cop that showed up to fill in the ""report"" told us he could handle three breakins a shift every day from strip of hotels near the Best Western. So:A/ It' not safe.B/ The staff couldn't give a shit.Stay at your peril. Be prepared for a door glass repair bill to be added to your invoice when you check out and you won't be too surprised or disappointed.The images of the Olympic sized pool online had me assume the rooms would be equally as awesome. Not so. My first floor double non-smoking room smelled strongly that the last tenant (or housekeeping) was smoking in the room. The bathroom was small, but clean and only 1 person could operate effectively. I was also a bit concerned with the rough neighborhood the hotel was located in. The only employee we saw there was the front desk guy who while effective, was visibly hating his job. On the good side, the Pizza Hut next door was excellent and the pool/sauna met my expectations although the hot-tub was on the fritz when we were there. Overall, the stay was decent for the rate we paid.The beds and bed linens are perfect and clean. No bad smells. No dust. No elevator and we were on the second floor--not cool. The hallway is on two different levels so more up and down with my suit case. There is a large lap pool. The breakfast is $5 and it is a full breakfast. So what makes this stay a 4 star? The price and the quality beds, the 40in plasma tv, ironing board and iron, hair blower, microwave, large fridge all for $59, that 's how. I've heard that Best Westerns were quality. This one was. On your way south from the windy city and are gonna be in Columbus around check-in time, check into this Best Western but get a room on the first floor.Was in town for a wedding and meant to book Port Columbus and got this hotel instead. The was definitely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. There were drug dealers, hookers and homeless people hanging around; empty condom boxes outside and a dog pooped in the hall and it was not cleaned until at least 24 hours later and only after we called to complain. The electricity went out Friday morning, I was woken up to the microwave beeping and I could not move the entertainment center to unplug it. I called the lobby and they said they would send someone up to unplug it but never did. There were gnats in the room and even though I kept killing them, they somehow continued to reappear...I would not stay here for free!","Two-story hotel in suburban Columbus, probably a 15 minute drive from downtown. Bed was sagging a lot, but surprisingly did not cause me any backaches. Free continental breakfast was not very good, the only hot food was weak scrambled eggs, little fresh fruit, no yogurt. Some parts of the hallways smelled very strongly of smoke and my room also smelled mildly of smoke and cleaning fluids. The hotel does have some smoking rooms but it was impossible to breathe in some hallways. No DVD player for the TV. The ground floor room I had was convenient because the sliding glass door opened in front of my parking space. The hotel and neighborhood seemed safe. A previous reviewer mentioned homeless people but I did not encounter any during my stay in June 2009. There are no sidewalks in the area so there is almost no pedestrian traffic. On weekend nights the restaurant turns into a very loud dance club so you might want to ask for rooms away from the restaurant. One of the side entrance doors did not latch and was constantly open throughout my stay. The room was clean and the hotel was relatively cute and quiet. I believe they also allow pets in some rooms. There is a large grassy field behind the hotel which is a good place to take your pet for a stroll if it is of the strolling variety. There is an indoor pool big enough to do laps in and an outdoor pool which is smaller. Free wireless internet was spotty at times but generally decent.Rooms were clean and spacious. Beds were thin but not sagging. Free wi-fi with a strong in-room signal. Good value (quality for the price). Uncool: 1) homeless asking for money in the middle of the night; 2) Receptionist with no sense of direction for those who get lost on Dublin versus Dublin-Granville Rd; and 3) The entry/exit door that slams each time someone comes or goes from the back of the hotel.I seriously LOVED it here.  First off all, I have stayed in MANY hotels in the area and this is the best, for sure.  I got a non-smoking room, and my room didn't smell at all-although some of the hallways did.  My room had a mini fridge and a microwave in it so that was a plus also.  For the neighborhood it is in it is very quiet. The outdoor pool is small but the indoor pool is HUGE and I loved that they had diving blocks! (: When I got in my room it was very clean, something I've had issues with in other hotels. It also looked really, really nice.  I got this hotel for 30 DOLLARS on priceline and I was AMAZED at how awesome it was.  My only complaint was that some of the surrounding rooms were NOISY, but, I could only hear them from the hallway.  In my room it was quiet, peaceful, and clean, like a hotel room should be! Next time I am in this area I will definitely stay here again, and I would definitely advise you to stay here, if you are staying in this part of columbus, or any part really, BEST VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY. oh also, that bed was more comfortable than the one at my home, seriously, favorite part!!",,,,"['haven', 'really', 'encountered', 'staff', 'pleased', 'cleanliness', 'encounter', 'also',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-columbus-downtown-columbus,Hampton Inn & Suites Columbus Downtown,4.0,$$,43,"I had an absolutely excellent stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites in Downtown Columbus! The staff was an absolute pleasure to deal with.  They each greeted me with a smile and continuously offered any help they could.  They even gave me a complimentary razor and shaving cream, since I had forgotten mine.  The location of the hotel is second to none.  You are placed right in the heart of downtown within walking distance of several bars and restaurants, as well as the Columbus Convention Center!  The hotel also provides valet parking, at a small cost.  When you wish to leave, you can call down and have your car waiting at the curb for you.  Then there is the room. FABULOUS!!  Flat screen tv, great wifi signal, beautiful view of Columbus, great stand up shower, and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on in the country!  I am not sure when the Hampton Inn and Suites was renovated last but everything in my room still appeared to be brand new.  The housekeeping staff provided additional towels upon request. There was a convenient vending area right outside of my room. If you want more snacks or supplies there is even a great little sundries shop right next to the front desk! I really enjoyed my stay and the Hampton Inn and Suites in Downtown Columbus and cannot wait to return!As others have mentioned, the rooms are exceptionally well kept, the breakfast doesn't disappoint, and the location couldn't be better.  However, for this review, I have to give major kudos to the staff for really looking out for me, the customer.  After a grueling three-day business trip, I left this Hampton Inn for what was destined to be a nearly 9-hour wait for my departing flight (long story...).  While waiting in Port Columbus Airport purgatory, I received an email from Roxane (one of the front-desk staff) notifying me that Housekeeping found my house and car keys while cleaning out my former room.  Needless to say, I panicked a little.  However, she managed to connect me with a taxi service that they would reimburse directly to take me to the hotel and back so I could claim my keys before I left town.  All I have to say is that I could not have been more fortunate in finding a hotel staff that went above and beyond the call of duty to help an absentminded soul like me.If I'm ever in Columbus again, this would be my number one pick as a place to stay.  Thanks for being awesome, Hampton Inn!!Overall, my stay at the Hampton Inn was very good. The rooms were very clean, fitness center was nice, and continental breakfast was good. Only bad thing about the Hampton Inn was there are no microwaves and Refrigerators in the rooms. The impeccable staff is what stood out the most. From the moment my colleagues and I walked through the doors we were very much impressed with Troy's hospitality and promptness at the front desk. He really want above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. This was our first time in Columbus so we weren't familiar with the area. He recommended a place nearby for us to shop and eat. In addition he arranged the shuttle for us to get picked up and dropped off. As flight attendants, we stay at several hotels on a regular basis and so we really appreciate the enormity of attentiveness given to us.A few blocks from the heart of Short North (Columbus's trendy restaurant/bar strip), this Hampton Inn is an amazing place to stay for business (especially if you need to be downtown or at the convention center). The property is impeccably well kept, the staff is tremendous, the rooms are super clean and everything works, gym is great, breakfast is pretty good. The have coffee and tea available at all hours. They have free printing in their business center. The strength of their wifi could use improvement. I had some issues with it during my stay. Will definitely stay here when work brings me back to Columbus.I'm not sure where to start on this place, honestly. I guess I'll use the Sandwich Method here. I'm not hoity toity, fancy, or pretentious. Here's the thing though. when you're paying a pretty big chunk of change for a hotel, you should get what you pay for. It's gorgeous, clean, and the wifi was fast. Nice beds as always too. Here's the bad parts... I literally waited 5 minutes for anyone to get to my car at Valet  I'm just standing around like where the hell are these people? ( 24.00 ) btw. which isn't a big deal ... Just drove 4 hours, kind of wanted to just check the fuck in and take a nap already. So, we finally get checked in, yadda yadda. Walked into a clean room, thought everything was kosher. THEN, about 20-30 minutes later, no knocks, no "" house keeping, you want me to fluff pillow ?"" or anything... 2 people just barge in while, well, how do I put this... You know when a man and a woman love each other and things happen. YEP. Right then. Fucking unbelievable. Seriously? It's THREE PM, I'm checked in, fucking KNOCK. Terribly embarrassing. We were LIVID. Of course, I went down and said my piece about what I thought about the situation... 6 hours later, I get a call... "" We comped your room and we are SOOO so sorry "" Sure. I get it. Mistakes happen. I let that go... I then check my bank statement, I get charged TWICE, instead of getting a refund. Lovely... I had just spent a shitload of money in The Short North district, and then 200 more dollars get pulled on top of the ORIGINAL 200 they charged?! 3-5 business days to get ALL of that back now. Perfect. BUT, Everyone was very nice. They tried to accommodate, yet didn't do a very good job... The coffee was very good. I'm just trying to not want to hate this place right now. I'll give them one more shot... Hopefully they can get their shit together. Cheers.Awesome hotel at an awesome location.  Reasonably priced for downtown Columbus, and if you're in town for a convention at the convention center, this Hampton Inn is it.  It's located right across the street from the convention center, literally takes less than 2 minutes to get there, extremely convenient.  It's also right next to the North Market, lots of eatery options. This Hampton is also bigger than others.  Nice big lobby, and the entire hotel is very new, clean and modern.  There's freshly brewed coffee all day and complimentary breakfast in the morning.  The front desk and the staff were very friendly.  There's a presidential suite on every floor, and they were so nice they even bumped me to the presidential suite (definitely coming back and staying here next time I'm in town lol).  Valet parking or you can self-park at the garage across from the North Market.We stayed back in January for a convention, and while it was not connected to the convention center it was just a quick walk across the street. The room was nice and well cleaned, but the walls were absolutely paper thin. If people are outside your door, be prepared to hear them as if they were in the room themselves. Staff was very nice, especially someone named Jeremy, I think. The poor girl at the check in desk still got us a room last minute after a problem with our last hotel, even though the lobby was filled with people trying to get a room. She was a doll. We did have a little problem with the GM after my fiance mistakenly thought the items in their suite shop were complementary. He didn't see any prices and noticed that there wasn't a cash register like any traditional shop would have had, only an unmanned window to the check in desk. He said it was an odd and confusing layout, and I must admit he shouldn't have assumed that it was complementary but I took a look down myself and I did think it was a strange and confusing layout as well The poor guy was distraught after he was yelled at by the GM and threatened to have the cops called on him over a bag of chex mix. I felt like the situation could have been handled better as the GM was a little boorish over the incident, and I was appalled by his tone and manner. If they haven't already, as this was months ago, they need better signage down in their shoppe to alleviate any problems like my fiance had or at least mark their window with a ""pay here"" sign. Again, the GM was a little crude about the chex mix incident, and brutishly gave us 30 min to pack up our stuff and leave while reminding us that we weren't getting money returned for the night we wouldn't stay. I still stand by my opinion that the situation was handled very poorly, even though I understand that theft is not tolerated, but a little empathy about the confusing suite shoppe would have been nice. I do believe Jeremy gave us a refund for our un-stayed night; I think he felt bad for us.You can find a photo of their suite shoppe on their slideshow right on the homepage and judge for yourselves.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhamptoninn3.hilton.com%2Fen%2Fhotels%2Fohio%2Fhampton-inn-and-suites-columbus-downtown-CMHHSHX%2Faccommodations%2Findex.html&amp;s=cde98fc4be5e9691192c68e28accfacf4f6474e86e565e59bc5c52bd0e266780"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hamptoninn3.hilton.com/e...</a>Stayed here this past weekend for a Bachelorette party and we had a BLAST!!! The staff at the hotel are amazing - Clifford was literally so very kind and happy! We all absolutely loved him - the other people at the front desk were also helpful! We were a rowdy bunch &amp; they took great care of us. I was especially impressed with their continental breakfast - it was delicious &amp; much much better than most. So many options!Overall, we had an amazing stay here &amp; I would highly recommend!Excellent stay. Rooms are very clean. They have onsite gym, Pool and whirlpool. Great breakfast and delicious coffee. The staff is very pleasant and everyone greets you with a smile and make you feel welcome. Will definitely return for another stay when I'm back in town.First impression - right across from the Convention Center, so that was a huge plus for us. Very convenient access.The room was nice - as Hilton Hhonors members, we were able to request a higher floor. We got the room right next to the Presidential Suite. Great pool and hottub, but no poolside towels. That was a bummer. Free breakfast is always a plus! Not quite what Embassy Suites offers, but still decent, with omelettes, sausages, and potatoes, and waffle makers, and usual pastries and bagels. Front desk service was exceptional. Christine (Kristine?) ended up taking care of a lot of things for us, and made the stay very pleasant. Oh, the complimentary toiletries were a godsend when our luggage was misplaced by Southwest Airlines. Thank you, Hampton!After driving for hours we arrived at the hotel to find out that the room we thought we had been given as a wedding gift had not actually been paid for, only reserved. The desk clerk we went to first was polite but cold, and I thought we should just go to another hotel. But the supervisor, Ms. Sura, took over at the front desk and helped us problem-solve in a kind and efficient manner.  We are grateful for her help and ultimately had a comfortable stay.Me and some co-workers stayed here for the Arnold Classic at the convention center. This place was pretty nice, but it truly was the people that worked there that made it such a wonderful place to stay. Clifford is a ray of sunshine here - he is always ready and eager to help anyone with anything- whether it's putting away your luggage or getting you coffee! He is very high spirited and is a staple to this hotel running smoothly and keeping guests feeling very welcome! Another great employee here is Jeremy. He anticipates customer needs like no other and is very accommodating. Best tip about this place: There is coffee and tea in the front lobby right by the elevators for on your way in or out!The property is gorgeous - everything re-done with new high-end finishes, and just a really pleasant place to stay. The wifi is easy and fast, and my favorite thing - SOOOOOO many outlets and usb plugs in the room. Wonderfully modern and convinient. And there is a very happy man named Clifton that you should hope is working when you check in. He is hilariously enthusiastic. Only thing I'd advise is that on a weekend, the club music from nearby can get pretty loud - I don't know why the city of Columbus lets that happen.Stayed here recently for work and it was terrific. Great staff, Clifford is a one-of-a-kind character and he made everyone there feel like a guest in the truest sense of the word. Rooms are very clean and comfortable and you can't ask more for location, I was able to walk everywhere all weekend.Very nice hotel! The front desk workers were friendly, and the rooms were clean and stylish. The pillows were awesome.. And the breakfast buffet was delicious. I'd definitely come back.I never thought I would give a Hampton Inn 5 stars....For a Hampton inn this is the best you get. I got a suite, which was huge! Nice fixtures and furniture then any full service Hilton I have stayed in! Extreme clean, no smells, no stains on linen. Valet Parking only, I missed it first, Valet is located on the side of the building.Door greeter is nice and friendly, although I think unnecessary for a Hampton Inn. Location is excellent for walk-ability to any kind of restaurant/style. Personally I checked a few out and they were all too loud for me to work and have dinner. I drove 1 mile down High st and found even more restaurants!I've stay in my fair share of hotels around the world (once logging in 221 days in one year) and I have to say that I was really impressed with this Hampton Inn and Suites.  First of all, this was the nicest Hampton property I have ever seen.  It looks newly remodeled and done in contempory style.  I could have mistaked it for the Hyatt Andaz property easily.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly &amp; helpful and the suite I was upgraded to was very spacious like I've seen at the Embassy Suites.I'll be honest, I don't get too excited when I have to visit Ohio but this really does make the difference for me when coming out to Columbus. And its proximity to some nice restaurants and bars is an added plus.I didn't not stay over the weekend or during an event but I would think it can get a little crazy outside with college bars around the corner.All in all, an unexpected nice find.The hotel was recommended by the wedding couple for its convenient location.  Everything around in The arena district is walkable and easy to navigate. Rooms are very nice, recently updated with very nice bathrooms-best hotel bathroom mirrors I've ever seen. Pool and gym facility were better than I've seen, breakfast was fine. Our only issue was getting in and out of The garage during two festivals.A great hotel for the price.  Reasonably priced and conveniently located to OSU, downtown, Arena district and Short North.  Clean with updated, contemporary styling.  Not a super fancy hotel, but definitely nice enough for me.  Very good breakfast buffet that is free, and free WiFi.  Was shocked when I was upgraded to a suite for free!  A very happy surprise.  All employees I encountered were super positive, helpful and friendly.  Clifford abounds with outgoing enthusiasm and welcome.Toiletries provided were pretty basic.  There were not any full length mirrors anywhere in the room.  The toilets flushed extremely loudly like a jet engine.Overall I had a great stay and would definitely return.One of better Hamptons I have stayed at in awhile. Location is great - across from the Convention Center and the North Market. They are in the middle of a renovation and I did stay in one of the updated rooms so all good there. The staff was great - super helpful and friendly. They offer the standard amenties: breakfast, free wi-fi, cookies in the lobby. The only con was the valet only parking. But the valet did make it easy by letting you text a number to get your car instead of calling. Overall, great value for a downtown hotel - I would recommend to other co-workers and stay here again.","Came to Columbus for a job interview and they put me up here.  Really good service and good location.  Front desk people were nice and helpful.  They gave me a bottle of water upon my arrival and the valet service was pretty snappy, even at 5 in the morning.  The manager greets guests when they walk past the front desk and asks if there is anything they need, which honestly is a great thing to do and a pretty rare event in hotels these days.  The Arena district is rowdy at night, but the hotel feels very safe.   It's not an overly luxurious hotel, but the service and accommodations they provide are solid and good value.  Best thing: Free wifi and free breakfast!  Tea and coffee always available.  Great hotel if you're in Columbus for a few days.Worst Hampton Inn we've ever been to, and we are frequent Hampton stayers. The staff was overwhelmed and unfriendly, valet is under staffed and very slow, and the only place that had air conditioning was our room (thank gosh). The breakfast area was so hot that it made the food disgusting, and the juice was all room temp. Save yourself $$ and stay 15 minutes away at the Polaris or Easton Hampton Inn.am a fan of of Hampton Inns in general. Hilton provides a consistent brand across the country. They are really good for families with the free breakfast. This hampton is in a great location in be short north and near the market--and close to 2 Jeni's ice cream shops! There are lots of restaurants and bars within walking distances. Like most Hampton Inns this one has a boutique-y feel. Rooms were clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I found the business center to be comfortable and the equipment in good working order. Would stay here again!Amazing stay at the Hampton! Very clean rooms, nice staff and most importantly the coffee is wonderful. Not only was this hotel really nice and enjoyable, but it was in the best location. Walking distance to everything I would need. Definitely a place I would return to as a car rental is not needed. Thank you Hampton!Take me to High Street!(After a particularly blah stay at the Westin DT, I was smarter this trip and stayed in the Short North...much better!)LOCATION: First off, you cannot beat the location of this Hampton. A stone's throw from North Market...where any food item you might need (including Jeni's Ice cream!) lives. Right on High Street...where a bevy of shops, restaurants, bars and galleries perch themselves sweetly. Many entertainment options, and right across the street from the Convention Center. Location is exceptional, and made my stay absolutely lovely. BREKKIE: Hampton's are known for their complimentary hot breakfast, and it was standard, per usual. Hot coffee, tea and other morning beverages plus some hot egg and meat items, cereal, pastries, fruit and yogurt. Quite substantial, and a nice eat-in dining room to watch the news or skim USA Today. To-go cups for coffee, nice touch. Despite the Christian Bible Pre-teen conference that overwhelmed (assaulted!) my pre-9am senses...this was still quite enjoyable. STAFF: Very friendly, though I would've appreciated one thing upon checkout. I had asked them to look up my HH number so I could earn points for my stay...and she told me to call an 800#. Um, no. How about you help me with it and we get it sorted out right here and I leave feeling like you actually care about where I spend my money and sleep my head at night, mmmmk!?ROOM: Besides the frigid, old AC that blasted 24 hours a day and gave me a sore throat...the room was A-OK. 2 nicely sized rooms (a suite!), clean bathroom, etc. The comforter was decidedly....lumpy? Yes, lumpy. Weird, like they washed it and weren't supposed to and it got all weird. (Can you tell I've done this personally? Well, I have...oops). GYM: Very adequate! About 10 cardio machines, full weights, full range of medicine balls, mats and bench. Water cooler, included...and headphones. Very clean, and had a good workout after drinking 4 cups of coffee at breakfast. Price: $159/night (summer/midweek) for a 2-room suite. Valet: $21 (seems a bit absurd, but I didn't have a car, so eh)Overall, great for the location and price is reasonable...it's a standard hotel chain, and no real complaints. Just wish the service (checkout) and the room were a bit less chilly!Pleasantly surprised.  Friendly staff, clean rooms, nice decor, good breakfast and warm cookies to boot.  We rented out a meeting room and it was very nice.  Didn't expect the parking fee but other than that all was well.Believe it or not, this may have been my first stay at a Hampton Inn... and while it was A-OK (with the location being it's biggest perk), it didn't exceed my expectations.  The positive:*a very adequate fitness room*a complimentary full breakfast buffet each morning (available from 6am - 10am)*free internet*pleasant front desk staff*awesome location in Short North! *the price (approximately $130 a night)The *not so positive*:-the odor in the room - not bad, but not great-the thin walls-the bed not amazingly comfortable and didn't necessarily feel like the cleanest bed I've slept in-housekeeping - they never came!  Bottom line: if you're heading to Columbus and want to stay in the Short North area and you don't plan on spending a ton of time in your hotel room, this is a fabulous, affordable choice.  If you prefer a hotel with nicer amenities and really want a good night's sleep, perhaps look elsewhere.I'm usually a Marriott guy, with over 200 nights a year (consolidate those points) - but decided to stay at this Hampton due to it's great location, walking distance to lots of good bars/restaurants. Hampton's are known for their consistency, but this one stands out due to recent remodel.  Super comfortable beds, great bathrooms.  2nd level ""great room"" is a good spot for eating/working.  Great indoor pool and jacuzzi.  Super friendly staff.  I think most of the bad reviews on here were pre-remodel. As a frequent traveller, I can endorse this as a solid choice.Nice place but no self parking (even for guests) big negative (valet only at a Hampton?)  In the middle of the action.It might sound insane for a local to spend a weekend in a hotel in their home city, but I stayed in this Hampton during Ohayocon 2010 with my girlfriend and some friends and we were all very thoroughly impressed. It wasn't the convention hotel, but it was right across the street and cheaper than the Hyatt and the Drury.The fitness facilities and pool were in excellent shape and very clean. My partner, best friend and I really enjoyed the sauna. Our room was clean, well-made, and everything was in order. Complimentary breakfast? I'm not a morning person, and it was worth it. Show up early, though, if you want choice picks and a chance at getting a waffle.I don't think there's anything negative to say about the hotel staff. The doorman was so welcoming and called for someone to help us with our bags, and the folks behind the check-in counter got us in and out very quickly.The only downside was the thin walls (we weren't the only con-goers staying there). We didn't hear any adult activities going on, nor did any of us engage in such activities, so I'm just chalking it up to con-goers having a good time.Super-friendly staff, great location, and a bed comfier and more nicely furnished than my own (I miss you, puffy down comforter). The pool is weird in that instead of tile or plaster it's metal, and the hot tub is really small, but both served their purpose. A little on the pricey side, but we found a deal online and split the room and parking ($20/day, oof) four ways, so for two nights it ended up being $85 per person. Not too shabby considering it's a nicer place within walking distance to restaurants, clubs, a park, and, most importantly, our friends' apartment.Room was clean and well-appointed. Nice city view. Beds are in good shape, and no complaints about the bath. The location is terrific; across from the convention center. Many sites within walking distance in the Arena District, and Short North neighborhood. For a newer hotel. this Hampton can feel dated. The exterior is fab, but the interior decor seems a little dark and outdated. I hope the hotel plans to do some redecorating in the near-future.  Staff was helpful. Parking is difficult around this area, so plan to spend about $20 per night whether you use the hotel's valet or one of the adjacent garages. Luckily, most places are short walks, so moving the car will not be necessary much. Heading to Columbus, I would stay here againGreat hotel for a 'downtown' Hampton. I have been to many Hampton Inns so I know what to expect.LOCATION: Short North. Directly across from the convention center. Walkable neighborhood - shops, bars, dining, parks.  PARKING:Valet entrance on Spruce Street. Overnight valet parking $23/night (weekend). CHECK IN/ CHECK OUT:Bellman/Doorman was very friendly. Front Desk Associate was nice - checked us in quickly. Nice lobby, with a faux-dome ceiling, and a staircase. GUEST ROOM: Upon walk in the air was off and there was a tiny 'staleness' to the room, but once the air kicked in it was fine. The rooms are decent, spacious to share. The wallpaper was peeling in multiple parts of the room, though. The bathroom was a good size and had your standard amenities. Free WI-FI which had decent speed. ON THE HOUSE BREAKFAST: Free. 6a-10a. Breakfast hostess did a good job at keeping up with all of the traffic. Food is Hampton standard, hot items (omelettes, waffles), boxed cereal, yogurt, bagels, fruit), juice machine. I like that the breakfast lounge is on the 2nd floor and not on the same floor as the front desk.POOL &amp; HOT TUB: Decently sized. Great thing is that if you do go for a swim there is guest laundry right outside the fitness center. Who wants to pack wet clothes?SOMETHING COOL: the cool part about this hotel is that when it went up, they wanted to preserve the 'historic' feel of the old building. so they took down the old facade brick by brick, built the hotel, and then reconstructed the facade to its original form again. All in all, our weekend stay was pleasant and if I ever had to come back to Columbus I would strongly consider (and recommend) the hotel.Is it possible for me to just defer to Colleen C.'s review? Yep, I'd really like to do that please. Not only does she capture the essence of this locale perfectly, but her review is far more informative and detailed than this one will certainly be. If you care to be educated on all things Short North Hampton Inn &amp; Suites, seek out my gal down there. Want to know exactly what I thought of my weekend stay here? Well, then, read on... Here's the skinny: it was OK. That's it. Just OK. I can't gush because there is positively nothing glamorous, sexy, indulgent or luxurious about this hotel locale. Nope, not a thing. They won my stay by default as (literally) the only hotel in the bustling Short North's fabulous High Street area and maintains a reputation - at least in my book - as one of the most utilitarian hospitality locales around. Think disposable cups in plastic wrap at your bedside, super lackluster paisley decor covering every surface able to be swathed in fabric, deafeningly loud wall unit A/C and then, of course, there's the bed. Oy vey, that bed. Take a table top hard king size bed with four insufficiently small standard size pillows and throw in the world's lumpiest bedspread for good measure, and there you have it. CC already made mention of the bed comforter in her review yes, but I'm sorry, it warrants repeating. I have no idea what they did to make those duvets look as if several oompa loompas are scattered and hiding underneath them, but it's ridiculous and uncomfortable to sleep with despite the hilarity. Expect standard accommodation bathrooms with shower/tub combos and the customary practical small-ish towels that accompany them. Make do and press on to the fun and fabulousness that awaits outside in this amazing neighborhood! To be noted: Continental Breakfast is free to guests (WIN!) though ends abruptly at 10am (FAIL!). Time your evening's festivities wisely if you know you need your a.m. java fix.I stayed at the Hampton Inn for three nights during a conference last week. Overall, I was greatly satisfied with my stay and definitely would return if I was back in the area. I'm not going to get super detailed since there are some great reviews already that say what I want to say better than I would say it, but here are my quick pros and cons.Pros:- Location: right in Shorth North, directly across the street from the convention center- Staff: Courteous and helpful at all times, gave me toiletries that I had forgotten at home- Free breakfast: Good selection, have free bagged breakfasts if you're on the run- Rooms: Clean and adequately sized, nice large lcd tv'sCons:- Parking is relatively brutal at $21 a night- No microwave or fridge in room (I know, nit-picky)This Hampton Inn was a far better experience than the night I spent at The Columbus downtown earlier in the week.Loved this place  -- even while it is undergoing renovation. The staff was friendly and eager to make my stay a pleasure. Maybe it's becuase I spend most of my time in the Northeast, but it was nice to get some Midwest charm. Don't delay, go ahead and book!I live in Columbus so staying in a hotel around town is a treat.  A stay-cation, if you will.We went out downtown and decided last minute to stay here without any reservations.  The rate they quoted us was $105.  I've traveled extensively over my lifetime and stayed in countless 3 to 5 star hotels over the years, and despite the generic decor, I was impressed with the location and rate.  The lobby is inviting, clean, and open.Upon walking in the room, you felt comfortable immediately.  The room was incredibly spacious with a higher than normal ceiling (at least it felt that way), and the bed was well-equipped with lots of soft pillows, plush down comforter, crisp quality sheets, and more than enough lighting.  There was a 50 inch plasma on the sideboard and typical hotel but tasteful furniture.  The air quality and heating/AC unit was effective and I appreciated how I didn't freeze my buns off or the fact that I didn't wake up with a cotton mouth.  It wasn't a suite and since our room was on the 6th floor, the sound from below or from the street wasn't a factor.  We had a nice view of the convention center too.I'd stay here again because the location is perfect.  To roll out of bed and walk over to the North Market is a bonus.  If I had company in town who wanted to experience that part of the Short North, I'd highly recommend it.  I'm not normally a fan of the Hilton brand of hotels, but this Hampton Inn is a great one.Ditto what everyone else said in terms of the 4-star reviews. Just wanted to note for swimmers: the indoor pool is nice but it's kind of square-shaped and smallish. I managed to do circular laps because I had the place to myself.Also: touchscreen computers in the business center with printer, free of charge. However, they blocked <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTumblr.com&amp;s=1cc1bf899c952cd90d5951173abb34d332a81054297eeafbe5d9e494468c0029"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Tumblr.com</a> because it's a personal blog site. Boo. Yet they allow access to sites like Yelp, Facebook and Gmail. Hm, time for someone in Columbus to get with the times.Anyway, staff were really nice and friendly, and gosh it felt so good to have some peace of mind after a long drive.I have stayed here several times and the last time I stayed there I got bed bugs.  I called and spoke to the manager the next day and he implied I was not telling the truth- WHY would I lie about something like that?  Having worked in the hotel industry for years I take that stuff seriously and was merely trying to give him a heads up.  It does cost an arm and a leg for a hotel to rectify this problem so maybe he just didn't want to hear it.  Whatever the case, it left a bad taste in my mouth (and quite a few bites on my legs).  It was awful.  The room was fine I guess. I remember nothing other than itching like crazy.  Suites are available here as well.  They are nice but prepare to hear EVERYTHING around you as the walls are paper thin.What a great, clean hotel in a great location. I wish I could've stayed here longer but had to stay at Renaissance Downtown because of it's proximity to where I was working. So many great amenities like coin laundry, pool, hot tub and fitness center. The best part about it was it's location, which is right in the Short North- a great area full of restaurants, bars, boutiques and galleries. Service was good, too. An excelent value for the money.","Perfect location, near everything.  Staff was very helpful, kind, and friendly. Great continental breakfast, very clean facilities, pool and jacuzzi were well stocked with towels and it was clean.  Workout room also well stocked at all times with water, towels, headphones.  Valet was fast and friendly.  Reasonable prices. Not one complaint.  I would definitely stay here again.Great hotel very clean rooms, VERY comfy beds as well! Staff was fast and very friendly. Hotel was right across the street from the convention center, plus in walking distance to all the bars Gay or straight. Very busy. Only down fall was the 189 room but it was a saturday. We did talk them down to 133 though so that was a plus. All in all Very great location and very good hotel . I would recommendTook a trip to C-Bus to see Roller Derby and stayed here because many of the other hotels were booked.  I'm glad we ended up here - we had a great stay in the Presidential Suite (sure we had to pay a little more and only got placed here because nearly everything else was booked but I still seemed special).  Great room, great location (North Market is around the corner - grab breakfast, lunch or dinner; Barley's Brewery is next door; lots of fun shops in the Short North), and great

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-columbus-osu-columbus-2,SpringHill Suites Columbus OSU,3.5,$$,23,"Great stay here. Looks to have been recently renovated. The room was clean and staff were friendly. The a/c unit in my room was louder than I would have liked -- it woke me up multiple times throughout the night -- but I assume it's an older building with some older fixtures.Breakfast in the morning was good -- nothing super fancy, but a good quick breakfast before heading out to meetings for the day.Overall, I found Springhill Suites to be a pleasant stay. Clean and quiet room, no fuss no muss.Would I stay here again? No. Just little things, I guess.Hotel bar did not have any food, they were out of everything. Although a small issue, when you have travelled all day, the last thing you want to do is head out in single digits in search of food. There is nothing nearby as in walking distance, that I would eat. Maybe I am picky. The vacant inn next door was also a little off putting. I obliged to the front desk staff solution and ordered out. I never ever do this. I don't because I do not enjoy eating in my room. Nor do I enjoy delivery food. Don't order from Wings.I was chilly last night and went for the extra blanket in the closet. (Hey, where is the extra pillow? No, I'm not calling the front desk because it is late and I have my nightclothes on.) The extra blanket was rough and pilled. Not the fluffy velour blanket that you get at other places. Gross.Breakfast was ok. The eggs were reconstituted and you could tell.Business traveller here. Will look to stay at a Courtyard Marriott next time.I dug this hotel. It has a newly remodeled look to it and the service was friendly and quick. I liked the amenities too. The work out room was clean and complete with some treadmills and ellipticals along with a set of free weights and a TV to pass the time. Their lap pool is small but a nice feature to have. Mornings offer a complimentary hot breakfast.My room was off the first floor and it was mostly clean. That said there were some fruit flies in my room that were a nuisance but I'll chalk that up to a fluke. The shower could've been cleaner and the handle to the glass shower door was falling off but all in all a nice place to stay. My room had a desk behind a glass partition with a fold out couch with a couple tables that you could pull up to the bed for laptop use...so for the business traveler I think this place is worth coming back to for what it is.Big fat zero..... The staff are very hit and miss.  The day shift staff have it way more together.  Afternoon shift is another story.  If you are staying for a convention plan on using your own transportation despite the shuttle.  Going out on the schuttle is scheduled, coming back is a try at your own risk depending on volume at a location so you could be waiting, bring a book. Good luck.  We stayed her once before a year ago because it was great but now it needs some polish.  As a frequent customer of Marriott,  there needs to be some front end training taking place here in a major way very soon or the ratings will start to fall without question. Rooms were your newer springhill format.  Tub/shower not walk in shower... Thats a negative.  Plus is bathroom and toilet are separate.  Location is good close enough to convention center but far enough away to avoid the traffic.  The building gets a 3.5 stars and staff get 2. I place great importance on management, attention to detail and customer service so thats why its a 2 star in my book.I have stayed here many times over the last four years while visiting my daughter and her fiance who were both attending OSU Medical School. Great service, clean rooms and a good breakfast.Great motel. Great location (minus getting out of parking lot during busy traffic times).  Nice decor. Price was right via Priceline. Nice free breakfast. Good free wifi. Would definitely choose this motel again if in the area.Great location near campus as well as a Target and multiple restaurants. Same Springhill Suites quality. The sink didn't work in one of our bathrooms, but other than that everything was perfect. Parking was a key aspect of this hotel...lots of other hotels in the area you need to valet. You don't here.""Use your GPS"" is not an appropriate answer for a front-desk person to offer when you ask for directions to an important local destination. (In our case: the building where OSU does admissions interviews.) It's also not professional for the person to get visibly annoyed when you ask why there is no map.GPS's don't work 100% of the time - so because the desk clerk's unhelpfulness, it took us 45 minutes to find the destination, which in theory is only a 5 minute drive. Beyond that: our room was fine - very modern and clean. However, the breakfast buffet seemed to include a lot of old food - the bananas were almost entirely brown, and the oatmeal congealed and icky. (I wouldn't be surprised if it was left over from the day before.)Notice how no one is responding to these reviews - the management clearly doesn't care. Search for ""hotels Olentangy"" and you'll find plenty of other options, often cheaper.Stayed here for a couple nights, and was pretty happy with the experience. The hotel seems to be brand new and nearly everything in the lobby, hallways and my room was pretty much spotless. Free lollipops on check-in. Free wifi. Friendly service. Free breakfast (not bad... cereal, oatmeal, eggs, breads, pastries, juices, coffee, etc.). Bar in the lobby. The room had a small seating area with a desk and sofa-bed. There's a microwave and small coffeemaker. The walls are pretty thin so you can hear the neighbors but it's not that bad unless you get a room full of 10 year olds next to you (like we did). The bathroom is pretty tiny but not too bad - the shower was fine. I thought the towels and soap seemed like motel-quality and felt out of place, but it wasn't a huge deal. Considering the convenient location (near OSU) and free perks (parking, wifi, breakfast, lollipops), this is a place I would definitely use again. Recommended.Stayed in room 308:Upgraded from previous 3 star review. Located walking distance to the Grandview area which has awesome restaurants!My room was clean and very nice.  The young lady at the front desk was very sweet and Friendly.  Xaiu I think that's  how to her spell it.  I had no problem checking in or with my room.  Another plus for Marroitt.Great location in Columbus OSU area.  The customer service was on point, very clean, newer design and the experience was condusive to the avid business traveler.  I will continue to stay at this location.  If you are like me, as a business traveler, I need to be within close proximity to a Target or grocery store to stock up on water, some food, snacks and maybe OTC drugs for the occassional cold.  Both Target and a Kroger were near by.Loved the look of everything- very modern and bright!  Loved the room and the separate bathroom.  Made getting ready in the morning easy.  Only downside was the ridiculously loud flushing toilet!  We have night time bathroom goers and it woke me up.  Also, breakfast was good- but are they powdered eggs?  Weird texture.  I'd stay again for sure.This hotel was brand new and everything was perfectly clean.  We had a room with two queen beds.  Love the queens instead of doubles!  There were two bathroom areas, one with a toilet and sink, and another with a bathtub/shower and sink.  The mini fridge was actually....wait for it....cold!!  Been a long time since a mini fridge in a hotel room actually did it's job well.  The location was very close to OSU (hence the name) but was also within 5-10 minutes of downtown which was really nice.The lobby was nice and there was always water available.  There was supposed to be a bar open nightly but I never once saw it open and we came through there all through the afternoon and evening.The service leaves something to be desired.  Both mornings when I went down to breakfast there was practically nothing available.  The eggs and sausage were almost empty with just bits that look like everyone had their hands on them left over.  The oatmeal was empty and cleaned out with 45 minutes left to spare during breakfast.  The batter was removed from the waffle machine...again with 45 minutes to spare.  Our room was barely made up.  The bed would have the sheets and comforter put back to the top of the bed but not smoothed out and the decorative blanket was never put back.  The bathroom would have new towels but nothing got wiped down.  The plastic cups were never replaced.  Simply put....it was subpar at best.Finally, no receipt under our door the morning of check out so I went to the desk to get the receipt and was handed a blank one.  They said they didn't know how to print another one so I never got a detailed bill.The hotel could be great if they could get the service items figured out.WARNING! This place is not for you if you have small children. Free breakfast, parking, free internet drew me to this place.Normally, we have our small child sleep in a crib placed in the bathroom. In most hotels the doors are normally so thick that a child can sleep soundly without being bothered. This allows us to watch TV or a movie and have a light on. In this place, they have sliding glass doors that let in both light and noise. Let's just say, none of us got any sleep.The other problem was the bed. It creaked really loud getting in and out of bed. REALLY, REALLY loud. Our girl heard us get up every time.If you don't have kids with you, you'll probably love this place. Clean too.Poorly designed for young children. It was hard to pay $159 a night plus junk state taxes to get a bad night sleep every night.I stayed here while interviewing at OSU, and it was very conveniently located close to OSU and the airport. The room was quiet, clean and spacious, with a nice set-up including desk, sitting area, fridge and microwave. The furnishings were quite modern and the bed was comfy. The fitness center is sparse but sufficient if you only need it for a couple days. Breakfast is served early enough (starts at 6:30), with waffles, eggs, sausages, yogurt, fresh fruit, and other regular continental stuff. There is also a Wendy's about a block away.The only issue I had was that my room was close to the parking lot, which had very bright floodlights that came through and around the drapes. I used some eyemasks that I brought along for my flight which made it bearable, so I would recommend bringing some along if you're like me and need your room to be dark when you sleep.Stayed here at Springhill Suites for New Years with my family. The continental breakfast was below average with very stale food. My bagel was hard as rock, bananas were almost brown, and the apple was soft and old. My shower was warm, at best. The exercise room was closed even though it was advertised to be open 24 hours. I exercise every day and, in cold months, I count on the gym for exercising. I book hotels with exercise rooms when I am away to fulfill my routine. The television channels barely worked. They skipped and cut in and out or simply said, ""no signal"" after stuttering so often. I would have to say not the worst hotel stay I have ever had but most certainly not even close to the best. Below average at best.Pretty much everything you want in a hotel at an affordable price. This is a cute, modern hotel, with friendly staff, probably a lot of whom are either students or recent grads from near by OSU. We stayed here for one night on our way over to Indiana, and had one of the best nights of sleep in a long time. Crazy comfortable beds and pillows!  Plus, free hot breakfast is always awesome.Room was big, great if you or your travel partner need to get work done, with a divider set up between the desk area and the bed area. Only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the thin bathroom doors (hopefully you're comfortable with the person your traveling with!) and almost 50% of the TV stations being dedicated to ESPN stations. I know it's a college town, hell I'm on my way to a Purdue game right now, but I don't need to see last night's score on 10 different channels.Location is convenient to campus and downtown area. Lots of restaurants, shopping and movies in close proximity. Rooms are updated and nicely appointed. Staff was professional, courteous and competent. Decent breakfast included or you can go next door to the Bob Evans. Light sleepers may have difficulty with train tracks behind and a busy road in front of hotel. I would stay here again.The hotel *just* opened. Everything is brand new and super modern. I've found there are two types of SpringHill Suites -- 1) the old boring kind with stale decor from the late 80s/early 90s or 2) the new chic-styled hotels. This one falls in the latter. I had a king-sized room. The toilet is split from the bathroom so it has another sink. Flat screen TVs and a L-shaped couch making it pretty nice. There's an open desk area between the couch and bed area. The only downside was that 1) though it offers a ton of TV stations, it doesn't carry Bravo and 2) there was no tub (only shower) for a king-sized bedroom. This might not be the case for all room types, but ... The exercise room is pretty good, especially for a ""budget"" hotel. There are free weights and a coupe elliptical machines with their own entertainment systems, though they don't offer the same amount of TV stations as that in the room. There is a ""dip pool,"" but I didn't try it.The hotel offers an open seating plan for breakfast and there is a bar area. Nice sitting area/lobby, too.Its location is great for OSU, but it's also pretty convenient to downtown.","First time in Columbus, OH and found this hotel to be a lovely surprise!Easy distance to walk to campus/tailgates/football stadium! Free parking which is always nice.The room is spacious and has a separate sitting/living room space (has a couch, coffee tables) from the bed. The bathroom is also separated - one part toilet and sink, next area shower and vanity area - very nice as two people can get ready at the same time and in different areas :) Great comfy bed, clean - very clean.After the OSU game, their bar area stayed open then woke up the next morning to a free breakfast inclusive of eggs, sausage, juices, breakfast pastries, etc...For what we paid, we were very pleased with our accommodations and how friendly the staff was!Older springhill suites. Carpet in first room had red stains all, second room they were brown. Beds were tired. Time for a remodel or at least a new head of housekeeping.This is a very well decorated hotel. Very modern clean lines and beautiful warm colors. The rooms are nice, with every room to my knowledge having beautiful glass showers, separation for the bedroom area, and flat screen TVs. I also like there's a fridge and microwave makes late night snacks easy.I agree with a previous review the tv placement isn't convenient for watching in the sitting area.The bathroom split in my opinion is strange. I want everything in one place, especially when sharing a room with a friend. The indoor pool is nice but freezing, both in the warm and cold months. And I mean cold. The room is warm though which almost makes it worse.Their outside patio is also nice.",,,,"['great', 'looks', 'recently', 'renovated', 'room', 'clean', 'staff', 'friendly', 'unit', 'room', 'louder',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-columbus-north-worthington-columbus,Crowne Plaza Columbus North-Worthington,2.5,$$,34,"About 5 years ago, I used to stay at this hotel 4 nights a week for at least 6 months for work. I've been back about a dozen times since my regular stays here.They've renovated the lobby and it looks nice.They also redid the gym area from what I hear.Not that I actually ever work out.Odd thing about this hotel is that it is across the street from Bud Weiser factory and you can smell the hops brewing sometimes from the parking lot.And the area that the hotel is in has gone a little downhill. Hotel is huge and it's quick to get to other areas but the direct section is a bit sketchy.The rooms are fine but they aren't special.Some have refrigerators and microwaves.The 8th and 9th floor is club level access so the rooms are slightly larger with desk and seating area.There was rain damage in the ceiling in our room.We always stay on 9th floor and the club room is great. They have breakfast with coffee, teas, salmon, bagels, cereals etc. They have a appetizer evening spread and a big TV in the room. The customer service here is nice and they always go out of their way to assist and make you feel welcome.I was worried about this stay because of the reviews.  Generally I like to base me Yelp reviews on ""what it is"", as in I'm not going to expect Ritz service from a basic hotel.Anyhow. Rooms were clean, beds were comfy, breakfast was delicious. I ordered room service. A Salmon Egg White Frittata, only for somewhere around 10-15 bucks, now that I was impressed by. Service was friendly. I had an issue with the cafe and it was taken care of promptly. I'm not sure what people are talking about with decor being outdated. The hotel isn't a contemporary style, but the hotel doesn't seem outdated or smelly. Overall I enjoyed my stay as a mini getaway on my day off.It's hard to accurately rate our stay. The hotel was nice enough and clean but we were both shocked to be awakened in the night at 2am by the sounds coming from the neighboring room (302). This is not a joke. I was legitimately scared that someone was being attacked due to the cries from the other room and the sounds of someone being struck. In hindsight, I should have called the front desk or the police. That said, it might be a good idea to upgrade the walls to make them a little more soundproof.Stayed here 2/8/16. I was attacked by bed bugs. A day later and the bites have become painful in addition to the itching. Notified the hotel and they blew me off. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!Stayed 3 nights at Crowne Plaza North recently.  We were very pleased with our experience.  The check in process was quick and painless and friendly.  We received excellent and prompt housekeeping service as we needed additional towels and a rollaway.We did not eat at the onsite restaurant but did use the pool (which is an indoor/outdoor) and it was clean and fun.We also found the location to be centrally located to our other destinations.  We visited the zoo, OSU, and Easton Towne Center.We have become so numb and just accepted the fact that we are going to get no smiles, no thank yous, no appreciations for staying at specific chain hotels, flying specific airlines, eating at specific restaurants or even drink our coffee from specific chains.This specific hotel (not the entire chain but this very specific location) blew me away and brought back to life what customer service really SHOULD be.I was part of a large wedding group so we had probably over 30 rooms booked.  Prior to arriving here, I didn't expect much cause I've never had a good experience with Crowne Plaza ANYWHERE in North America.From the moment I checked in, to the special requests I made to the check out process to the request for a late check out (which the hotel is in NO WAY bound to accommodate without charging a fee); I mean EVERYBODY was so pleasant, had a smile, were respectful and just happy.For those of you in the service industry reading this review, there's PLENTY to learn from these guys at this location.Giving this hotel 2 stars is generous and only because the public areas are attractive and the fitness center is acceptable.  However, I'm not sure if this is a trend in hotels, but this one has become over security conscience and made access to everything cumbersome.  For example, you need your key card to use the elevator and the stairs.  Upon entering our room it had an unmistakeable mildew smell and I narrowed it down to the shower curtain.  The walls are also not that  well insulated and could hear everything from the room next door.  Then there was the breakfast (not included).  You do have the choice of ordering off the menu or the buffet which cost almost $13.00.  You could get made to order omelets but other than that it was a typical buffet breakfast bar.  The only reason we stayed there was we were attending a conference being held at the hotel.  If we choose to attend the conference in the future and it remains at this hotel, I will be more inclined to book a different hotel to stay at.My family stayed here for a wedding. I came from out of town and it was my first time staying here. The parking lot is spacious and it is not hard finding a spot close to the building. The lobby was nice. There was a restaurant and bar as well as several ballrooms and a courtyard area. This hotel also had a gym and pool which from my understanding were both free. There is also a little store where you can buy snacks. In theory you need a room key for the elevators , but one didn't work so you could use it without, and the other you had to put your card in a certain way or it wouldn't work. The room was nice and of average size. The beds were comfortable but seemed more on the full side rather than queen. The tv was nice as well. The bathroom was a nice size as was the shower. The room was also very clean. The staff at the hotel were polite during the day, but I did note that late at night some of them were making distasteful comments while at the bar with guests. Another issue I had was that quite a few drunk people were stumbling around the bar and lobby late at night. I'm guessing they don't really have a cut off at the bar. Someone did vomit outside and it stayed there all night. Ew. They were very accommodating at this hotel however. My brothers wedding ceremony and reception was beautiful and the hotel staff were flawless during this time. They were so nice and attentive. With all that being said I personally wouldn't make this hotel my first choice unless you are holding some sort of event. Events are where they really shine. I stayed here for 3 days and 3 nights.From my experience at other Crowne Plazas, I thought that this location would be able to provide a good experience. I only stayed one night and I've had better experiences at motels than this place. The hallway outside my room wreaked of cigarette smoke. My room seemed relatively clean but there were dark stains on some of the white furniture. At night, the heater was so loud that it woke me up a couple of times. At 8:05am when I was about to head out the door to check out, housekeeping is knocking on the door non-stop. I open the door and tell her I'm about to check out so, she can go ahead and clean the room but instead of coming in to clean she repeatedly apologizes and leaves. Their breakfast buffet was pretty pathetic. For $12, I expected a bit higher quality - not so much bland artificial eggs in pans. Also, I've never experienced so much chaos when trying to get my room tax free. I had to email our form twice. They weren't able to take care of the paperwork before I went to my 9am meeting so, I decided to go ahead and go and I thought that surely, they'll sort it out by the time I come back at noon. When I got back, they hadn't even filled out the forms. They had me fill out their spots on the form like the name and address of the hotel and I waited for at least an hour while two poorly trained front desk clerks ran back and forth to the accounting office to ask questions and crawl through the computer forms. How can their front desk clerks be so poorly trained? One of them could hardly type and slowly poked out the words on the keyboard with her two index fingers. It just seems like the whole place is poorly managed with no sense of order.Just no.  Don't do it.  I went on priceline and bought the ""mystery hotel"", 3.5 stars, in the area I needed.  I thought 3.5 stars had to be a good hotel.Not sure in whose world this is a 3.5 star hotel.  But if it is, its out of 10 stars.Room near highway is like sitting in the middle of the highway.  You hear everything.  Heater is so loud that it sounds like there is an engine in the room.  You can't hear the tv over the noise of the heater.  So, I turn of the heater and freeze, and hear everything next door because the walls are paper thin.The bathroom was nasty.  Black thick mold under the soap dish in the shower, rust marks under the faucet, slow draining tub so who knows what you are standing in.Housekeeping banging on the door at 8 a.m. I would never, ever stay here again.Stayed here overnight after booking a Name-Your-Price room on Priceline. I was really worried after reading most of the reviews here on Yelp - what kind of roach motel had I bid on? But I had to remember that most hotel reviews I read tend to be overly picky and critical, for whatever reason.I found the front desk staff to be very pleasant during check-in. When we arrived, the hotel was super-crowded with a couple of conventions, so the lobby was hectic and full of people, and the elevators were also filled with people coming back from a dip in the pool, but I didn't find those things to be particularly intrusive.The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the fan on the AC unit blocked out any noise we might have encountered from other rooms during the night (although our floor seemed relatively quiet late on a Friday night). Since there were two of us, more than one set of toiletries in the restroom would have been nice, but the hotel does offer concierge service including free extra basic toiletries upon request, so we could have requested those if we really wanted or needed them.Overall, I found this to be a more than decent hotel room for the price.Given past experiences with this same chain of hotels I figured I'd be getting the same as with other stays, boy was I wrong! First of all I was in a makeshift king room with a pullout couch blocking the sliding glass door. My ""wall ac unit"" functioned at half capacity and there were bugs on the wall in the middle of the night that scattered when I put on the lights. I can only guess they were roaches or worse bed bugs..... My thought is this room was originally a two room suite that they made into one room as it had multiple doors for adjoining rooms but they were nothing more then wooden cheap doors that had patchwork over where a door knob must have originally been. There were also large amounts of dust throughout the room. I voiced my concerns with the night staff about the quality of the room but was told there was a convention and no others available. It wasn't until I was woken up several times by my neighbors crying baby and found the bugs that I was truly truly mad. When I brought up everything to the morning desk staff and asked to speak with management, of course he was the manager, that it was taken with a grain of salt and not as seriously as i would have liked. I wasn't looking for a free night just for someone to act like they cared. It's frustrating that all I got was a well we will have someone look into that. I offered pictures of things I saw wrong and everything and he wanted nothing to do with it.I come here strictly for work conferences amd this hotel and their staff are very nice and helpful with any issues. The hotel is always clean and in a convenient location. The restaurant and bar area is somewhat small, but the food is good and the drink selection is sufficient.My son and I stayed for a function that was being held in the hotel. The hotel seem to be  more business friendly than a place to stay while on vacation or on a trip such as ours.  The rooms were clean and everything worked as it should. I was a little disappointed that the wifi only allows you to login on one device, effectively making us share one. I figure I should be able to login with two since there were two of us in the room. Also, I would have thought for the price, a continental breakfast would have been available. I find it hard to believe you don't offer that with competition being what it is. If we were faced with a situation with an event that was booked there, I might consider staying there again. If I were to just stay in the area, I'd most likely look somewhere else. You can do better in this price range a few miles away. I would have given it a four or five star if the wifi was set up for both of us and the continental breakfast were available.I was there less than 10 hours so I can't tell you a whole lot.We arrived late on a Friday and check in was fast. ~$80 for a room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotWire.com&amp;s=50976d16a465dfb2d93088bbc0344f5e378596cda3344562d751c44909704e1e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HotWire.com</a> and I feel like that was a bit much for this place. Anyway, check in was quick. I then stopped at their little snack store and paid $4.50 for a pack of pop tarts and a water.. I mean, you've got to be kidding me.Elevators require you to use your room key and they don't function the best. In fact, the elevators scared me a little bit. This hotel at first appears to be updated but on further inspection it's not really. When I got off and on to my floor, I was really intimidated by the looooonnnnnng hallway.Also, someone's left over take out sat in the hallway all night. Gross that trash was just left there.Room was nice and clean. Lots of towels in the bathroom. Bed wasn't very comfortable but for one night it was okay. That heater though. Ugh. Worst thing ever. Kicks on and it's so loud! You're sleeping and it wakes you, you fall back asleep and it kicks in e again... That was my sleep cycle.So thankful that I was out of there by 7a on Saturday.When you search for this place on a map, it looks like a great location - right off the highway, perfect!  Not so much.  It's true that the building is physically located directly next to the highway, but there is not a convenient on/off ramp nearby.  I'd say the journey to the hotel from the highway is closer to 10 minutes than 5.  Maybe not a big deal for most people - me included - but having to search for the place turned me off right away.The restaurant/bar in this Crowne Plaza is nice, as is the lobby and that whole set-up.  The room was average.  I was comfortable but not impressed.  It WAS nice having access to the ""executive lounge"" on the top floor, where they had better breakfast in the morning and snacks/drinks set up in the afternoon/early evening.  The attendants there were friendly.One big gripe - I received a cetificate for a free cup of coffee from their little store (in thanks for being a rewards club member).  When I went to redeem it the first morning, there was no regular coffee.  They use the K-cups (little single serving thingamajigs) and they only had ""fancy"" flavors.  I asked the front desk for regular, you know, coffee flavored coffee.  She checked and they didn't have any.  Ok, I'll try something else.  It was then that I realized they didn't have any cups out, either.  No cups!  I asked for these as well.  She called someone on the walkie-talkie and asked for them.  About 10 minutes later, no one had come, so she left - asking me to watch the desk - while she went to get them herself.  Ugh.  All that for a cup of french mocha latte some crap, I don't know - weird coffee.Better luck next time.After a long drive, we were happy to book an inexpensive room in a convenient location. The check-in was easy, and our room was clean and comfortable. What went wrong?We stayed here on a Friday night, and on Monday, I noticed a second charge on our account. I called Monday, and was told that only the correct charge was showing up. I said the second charge was not listed as pending, and shared the amount. I was told that management could not do anything to help, but to leave a message with accounting. I did that, and waited until Thursday, but never received a call (or saw the charge removed), so I called again, and was told the same. I left another message Thursday, then received a call on Friday that the charge was an accident and was removed. It was credited to our account today. Not a big deal, but one which was frustrating - I had to call twice, and both times was told there wasn't a problem, but to leave a message for accounting which took a week to respond. Not how you do business if you want someone to stay again. We won't be staying here again.I hope you will avoid using the property.  Ranks right up there with the worst customer service I've ever experienced!OK so granted, I bought my room on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHOTELS.COM&amp;s=9caeb64ed2fd4b9c2c643e817311b57c9cdaff788c2c0ec8d568ae863fade6a2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HOTELS.COM</a> at a pretty good rate.  Not a GREAT rate...but not bad.  It was just before Christmas last year.  (I know, a little late posting this, but I haven't forgotten.)  I was passing through Columbus midweek and decided to plan ahead (not something I normally do).  During my journey to Erie, PA I learned that the Columbus / Northeastern Ohio region was expecting a very substantial winter storm late that night and early the next morning and that the highways would likely be difficult if not impassible.  I thought it was probably best to push through and drive the extra 4 hours to get to my destination that evening.I called and explained the situation. Because of the impending storm, I would not be needing my room that night.  Dispite the extenuating circumstances my request for a transfer of nights fell on deaf ears.  There were no refunds, no transfers, no credit for future use, no nothing.  My initial action was to try to convince the front desk to reconsider.  Then to ask for a supervisor, which was fruitless as well.  I finally asked to speak to the General Manager and was put into his voicemail.  I called back the next day and was again put into his voicemail.  He never returned my call but his assistant did.  She was not in the Christmas mood evidently and was not even going to consider my request.  I can be pretty convincing sometimes but this woman was not budging.  In the spirit of good customer service, there was absolutely no reason at all that I should not have received a credit to use on a future date.  I have been in some type of customer/sales related position most of my career.  There isn't a reason in the world to be so stringent with policy.  Shame on the Crowne Plaze in Columbus OH.LOOK!  I know that those websites, (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, expedia, etc) are designed to help put heads in beds at a discount.  What I don't understand is why a credit can not be issued for future use.  They got my money, I got nothing. However, they will never get any again. I feel better now.  I hope you will avoid using the property.  Columbus has plenty of great places to choose from, it should be easy to avoid the bad ones.I was forced to stay at this hotel for two weeks for work, and currently have 3 more days left.  This hotel is so terrible I leave angry every morning.  I have a quick list of what, so far has made me so mad, so often. 1) the AC unit/heater is one of those with two knobs and 4 push buttons that were real popular in the 70's. The left knob, when turned all the way to the right makes the room noisy, and blows lukewarm wet air around the room.  If turned to the left, it is quieter, but makes a fart smell and kicks out warm wet air.  I have no doubt the universal remote cost more than that unit.2) the universal remote Cannot select inputs on the TV.   So if you didn't want to cycle through the channels at 1channel every 3.4 seconds (max speed for changing channels), you can't switch to an HDMI input.   And good luck finding something on TV.   They don't have a channel list. 3)Because I had to stay here every day and their lunch average cost is around $22 for food that is prepared poorly, I wanted to get my own from the grocery.   Well I had a choice of either putting it in the freezer and having it freeze in 45 min, or in the fridge and it freeze in an hour.    The knob to control the fridge was broken off, turning this machine into a strawberry killer.4) This is the worst.   I came to my room after work, around 4 to find the housekeeping cleaning.   They ran over one of my shoes, sucked up the lace and burnt up the vacuum, and the lace of my shoe.   The very illegal woman just smiled real big saying ""sorrysorrysorry"" and left.   My room smells like smoke and my shoes are screwed up.This hotel is a mistake in every way.  My room is uncomfortable, cleaning staff is worthless, equipment is outdated or defunct.  I have been homeless before, this hotel is unacceptable.I've stayed here twice. The wifi is $9 per day, which is just amazing to me. The AC unit is really poor quality so I'm either freezing or burning up. The bathroom is strangeBut here's what took this hotel from 3 stars to 2: My mom and I went to eat breakfast and the waiter gave us a really hard time about ordering off the menu even though breakfast was still supposed to be served for another half hour. He took our orders and literally walked by and threw a bottle of ketchup on our table. He had also seated us next to tables away from everyone else with piles of dirty dishes on them. After he threw the ketchup, we were done. We left. We went to the front desk to tell them what happened and was met with, ""No, we don't have anyone like that here"". This hotel is mediocre on a good day. And I hope you don't have a problem here because the staff isn't going to give a damn.","One of the worst hotel stays i've ever had, and one of the worst hotel chains i've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Wish I could give it negative stars.After a long 7 hour drive from St. Louis we arrived tired and ready to relax, but the staff here made sure relaxing was the last thing I did.A 16 day road-trip, at which I booked all my hotels through priceline, this being the top star level i stayed at (3.5 stars), and was the only hotel that gave me an hassle when I requested a double room.I walked into the room and it had to be at least 90 degrees, i turned on the a/c and watched it struggle for 20 minutes.  I contacted the front desk and they sent up an ""engineer"" that fumbled with the buttons for 5 minutes and then told me the a/c was ""overheated"" and i should ""wait it out"".Well f**k that, I decided to grab my kids and head to the pool for relief.  After my kids jumped in, I immediately told them to get out.  The pool was so grimy that the names people had inscribed in the muck on the side of the pool tiles were still legible, ew.So it's time for dinner and I call a local delivery place.  40 minutes later, while on a very important business call, my wife picks up the room phone.  It's the front desk telling me I have to hike down from the 6th floor to the lobby to get my food.  WTF did i order DELIVERY for?  Yes, on the surface it seems lazy, but it's incredibly inconvenient when you're on a business call to have to tell your client you'll call them back so your family's food doesn't go cold.Mr. Delivery Driver forgot our drinks (but that's another review), anyways, i head to the end of the hallway to the vending machine to get a drink and it's broken.  So is the one on the 5th floor.  So I head all the way down to the lobby, again, to get a drink from the sundry.  I wait 7-10 minutes for someone to ring me up before leaving disappointed.  At this point I give up, decide to go take a shower and go to bed, but before settling into my sagging ""u"" shaped mattress, I had to play a lovely game of ""stomp the ant"" in my bathtub.  I contacted the manager, along with customer care the following day, and the hardly gave a s**t.  What a completely f****d business model these people run.  I will never stay at a Crowne Plaza again.Ok hotel for the price, but it is not a pretty place.  Our room was dirty and it looked as though someone used the curtains to wipe themselves.  I agree with another reviewer who said she felt bad for the staff.  The people who stay here are a sketchy group - at best.  There was a high school tournament of some sort going on in the area.  That led to countless unsupervised teens roaming the halls, shouting, and playing loud music until early dawn.  I politely asked then to quiet down, and they replied with middle fingers and swearing.  I called the front desk, and they sent security to shut the kids up.  That worked... for about a half hour.  You get what you pay for, and we will be spending more to stay at a more reputable establishment during our next trip to Columbus.nicest crowne plaza that I have stayed at in usa in a very long timegot upgrade to top floor - this room must have been updated already (sign in lobby said under renovation)  tv and furniture all looked newfront desk, lounge and housekeeping staff all very nice and helpfulonly complaint is exec lounge is dark/drearynot luxurious  so cant give 5 , but inexpensive ($80) so highly recomendedOne of the WORST hotel experiences I've had.Our first room had a ceiling leak.  Parts of the ceiling actually fell onto the carpet and onto many of my belongings.  The water luckily only fell into my cooler.  When I called to report the problem, the front desk didn't seem alarmed or concerned.  When they finally sent an ""engineer"" up to look, they acted like it wasn't that big a deal. He finally asked if we would like a new room.  They were not apologetic nor accommodating. I was stunned to receive this kind of service at a hotel.The hotel is not nice at all - outdated decor, dirty (from lack of employees cleaning the hallways), cheap accessories in the room (i.e. the coffee maker).Sure, the decor is somewhat dated, but the place is kept clean and in good shape, so I'm not complaining.  Add to that the fact that a room can usually had for cheap (~$50) via clever Priceline bidding, and the fact that the wifi is free and the gym is surprisingly decent, and this place gets an easy 4* overall.We stayed here for our friend's wedding, the same weekend as the Ohio state high school basketball tournament, so the hotel was full of high school kids.  Our room was recently rehabbed, which was nice,  but the room still looked worn out- dirty carpets, dirt on our curtains, etc Walls are paper thin- did not enjoy being woken up late at night by a bunch of high school kids. Location is conveniently located near Polaris mall and Easton, so that is nice, but it's off Cleveland Ave. If. you know C-bus, you know to be careful near Cleveland ave. For our purposes, it was fine and the price was okay, about $95/night total. Front desk staff were nice, and workout facilities are pretty decent (but small). Overall I think it's just okay, but if you can stay in a better location, I would recommend it.This hotel is very underrated, in my opinion. It's not the nicest hotel I've stayed in but for he price, it's great!! It's updated and the rooms are very nice. It's a little bit of a drive to the freeway, not as close as it looks on a map, but not a big deal to me.Large, clean, nice hotel. Not sure what people were talking about with the dirtiness. Sweet pool and hot tub area and new gym machines in great shape. I would definitely stay here again.Did you ever stay in a hotel where you actually felt sort of bad for the people that worked there? That is the feeling I have for this place. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the staff. It's cheap and assume it would be a good place to have a hotel party if you were in college.Here are a few observations I made while staying here:This place is filthy, I feel like I need to disinfect.A bottle opener for soda bottles in the bathroom? You are about 20 years overdue for a renovation.The furniture was so worn and nasty I didn't even want to sit on it, more of less breast-fed my daughter.Smells stale and nasty.I can smell smoke.The carpet is sooo dirty.Wallpaper with boarders peeling off. Really?You couldn't pay me to touch the phone. It hasn't been wiped down in years.Outdated design leaves you wondering when they are going to get around to fixing the place up. Even the toilet paper is hidden far underneath the sink.  None of the vending machines seem to work, but there is a kiosk in the lobby where you can get some soft drinks, snacks 24/7. Cops on all the surrounding streets making you run the gauntlet to get back to your hotel. No, i didn't get a ticket. I was one of the lucky ones. Management should talk to the local PD and ask them to stop using their guests for the PD financial bailout. The staff I encountered at the hotel was all very pleasant, hardworking and helpful. But management and ownership need to do something to get the place fixed up.My husband and I decided to stay here while visiting Columbus for CommFest.  We got a great price on PriceLine.  There were three other couples that booked with us.  The nightmare began right when we got to the hotel.  My brother-in-law went  to check in and was informed that he did not have a room waiting for him.  He was told that his reservation was for two days prior and that they recorded it as a no show!  After that eventually got worked out, we all got situated into our rooms and then headed to the indoor/outdoor pool.  This was a redeeming quality of the hotel.  Another of the couples with us had no air conditioning and of course the window didn't open.  This same couple also found that the bath tub did not drain and had to call maintenance.  The next morning at approx. 12am, another one of the couples with us received a knock on the door from a member of the security staff of the hotel.  He was extremely rude and demanded to know who our friend was and why was he in that room because ""he wasn't supposed to be there!""  He demanded to know our friends name and loudly called the front desk on his walkie-talkie finding that, of course, our friend was registered to that room. The manager (not the security person) apologized and offered a complimentary night on their next visit. Next was our turn!  It was raining while we were there and one evening when we returned to our room, we found that there was a large leak in the ceiling/roof and our carpet was WET!  I informed the person at the front desk and the person there just told me that a few other guests complained of the same issue and that it was because of the rain.  But he assured me that someone would be out in a few days to fix it.  Not only did the leak in our room need to be fixed but the wall paper needs to be patched, the bath tub drain in our room also needs to be fixed (very slow!!!) To be fair, there were a couple redeeming qualities (in addition to the pool).  The bed was comfy (bring your own pillows...); the fridge in our room was great; Polaris Mall and Easton Mall are within 5 minutes; the bartender was friendly.  Overall, I would not stay in this hotel again if it were at all avoidable.This place is pretty nice.  The rooms are good and so are the beds.  Very clean.  Book your room on priceline and save money.I recently held an event here and was pleasantly surprised. While the decor feels a bit outdated, the staff is exceptional. Every single staff member from the managers to the cleaning staff stopped to say hello and check on us. Consistently impressive service for three days is rare and will have me considering this hotel as a venue for future events.Wow a Crowne Plaza that is not nice! We checked in for just one night, and the place looked very nice. The place is very clean in the lobby and the front door.  After parking and going to the room (that we asked to make sure it had a fridge for medicine) we were VERY disappointed. The room was very old and worn looking, there was a burn the size of my foot in the carpet made from a hot iron, and no fridge. We called down to get one, and about an hour later they got us one, we had to keep out medicine on ice till then.  While we were at this hotel there was a group there (All Nations Baptist group) in the hotel for the night also.  This group consisted of about 200 of the most rude and obnoxious people I have ever met.  When we came back from dinner, there was a homeless man asleep by one of the side doors on a picnic table. We informed the manager that he was there and didn't feel comfortable with him there, we were informed ""Its OK, we decided to just let him sleep there. We didn't want to call the police on him.""  We also went to the front desk to get some menus for ordering pizza, when we were told ""Well I think everyone stops delivering at midnight, no there is no reason for me to give you any of the menus. sorry.""  What?! You think they stop, so we cant try?  Wow, I didn't know I was 5 and had to have my mommy tell me what to do and not do.  I would never recommend this hotel even to someone I hated. Its not safe, or even nice.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-dublin-4,Embassy Suites,3.0,$$,29,"This is a splendid hotel with great proximity to food options. Especially good if you're doing business travel, as I just so happened to be! The service is flawless. They gladly changed my room to a location where I could use an ethernet cable to access the net during my trip. This because my computer doesn't VPN so well on WiFi. With the amount of Japanese business in the area, and the fact that many of them use this hotel for conferences, there is a Japanese and English bilingual concierge and front desk. Made for a great chance to chat casually in Japanese before having to go around and impress big-wigs.The room itself was immaculate and huge. Of course being on a business trip I stayed in a suite. The bedroom was completely separated from the living room and bathroom portions. I could easily have lived in this room quite comfortably. They had two LCD TVs available in case I actually managed the time to watch them, and practically a full kitchen with fridge, microwave and deep stainless sink. All-in-all a superb hotel for any traveler, but especially for business travelers!Let's preface this review by saying we stay here while visiting family because it's really close and convenient to them and it's the only hotel that has smoking rooms and in the winter that's a great thing for my husband! The hotel itself is old, beaten and warn.We arrived, unpacked, loaded the refrigerator with drinks, left to visit family only to come back to our room about 2 am to find the heat in our room didn't work but the air conditioning did. It was something like 30 degrees outside and a cool 60 inside. Called the front desk and she offered us blankets or another room, of course there is no maintenance available in a hotel opened 24 hours a day, that could actually be a normal thing and nothing is ""normal"" in 2016. We accepted a new room and found one of the lamps next to the bed didn't work and the only lamp with outlets, the kind with outlets on it to charge phones, laptops etc was in the living area. You can't get to the other outlets in the room because they're all behind beds and dressers. It's forbidden to dry my hair anywhere in the room except the ""kitchen"" while my husband takes a shower because there is no accessible outlet anywhere else!Hilton needs to update this hotel to make its rooms guest friendly and and more appealing. Rooms are outdated and tired looking. The pool tables in the lobby are nice and a great gathering spot when friends or family stop in but once again the furniture could use an update, saggy and old!Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful!This hotel is awful! The service is terrible!! The property is dingy, the rooms are old, the furniture is dated, the restaurant is lousy and apparently the staff does not talk to one another!! Don't expect your room to get cleaned properly, nor your DRY CLEANING to get done! If you stay at this dump be sure to ask various employees the same question, because they all have different answers! One star. Poor.This place seriously is the most poorly managed hotel I have ever been to. They ruined my wedding weekend and I honestly would never stay at a Hilton Property ever again. Disrespectful staff and management. Poor policies and dirty rooms. Seriously do not stay here and find somewhere else to stay.I was offended by their disrespectful management and staff.Shame on you Embassy Suites and Hilton Hotel group.Using my points to stay here a week for vacation I know this area which is great, safe, etc., that was all good,front desk staff was nice, room was clean although I did find a Q-Tip and Kleenex shoved in the bed/wall area... And the room phones DO NOT WORK.. I had to use my cell to call room service. The air flow in the rooms is ok... I have it at 65 and it's still warm in the room. I appreciate the parade/traffic notice however when I got back around 6pm I could not find a place to park...called hotel and was told there was a Nigerian wedding and more guests arrived than expected so, I was directed to the overflow lot ... Umm I 'am the guest, why not make the ""wedding visitors"" park in the overflow lot and walk??Bad move on hotels part poor poor customer service! Three stars for reasons mentioned.My review can only be for the meeting spaces they have for rent. I was involved in a conference that was held in Saloon 2 and it's was a lovely venue. They had coffee and soda available to is on our way in and water pitchers in the center of the tables. They also had notepads, pens and mints. It was a clean and nice presentation. The hotel had a beautiful lobby and the staff was very friendly.Very nice hotel and great rooms however I was bummed to have to pay for wifi!! Why would you pay for wifi after dropping that much on a room?? They have ports for Ethernet wires but the front desk has like 6"" cables and they didn't work...Breakfast was great and was the managers reception!Book it, book it now! Very clean rooms. Absolutely loved the complimentary breakfast buffet with made-to-order omelets. The staff was very friendly and helpful-we went downstairs to get a coke and even tho the machine was broken, the girl gave us two so we wouldn't have to wait. The pool and hot tub were perfect for our 3 year old and it was nice that the pool closed to children at 10. Another awesome amenity was FREE drinks from 5:30-7:30, which even included non-alcoholic drinks for our little one and snacks. I was very impressed with this hotel and will definitely come back if I am around Dublin again!I get cranky when wi-fi isn't included.  I'm not sure if that makes me cheap or just reasonable, but either way, it impacts my experience.  I was at this property for a state-wide conference.  The accommodations were as you would expect in an Embassy, things seemed up to date, I had no issues with my room.  And, I was able to snag a pretty great room rate ($99/night).  The staff were all very pleasant.  Parking was plentiful and free.  A hearty breakfast bar (made-to-order omelettes) and evening drinks were offered with our room.  We opted for the breakfast bar instead of the breakfast with our event that was all sugar and carbs.  I've stayed here more than once, and what I don't love is the interior corridor opening to the space below-it allows sound to travel, and I could imagine if you weren't with our group on the first night, you were annoyed by the volume coming from our happy hour.  But with the suite set-up, maybe you'd be just far enough away.  Otherwise, the event space was equally fine.  There is free wi-fi in the common spaces and, we had it in the conference spaces, just not in the rooms.  That just annoys me, sure I can expense it, but come on.  I'm only going to spend about two hours in my room when I can/would use wi-fi, just include it.We were there on a busy weekend which I think was probably the norm.  Multiple sports teams, a family reunion and a gamer convention.  It was extremely loud with doors slamming all night.  It's probably much nicer during the week.  Breakfast was very good.  The happy hour was ok.  All in all we wished we would have stayed somewhere else.Very nice hotel.  The rooms are clean and very large.  Love that they have a separate living room area with a refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker.  The views are nice and loved being on the 8th floor.  Very quiet, could not hear any street noise, doors slamming, loud talk in the hallway as in so many hotels.  The breakfast has so many hot options with a cook making omelets.  Food is fresh and good.  So much seating options.  Nice reception in the evening with free drinks.  Hotel close to highway and attractions.  Really nice staff, easy checkout, lots of parking.  Highly recommend for the overall comfort, price &amp; great amenities!In my first room, the toilet wasn't attached to the floor.  So, housekeeping somehow didn't notice, the housekeeping mgr who signed off on the room didn't notice (the nuts &amp; caps were laid out next to the toilet) and maintenance didn't sign off on the room.  Different managers thanked me for ""bringing it to our attention"".  Why would you thank me for something that is ridiculously obvious &amp; at least 3 different people are paid to notice.  They also apologize.  I had to move rooms.  Annoying.  But, they were very nice &amp; they sent up a drink &amp; an appetizer.  Unfortunately, things kept getting worse.  Lost my package for 4 days, asked multiple times, I paid extra for 2 day shipping, finally when I said X signed at this time they magically found it.  The wifi is useless &amp; constantly dropping-maddening!! when you're trying to do work!! The speed, when connected, is pathetic.  The extra fee ""premium"" is slower than most business hotel's free speed.  I didn't even bother to mention the chewing gum plainly on the bedroom door.  I just started cleaning it myself.  I could say the people are very nice but, that this a bare minimum expectation-not something to grade up for.  I  just want to get this trip over &amp; get out of here.We stayed here and went to a wedding here this past weekend and it was pretty great! The room was nice and clean, and they even brought us some toothpaste since we forgot ours.The breakfast was amaaaaazing.  Free and delicious - doesn't get any better than that!! Overall it was great, we would definitely stay there again if we ever found ourselves in Dublin, ohOur stay was over the July 4th holiday. So lots of people in the hotel. The first night I did not sleep at all because of being too hot and not way to cool the room down as you cant get the temp control to move. My husband was hot as well as he was uncovered the entire night. The second day started off with need to be out of the hotel by 10 am or being stuck at the hotel until noon because of the parade. On the norm that would be ok but when you have not had any sleep. Breakfast was great. When we came back to the hotel July 4th evening went down for the free snacks and drinks only to find a huge amount of people for a wedding reception had taken over the entire hotel, children of all ages playing on the elevators, cramming the halls, screaming, laughing, pushing shoving, you could not get thru, could not get to the snacks or the tables, ,my family reunion had gotten a conference room and the guests for the wedding kept opening the door to our room and trying to get in, again the screaming, elevator joy riding and blocking the halls. No sleep this night either due to the hose of the wedding guests In the halls. I have asked for a refund of this night. But I also want to say my room was dirty chips on the floor from past guests. Took housekeeping until 3 to make up the room. I wanted to take a nap but had to wait for them to clean the room. I will never stay in this hotel again. My entire family was upset but we tried to make the best of it.Convenient location to the Columbus Zoo.   Kroger nearby for grocery shopping.   Rooms are what you expect from an embassy suites.   Breakfast and evening reception are nice like you would expect from embassy suites.  For some reason they still feel the need to change you $10 a day for wifi, that you get for free from hotels that cost 75% less.   Would stay here again if in town.I wish I could give this hotel a better rating because it was a very clean hotel, nicely appointed, and the customer service was very up-to-par. The problem is that every suite in the hotel opens up to the same courtyard (inside, the center of the hotel) where the pool, games, and bar are located AND this hotel caters to large groups. The noise is awful! During our two night stay, the first night, over half the hotel was taken up with a gymnastics meet in town and the second night of our stay, the same problem except with a basketball tourney. Think teenagers. Think loud, excited, copious amounts of teenagers. And, since they had easily reserved over 20 suites, you can imagine who the hotel was more concerned about; certainly not my party who had reserved only one suite. Bottom line: Traveling with a larger party? This is the hotel for you. Reserving for a girls weekend full of Moms who want to relax? Think elsewhere.Oh yes, one more side note: this hotel charges for WiFi! Who does that anymore? $10 per night PER device.I booked a room here for a ""staycation"" with 2 kids.  I'll admit, I booked here because I found a REALLY good deal ($70/night).  I've stayed a many Embassy Suites previously and knew about the manager's reception, breakfast, etc. So I thought it was a great deal for entertaining 2 kids for the weekend (including the pool!).  All went well on Friday night, breakfast was nice on Saturday, with the exception of the crispy/hard pancakes and the use of butter with the omelets (every other Embassy Suites I've been to, uses water when cooking the omelets).  Swimming was fabulous - the pool seemed very clean (an odd shape, but it's a pool), the hot tub was nice and hot, and we were the only people using the pool.After an outing on Saturday we came back to our toilet flooding... I turned the toilet water off and called the front desk.  They had someone come up quickly to fix the toilet and then housekeeping to clean the bathroom.  This was unexpected and pretty gross.  The manager's reception was nice; the hotel also had kid games you could use (i.e., chutes and ladders, checkers, etc.) and 2 pool tables in the lobby.  Again, we went back up to our room to our toilet flooding!  Another phone call to the front desk ensued and the ""fixing"" of the toilet happened.  We made sure from there on out that we rarely used that toilet!In addition to the toilet, the remote for the living area TV didn't work.  They replaced it, but when I asked for someone to fix the ""movie"" function, no one did.  Every time we turned the TV on, it was an ad for adult entertainment movies... not the best thing for children.  Therefore, I couldn't ""order"" a movie for the kids to watch in the evening, which was a little frustrating.Another positive for the hotel... they had a sheet of paper when you checked in that included local events for the weekend, specials for the hotel (i.e., large pizza for $9.99 via room service), hours of the pool, reception, breakfast, etc.  This was helpful throughout the weekend to know what was available.The kids woke up early to go to the pool on the last day and the hot tub was cold (2 hours after the pool was opened).Breakfast was good... we stayed away from the pancakes since we experienced them as hard/crispy the previous morning.All-in-all, I would go to a different Embassy Suites because of my past experiences, but I wouldn't go to this one again.  The rooms were loud, but not at night; the breakfast is a great addition, although it was different from the other hotels; the pool is a great addition, even though the hot tub was cold one of the mornings; and the manager's reception was nice.  The employees were courteous and helpful, but the biggest reason we will not be returning is the toilet issue and the issues with the TV.Lastly, wi-fi was not free... you had to pay extra for this if you wanted it!We visited the Embassy on 4/1/12 - 4/3/12 and had a great time.  The suite was roomy and clean. Managers reception went well and the morning breakfast was really good.  The pool was clean as well as the fitness facility - lot of  towels for the patronsI am taking away 1 Star due to the following reason - kids (probably within the ages of 2 - 9) ran amuck both at night and during the breakfast with no parental supervision.  Therefore, messes were made and pool sticks were swinging upon the guests. (yes, I have children and no I won't allow them to act that way). Would I go back?  Most definitely.  Just hoping that the parents/guardians or staff puts a stop to the ones that run wild.I'm pretty sure all Embassy Suites hotels were designed to prevent guests from sleeping. The open, echo-filled courtyard fails to block noise from downstairs while simultaneously encouraging guests to hang out in front of their rooms, making noise while hanging over the railing. Also, charging $15 a day for wi-fi after I just spent $140 a night for the room is ridiculous.I do appreciate the manager's open bar every night from 5:30-7 p.m., and the free breakfast is helpful when you can't sleep in.Finally give you a code for free Wi-Fi which helped with business.  Super clean room, luxury feel.  Fantastic breakfast and Managers reception.  Great food and service for event.  Friendly staff.","My husband and I had our wedding reception in October at the Embassy Suites in Dublin. Given that it is a gorgeous venue and the staff was nothing but friendly and helpful to us in the entire time we were planning our reception.  The food was great and we, along with our guests had a good time as well. The only snag was that they were too anxious to put out the 'cookie table' items WAY before the cake was even cut.  Not good. Not when we spent several hundreds of dollars for a cake. As for the beds at this location, I didnt sleep that night given that the pillows seemed to be VERY thin and not comfortable at all. The bathroom was gorgeous and everything else was too. But I was a little upset that I didnt get a good night's rest. We took advantage of the breakfast the next morning, but was a little disappointed in the huge crowd and little place to sit to eat. We didnt get a chance to have an omelet given that the line was too long.  Overall it was a great experience and a beautiful venue!The suites are always nice. A main bedroom and a separate study with two tvs. You also have a mini fridge and microwave. Free breakfast and happy hour daily. Pretty good deal Eh!!  Clink!!After our fifth stay on a New Years Eve &amp; for all of the noise others on this site have complained about, I slept like a baby. So did my daughter &amp; the guests in the front.room of the suite. The cocktail hour was fun. It was nice to meet friends from previous years and everyone was in the sharing holiday spirit. From babies in carriers to more mature.... grandparents(?) . There is something for everyone. On this night, the hotel was full &amp; there were two wedding receptions going on. That made it more special &amp; more fun. The breakfast buffet with made to order omelets was superb! We will go back, again &amp; again!Hotel was nicely appointed.  Rooms were comfortable.  Food was not bad at all.  The menu is very limited with only a handful of items.I was booked here for a job interview between Christmas &amp; New Years during horrible weather.  I'm a Southern California boy so it was quite a change to be in 12 degrees and snow!The hotel staff was outstanding!  Polite, professional, caring and accommodating.  The room was also wonderful.  Had a corner suite and it was outstanding!Morning breakfast was wonderful as well as the evening hospitality.Would definitely recommend this hotel.We were at Embassy Suites for pre and post wedding shin digs. I have always liked Embassy suites, they are ranked on my top hotels because of service, cleanliness, and budget. This embassy suites was very busy this particular wedding....so I understand no early check-ins etc. But the staff was not friendly about it. We had a shuttle set up to the venue and called to see if we could leave a few minutes early. Instead of apologizing for the inconvenience we got a very shot, brisk ""shuttle times can't be changed, ok? bye."" I get it, they can't be changed that's completely acceptable but maybe be a little nicer about it? Also, my #1 pet peeve when it comes to customer service...when I walk in and say hi to you and you just look at me behind the desk and not say anything back, that really gets my goat. It's not hard to say hi. The shuttle bus driver was great! He sang for us so kudos on that :) On the room: Everything was clean and in order, housekeeping was plentiful if we needed anything. I love the room size it left enough for our hairdresser and make up artist as well as the videographer to all work comfortably at the same time. I will continue to stay with Embassy Suites but this one needs some front desk customer service training.So far so good. Staying here for a work conference. Checked thoroughly for bedbugs and it seems clear (knock on wood). Weird layout. Pretty good food, but as usual for hotels, outrageous prices. Found period blood under toilet seat though - gross. Free wi-fi, which means I will be playing scrabble on my iPhone instead of paying attention, muwahaha.Very nice. Clean and modern. Good bar and good food. Starbucks in hotel!!This Hotel is somewhat older. I was in town on business and this hotel catered to all our companies employees. There is a bar inside the hotel, but beware the close fairly early.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inn-columbus-2,Red Roof Inn,3.5,$$,23,"Ended up staying here while traveling from New Jersey to St. Louis. Exhausted and desperate for a place to spend the night, this was one of the cheapest hotels in town so we booked a room and arrived about a half hour later.  It was around midnight when we arrived, and despite how late it was and how little time had past since we booked our room, everything was ready for us and the staff was friendly as could be.  Check in was quick, and the room was clean and even better than I expected for the price.  Breakfast was minimal, but all we really needed was coffee to fuel us for the rest of the drive so we were more than satisfied.  This hotel went so above our expectations that we ended up booking a room here on the way back as well, and were greeted with the same quick and friendly service.  Oh, and one more thing!  This Red Roof Inn has the fastest elevator in the world.As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the lovely and helpful staff. It was snowing and super cold out so they showed us where we could make hot chocolate while our friend set up the room. The elevators were fast and we got into our room quickly. The view was spectacular and the bathroom was very nice. The beds were a little small and kind of firm, but we managed. Another con was that the parking was $10 and across the street with no cross walks to get you safely across the roads. A pro was the room service. It was super inexpensive and came to our room within 45 minutes. I enjoyed that we had a free breakfast but it wasn't very big. They had no scrambled eggs, bacon, or a waffle maker, which kind of sucked but you take what you can get! Overall not a bad stay considering the price! Would stay there again!You get what you pay for right? Knowing we were going to be in Columbus for one night only and going out with friends all day and night we decided to (for one time in our life, not splurge on the hotel room) humpf. Not sure if this was the right choice. I have to admit, I am a little spoiled. I like my fancy hotels, with modern lines and great amenities, but I can rough it once in a while if the place is at least clean right? Upon arriving we checked into our room and I could not help but notice there were dirty items all around our room. There were what I can only assume were chicken skewers? sticking out of our trash can with bits of meat left on them (EW). And the whole room just seemed like it needed a good vacuum. Another completely mind blowing occurrence - there was no comforter on our bed! There were only sheets and a gross bedspread used for decoration. I do not want to roll up in that. It was so late we just put on some sweatshirts and covered up with the sheets but it was not a comfortable nights sleep to say the least. The positives - The service was friendly. It was dirt cheap. There was a complimentary breakfast (really just coffee, juice &amp; pastries - we didn't end up eating) and most of all they allow pets. One of the only hotels that allow pets in Cbus and we were thankful for that. Overall would I stay here again? No. But it is a good value for some one just looking to lay there head down for the night.I never stayed at a Red Roof inn before and so I was forced to stay here for work. I had called the hotel prior to my arrival and was told to make sure I park in front of the hotel first - check in and then I would be given a card for parking across the street. I am so glad they did - big help!  Also I was impressed the parking is only $10 per day.  I went to check in and they asked for driver license and took down my number which I have NEVER had done in the past 15 years of staying at hotel ever.  I have to also say that I HATE the keys for the room see attached - they are not like a credit card at all - annoying as hell.  I went up to the room - super fast elevator and the room was very nice and very affordable - $79 for King room and they have free wifi.  The only other negative thing for me after a a shower that the towels had stained on them and grossed me out.  I called the front desk and new towels were brought right away.Have to add - the breakfast wasn't that great at allNot really impressed. Granted, we often stay in nicer hotels, but opted to save some money since we've been doing a lot of traveling lately. So here's the run down...Pros:-The hotel was clean. Our room was clean. It had a more modern appearance than I expected, which was nice. -The location was super convenient. Cons:-Customer service. Prior to getting there I called regarding parking. The woman was very short and stated ""You have to check in before you can park.""  Then she hung up. Rude. -Our room was essentially in the lobby. I'm not kidding. And next to an ATM. It was very loud the entire time we were there. -The room and walls shook whenever we shut the door. That isn't all that comforting. -The ""breakfast"" consisted of muffins, moldy bagels (yes, moldy), and seriously weak coffee. It wasn't the worst experience, but we definitely won't go back.Well what you're paying for here is the location not the quality of stay.  The hotel rooms are an afterthought to the entire operation.  I will say that the staff was amazing.   Overall definitely overpriced.Our experience. Upon arriving we were told parking is a block away. We arrived after eleven at night. Parking is very limited so we had to park in the convention center parking. Not a big deal except the ticket machine wasn't working right and it took three trips to the front desk to get parking straightened out. Our first night we were in a suite. It was okay. Very large. The overhead lights didn't work and it smelled odd. At the front desk, they just said sorry. The lobby smells horrible. The next night we were in a king room. I liked it better than the suite. Appeared cleaner. If you're looking for a very basic room this is an okay hotel. Personally it didn't suit us.Overall it has been a good experience, the room has the usual amenities (fridge, microwave, TV, lousy coffee, lousy continental breakfast).  On the upside there are a ton of power outlets, on the downside the TV, while having HBO and a decent cable selection, is a wide screen tv showing a widescreen signal but it still shows it letter-boxed. It is also not HD, and this room at least has no guide.The wifi is about as expected, generally decent (as far as hotels and public wifi goes), but it craps out on occasion if you're streaming Netflix or related.There is no restaurant or bar attached, though there is a room service menu, curious where that food comes from.Beware of the surprise safe fee of 1.61 per day. They will remove it if you ask-but only at the end of the stay. otherwise a perfect stay. Great rooms. Handy to downtown. Free use of nearby health club. Parking just ten dollars per day. Walk to convention center or the uber trendy Short North neighborhood. Great microbrewery around the corner. Dive bar pizza joint and bar acreoss the street. cute restaurant next door. Rates are a bargain compared with nearby hotels. Don't miss the North Market. steps to the Capitol. A steal.  Not your typical Red Roof Inn although this is a Red Roof  Plus.Very hard for me to find a hotel in which I walk away saying to myself, whenever I'm in this city, I want to stay here.  Red Roof Inn is one of those hotels.  I stayed here a few months back for a conference being held in the convention center (which is right across the street; you can't get any closer) and again this past weekend to take one of my best friends out in the city two weeks before his wedding.  Both times, I was impressed with the customer service, cleanliness, and accommodations of this hotel.  First off, the staff couldn't be friendlier, made me feel right at home!!  They were constantly asking how my stay was, if I was enjoying the city, or giving me recommendations as of where to go out (bars, restaurants, shopping, etc.).  If you are a people person and enjoy that attention, you will like your stay here.  Next, the rooms and facilities were quite tidy!!!  It's definitely a good thing walking into a fresh and well laid out hotel room. Also, if you forgot any necessities, toothbrush/paste, shaving cream, razor, floss, etc. they have all of that available.  The parking is a ten dollar fee, but I have found that is common for hotels in the area.  Also, for those of you who are big on breakfast, their complimentary breakfast (from 6:30-10am I think) is pretty good!! Both times I've been they've had fresh fruit (apples, bananas, pineapple, mango, grapes), yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, oatmeal, and more.  Also, if you like to hit the gym, guest get free entry into the gym down the street which is pretty nice with a good mixture of free weights, machines, and cardio.  Long story short here, I'll be back next time I'm in town.The walls are as thin as the pillows. We could hear the people next door as clearly as if they were in the same room. Heard when they zip/unzip their luggage. Heard every text notification they got. Heard conversations they thought were private, but now we know their dirty secrets. Bed was hard and uncomfortable. Mini fridge didn't work. Parking was across the street and an extra $10 a day.Great stay! Convenient location and very friendly staff. Our room smelled like smoke. They promptly, without hesitation, changed our room. They let us do a late check out and gave us details/logistics for the area.I'd recommend this hotel. Looks like they've had a renovation. Stay here! Not the Sheraton at Capital Square.My two cents...Great roomsGood service Parking 10 overnight or at metered which is free on weekends.  Friendly and downtown really downtownClean air conditioned noisy near downtown park across the street 10 dollars per nightNot great really but not terrible. Had to park across the street and walk back across a four lane busy street to get to hotel. TV was funky, each channel change takes like 5 seconds which makes it hard to lay in undies and flip channels for hours, which is number one on my list of hotel qualities of faults. The 1970s Infra Red chicken basting machine type lights above the entrance made me think of Hell more than of the red roof inn, just weird. If you're staying to visit places in the Short North, it's a bit of a hike.I travel often.  I got a room here last minute, well, because it was the least expensive place next to the convention center.  I have to say; not only were we greeted by the most courteous front desk, JJ, the front desk host called our room to make sure we had everything we needed, as well. Not too many amenities, but A+ serviceFriendly, clean, right across from convention center. Parking lot was full when I got there very late. They allowed me to stay parked in there 10 min parking outside the door for 16 hrs ( even after I checked out!)This hotel is much cheaper than the surrounding options, and only slightly less posh, if at all. I have friends that stay here for the Hell City Tattoo Festival. Of course, I live in Columbus, so I've only visited them in their room, never stayed myself. You'd have to ask them about the beds.But the staff was friendly and courteous, the common areas were clean, etc. Those things I can attest to, and I know that rooms are only $90ish in season. A good alternative to the Hyatt if you're attending an event at the convention center.NO! NO! NO! I will not be heading back here! The place looked like it had been recently ""updated"", but everything in the rooms seemed dirty and dusty. Some people found bugs in their rooms (ceiling lights). There was no lotion provided. The free breakfast included packaged muffins/danishes. There are PLENTY of other hotels to stay at in the area.They did have free Wi-Fi...Nice hotel, with good rates for the area. We paid 46$ and were content with the value for the money spent.","The people are friendly, and informative and the place is clean and inexpensive!  The room was spacious, there was parking directly across the street (for $10/night) is was within walking distance of Goddard Park and all the yummy places in Short North.  There was a mini fridge, hair dryer, free wifi and an above average continental breakfast.  My dog was given an enthusiastic welcome by the front desk manager and there was NO pet fee!  Next time I come to Columbus this is definitely where I am staying!place is nice and clean, spacious rooms and friendly service.  the only bad is that parking is across the streetclean, spacious, surprisingly well-appointed rooms for the price.  unfortunately, somewhat thin walls and floor plates contribute to a noisy experience.  but the low room rates more than make up for the noise.",,,,"['ended', 'staying', 'traveling', 'new', 'jersey', 'exhausted', 'desperate', 'place', 'spend', 'night', 'cheapest', 'hotels', 'town', 'booked', 'room', 'arrived', 'half', 'hour', 'later',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-columbus-columbus-2,Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Columbus,2.5,$$,21,"My family and I booked a room on Expedia at 6pm on a Friday night and drove 3.5 hours that night to get to Columbus. First of all we had an AMAZING rate. The room we had was quite larger than ""higher rated"" hotels: big bathroom, large vanity, queen bed, sofa couch for the little CrossFitter, big fridge, big kitchen. It also helped we were right beside the office. Secondly, and more important to us, the staff was great. Immediately we felt welcome. The office staff was awesome, superbly friendly, and the full breakfast was delicious. The kitchen staff made sure the food was hot and plentiful. My family was in town for the CrossFit Cert class at Rogue so we are used to eating a lot! The staff accommodated excellently. When we return to Columbus. We WILL stay here again. Some reviews say the rooms were ""outdated."" I call it a feel of home away from home. Well done, Hawthorn, well done. #Merica!Where do I begin? This was literally the RUDEST and least professional I have EVER been treated. I reserved this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for 3 nights. Upon arriving at the hotel, I informed them that my friend from Cincinnati was driving up later and I would like to add his name to the room so that he would have no trouble getting a key when.  I also asked that I have extra towels sent up and fresh towels daily.  (I shower at least 3 times a day.  Sorry, I'm just weird like that.)  I was informed that it was against hotel policy to have more than two sets of towels in the room at a time, and if I wanted fresh ones that I would need to bring them to the front desk and swap them out. WHAT!!!! Okay. I'm not going to let that ruin my trip. I go to my room and begin unpacking.My friend arrives and he is told by the front desk that his name is not on the room. I'm a bit upset, but I throw on some clothes and walk over to the front. To my shock, it is the EXACT SAME YOUNG LADY THAT CHECKED ME IN that was still behind the desk. I said to her, (Her name is Sabrina by the way.) ""You don't recall me adding his name to my room earlier?""  ""I was busy and forgot. I am the only one working right now."" (Which by the way, ""I am the only one working right now."" and ""I am only one woman."" were sentiments that she repeated to several hotel patrons throughout my stay.) Again, a little upset, but this will not ruin my trip. We got my friend a key and went on about our business.The following day, I woke up and went and spent some time with family. I returned late afternoon and to my dismay, my room had not been touched. The bed wasn't made, the towels weren't refreshed. I called the front desk and voiced my displeasure, and I was told that ""you must have had the Do Not Disturb sign on your door."" No apology. No acceptation of blame. Just immediately put the blame on me. I did NOT have any Do Not Disturb sign on my door by the way. I asked if fresh towels could be brought to me, and she informed me that Housekeeping had left for the day and I would need to come bring my dirty towels down and get new ones. How ridiculous is this!  I don't want to carry dirty towels around. But what else am I to do. Sabrina has informed me that she is only one woman and could not bring them to me. Imagine my surprise when I got to the front desk and there were in fact TWO women working. So I exchanged my towels, and returned to my room to freshen up.On my last day of my stay, I return to my room from a family brunch, and my keycard will not work. I was with a friend of mine whom was giving me a ride and dropping off a couple of birthday presents to me. I went to the front desk and told them of my issue. Sabrina immediately questioned my friend, ""Are you going to the room. I need your ID."" My friend obliged, despite the fact that she was merely visiting for a few minutes and not staying in the room. Sabrina saw her ID and told me that one of us would need to pay a $200 deposit or else face immediate eviction. At this point, I have had enough. I asked what the reason was and I was told that if anyone local sets foot in the room, it is a mandatory $200 deposit. If she sets one foot in the room without the deposit paid, it will be an immediate eviction and $250 cancellation fee charged to my card. I then explained all of my frustrations in my two days of being there and Sabrina immediately said that was not her fault. ""You chose to book through a third party, that has nothing to do with us. I can't affect them giving you the wrong information."" At this point her supervisor, Tammy chimed in and confirmed everything Sabrina was saying. My friend said that she wouldn't go to the room and would wait outside. Sabrina told her, VERY RUDELY, ""You need to sit right here where we can see you so that we know you didn't go into the room and wait for him to come back."" At this point... I was BEYOND regretting my decision to stay here. The amount of disrespect was APPALLING. After this, they told her that she was now trespassing and either needed to leave or the police would be called. (As Sabrina reached for her phone to call the police.) Tammy began explaining the $200 rule, yet again, and I told her that we understood the rule. Sabrina interrupted me to say, ""She is just doing her job and telling you the rules."" So I retorted, ""So can you please do your job and give me my key?"" This infuriated Sabrina and she looked at me with this evil death stare, turned back to Tammy and asked, ""Does he have to stay?  Because if I have to continue dealing with this attitude..."" and pointed to something on the monitor. Tammy came from behind her counter and walked over to Sabrina's monitor to look and said, ""Check him out.""  I have no idea what was on the monitor, nor do I have any idea why I was kicked out of my room. Sabrina then proceeded to check me out of my already paid for room, refused to give me a key AND refused to give me a receipt. The absolute WORST experience.Stayed NYE 2015 . 1)Hotel is very dated .. 2)Couch is old with stains as well as the chairs . 3)Toilet had black water and a ring around the inside . (Disgusting ) 4)Chipped paint off toilet seat. 5)Wood is chipping from bathroom sink . 6)rail to climb the stairs the screw is hanging all the way our so the rail is very loose and not safe for use (the rail outside to climb the stairs was the same ) 7) there was slick ice on multiple stairs to walk up to the room. 8) legit took 25 minutes to check in and there was only two people ahead of me . Very dated and some parts very gross .. Good thing is the noise control is great didn't hear anyone through the night next door . The hotel staff takes a copy of your drivers license and credit card for check in ( they take this from each adult staying in the room ) My friend reserved a room for her brother and her and her brothers credit cards were both booked for the entire amount of the room. She is currently disputing the charges now.I I only stayed here to be closer to a friend . The next time I will make the 20 minute drive to stay at the residence inn. Will not stay at this hotel again .Horrible. Came in 6.22.15 can't do it. I asked for a full refund and I am leaving early. Dirty rooms, not handicap accessible no whirlpool pool out, no elevator to reach food area, no bottle drinking water since 6.22.15. Time to go.I took a break from writing this review to see if time would change my mind, however the experience here has ruined the company in my mind forever!With that being said, IF you value customer service DO NOT stay here. We booked two rooms for my nephews graduation one studio and one penthouse, over a month in advance. Flying in from Nevada with a group of people, one being an infant, and one being a child with autism; we needed the extra space. The penthouse is great as it is two floors with separate spaces and two bathrooms, perfect for people to not be on top of each other. One week before arrival we called to make sure that we had the penthouse and to cancel the studio as a few in our party were not going to be able to make the trip. We arrive and given our room, we enter and immediately know this is not our room, we leave the room upon arrival! No bags even left the car, and we go drive back to the reservation desk.My sister tells the reception agent that this was not our room and the guy immediately got defensive and said that they well fully booked and she would have to deal with it. Proceeds to argue with her and tell her she must have screwed up the reservation. Took no responsibility for the issue and told her that no supervisor was available. She wanted a manager as we had a long travel day and just wanted to speak to a manager but was told no one could help her for the evening. For a reservation person to be so aggressive and verbally attacking a customer, not to mention we had stayed there multiple times, was despicable! There was a large hold deposit on the rooms, we couldn't get that credited back till after the holiday weekend. It was midnight and we had to now drive to multiple places to find vacancy for a large suite or two adjoining rooms. What a nightmare!The effort it took to get the card refunded was outrageous. How hard was it for 1) for anyone to apologize for the miscommunication regardless if they felt that they made a mistake and 2) to not blame the customer and yell at themThis location needs some serious customer service training.BEWARE!! This place is horrible, the rooms were filthy and I itched the whole time, our feet were black from the carpet. The curtains were torn. The people that are permanent residents were scary, I was scared to leave. The staff was rude. I should have listened to the negative reviews. Told us we would have to pay $20.00 for extra towels, this place is by far the worse place I have ever stayed. Residents sit outside on shared balcony with doors opened and music playing. I felt very unsafe.The rooms were well maintained and looked very nice. Everything seemed a little old and out of date so I didn't like that part and it is situated in a somewhat ghetto (or what felt ghetto) part of town. There is a Waffle House right around the corner which was convenient. The staff was nice but nothing special. I didn't wake up early enough for the breakfast so I cannot comment on that.My actual review would be less than 1 star. Stayed here recently. Outside looks much nicer than the inside. Inside is very old, and run down. I considered biting the bullet and paying for a different hotel. The bed linens were disgusting. The shower had a hole in the ceiling covered by a piece of clear plastic secured with safety pins. The sofa bed mattress was also completely disgusting. There were occasional faintly audible smoke detectors going off at around midnight and there was a lot of outside noise as well. Do not stay here!!Do not stay here. We got stuck staying here for exactly 15 hours while driving back to Chicago from DC in late June. Our original plan to stay in downtown Columbus wasn't possible due to a huge convention in town that had every hotel room there booked, so we figured we'd look elsewhere outside of town, to get a better jump on the 6 hour drive home.Found this place on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, looked at the reviews which were just 'meh' but figured it couldn't be that bad to just stop for the night. Well, it was. We got one of the rooms free (book 10 nights, get one free) so that's the only reason why I didn't demand a refund. One of our rooms smelled of cigarette smoke and the furninture was very old, very ratty. I too would be leery of the clientele here - lots of people loitering, and we were told not to leave any valuables in the car. However, many people there seemed to be staying due to its proximity to Ohio State (15 mins south), so the jury's kind of out on that, I suppose.The wifi worked well, and the breakfast was good as well. There are many restaurant options nearby (Cheesecake Factory was 10 minutes or so) so that's a plus, too, I suppose. But if you're in doubt to the kind of place this is, I will let my pictures speak for themselves... we left the 'calling card' and 'welcome' beers untouched for the next guest....I am currently writing this review from my hotel room. Mom booked the room while she and my dad are moving stuff from our old house to a new one, and I gotta say, this is damn nice. I am really, really enjoying this place and I think I'll be staying here when I am in town to visit if there isn't any room at my folks' place.The room I'm in is a suite with an upstairs loft, a fold-out bed, master bedroom, two bathrooms, and a full kitchen and sitting room. It feels more like an apartment than a hotel. And with as nice as this place is, you'd think it would be around $200 a night. Nope. $80 per night for this suite (Mom booked through one of those discount sites). Their cheapest rooms are $40 a night. In addition to all the awesome perks inside the room itself, there's free wi-fi, a market inside the office (they sell chips, bottled water, cans of soda, ramen, etc.), on-site laundry ($1.25 per load for the washer and dryer), an outdoor swimming pool (currently closed because it's winter time), a tennis court, and a basketball court. Talk about nice!Another thing that makes me happy: they're pet-friendly. My dog and two cats are here with me right now. It's an additional $125 onto your bill when you check out, but it's worth it since the majority of hotels, even the really dingy ones, don't allow guests to bring their pets. They have a designated puppy-potty station so your pup can do his/her business, and they even provide poop bags! There's a trashcan at the potty station so you can immediately dispose of your pup's poo rather than carry it around with you.The area the hotel is in isn't the best. I lived not too far from here (Eden of Easton on Chesford Rd.) and my best friend lived in the Reflections on the Lake apartments on the other side of 161 until this summer. Another friend lived in the Continent apartments with her husband, and those apartments are literally right behind this hotel (they're not too bad, though). The Giant Eagle just around Zumstein Drive has been robbed several times. Obviously, it's not the best location. Still, it's really nice. I don't think its sister hotel, the Baymont, would be here if this area was truly horrible (like, say, Northland and Easton). The area around my old apartment at Eden of Easton was significantly worse than this.As for what's in the area, there's plenty. The Pizza House, Grandpa's, Pizza Hut (ew), Bob Evans, Tim Horton's, McDonald's, Wendy's, and Waffle House are really close by. There's Giant Eagle. On Boardwalk Ave., there's a convenience store/smoke shop, an internet cafe, tanning salons, a GetGo, and a Speedway little ways west on 161. Capri Lanes is also pretty close if you fancy a trip to a bowling alley. Oh, and Auto Zone if you need something for your car.The internet tends to cut out if you're idle for too long, but as long as you're zooming around the web or playing World of Warcraft, it's strong, reliable, and works really well.If - IF - you're a pet parent, bring a pet bed, a crate, some Stink Finder or Nature's Miracle, pet food, and dishes. Bottled water as well. I picked that habit up while my mom and I showed our Birmans. Pets get used to the taste of tap water from home, and tap water tastes different no matter where you go. This difference in taste might cause your pet to avoid drinking and become severely dehydrated. That being the case, get your pet used to bottled water before you travel and then only give them bottled water until you return home. Stink Finder and Nature's Miracle are must-haves anyway, but it's still a good idea to have some with you when you travel. It makes the housekeeping staff's job easier and might reduce the possibility of having to pay for damages to the room if there's an accident.As previously stated, I would happily stay here again. This place is really, really nice, and you get your money's worth.stayed there for 2 days while at the Equine Affair.. not a bad place to stay.. easy off easy on to rt 71.. i would stay there again.. free breakfast... fireplace didn't work but it was a hot weekend so we really didn't need it..First and foremost, I will always look for a Hawthorn Suites whenever I travel. Absolutely more bang for your buck! The loft style suite - full kitchen two bedrooms and bathrooms for $109, the best rate ever! Fireplace, wifi, two tvs, pool, grill area, $109 -heck yeah!Here's the problem, this particular little gem is going down hill fast.  Unfortunately this hotel is surrounded by very low budget hotels with poor curb appeal. Unfortunately the whole area is or has changed. The hotel is very difficult to find, even with a navigation system.Here is what was bad: No fully equipped kitchen, not a pot or pan, no glasses, barely any utensils. Completely picked over! Check in was problematic, the credit card machine wasn't scanning properly and a guest made three room transfers during my check in. Not a good sign. Cleanliness, the rooms and bathrooms were good, the kitchen-not. Oven/stove greasy. After the mushroom cloud from the oven was released I just knew the smoke alarm would go off! Lets see, what else - the locks on the entry door were inoperable, maintenance came and replaced the entire system. Oh pets are allowed, I'm sure the policy is at most two dogs. Well the pack below howled and whined continuously. Wifi connection not good at all.So for the good: staff bent over backwards to correct every issue there was. I'm not sure if the problems are due to understaffing, mismanagement or financial reasons. Even with the issues you still get more for your money, spacious floor plan with a loft and separate entry, all for $109+tax, come on now!Overall this hotel chain is excellent in my book (Wyndham), I will continue to use them, unfortunately this location is having some difficulty.So when out of town guest come, this is still the hotel of choice, maybe a different location.My family stayed here at Hawthorn in the pent house suite.  Awesome. We had a King suite and a living room and full kitchen along with a loft suite upstairs queen bed.  Although it is not a four star motel it was quite clean and management great. We had some plumbing issues but were taken care of immediately.  We stayed for 5 nights and were able to spend the holidays with my son in a comfy atmosphere!! After searching on internet we received an awesome rate which made the stay even better!!!   I will definately stay here again!!!On December 4th, I arrived at the Columbus North location to begin a four-day stay that I had purchased in advance from a 3rd party website. I was presented with a room that not only appeared to have not been cleaned in several days, but also showed signs of a serious ""bed bug"" infestation as well. When I attempted to pull back the bed spread on the upper left-hand side of the bed, I noticed a small brown-coloured insect on the pillow itself. After completing a quick search online, I was able to identify this insect as a traditional adult ""bed bug."" I'm confident that you are well aware of the serious health complications that can accompany a person's interaction with such an insect. Secondly, I also noticed numerous used Kleenex tissues that had been discarded in back of the nightstand and subsequently left for the next guest to discover. Although both of these issues are quite substantial in and of themselves, I would argue that the third item that was discovered could in fact be considered in direct violation of state and federal law: a half-bent tablespoon that was sitting idle on top of the living room couch. The spoon was quickly placed in the trash can, as well as an urgent call to the hotel front desk. The young lady at the front desk was extremely apologetic and horrified when informed of these issues. She agreed to immediately move me to a second room that was located closer to the front of the hotel complex. She also suggested that I speak with her manager, Bethany, the next morning to address some of my concerns. The second room initially appeared to be satisfactory with the exception of white-coloured stains on the living room couch itself. Admittedly, I did not fully inspect the second room until the next morning as it was considerably late in the evening at that point. Several issues were addressed with Bethany the following afternoon: the bug infestation, discovery of used Kleenex tissues, large white-coloured stains on the couch, as well as the serious discovery of drug paraphernalia. Bethany was visibly troubled by these issues, however she was clearly not interested in addressing our health and safety concerns. She offered to send someone up to the room to clean the white-coloured stain off the surface of the cushion itself, however she was unwilling to accommodate us any further than a 15-minute session with a portable carpet cleaner. Although I did not agree with her assessment of the situation, I was willing to give her the opportunity to address the known issue within the second room. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed to discover numerous cleaning and plumbing issues within the kitchen later that evening (December 5th). I also discovered that the dark-coloured carpet had amassed a significant amount of dirt/dust that was only clearly visibly from the bottom of a naked foot. Subsequently, I became unwilling to stay at this location beyond the few minutes it took me to remove my belongings from the hotel room. Although the young lady at the front desk was concerned about the additional discoveries, she was unable to reimburse me for my entire stay. I have already been in contact with American Express to dispute these charges based on the fact that the service provided was not only inadequate, but also hazardous to the guest's health. I am deeply offended by both the presentation of these two rooms, as well as the lack of legitimate concern or response from hotel management. The entire ordeal forced me to make alternative last-minute reservations at an alternative hotel based on the nightly rates that were offered at that time.This place is THE BOMB.The queen suite is nice, larger than your average hotel room, with a sitting area and kitchenette.  If you're a Wyndham Rewards member and are looking for a place in the area to spend your points on, GO HERE.  You can get a king suite for 5,000 points (the lowest tier), and it's INSANE--a two-level suite with two bedrooms and two full baths as well as the sitting area and the kitchenette.  We lived in a house that was smaller than that once!Maybe even better than the room, though, is the breakfast--not your standard Continental breakfast foolishness, it's a real, hot breakfast, with scrambled eggs, sausage, fried potatoes, make-your-own waffles, yogurt, fruit, and things to toast.  The rooms are a little more than, say, the Days Inn, but the free breakfast makes up the difference.  We love this place and try to stay here whenever we're in Columbus.Dissappointing. Does not look like the pictures. Very old buildings. Granted you can't beat the price and its the best bang for your buck. Can't beat $50 for a room with a kitchenette. So I would stay here again but only because of the price. Don't stay here if you're looking for an uppity getaway.Take it from a retired criminal attorney and police academy instructor, you DP not want to stay at this property or the others near it. The I-71/Rt 161 area is not safe. The drug dealers use these properties for dealing and parties. They rip out the smoke detectors so that they can smoke and party. Blood stains on mattress, mold covered shower, broken door locks, and only one scared clerk on duty for the entire complex. If you had a good stay there, you were either partying with the druggies or oblivious to your surroundings. Cops say it is a hotbed of activity. I'm serious when I tell you that you are putting yourself in danger staying in this area near the I-71.Hotel reviews on other travel websites were very misleading.  Rooms need updating/proper service and cleaning.  Location's pretty rundown and guests seem to loiter quite a bit. Breakfast was pretty good though. Service was also hit or miss.  One female guest rep (daytime) was great while another male gentlemen (afternoon) seemed to care less.  Item was left room and called to follow up and retrieve but they didn't seem to care.  Asked how he would handle and the situation and response was, ""don't leave anything behind.""  Fair enough.  Or avoid staying altogether.YUCK!!!  Our room smells musty and is dirty. The sofa bed is stained and sags. It's so bad that we have decided to go home tonight after the event we're attending so we don't have to sleep here.  Worse place ever! The only bright spot was the lady who checked us in. She was very nice. She deserves the one star.Very nice and front desk staff. Although we were not able to get breakfast on our first day because they ran out of food, the second day we got our breakfast.","Apparently this used to be  a Residence Inn. Needing a hotel on short notice, I tried Hotwired and got this room for 50 bucks plus taxes. The room itself was OK, clean enough and it seemed safe, but there were a few issues: - There was a sticky spot on the rug. - The sink was leaking and left a wet spot on the rug under it. - The toilet also dripped as it was filling up leaving a wet spot on the floor. - The hot water ran out in the middle of a shower. - The internet connection was spotty at best. The bed was soft and comfortable, and the room sizable with a big kitchen . So all in all not bad for 50 bucks, but If I'd paid the normal rate, I'd be more irritated.PS - if you do stay there, it's a little tricky to find. It's way behind the Giant Eagle in the road paralleling 71. The Google map on Yelp is not showing the correct position.",,,,"['family', 'booked', 'room', 'night', 'drove', 'hours', 'night', 'first', 'amazing', 'rate', 'room', 'quite', 'larger', 'higher',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-columbus-downtown-columbus,Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,3.0,$$,45,"Great location; friendly staff; clean, modern facility; and great price for the room (I got a queen room for $129).You're within walking distance of tons of restaurants and several of the big corporations, too, so it's an ideal place to stay on business travel to Columbus.  There's a bar and a little coffee shop inside, and a Max &amp; Erma's right across the way.  I would definitely stay here again.My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday night in February. First impressions were all good: The lobby and hotel bar areas are nice and spacious. A young man checked us in and gave us valet parking for $15 for signing up for IHG rewards, which was nice. The hotel bartender was very friendly and we enjoyed a drink before heading out with some friends. Now the bad: First, the hotel is in desperate need of remodeling. The hallways smelled and the carpeting, wallpaper, and lighting are old and outdated. Rooms are average but also could use a facelift. The ceiling light in our room flickered. The walls are paper thin and we could hear loud conversation clearly in the room next to us all night. I was woken up at 4am and had to call the front desk to send security. Valet attendant didn't offer to help with luggage and instead of saying have a nice day, we got  a ""keys are in the car"" before he left. My husband had a tip ready in his hand that he didn't even get a chance to give. For the price you pay, this hotel is definitely not worth the expense.  We would not recommend this hotel to our friends or family.My friends and I stayed at this hotel during the ohayocon convention. We experienced difficulty's from the start. In the description of the room we were promised a couch and a microwave which were not present. Almost immediately the toilet clogged and we had to call someone. (We had to call them several more times throughout our stay because it kept clogging) also the mini fridge stopped working in our room as well. I will give it stars because the beds were nice and big. Also with the price of the hotel I was expecting to get a free breakfast but apparently you have to pay for that too. I will say that the employees were very kind and apologetic. But I think next year we will stay somewhere else.Not sure why everyone is complaining about 23/night safe valet parking...Maybe it's Ohio or something because any city I visit with my car, especially downtown, I know there is going to be a 20-something$ for overnight valet parking. Get over it, you're not entitled to have free parking, it's a city. Try DC where the parking for one night is double that then complain. End rant Hotel staff is prompt and friendly. I stayed here for business will most likely be back since my company chooses my hotels for me. There is food at the bar area which was actually amazing! Got a flatbread pizza and it was one of the best I've had. Our waitress was very friendly and fast even though she was serving what seemed like the whole bar! You go girl! The room was clean, big, and nice. I was, unfortunately, right by the elevators and even so it was still pretty quiet. The only complaint I have is that ALL my pillows were firm, no soft pillows. I like to see 2 soft 2 hard pillows in rooms...like tacos ya know. HahaI've stayed at this location about one a month for the last year so I can give you this review on its consistency. The front desk staff is some of the most professional and friendly folks you will run into at a hotel. The bar staff has actually remembered me month to month. Maybe that's a hint and half to become friends with Bill W. or perhaps it's just a hotel used to business travelers who enjoy a nightcap after a long day of meetings followed by business dinners.  Sure the Hilton on the opposite corner is newly redecorated but the staff makes this place. They are all very friendly and kind - everyone you run into - parking valets, reception, housekeeping....after all this time the girl at the coffee kiosk remembers my order. That's amazing. How many people must she see every month that she remembers mine for a few days very month?  It's the staff that makes this place.  Sure, the beds are comfortable. The rooms are quiet. No matter who is in town or how many conferences, your room is nice and quiet. Pay a little extra for the executive level and get a free breakfast and an economical happy hour. As I said,move been here about once a month for 9-10 months and consistently the service all around is very good. I think that makes for a pretty safe bet when choosing a place in downtown Columbus. It's a hop, skip and a jump to the Short North or the Nationwide Arena as well a some really nice restaurants.One star for location and one star for the clean, comfortable room. Everything else was massively disappointing. The pool is a joke. Cold, all one depth (deep!), dirty, and hidden in a musty basement that's only accessible by one elevator which you can't specifically call! You have to keep pressing the elevator button in the lobby and hope the right one comes. That is if the elevators are even working. When we were there they broke and were left to go down 10 flights of stairs if we wanted to leave. Such a disappointing place to stay, especially for the high price.This place is the definition of mediocrity.I stayed here for a conference at the convention center. Location is the best thing this hotel has going for it. It's close to the convention center but also to the Short North, so you're not stuck in the urban wasteland that is other parts of Columbus's downtown.The hotel itself is nothing special. The rooms feel old a tired. The hallways feel dark. The carpeting is in desperate need of a refresh. This isn't hotel I'd pick if I were traveling for pleasure, but for business, it got the job done.We had our wedding reception at this venue in July of 2015. The early planning stages went well and were actually quite fun. Unfortunately, our wedding coordinator left the company just two weeks prior to our wedding. This definitely freaked me and my wife out. The new sales person did the best she could. She was very professional and down to earth; however, if we knew this would happen, we obviously would have went somewhere else. The new sales person did not seem to have much experience with weddings and being creative with decorations, signage, etc. I would at least wait until they hire a dedicated wedding and large event coordinator before going to this place. We had other issues as well: The hotel rooms were completely booked several months before the event, and we weren't told by the staff. This meant that a portion of our reserved block went to guests that were there for a different event. The main reason we chose the place was for its value and convenience, being that our guests could stay there. This was a huge let down. By the time we figured the hotel was booked, nearly all other hotels downtown were also booked. There was a 31 gifts convention going on that weekend, which is why everything was booked. Our 2nd issue was the traffic of all the non-wedding guests on our event floor, likely from the other event in town. We were told the floor would be dedicated to us and our guests. We even had items stolen from our toiletry baskets in the restrooms. Given it was a fairly intimate wedding, I doubt it was one of our guests who stole the items. They should have had a sign easily viewable stating ""private event"" or something of that nature at the bottom of the steps to our event. Our 3rd problem is that we were supposed to receive a gift card for signing up with the hotel. After repeated attempts, we have not received this card. Our 4th problem was the lack of communication between the staff. Many of our guests calling in for reservations were given conflicting information regarding room rates, valet parking, etc.There are lots of nice places downtown to have a wedding reception. At least at this point, don't limit your options to this venue.Solid Crowne.Great staff.Decent bar food and drinks.Love the outdoor seating area with fire pit!Beds are good. The rooms are very comfortable.Typical setup. Great office/ desk space. Fridge in room (always a bonus).I ordered room service (breakfast) and the prices were very reasonable! The food has been consistent each time I have been here.Very convenient location downtown.Great location downtown, directly across from the convention center and down the street from a great running trail.Comfortable beds, fridge, desk, working toilet and shower/bath.  What more do you need for a great night's sleep on business?We have stayed at a variety of hotels both budget priced and nicer. I'm honestly not sure why we paid the extra $$ for this place.  We booked because of the pool and game room for the kiddos.  This was a spring break mini- vaca for them.  No game room and probably one of the weirdest isolated pools I've seen down in a basement.  The room itself is fine, but not any nicer than a budget room elsewhere.  Also, no breakfast(which we knew) and paying for parking every night leaves me wishing we would have stayed somewhere else.  Certainly not worth the money spent.Stayed here over the weekend for the 'Last Chance for Boston Marathon'.  Overall, I thought the hotel was very clean, the staff was welcoming and enthusiastic, and the hotel was a great host to all of us runners.  Overall, I am struggling to find anything negative about my stay beside the fact that the hotel wanted to tack on an extra charge of 5 dollars a night for an in-room microwave and 10 dollars a night for an in-room refrigerator.  Maybe I'm just a small town man and not use to the way things are run in the big city, but I can't remember the last time I paid 100 dollars a night for a hotel room and was told that such luxuries as a microwave and refrigerator would cost me an extra 15 dollars when I would probably use a whole 10 cents in electricity with these appliances in a 24 hour span.  In the end, I didn't need the refrigerator and forked over the 5 dollars for the microwave but I'm not complaining because I ran a 2:53:32 marathon, qualifying for the Boston marathon while I had a very nice and comfortable sleep and a hotel in a convenient location.  I will see you next year for the next marathon!!!Highlights: Room service is prompt and reasonable, shuttle service, clean.Lowlights: Extremely noisy, lots of children running around for a tournament, making noise my first two nights.  My second two nights included large groups of intoxicated people yelling in the hallway, jumping in the elevator until it broke. There was also the hotel bar directly below my room, where there was also lots of commotion.  You can hear everything through the closed windows.  I had to call the operator for security twice and when I checked out, I notified the management about the noise level when I checked out and I was told that was ""normal"" for Friday and Saturday nights.  I would not recommend this hotel for business travel.I have stayed here many times for business. It is just ok, nothing special. It's clean and they have room service and a lobby bar as well as a shuttle to take you around town.There is also quite a lot with in walking distance, so the location is good.If you are looking for this location but want something with a litle more style, stay at the lofts - they are connected to this hotel, but are more boutique style and you can walk across to the Crowne to use the amenities there as well as the shuttle etc.There are some bars and cafe's that you can walk to, depending on the weather.Not entirely sure how this place is a 4 star hotel. I think that system is completely defunct. Ended up here because of ""name your price"" on priceline, and we picked 4+ hotels. The base price itself wasn't bad, but then remember that you have to pay around $20 for parking unless you want to risk parking your car on the street. Since we were only stopping here for the night and didn't want to leave our car with everything inside on the street we chose to go for valet. The lobby is nice, but once that you go up in the hotel you see what I mean about BS 4 star rating. The halls are not well kept, looking pretty beat up. The room itself was nice, but when I looked behind the bed for plugs it was just a mess of dust and dirt. I think the positive was the concierge service. They were really nice and brought up toothbrushes and toothpaste for us at like 3 am in the morning when we realized we had forgotten them. It's also connected to some local chain restaurant and they will bring you anything from the restaurant up to your room.Accomodations are decent but it's an old hotel charging new hotel prices. This was way too expensive for what I got.No central air. Tacky carpeting. Lack of available power outlets. The furniture is decent but it was kind of like lipstick on a pig.  It's about a 10-minute walk to Short North. Unless you're hanging out exclusively in the downtown area, the location isn't close to Short North.Customer service: They aren't going to go out of their way to greet you or ask if you need luggage assistance but they took care of two problems I had.The Crown of Holiday Inn. The top shelf ! Well I do not think so. Nice lobby and lounge, but the place was not very clean. We stepped out of the elevator on our floor and you would think they would vacuum the floor. It was down right dirty. We walked to our room with the Bell Hop. The room smelled musty, it smelled like they have not had any clients in it for a long time. That old smell you get in homes, that is the smell. Other than the dirt and smell the Crown Plaza was OK. Great location and they do pour a strong drink in the bar. But they can not make Mojito's ! Be prepared to valet park and tip here. The service was great with valet parking and Bell Hops.Great place to stay when you want to be within walking distance in the Arena District.  Lots of room to move about, great on site gym (albeit on the small side), beds were comfortable.What I didn't like was the connectivity to the Internet, valet/garage parking, or the confusing hallways.But I still enjoyed the stay while here.  The surrounding area is great if you wanted to be within walking distance of some great eating establishments and some awesome local owned shops for shopping.  Columbus is a huge city, and this location of the hotel was very close to the downtown area and government buildings.These places are such hit and miss spots... This one I have neither a plus or minus to make me lean either way, which is neither a good or bad thing.It was a business trip, so it was one, two, three, check in, change for dinner and out.I hated that they had a queen double for me, after reserving a king... oh well, my suitcase gets its own bed.I did NOT like that there was not a coffee spot in the morning.  Had to wait for the bistro to open and order a cup of coffee.  For food/breakfast/dinner - you had to cross over the valet area and eat at Max and Ermas.So when a hotel doesnt supply food, aint that grand.  We are travelers and part of our living arrangements for the day/week etc should have easy access to food...I came back one day from a full meeting day and the lobby, bar, restaurant, was loaded with people- so loud and noisy, there was a convention going on at the center across the street and you know what that's like... the amazing thing was it smelled of bacon, but there was no way I was going to eat there so I crossed the street and had tilapia with a side of broccolli for $12 at Max and Erma's...Other than that, it was ok.  I travel for work, so all I want is a good bed, with decent air conditioning (no, not freezing or broiling) clean bedding and a loud alarm clock.  So it met it needs.I am not understanding the negative reviews of this place.  Our stay couldn't have been nicer, nor the staff friendlier .  Room clean.  Attention paid to detail.  Our bed was turned down for us when we returned from our evenings out.  There were fancy expensive chocolates on the bed, the robes were on the bed waiting for us, and soft classical music playing in the room, and a soft light turned on for us.  VERY nice touches.  Four pillows per double bed, which was another nice feature.  Modern bathrooms but with the typical shower/tub.  Very nice freebie lotions and shampoos. The staff was amazing.  My sister had made the reservations for three rooms but the staff was most accommodating when it came to payment since we all wanted to pay for our own rooms.  Jeremy the valet attendant was helpful, attentive, quick, and knowledgeable.  If you don't know where to dine, just ask him.  There is a shuttle too.  We chose valet parking at $23/day. We are used to this though, and I know it sounds steep but we didn't want any hassle with our car getting broken into, or walking a good distance with luggage in hand.  Valet Parking is worth it in my opinion. Ryan the Operations Supervisor did me a great favor.  My sisters and I were in a quandary, my elderly mother needed some flat shoes to wear to a wedding reception - her feet were swelling and her own heels were getting uncomfortable.  We shopped across the street for something but could only find flip flops.   I asked Ryan with a strange request that if there is a pair of women's shoes, size 8 in the lost and found that have been there forever and it is obvious that no one is coming back for them, can we have them?  He went down and found something we could use.  We offered to return them but he told us we could have them.  Thankfully they weren't dirty and disgusting.  He listened to my request and had a great attitude about the whole thing.  We were so grateful for him and he was a perfect example of how someone in the service industry should behave, as was the rest of the staff at Crown Plaza.  The free breakfast (don't forget your coupons!) at Max and Irma's was very good. Nice fresh omelettes, good fruit and good coffee.  Thank you Crown  Plaza!!!","I really want to give this place 2.5 stars.  Upon arrival, you are given a ""choice"" of $23 a night valet, or, $11 a day somewhere around the corner, down the street over there....The lobby is great and they actually keep the bar open late.  So far, the lobby is straight out of 2012.; nice.  When the rickety elevator arrives, be prepared to be hoisted (very slowly) into 1975.  When I got off of the elevator, I half expected Joe Namath and Bad, Bad, Leroy Brown to be walking around.  Carpet and walls simply DATED!  Alas, arrive in your room and you are time-traveled back to 2013.  Room is updated and clean.  Sub-par toiletries, but the room was comfortable and modern.  They want to charge $9.95 for Internet...when will hotels get over this charge, or, at least make it reasonable.So, if you wonder why 2 stars, it is because for the price, it should be a bit better.  It make be closer to a 3 if you get a discounted rate, but really, you get better amenities and a lesser charge at the Drury Suites across the streetNice hotel in downtown Columbus and close to the convention center and the Nationwide arena.  The King Corner Suite had plenty of space for four with pull out bed in the sofa.  Downside was only one TV for a suite.  Overall nice hotel for the price.Expect to pay valet $24/day or $17 if you're a priority member with in and out priviledges.  If you go public parking overnight, it's the same price so go with valet. The entrance has automatic doors, the lobby is spacious, an check-in was a breeze. There were 3 elevators but they really took too long.  We tried to take the stairs from our floor but only lead to the outside which would trigger the emergency alarm.  As to the room, we got a king suite with a sofa bed. Sitting area was roomy. And the bed was huge. The bedding was fantastic, the pillows were fluffy and the sheets were soft and luxurious.  I definitely got a good night's rest!I was able to find everything without too much effort.  What I mean is I could access the sometimes had to find light switches, lamps, outlets, and thermostat.  I called the front desk a few times and I received excellent customer service: friendly, professional, and helpful.  I didn't spend too much time using the facilities (gym, pool) but I'm sure they were nice.This place gets four stars for location and friendly service! It was conveniently located near short north and made running around town a breeze. Valet,  front desk staff and cleaning staff were exceptionally nice - probably the nicest I've ever encountered at a hotel ever. The rooms - meh - but I didn't really care about a fancy room. Just needed somewhere to lay my head and shower. Reasonably priced, great location and super friendly staff! Will use this hotel again next time I'm in town!i stayed there last month for 3 days.(I got a steal on priceline) I have Nothing bad to say.. The area was nice. Im a sucker for good service, and they SOOOOO have that. The shuttle driver/valet was the star of the show! His name was Chad. man he was great! i had to use the (free shuttle) 3 times.. I got to all 3 appointments in a timely manner, dude was chill, and he picked me back up on time! And my phone actually worked in that hotel so Big plus there.. The house keepers have this aroma therapy stuff thats Awesome!Thank you guys for a chill trip!Stayed here while interviewing at the medical center just a short distance away.  Very convenient location and nice clean rooms.  The front desk and shuttle drivers were very helpful in accommodating my schedule and helping me get around.  I'd stay here again if i came back to the area.Nice Hotel, very cleanA horrible place.  Stayed here Bout six times and almost always ran into issues.  The last one was explosive feces in the bathtub that wasn't cleaned by the staff.  Loud and rowdy, not what I expect from a hotel.  I would only recommend this place to my enemies.F__K this place. Snotty staff, reluctant service, and old carpet, smelly rooms. This sums up my experience: First thing I asked the creep of a front desk dude (after he had finished fawning all over a wealthy-looking guest) was if they had some sort of continental breakfast. His response? ""Um, we're not a Holiday Inn Express, sir"".  Well excuse the hell out of me. Instead of letting him know about the other places I've stayed that are better - cheaper ones and high dollar - I'll just stay at one of those next time.Really, I would prefer to give this place 3.5 stars - I appreciated the location and the rooms were certainly nice, with comfortable beds and appropriately layered blankets and a variety of pillows. Unfortunately, there were issues: the internet access was spotty and unreliable, often dropping out for up to twenty minutes at a time. The climate control in the room seemed to have only two settings, despite a digital thermostat on the wall - either it was the tundra or the desert, and the windows were non-openable, plus also unpleasantly small (much smaller than a classic hotel window, giving the room a gloomy cast at all hours). The pool, located in the basement, is very strange - constructed like a lap pool, at 5 feet deep all the way across (no shallow end) but far too short for actual lap swimming.The staff, however, were overall /wonderful/. Frank at the front desk addressed the internet issues as best he could, calling for tech support and refunding our internet charges. Nicole produced change, envelopes, directions and restaurant recommendations, and when we called down to ask about a nearby movie theater Katie had a printout of the movie times sent up with discount coupons attached. We were generally welcomed every time we came in and greeted warmly by the front-of-house staff, who really were working hard to make things right.I'd certainly stay again, though I would be sure to ask for a room near a router, and on a higher (and, I assume, sunnier) floor. Also, because I got this room on Hotwire, it was $72 per night including taxes, which seemed quite good for this property, and made the room feel more like a value than it would have if I had paid the advertised price, at nearly double.I stayed here last weekend for a friend's fraternity's formal. Overall, good experience. Positives: I didn't have to pay anything (woot!) but I know the guys got a great deal. Our dinner was delish. The bed was comfy. Negative: Room service came at 9 am. Really?I can't say much more because I was only there for one night but it's a good location and I'd recommend staying there if you're in the area.I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Terrible customer service. Expectation to leave your keys with the valet just to checkin.  The Valet while pushing their service did not tell us the correct price of the parking garage next door.  I was pleasantly surprised at the low cost of the garage.   I've traveled extensively for work and expect better service and cleaner rooms!Stayed here for a family wedding. My only complaint was the room desperately needed dusting. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was great and beds very comfortable. Convenient to the skywalk and many good restaurantsThis hotel is in a good location.  You can easily walk to the Arena district which has plenty of bars and restaurants in it.  The rooms were decent sized, and the hotel was clean.  The staff is friendly. Nothing to wow you with , but simple and easy.This was one of the best experiences ever!  First, the hotel is up-to-date!  Clean everything!  The rooms are very nice and there is a lot of small detail they focused on - to include making a nice box to cover the ugly air conditioners typically seen in hotel rooms.  The staff was super nice!The best was that my husband and I went there for our first ever Ohio State Football game.  We didn't know anyone and we're going to be tailgating or anything.  That is - until we were offered a deal from the hotel.  For $25 a person it was all you could eat and drink tailgating in a great corner in the stadium parking lot.  They had a very nice set up with great food and 3 TVs.  They began 2 hours before game time and were there until 1 hour after the game ended.  They were the nicest people. When we showed up we were greeted with two very nice people (one lady was the General Manager of the Crowne Plaza) and we were offered drinks, and somewhat catered to.  We got food and our drinks and sat down in those awesome comfty folding chairs.  These people were so awesome - they would come and throw away your plates and they would get you refils and they were just so very wonderful.  It was clear there were ""regulars"" that attended this tailgaiting.The only reason for not giving the 5th star was because their pool was terrible - even though its listed as a lap pool - it was dirty and gross.  Also, their cafe has weird hours and there was no good breakfast place without going to Max and Ermas.  When the cafe was open - the breakfast choices were poor at best!All in all a great time and next time we go to an Ohio State Football game we will certainly be staying there.I don't think the first review counts cause he hasn't been there yet.  So, here is a more appropriate review.1 star for the location.  It's in a nice area only 5 minute walk to the very trendy, gay friendly strip on High St.2 stars - cleanliness and manicured landscaping3 stars - customer service.Downers: No free parking.  The closest structure to the hotel offers $12 a day parking.The hotel itself offers $26 valet.Bed could have been more comfortableI think only one elevator was working at the time.Save your money and find another hotel.  Old rooms, not the cleanest.  Turned my lights on when I entered the room and closed the door behind me and the lights went off from the door closing.  Room service is awful and the customer service was non existent.  I travel a lot for work and this is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at.  I would never stay here again and wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.Cannot really complain too much about this place since my law firm client was paying BUT...  there is a Hyatt across the street which I'm sure is 100% better..  Anyway the rooms were clean although mine was strategically placed right above all the HVAC units for the lower parts of the building and across from the parking garage..  Gotta love that!!!  Carpet looks like it is right out of that 70's show..  Ashton Kutcher are you punking me???  Room was clean but let's not kid ourselves this is not a four star hotel maybe not even three...At one point there were about 15 people waiting for the elevator in the evening.. umm.. and the bar staff downstairs while accomodating one bartender started talking about filling bags with his own feces (insert a word that starts with 'S') and throwing them onto the field if the NFL brings in non union players... that's what I want to hear about for sure after a long day some bartenders s*** in a bag - wait aren't we in Columbus is there an NFL team here...Decent enough, but had some basic flaws that made it difficult to give more than the ""Meh, I've experienced better"" two star rating.It's a good location, and service was prompt and friendly.  I found it to be clean, no problems on my usual checklist of stuff.  Shower was nice.  I'd stay here again, except for one big problem which removes them from my list:1) The noise.  I had some serious suspicions when I got to my room and found a nicely wrapped package of earplugs.  Saturday night, I found out why - there is apparently a venue nearby (outdoors, no idea where) that was featuring a rap venue until around 1:30 AM.  The windows are poorly sealed, so I got full benefit of the music.  The room door had a HUGE gap underneath (probably 3/4"") and the additional noise in the hallway was like it was right in the room.   Clearly, management does not stay in their own rooms enough.(the other three problems below were minor, but warrant mentioning)2) The elevators.  I was fortunate enough not to be with the people who were trapped in the elevators a few minutes before I got to the elevator lobby one evening.  The elevators smelled bad.3) This is a minor gripe, but the chair at the desk is like a spandex sock wrapped around a metal frame.  Possibly one of the worst chairs I've ever sat in.  4) If it's the football season, and you're not into football, you might keep a close eye on the schedule.  The place was overrun with Miami fans, who were loud and drunken until late at night on both nights.  I assume pretty much any ""game night"" will see similar activity.Price was not cheap.  Two nights: $509.  For the mid-west, that's pretty steep.  Not worth it, given the noise issues.I had a good experience here, mostly because I got a killer corporate rate and $5/day valet parking.  Can't go wrong with the arena district.  Renovation and rooms are nice.  Front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating.  Only complaint are the elevators, very slow... sometimes extremely slow (1 floor every 30 seconds).","I wish I could give 3.5 stars....It was better than 3 but just not quite a 4.  After reading some of the reviews, I'd have to agree with many of the recurring issues mentioned.  I stayed here for a family wedding, and while it wasn't a bad experience, it wasn't outstanding for the price we paid.  The room was clean and the staff was mostly friendly.  The maid service was a little slow and one day was non-existent.  The shower is a little short for people over 5'8"" or so.  The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate -- even though there was a digital thermostat on the wall.  We did figure out the last day that the window opened but it was a humid June day so it didn't really help.  The elevators were slow and sometimes didn't stop right in line with the floor/door.  I truly expected to get stuck on there at some point or another.  I asked for a late checkout, and while everyone else that was part of the wedding group was given 2 pm, I was told they couldn't accommodate me past 1 pm.  The required valet parking is expensive at $23/day.  They charged me for two cars when I only had one.  However, the girl at the front desk did promptly take it off when I brought it to her attention.  The actual valet staff were very nice...so they have that going for them. It would be nice if they offered an airport shuttle. There isn't a brand-name coffee shop around, but the cafe in the lobby isn't bad.  The girl working there was talkative and helpful.  I liked the bar area and outside seating with the fire pit.  I had hoped to try the pool and fitness center but didn't get a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out the internet was free!  The bed was comfortable, and I liked having a refrigerator in the room.  I loved the location and would stay here again if I was able find a reasonable discount when booking.This review is based solely on their intelligent customer focused policy on internet access.  I haven't had a chance to stay here yet, but I will on my next trip to Columbus, based solely on the fact that they get it.  In fact they should just change their wireless SSID to something like:""Checkout of the Hyatt and Check-in here for real customer service""I stayed here for Columbus Pride. It was perfect because of the location!!! You are in the Arena district and just walking district to Short North. The hotel was clean. The room was great and the staff were very friendly.I didn't test out any of the hotel amenities because I did everything outside since it was Pride weekend. I did have trouble with the soda machine because it wasn't dispensing so I took the stairs down to another level to get drinks. I wished they had a snack vending machine. Especially at 3 am when I was roaming the halls for one. You dont get 24 hour room service so bring snacks. I like the mini fridge that was empty for your use.My only complaint and it's a big one was the doors!!!! The doors are heavy and when they close they slam hard! So in the morning all I could hear is dozens of doors being slammed shut over and over as people were checking out for noon deadline. Then the following day I heard the same thing over and over again. I peep through the peep hole to discover it was a supervisor checking each room to see it was cleared out. I was partying all night  I needed my sleep!!! They needed to install retractable arms so it would pull the door close quietly. I made sure to write that down on the comment cards. I doubt they would do it since it's a privately own Crowne Plaza. Every penny counts there. They don't even offer airport to hotel shuttles like the other Crowne Plaza locations.I didnt get to eat there but I LOVE the BIG wooden tables with high chairs you see in the lobby near the bar area as you walk in. Make sure to sit there and hang out for whatever reason. I finally got my chance as I waited for my shuttle to arrive. I want it for my house now!Great location if you are working downtown and not far from great bars and restaurants. 1 star for location 2nd star for nice rooms (excluding the AC unit)  The customer service was not very good, in a half empty hotel they initially put me in a room by the elevator, then put me into a room with a defective AC unit, everytime the wind blew against the hotel it would blow cold air into my room. Oh and yes it is bloody windy in Columbus in the winter!Double Tree suites down the street next time, Mmmmm choccy cookies :)Its a pretty good location if you're on a vacation. Not for business travellers. It is kinda far to walk to work. The room sucks. I had a nice view of their parking garage from my room. The lighting is not very good either. The best part of the room was the flatscreen TV for me. The wireless internet is not free but its a very nominal fee. They have a nice bar downstairs and Max &amp; Erma next door though I didn't eat there. The pool in the basement sucks big time. It's kinda creepy to be swimming there alone. There is a skywalk to the Convention Center and the building next door which is pretty cool.",,,"['great', 'location', 'friendly', 'staff', 'clean', 'modern', 'facility', 'great', 'price', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-columbus,Drury Inn & Suites,4.5,$$,46,"Go Yelp.  Let me start by saying I found this gem because of Yelp.  Now. It isn't a luxury hotel.  No room service. No frills but.....totally great place at a totally awesome price.  Room was perfectly clean. Beds were comfortable and linens were nice.  Not a complaint about the place. The service was awesome and the free breakfast and happy hour were great. My kids loved the pool, which was indoor/outdoor. Do yourself a favor.  Save yourself some money and stay here. You won't be sorry!!!!I cannot give this place anything less than five stars.  Everything is always above par here.From the point we arrived until the moment we departed the service was excellent.  I love how nice the employees are here.  To me, they genuinely enjoy their jobs and seem to go out of their way to make your stay an extraordinary one.  I have to suggest becoming a member of their rewards program called Gold Key Club.  You get some amazing perks with it.  The one time I used it to my advantage was to ask for a roll-away bed.  Due to the program, I got this with no charge to me.  As always, free breakfast and dinner, or as they call it, Kickback.  The menu changes depending on the night.  I noticed this time around that if you do not stay at the restaurant you can still partake in these meals for a fee.  Indoor/outdoor pool, hot tub, small gym area, small business center, connection to the Convention Center where there is a food court/small shopping center, grand piano in the lobby, gated parking garage.  If I kept listing the advantages of this place I am sure I would run out of space for this review.This will always be the first place I look for a room when I come to Columbus.  The proximity to Downtown, Arena District, Short North and surrounding area is very convenient.Wow!  What a find.  Was in town for a concert, looked at hotels downtown and this one was the least expensive.  What put it over the tops were the ""perks"".  Free happy hour complete with food, and real food at that.  Free hot breakfast with a ton of options.  The room was nice and is outfitted with a microwave and mini fridge.  The staff was super friendly, going out of the  way to make sure we felt welcome. I'd stay here again in a second!Even though could not hear the staff due to noise level of ComicCon, they were very friendly and courteous as well. Had to call Front desk at night due to loud guests in the next room. Within a few minutes the staff answered the call and was able to finally sleep. Really enjoyed the fact there was on-site garage so that my brother and I did not have to find other parking for the hockey game. The free hot breakfast buffet was a real plus as well.This place far exceeded my expectations. The room had some great design considerations with HBO on demand as well as a 37"" LCD TV. If this wasn't enough they serve dinner from 5:30-7:00pm. For dinner I had. A salad, macaroni and cheese, chicken tenders and nachos with cheese. They also give you three complimentary drinks so o had a bourbon neat, a dry martini (with olive) and a glass of wine! ..just to see if it was real. I left full and satisfied. After dinner I worked out in the onsite gym and them swam in the pool until it closes at 10pm. When I woke up the hotel provided breakfast! And not those cheap continental ones. This one was a spread. They had fruits, oatmeal with raisins, brown sugar or granola, yogurt, bagels with a toaster, donuts, muffins, orange and apple juice, milk, 4 cereals (rice Chex, Cheerios, raisin bran, lucky charms). The also served breakfast potatoes, scrambled and boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy and sausage. They had a begin waffle station as well as the toppings. I didn't know Drury provided all of this for such a good price. If definitely stay here again!I'd never stayed in a Drury chain property before and wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to admit, I was absolutely stunned- pleasantly so.  I actually ended up bummed that their geographic coverage is relatively limited (looks like south, Midwest only).Though I got here too late for the evening free food and drinks (check out other reviews, though- sounds like quite the spread), I did enjoy a decent free breakfast. I got there early and everything was just being set up. There was a nice variety of fresh and decent food.Staff was friendly and efficient. My room, the lobby, common areas, even the parking garage for gods sake- were immaculate. (Okay, maybe the parking garage wasn't immaculate, but it was reasonably litter-free, brightly lit and felt safe, which is all you can really expect.)I'd stay at another Drury property in a heartbeat based on this stay.A great resource if you are staying at the convention center. Reasonably priced. Clean modern rooms. The daily breakfast and cocktail hour food bars were invaluable (especially on a family weekend stay). Very convenient to High St., so there's lots to do.We stayed across the street at the red roof inn plus+ for a few nights; we're here on business. Honestly we were just trying to save some money. Long story short, we were supposed to go to Kent but decided to spend an extra day in Columbus and we wanted somewhere new because the beds and parking at the red roof suck. We didn't have a reservation,  but Yodit took great care of us. All we asked for was a single queen or king and nothing fancy. The first availability that popped up was for two double beds and we were ok with that, but Yodit found us a suite for the same price! The room was beautiful, had a decent view, and Drury offered us free drink vouchers and a hot breakfast bar. We were blown away by the quality of service. We'll definitely be back next time we need a place in Columbus.In town on business, and stayed at the Drury.  The room was spacious and clean, a great value for the money.  Complimentary breakfast and dinner, with free drinks in the evening.  It was attached to the convention center, which was perfect for me.  I wish the hotel had a restaurant, but there are restaurants within walking distance.  Very secure.  Your key is needed to use the elevator, and to get into and out of the parking garage.  Very pleased.Came here with the family to attend the National Volleyball tournament.Hotel is VERY convenient being connected by a short covered walkway to the Convention Center. Not ""cheap"" but reasonable for what you get:1. Free breakfast 2. Free dinner3. Free alcoholic drinks (limited to one or two I think)4. Free soft drinks5. Free wifi6. Free parkingI haven't been to too many hotels that offer that much for free.Granted you probably wouldn't want to eat the breakfast and dinner everyday (food is pretty much the same) but it's an option and will save you money.Staff are helpful and friendly.Rooms are spacious and nice with flat screen tv's.The showerhead (Hansgrohe rain head) is VERY relaxing and I'm planning on getting one for my shower at home.The only cons are:1. Rooms aren't insulated well and you can hear noisy kids running around or playing in the rooms.2. Towels are like sandpaper.  I know good cotton towels are expensive but would be nicer.All in all I'd definitely stay here again!I spent the night at the Drury downtown. There were some things I liked and some things I didn't like.The room was great. I had a nice view. Free wifi. The bed was very comfortable. Lots of mirrors, lots of light. No issues at all. I liked the happy hour and breakfast. This added a lot of value to my stay. Free food and drinks are not a problem for me. Check in was easy. The staff was delightful. Parking was a breeze. The garage is nice and feels secure.The location can't be beat. It's connected to the convention center and all of downtown is right out the front door.The pool was just ok. It was overrun with kids most of the time and the hot tub was not warm enough. Not the end of the world, but it could have been nicer. There is no bar, no restaurant, no room service. If you want food in this hotel show up when they're serving or you'll have to fend for yourself. I don't know if it was because it was a holiday weekend, but I swear, some of the guests I encountered did not seem to know how to hotel properly. First of all, you need to wear a shirt to the buffet, hi. This dude had his shirt off every time I saw him. Come on buddy.Second, it's best to allow people to exit an elevator instead of putting your head down, charging forward and hoping for the best. The guests are not the hotel's fault of course, but the high degree nonsense I experienced was a drag. All told I had a pretty good visit and the price was right. The Drury doesn't nickel and dime you like most hotels with hallways. I would gladly stay again on a weeknight. For a weekend I would probably pay a little more and stay somewhere else.Will never stay anywhere else in Columbus!!! This place is awesome. Super helpful friendly staff. Great breakfast and Happy Hour - fantastic!I have stayed at literally hundreds of hotels and motels across North America.  We visited Columbus, Ohio recently and found Drury Inn &amp; Suites through an internet search.  This hotel far exceeded our expectations.  We stayed in a two-room suite that was very clean and in excellent condition.  The staff was very friendly and helpful without exception.  The hotel offers a free hot buffet breakfast and a free dinner each day as well as 3 free alcoholic drinks each evening.  The pool and hot tub were well maintained.  We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.Not my favorite Drury but still good. The parking garage stinks. You have to check in before you are allowed into the garage. Plus theres no signage showing you where the garage is. Can be easily confused with convention center parking garage. The parking spaces are very tight and garage layout is atrocious. Plus you have to pay to park in this awful garage. Outside of the parking garage...the hotel is great.Stayed here on a week night for work and could tell a lot of other people stay here for business too. So it isn't the fanciest place on earth, BUT, when a hotel goes beyond free continental breakfast, and offers guests free dinner and three alcoholic beverages per night, and has an indoor/outdoor pool and free wifi, I'm not sure there's anything more a guest could ask for?The rooms are very clean. We were located right next to a major off ramp and couldn't hear a single car. Very quiet. Staff was courteous and helpful. The only blip is that the shampoo and conditioner (installed in shower) were really bad. I had to use twice as much shampoo as normal and the conditioner had an awful smell that was chemically and it was almost baby lotion like. It was also useless. The hotel was great, but bring your own shampoo and conditioner.I've stayed in a few different hotels in downtown Columbus during the Ohio Star Ball (a national dance comp). This year, I stayed at the Drury Inn as part of a group reservation, and by the end of my visit, I was wondering why I hadn't chosen to stay there sooner. The hotel was clean, the bed was large and comfortable, the staff was hospitable, and the value was great! There was free wifi and complimentary breakfasts and happy hours. The only drawback was the absence of room service, but there are restaurants within walking distance, including a favorite breakfast spot, Max &amp; Erma's. The Inn is connected to the Convention Center, so you can walk to your destinations without stepping outdoors. This is usually a preferred alternative to battling the freezing temps of Ohio in November.I can't say enough about this hotel -- the people that work there are truly amazing and they really make sure you feel happy about your stay. From the breakfast on weekends to the afternoon kick back it is the little things that make a difference there.If you are in town for something at the convention center you can't beat the location as well. It is so close to everything and right in the middle of it. The only thing that they really could use some help on is the exercise room. During my last stay it was all out of operation and the equipment they have there is really minimal -- a few treadmills but that is about it.The rooms are nice -- staff is helpful and that is really all you ask for to.I'll keep coming back as far as I know.Drury Hotel is one of the best around - also has the best breakfast free - Hyatt is over $200 - you have to tip everyone - $25 valet parking or $12 if you go to a certain lot - restaurant only for meals . . .  Drurys rooms are wonderful - also everyone extremely friendly! Drury reduced their price to $149 for us too. You can't go wrong with them! **We are here w the ""Women of Faith"" Which is awesome @ Convention Center so we are split between both Hotels.The venue was surrounded by orange barrels and a ripped up street but I persisted. I was met with prompt check in and friendly service. Good explanation of how parking garage works, availability of evening snacks and breakfast hours. I liked the ease of the parking deck and found it a simple matter to get from car to room and room to car schlepping all my stuff since both were accessible via the same elevator. The breakfast selection was fine. The 7th floor was extremely quiet, and the room was very nicely appointed and clean. I got a great night's sleep.","I'm one that walks in a hotel room and rips all the sheets off the beds and the cushions off of the couches/chairs to check to for anything... Gross.  I also lift the mattress off the box springs to make sure there's nothing hiding out under there.  This hotel was SO CLEAN!  And very nice too.  Friendly staff, they were very accommodating at my request for a later check out time.  The pool is indoor/outdoor and there is also a hot tub. The fitness area is small, but very nice and clean.  We stayed in a suite which was awesome because there was a solid door separating the bedroom from the rest of the suite- which worked well for us as my husband who had to get up much earlier than me. I would definitely stay there again if I were in downtown Columbus and this will also make me think of checking out Drury Inn's when staying else where also.Found this place online when I was headed down to Cbus for a weekend shopping/drinkfest.  After I called and spoke to the girl at the desk I actually got a cheaper rate than the quoted online one!  This place is GREAT.  Perfect downtown location and right off High street.  The free breakfast, evening snacks and 3 drinks per person are totally worth it.  They also have a great pool that goes outside even in the winter months.  Its pretty cool to be outside when its snowing but be in a nice warm pool.  I had to pay for parking but its a secure lot and easy to get into and out of.  Ever trip I plan from now on will be including a stay at a Drury fo sho..I usually stay at the the Troy MI property. Overall a good Hotel comfy beds and a decent continental breakfast. They are always super clean and offer great services. The bathrooms in the rooms are a bit smaller than other Druery properties I have been to but I relate that to being in the city center. I like the Druery and have never had a problem prior to this visit. I was in town on buisenss and we got a meeting room in the hotel it was perfect for our group the issue was we had the room for one day and they charged us for two and advised us that we would need to talk to the manger to get it resolved. The 2nd issue I had was at the ""Relax Time"" they give you 3 free cocktails per night (which is awesome) I had 2 and couldn't find my card so another member of my group who didnt drink gave me their card and the server was really rude! She told me that this was my last drink and took the card away!! It would have been ok if whe wasnt so rude! When I stay at a property that offer ammenties I dont expect to be treated poorly when using the amenites.I was there for a week while training and enjoyed my stay here. Friendly, engaging staff-members combined with the free breakfast and happy hour made nice bookends of busy days. The indoor/outdoor pool was enjoyable (even in December). The room was comfortable, spacious and had a nice mix of amenities. Great location!I travel around the country to conventions and have never encountered a hotel that's as accommodating and pampering as the Drury! The Rooms are incredibly spacious, we stayed in a suite for two nights, that came with a living room, The last night we stayed at a double bed single room, and both stays were incredible.Every room came with a microwave, a mini fridge, a flatscreen (two in a suite) and free breakfast, dinner and drinks, and for a crowded convention night, effective Wifi.The staff is incredibly efficient and polite, they greet everyone and ask any questions i needed.It's also an incredibly affordable hotel compared to any of the others and the location is right next to the convention center as well as many restaurants and bars.Will stay again next year for sure.I'm really, really hoping that was a kettle cooked potato chip I found on my comforter. Granted, I never ate in the room and I have not had kettle cooked chips in sometime, so if it really was a kettle cooked chip, it surely did not belong to me. I just happened to have plopped on the bed for a second to send out an email when I felt something sharp pressing into my leg. Surely a chip would crumble, right? As soon as I saw it, I freaked out for a second and brushed it off the bed. It was late, I was disturbed and I reacted to it the same way I would a bug in the hair.  I pray, pray, pray it was not someone's dry foot skin.I'm really surprised that the ratings for Drury Inn &amp; Suites are so high! I feel like I stayed at a different hotel from everyone else or something, because I was not at all impressed. As soon as my cab pulled up to the hotel, my expectations dropped. It was definitely a very humble driveway and lobby, so it gave me a better sense of what the rest of the experience would be like. At the time I checked in, the hotel was in the midst of changing up their access card system. This caused for a bit of chaos and disorganization at the front desk. Totally not a problem, since these kind of things happen. But I was disappointed by the lack of professionalism through the wait and through my check-in. I wasn't even told what direction to walk in, or anything about the facilities. I definitely was aware there was an indoor pool however. You could smell it in the lobby. The suite itself was spacious, but incredibly dated. Everything about this place felt old and slightly motel-ish. The coffee maker looked dirty (pass) there was only one piece of soap in the bathroom, the towels were rough and they had pre-filled conditioner and shampoo pumps in the bathroom. (Like a public locker room!)I even gave the complimentary breakfast a try in the morning (it's free for guests but $5.99 for non-guests. Why someone would pay that much for what they had to offer, I have no idea.) Pretty basic continental, with a few hot items (sausage, scrambled eggs, waffle maker) which was displayed pretty central, just aside from the lobby. I took a gamble on the scramble, ate a piece of toast and threw the deuces up. The only redeeming qualities that I found were:1)Location - It's next door to the Convention Center and you can walk to a bunch of places2)Staff  - they were pretty friendly and meant well. I think because they were in the midst of some changes things were running a little less smoothly.I have no plans on staying here again, nor would I recommend it unless it's a toss up between here and a motel chain. Between the two, it would be a tough call.Stayed at the Drury Inn columbus this past weekend.  We were in town for our daughters graduation from OSU. It was the perfect location, not far from campus and quick drive to the short north for dinner. The hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean. We reserved a suite and it was very comfortable for 6 of us! The happy hour and the free breakfast was definitely an added bonus!!! Would definitely return!My husband, daughter and two dogs stayed here for one night. The room was VERY clean, the staff was polite and check-in and check-out were a snap. The only issue I had was the card I used to reserve the room getting charged as well the card I used at check in. Other than that, it was an excellent stay. The free breakfast is also a plus. Hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, waffles, biscuits and gravy. I would definitely stay here again.This hotel represents Columbus! Clean rooms, perfect location, and great breakfast! Thank you guys for a great night!I stayed here on Nov. 17, 2014 in room 559. I rate the front desk staff and room cleanliness 5 stars. The reason for the overall 3 star rating is this - after checking out and going to work, I realized that I forgot my Kindle Fire in the room. After double checking my overnight bag, I went back to the hotel as soon as I could - 5 hours later. I explained to the young lady at the front desk that I had left my Kindle Fire in my room and exactly where I left it. No one else had yet checked into the room but it had been cleaned. The young lady checked with housekeeping and the housekeeper who cleaned the room claimed nothing was left in the room. They took my information in case it turn up and I left. I once again checked my overnight bag - nothing!!!!  I'm not going to accuse anyone of anything but isn't it interesting that no one was in the room but the housekeeper and the Device is no where to be found?A friend of mine was staying in this hotel because she was relocating for work.  I came into town to visit her and stayed in her hotel for a couple of nights.  I was very impressed with the hotel staff and service.  Everyone was SO friendly and helpful.  They rooms/hotel was very clean. They had breakfast, dinner, snacks, and drinks daily!!  ...and free internet! :)I will definitely stay at this hotel when I come into town to visit!  Thanks for making my stay pleasant! =)Extremely nice and helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms, 3 free alcoholic drinks per night, hot breakfast and hot evening snacks, adjacent to Convention Center (you don't even need to go outside!), electronic room card-key system that WORKS! What more do you need? If I'm ever back in Columbus, I'll stay here!Nice hotel. Big rooms. Had a nice message from teh front desk upon turning to my room asking me if there's anything else I need to make my stay better (nice surprise). Spotty Internet, but its free.The first stop on our road trip across America was Columbus, Ohio. We got into the city fairly late and the only pet friendly hotels we found on Yelp were Red Roof Inn and the Residents Inn. The Residents Inn was expensive ($179 i think) and they were charging a $79 pet fee plus $20 for parking. Red Roof Inn do not have a pet fee, but there's no private parking lot. With my whole life in the car, i did not feel comfortable leaving my car in an open lot across the street. We pulled the car over, and saw Drury Inn. I called, and they had vacany, no pet fee and a private lot - I'm sold. The rate was $126 with AAA discount, $12 for parking.Upon arrival, the clerk at the front desk was really friendly. She gave my dog some treats and checked us in quickly. She also informed us the hotel offers free hot breakfast and free wifi. The hot breakfast includes eggs, sausage, french toast, muffins, toast, bagels, waffles, cereals and coffee/juice. It was great!The room was clean and roomy. The private lot was awesome. You need a hotel key to get in the lot, and key entry to the elevator bank thru the lot.Drury Inn quickly became our hotel of choice across America...I was very pleased with the service (Scott in concierge was especially nice and helpful), ambiance, comfort of the room and the free happy hour with food (didn't have to buy dinner!). My only gripe was that housekeeping didn't come by to clean the room til 4pm - which meant I'd already returned from my event and didn't want to vacate while the room was cleaned. Most hotels I've ever stayed in, the rooms are cleaned by 2 or 2:30pm so that was disappointing.Always have a great experience at Drury no matter which one it is!  This was no exception!  We love Drury!We stayed this past weekend for my sister's bachelorette party. I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with everything about this hotel. I know a group of rowdy girls is not easy to handle and every single staff member made us feel welcome. We especially appreciated Josh, Scott, and Rosalia for their patience with us! Josh at the front desk even gave us free admission passes for The Big Bang Piano Bar since he found out that is where were going. The free appetizers and drinks were amazing and a great thing to offer. The location is perfect for easy access to the Arena District. We had a suite and 2 basic rooms which worked perfectly for the party. The suite was very spacious and perfect to hold all of us.I would recommend this Drury Inn to anyone staying in the area!I'd like to give the Drury a 4.5, but as you all know, there are no half-stars on Yelp. Anyway, if you're ever in town for a couple days, I highly recommend the Drury. It's only a short walk away from the strip where all of the bars are, but far enough away that it's actually quiet. There are a couple bars across the street (Max &amp; Erma's, Charley O'Toole's) and it's attached to the Convention Center, where there is a mini-food court with several different choices of food and several stores. The staff is very courteous and friendly, and very attentive. We had a problem with our lock and the room # plate kept falling off mysteriously, but both were fixed within a half hour of us reporting the problems. It's very easy to get around in the hotel.The best part of the hotel is the free breakfast and nightly gathering they have.  If you're a guest at the hotel, you get a card that is good for 3 free drinks (anything) and free food.Again, if you're in the area for work or fun, I'd highly recommend the Drury!!Nice rooms, spic and span bathroom.  Walking distance to Arena district and North Market.  Free Wi-fi.  They give drink vouchers for happy hour.  The only qualm I had with this hotel was the hotel key card used to enter the parking garage was temperamental.  Another thing was I called to check if could do late checkout and they said 1pm was fine.  My friend called the next day to make sure and they said we had to leave by noon.  So my friend had to drag all of our luggage and hang out in the lobby until I got back.  And I had to change from my suit into my casuals in the lobby bathroom.I stayed at the Drury Inn two weekends ago on Saturday night for a bachelorette party. The set up of the room was perfect...there was a large living room area with a pullout couch, a nice size bathroom, an area between the living room and bedroom that had a microwave, counter and mini-fridge, and then the bedroom which we got with two double beds. I slept on the pullout couch which was actually pretty comfortable...either that or I was really drunk. Hmmmm...I'll go with a combo of the two.The location of the hotel is nice because you can walk to the Arena District or Short North very easily. Plus if you drink too much and decide to cab it back, it's only about $5 from the Arena District (not that I am speaking from experience of course...). There is plenty of parking at and around the hotel - you can park at the meters on Nationwide for free Saturday night and on Sunday; there is a garage attached to the hotel, although you do need a room key for it; and then there is another garage next to the hotel which will cost you about $20 if you park overnight. Also be warned that you will need a room key for the hotel elevators.Overall, a great hotel and one that I would definitely stay at again next time I am in town.","We were in Columbus for a convention and the staff at the Drury were unbelievably helpful and kind. The staff helped me bring things over to the exhibit hall and dealt with UPS for me after I checked out, shipping my items for me. The evening drinks and food (complimentary) were a great opportunity to network and speak with other guts, and the complimentary breakfast was great. This was my first experience at a Drury, and I will look out for them in future. There is nothing that could have been done to make our stay more enjoyable. Five stars!It seems the Drury isn't so dreary. In the shadows of the larger marquees in town such as the eye-catching Hyatt next door the Drury still makes quite an impression. To start off I would like to compliment the concierge at the other Drury in town. I initially printed the wrong directions that led me to a separate Drury. The front desk there was so helpful they not only informed me of my location but printed out directions to my hotel. As I navigated Columbus and drove to the front entrance of the hotel it seems modest but yet once one enters the lobby you immediately feel welcomed and surrounded in a comfortable clean environment. At the front desk we were checked in by a lovely young associate who explained about the area and when you will you will need your keys.As for security the entire time I was there I felt entirely safe. From the parking garage where you need a key to enter thru the doors and elevator requiring two key validations. Once you unlock your room you are instantly greeted by a marble floor from the bathroom. The bathroom contains a comfortable vanity area and a private but compact restroom area. There is also a great tv area with a microwave and mini-fridge even in standard rooms. There are comfortable and clean beds beckoning for you to lay down and rest. Speaking of resting from 3-10 pm there are free drinks and popcorn available in the lobby.There is also a hot tub/pool area which looked nice for a relaxing swim. In addition to all of the amenities mentioned above there is a great complimentary breakfast featuring great waffle you can make yourself. Overall the Drury turned out to be a hotel worthy of mention and has overall won my business in any area one is.After all of this great service there was one issue after I had left the hotel I found out that I had left my iPad charger in the room. I immediately called the hotel and they were so nice and offered to check the room for my charger. I later received a call that said that they would happily send me my charger. After all of this I truly was impressed with the level of service at the Drury inn led by their friendly manager Scott.In a time when everyone is cutting corners, Drury offers a lot of extras. 3 complimentary drinks for each night. Free breakfast. Free food in the evening. The staff was awesome. The rooms were clean. The location was ideal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying downtown Columbus. Was way better than the Red Roof across the street I once stayed in.Stayed at this gem of a chain when interviewing for Residency last year and can definitely say it was the best place I spent a night during the entirety of my search.Clean and large rooms, great free coffee, a central location downtown, offstreet parking with easy come/go access, and absolutely free wifi.Better than other more expensive options downtown and more convenient and cleaner than cheaper options outside the city.  Would be an excellent place to stay during NHL Season, the Arnold, or for a Convention.I have put on two meetings in this hotel and the staff has bent over backwards for everything we ask.  The value is more then i can ever ask for which make me look AWESOME to my clients.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting or needing to conduct a meeting.Quite, clean, friendly staff... Most importantly, free internet in rooms and wireless in the lobby to yelp...",,,"['yelp', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'found', 'gem', 'yelp', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'room', 'service', 'frills', 'totally',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-columbus-airport-columbus,Hilton Garden Inn-Columbus Airport,3.0,$$,18,"It was not a terrible stay  but I would think twice about coming back again. I didn't feel comfortable / clean in the room from looking at the sheets.  Also, the conditioner bottles in my room looked worn which makes me think that if guests leave the bottles lying around, they just fill up the bottles with stock conditioner.  But worth of all, and this is why I chose to write a review, the walls and doors are PAPER THIN!!! I can hear people walking around the halls, talking, slamming doors - AND the rooms next to me... I can hear them watching television and talking!!!!!!!!This is your average Hilton Garden Inn. There's a fridge, microwave, and your basic amenities. I do wish for Hilton Garden Inns, Hilton Honors diamond members didn't have to forgo points in order to receive the free breakfast buffet. Even at the diamond level (takes 30 stays), members have to choose between free breakfast or 750 points. Oh well. At least this location offers my favorite breakfast food in the buffet - corned beef hash. I don't know any other HGI with this option.My main pet peeve that this hotel might be a little too close to the airport for me. I realize you may state, ""Well it IS an airport hotel,"" but there are MANY airport hotels that are not EXACTLY right on top of the airport - aloft San Antonio airport, Renaissance Newark airport, Hilton Garden Inn San Francisco airport, etc (I could go on and on!). This airport hotel is SO close to the airport that you will hear the planes land, and depending on your room, can see them right outside the window on the runway! Given there are not soundproof windows, I give two stars!It's very close to the airport, but the walls are so thin, I thought my room was being broken into whenever my neighbors moved around..Stayed here because my daughter had a softball tournament nearby. It's near the airport, so goes without saying, it was very loud. ( read one review that said it was quiet???)   Upon check in the staff asked me if we were with any group, for discount purposes I suppose. I told him no, just here for a softball tournament. He then actually told us that there was no game playing or running and yelling in the hallways! I told him I thought we could hold off until we got to the field the next day. Pretty rude.   Lastly, the bed was like a board with a blanket thrown over it. Definitely done with this Hilton.Honestly, I don't understand why everyone is complaining about the decor. It's a chain hotel right next to the airport. It does what it needs: a nice comfy bed and free wifi for business travelers.I usually stay here or the Hampton Inn by Easton when I come up for business trips, and this hotel suffices. I receive a large room &amp; working wifi. Yes in the morning you hear planes; you're right next to the airport, what do you expect? It smells just fine to me as well. If you're expecting luxury service, remember this is a Hilton GARDEN Inn next to the airport. Remember what you're here for, and you'll receive it.The hotel itself was fine.  It was a room with a bed, clean, and the staff was friendly.  However, their payment processing leaves something to be desired.  When I went to check in, they told me I had to put the entire amount of my stay PLUS $150 in ""incidentals"" on a hold on my card.  Once we checked out, the ""real"" amount would finalize, and the hold would drop off...but not until 5-7 business days after we checked out!  I said I was not comfortable putting $650 on my credit card for that long, so they did not let me check in until my roommates got there.  So after driving 8 hours, I had to sit in the lobby for 2 more to wait for them.  Then, when they showed up, THEY were told that was only for debit cards.  For credit cards they just held one night's stay, about $140.  Nobody said this to me, and I was not using a debit card.  So I sat there for 2 hours for no reason.  Then, fast forward to check out.  We split the room up between us, the total is about $125 each.  I give my card, everything is fine, then I get home and look at my statement.  There is a ""hold"" for $250!  Remember, my card was not used in the check-IN process, so no hold and no incidentals were placed on it.  There is no reason in the WORLD that this should have happened.  When I called they basically told me they had no idea why it did that, and the ""final"" charge would just be the $125 as it should be.  And when I said, ""Well that's great, but what if this unauthorized hold had put me over my limit?  What if I NEEDED that extra $250 to live my life?""  And the girl had no answer.  Basically said, ""Sorry, nothing I can do.""  Meanwhile NONE of this was made clear at the time of reservation.  I am extremely disappointed in the way this all was handled.  I travel fairly often, and have never had an issue like this before.Horrible!  The entire place smells like an ashtray.  The non smoking rooms smell like smoke!  So gross Hilton!!  Charge 140 for this Crap is a Joke.  I am sure management will not Respond as every other review on here is negative. Diamond member officially moving over to Marriott as of today due to this trailer park Columbus Hilton you suck!My fortune 50 company decided to book a room here to better train their employee's.  Here is a run down of why you shouldn't book the Hilton for your next stay.A.  It needs updated.  They use 4 x 3 screens it it is 2011.  If you want business, you have to update your facilities.  Get a high def screen for the conference rooms.  While you are at it update the tv's in the lobby.  My grandmas Zenith console is more up to date than what is in the lobby.B.  Fix the HAVAC unit in the conference rooms.  When it would turn on, you couldn't hear a thing.  Plus it would turn on and off so much I felt like I was my mom going through menopause.  C.  Update the decor in the conference rooms.  If you are too young or too old and haven't been to a wedding in the 80's come here.  The minute I walked in I could have sworn I heard the Vapors singing ""Turning Japanese"", but then again maybe it was the HAVAC unit.D.  While we were having our meeting someone at the hotel brought in two men and showed them the room to see if they wanted to rent it out.  Are you kidding me?!   Again, are you kidding me?  I do not care who is renting out the room already, whether it is for a Bar Mitzvah or a business meeting but come on you just had to show those individuals the room and interrupt a business meeting that was already going on?E.  Thanks for running the vac during our meeting outside the doors of our room.  You knew we couldn't already hear because of the air unit, but this was the icing on the cake.F.  The bathrooms downstairs are cold enough to be a meat locker.Yeah...so I haven't slept here yet. I've checked in, gotten settled and wish that I hadn't decided to stay here already.Why you ask? Few reasons: First off, there aren't sidewalks that take you around the building. It was suggested that I park over closer to my room and by doing so I had to walk about 50 feet in cold water with my nice shoes. Second: The shower. I have *never* in all my stayings at hotels had such AWFUL water pressure. I almost had to touch the wall for water to hit me. So sad!The comforter is lumpy...really? yep! It is.The wireless uses some system that for some reason disables my ability to use my VPN. Thankfully there is a wall plug and it works through there, but otherwise I'd be hosed.Oh wow...so I had to edit this review after checking the gym out. I have not ever seen that bad a gym at a hotel before. Jeebus. I forgot how rundown and bad the places near airports are.Only positive such far is the fact that the AC will blow cold air, cause I can't stand having the heater on regardless of how cold it is outside.This is the nicest hotel ever!  The staff was very welcoming and helped me find a tasty delivery place at 1 am.  The next morning I came to breakfast and was worried my debit card wouldn't work (bc I am from out of town and thought it would freeze) and I was comped my breakfast.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable.  I would stay here again when I come back to Columbus.Stayed here on a business trip. OK experience here. Hotel room was fine, although I had issues connecting to the internet at times (not sure if it was my computer or the wireless network). Stayed right across from their small fitness center. Other than their in-house restaurant and the McDonald's across the street, you don't have many food options.Do you like hilton miles?  Do you like old fashioned Tv's and the sound of the runway outside your window?This is the place for you.I doubt Paris would stay in this namesake hotel.I decided to head to airport a day early due to bad weather and made a reservation with them -was a little concerned when they said that they were undergoing renovations but I didn't have a problem at all - they were very nice and helpful - was worried the airport shuttle may be to small as there were quite a few of us going there but was able to fit in 15 people and more pieces of luggage than that - all in all I was very happy staying there.I didn't hear the airport noise during my stay, which was nice.  The rooms are spacious and the free wi-fi was a great benefit.  I don't think I used the TV (I prefer to watch movies on my laptop).  The breakfast was good, although it was probably cheaper at the McDonald's across the street.  McDonald's is the only eatery close by, if I remember correctly.  But for an overnight trip, this hotel was a good pickDefinitely not bad as far as budget hotels go. The rate was pretty cheap ($119.00), and it was a pretty large room with a good internet connection, and a nice TV. The food at their restaurant in the front wasn't bad either.If you're looking for an airport that's pretty conveniently located to industrial parks, stay here unless you're going to a particular event in at a particular hotel.Oh, when I came it, it was the last day of the Arnold Classic Fitness Convention, which apparently is one of the biggest things that happens in Columbus. I didn't go, but I did keep getting asked if I was going or had gone, which sorta made me snicker. I do, however, wish I had gone out one day earlier, because the night before I was there, the UFC 68: The Uprising actually occured as part of this event.If you need to stay by the airport and whatever is out this way in Columbus, the Hilton Garden Inn is the way to go. Rates were wonderful, only $84 + tax = $101.Dining options are a bit weak, just the hotel restaurant and McDonald's across the street, but if you're only staying a night or two that's fine.Rooms are spacious, wireless is free, my floor (the 2nd) seems to smell like hair perm chemicals in the hallway, but otherwise the place seems clean and nice.Initial greeting by front desk &amp; housekeeper supervisor excellent - but assigned room way out of date and badly in need of renovation. Very spartan room decor, luke warm water with little pressure in shower, ancient tube tv, squeaky bathroom door a big annoyance &amp; on a spring to keep shut (broken trash can in the bathroom obviously constantly used to keep door open when desired), coffee service not cleaned. We've stayed at other extremely good Hilton Garden Inns but this one is not good.amazing customer service. nice rooms. quiet despite airport.",,,,,"['terrible', 'think', 'twice', 'coming', 'back',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-suites-east-broad-at-270-columbus-2,Comfort Suites East Broad at 270,4.0,$$,16,"Stayed here for a night when visiting town.  Staff was friendly, room was updated and clean, free wifi and breakfast.  My only ""complaint"" is that the breakfast could have included more hot foods and the juice dispenser was more like flavored water.  I would stay here again.The room was large, with two queen size beds, couch, sitting chairs, desk, fridge, microwave, you name it.  Everything was very clean and smelled fresh.  The beds were a little firm but not uncomfortable.  The air was a little dry with the AC going all night.  I enjoyed it; wish I could have tried the pool.Pros:  it's nice, it's clean, the beds are comfortable, and it's easily accessible to the highway.Cons: the hallway floors feel like you are walking in a fun house... Ups and downs, lots of soft spots along the way.  For a hotel that is only 5 years old, this is crazy.All in all I would stay here again, I just hope they do something about the hallway floors before someone falls and gets hurt.Nice room with 2 queens and a sofa bed. Pool is really small - half the size of normal hotel pool. Only goes to something like 4 ft and freezing in the morning. Still fun for the kids. Breakfast is convenient and gets put away at 9 am. Front desk was quick and efficient but not the friendliest. No pets allowed. Convenient location.For whatever reason, the airport hotels right next to the Columbus airport are wickedly expensive compared to what you pay only a few miles out. This Comfort Suites is a mere six miles away (by interstate; it's less if you take the back roads like the cabbies do), and much cheaper.For $100/night I had a massive suite with a chair, foldout couch, flat-screen TV, comfy bed stuffed with pillows, a sizeable desk, a microwave and a good-sized hotel refrigerator. All for just me....This Comfort Suites has very friendly staff; on my check-in I received a little welcome bag for being a Choice Privileges member (I've never gotten one before!), and the woman at check-out remembered me from the day before. Little things, but welcome ones.A free airport shuttle is advertised, but as far as I could tell it's sporadic. I arrived around midnight and simply took a cab from the airport to get to the hotel, and when I needed to go back to the airport the hotel paid for a cab, instead of taking me in the shuttle that was parked outside. I don't know if they'd comp your trip from the airport, were the shuttle not running, but that may be worth checking into. Given that the cab ride was around $25, and rental cars at the economy level are around $15/day, you might be better off just renting a car to begin with, if you can't get a shuttle to the hotel.I didn't use the pool but it looked large and clean. There's a fitness center, and the standard continental breakfast. I usually avoid them, but this one had clementines instead of plain oranges - a nice touch. The biggest downside of this location is that it is fairly remote; there's not much around (aside from Waffle House and Chick-fil-A), though a short drive takes you to more populated areas. I wasn't running this weekend due to rehabbing an injury, but if you're like me and usually like to go out for a run no matter where you're staying, be aware that there are no sidewalks in sight around here. The general area is a bit east of Columbus proper, so if you want to go into the city at all, you're in for a drive.Comfort Suites are probably my preferred label of the Choice Hotels family, and if you're in Columbus and need a good one near the airport, this is a great choice.Overall it was a good experience and decent value, with one major downside. I decided to splurge and get the room with a private jacuzzi in it, which was really nice. Service was nice, the free included breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety. Free internet.The only real problem I encountered was when I woke up with a bunch of bites that I'm fairly sure are bed bug bites. Not cool. They should take better care to avoid bed bugs! If it weren't for that I'd probably give it the full five stars.Stayed here on a business trip and we were all very impressed! For $99 a night we got a huge room, comfy bed, nice sized bathroom, a nice sitting area as well as a kitchenette with fridge, coffee maker and microwave. Not to mention a nice work area with desk and plenty of power outlets! The room was clean and kept cool. Plenty of lighting and a nice tv. Best of all, free *fast* wifi! Why spend $200 on a room elsewhere in the city (cough cough The Hilton) and not get free wifi?! If I had to give one con you can hear a plane taking off or landing every once in awhile but that didn't bother me very much. Anytime I do business in the Columbus area this is where I'm staying from now on!This is my favorite choice hotel in Columbus. Not only its close to the airport, the staff is friendly and the room is big and clean. the added bonus? FAST INTERNET!SUMMARYFront Desk:5Check out Process: 5Room Overall: 5Bathroom Overall:5Breakfast:5Internet:5The Run-Down:When you first walk in, the set up of the hotel is wonderful. Plenty of seats in the lounge to sit with a big screen tv. The computer and printer actually works well. The front desk is exceptional. I can be somewhat picky or needy at times but they are accommodating and super friendly. Check in is a fast process and when I go into my room, Im always suprised at how nice and clean it is. Its so clean that I dont mind walking around barefoot! Another little thing that I notice about the rooms is that there are outlets on every lamp and 3 extra plugs at the work desk. Its such a small detail I know but I appreciate it and I hate having to go behind drawers and desks to try to plug in my laptop and phone. The breakfast area is wonderful because even throughout the day, they have fresh coffee out. They also keep plates and utensils out which is great for when I bring take out to my room, I can easily head over to the breakfast area and grab what I need. Lastly, the internet runs about 10-15 Mbps download and 1.5 - 3 Mbps upload. Love it!I stayed here two nights last week while visiting family. I didn't get a chance to really explore the hotel or even stay in the room much, but I was quite comfortable. Check-in was easy (I'm really glad they had luggage carts available), the room was very clean with a nice assortment of extras like a fridge, microwave, plenty of plugs for electronic devices, and even a little sitting room area. Had we wanted to, we could have definitely had visitors in the room. It was quite nice. I also really was happily with the excellent air conditioner that was very easily controlled and kept the room at a nice temperature.I didn't eat breakfast, but my wife did. She didn't say anything about it, so it must have been OK. She did bring me some doughnuts, though.I will say, though, that there were a lot of geese outside of the hotel. That doesn't bother me, but one of them was quite aggressive and kind of lunged at my while I was carrying my daughter. I got in his/her face and yelled ""come at me bro!"" That caused the beast to back off. Don't mess with my kid, goose.Oh, and evidently a few people staying in the hotel had their Nintendo 2/3 DS systems on as well as I picked up quite a few folks on Street Pass.Plenty of parking (and was also allowed to leave my vehicle in the drive through for some time) Front desk staff was friendly and helpful.Room was clean and large with a separate area with a couch.Coffee maker (not in bathroom :-) and fridge.Large pool.Free coffee tea out at all times, and complimentary breakfast (decent - waffle maker was fun!)Close to food (off top of my head: Bob Evans, Tim Hortons, Chipotle, Tumbleweed)My husband and I stayed at Comfort Suites for 1 night while visiting our daughter who lives nearby. I chose this hotel based on proximity and Trip Advisor reviews. Our stay was wonderful. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The rooms were clean and spacious. It was nice to have a separate living room area, as well as a refrigerator and microwave in-room. Breakfast offerings were sufficient. There were eggs (hard-boiled &amp; scrambled)and sausage, along with instant hot cereal, bagels, mini donuts, muffins, an assortment of fruit, yogurt and juice. There was also a DIY waffle station. The kitchen area and subsequent eating area were clean and tidy. There was also a business center in the lobby along with an adjacent seating area. Also the hotel offers free wi-fi. All in all this as a great stay. I would definitely stay here again.Knowing the Comfort Suites brand, I didn't have high expectations of this hotel.  It turned out to be a rather pleasant surprised.  Located close to the airport, getting their in our Mitsubishi rental car from Dollar was a rather simple affair with help from my trusty friend Siri.  The place was easy to find and looks relatively well kept.  Upon entry, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  Then again, most people from the midwest are.  I checked into Four Square while my boss checked in and got a little welcome gift offer.  I jokingly presented it the staff and they said they just ran out of it and would make some more and be sure to save me one.  I got a room on the 4th floor.  Since it's only 4 stories I guess you can call it a penthouse (j/k).  The room was nicely furnished with a nice sized bed, office area, separate sitting area and very nicely done bathroom with granite countertop.  Color me impressed!  My perception of Comfort Inn being similar than your Motel 6 was definitely wrong.  We were leaving for a meal and the staff actually remembered me and gave me the welcoming present.  The next morning there was free Continental breakfast with a Waffle station!  Also the WiFi is free and you don't even need a password.  That makes life so much easier for watching Hulu!  I give this place a thumbs up.  If it wasn't for the lumpy bed and the sad 3 machine gym, I would give it a five star.  Yikes a 5 Star Comfort Inn!!!Nice room, well kept and clean. Didn't spend a lot of time there but I had no complaints and these days that's the most you can hope to get out out of a hotel in this price range. The staff was exceptionally friendly. The breakfast was the standard ""continental"" fare, meaning barely edible.Nice place to stay at. Very spacious and updated. New appliances. Great breakfast!Didn't give 5 stars because floor squeaks and one of the computers in the business center wasn't working right and made me lose my work twice.Great, clean, comfy, no smelly heater, great service. I was happy to stay there!!!A nice looking building from exterior, and also well-kept on the inside. We stayed for an extended weekend with our infant son. Our room was large, with plenty of space to set up our pack n play. Nice kitchenette with sink and mini fridge... Needed with a baby for sure! Nice furniture including a hide-a-bed couch, desk w chair and a separate rolling table (handy!), comfy chair  (good for holding a napping child), large bed with down comforter and lots of pillows (though I always advise bringing pillows from home bc a good pillow is key to a good sleep!), nice closet, and an easy to use AC/heater unit. That said, my biggest annoyance about this hotel is the floors! And I'm not talking about the carpeting. The floors creak BAD!! And they are apparently paper thin too. We could hear EVERY freakin thing our upper level neighbor was doing... ALL NIGHT LONG! Yeah, hello... Hotels are floor sleeping!!! Go to bed, people!!!  Be warned now: If you tend to be a light sleep, you better ask for a room on the top floor. For this one reason alone, I'm giving a lower rating. No one should have to hear what the person above is doing all day or night long! (Why does anyone come to a hotel and not sleep at night?! Seems like a waste of $!) Well everything else is pretty top-notch. Don't expect anything delivered to your door though. You need something? Get down to the front desk. They'll gladly help, but there's no delivery service for anything... Except Dominos pizza, which costs extra, of course. The front desk lady (we saw the same one all weekend) is super nice. Continental breakfast is good, with a Belgium waffle maker. Mmmm! Parking is decent (particularly before 7pm). Oh and it's a great location with plenty of food options down the road!! So, overall a fabulous hotel... But best on the top floor if you plan to sleep at all.",,,,,"['night', 'visiting', 'town', 'staff', 'friendly', 'room', 'updated', 'clean', 'free', 'breakfast', 'complaint', 'breakfast', 'included',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/columbus-marriott-northwest-dublin-2,Columbus Marriott Northwest,4.0,$$,19,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I used hotwire to book the reservation so I didn't get to do a thorough check of the hotel prior but this place exceeded my expectations. I regularly stay in hotels for work and this place went above and beyond accommodating everything we needed. The from desk clerk was a younger lady (Laney) and she did a great job of multitasking and making sure everyone was taken care of. Great place. I will be back on my next visit to Columbus.Terrible management. We stay at Marriotts often. Usually no problem--in fact, we're usually very happy. Here? Too long a boring story-- suffice it to say: room not prepared; room not serviced the next day, despite a 2nd request; lies; smirks; and promises from a General Manager that went unfulfilled. Add to it a really dumb customer service function by Marriott-- you call, they say there's a wait, would you prefer a call back? I leave a message--and get a return call 4 days later. Not really great service any way you look at it. Maybe it's time to shift to Hilton.(Just noticed that another reviewer had a similar experience with the room last year--so it seems it must be management/training. Makes me think I'm not as crazy as I feared, as well. Most of my reviews on Yelp are very positive-- these guys really tourqued me off).Ok for conferences. Food is ok but better than some of the chain places near by. The Starbucks has odd hours and difficult to catch them open.I have been really impressed with the front desk staff.  Everyone is efficient, friendly, and has gone above and beyond to take care of us.   I will definitely stay here when I'm in town again.My husband and I got married last night and the wonderful staff took such good care of us! They bumped our room from a regular room to a suite at no extra charge! We will definitely be coming back to this location!This is a great hotel.  Service is top notch, rooms are updated and super clean.  Excellent Gym with lots of options and space.  Bar and restaurant have excellent service and all my favorites.  Possibly my favorite Marriott in the chain.The staff were friendly and efficient.  The hotel decors and the room were a bit dated but kept very clean.   I have the access to the lounge and it was small but had all the things that I need in the morning and before dinner.   I would definitely come back to this hotel should I come back to Columbus again.I've had the pleasure of staying here for the past year, and I wholeheartedly recommend this place both to business travelers as well as those who travel less frequently.  Let me start off by saying that I'm not one of those travelers who demand/require a lot of pomp and circumstance.  If I stay at the same hotel on a weekly basis, I try to know everyone in the hotel on a first name basis.  From the very first night, this hotel was top notch in every aspect.   The chefs, Larry especially, know their stuff.  I've had almost every item on the menu.  Never once did I have something that was prepared perfectly.  Michael, Allison, and Maria were amazing at the bar.   Clare and the entire front desk were always there to greet me with a smiling face every week.  Amy up in Concierge was always a welcome face each evening.  I think it goes without saying that my stay there was excellent.  I would not hesitate to suggest this place to anyone.  The price is good, the amenities are good, but the real selling point here is the staff.   Keep up the great work!Oh, Marriott in Dublin.  I am giving you a huge MEH.  I've experienced better.I am a 10 year fan of the Marriott Hotel chain.  I have had great experiences at most every hotel that I have visited.  This one is an exception.  Although the front desk clerk was nice and friendly, she also gave me a room at the very end of the hall way, next to a cleaning closet that was propped open more than half the time, making me a little fearful when going to my room.  Yes, I am sure for the most part, a hotel in Columbus is relatively safe.  But I still got the heebie-jeebies walking down the long hallway to my room.  And it was not like that hotel was full, there was probably a total of 5 cars in the parking lot on a Sunday afternoon. Why not give a female traveler a more appropriate room location?  Any other Marriott, and I would get my room upgraded.  My Gold status got me nuttin' here.Another couple minus stars for their gift shop.  When traveling, you are inevitably going to forget something.  And the gift shop should be stocked with necessities.  So, when I was in desperate need of Advil, I called to front desk to inquiry as to where I might be able to buy some.  I had developed a migraine, and although I have prescription medication, it does not work without Advil.  They told me that I could get Advil in the gift shop.  I made the trek downstairs, only to find the location of Advil bare.  Then I had to wait until they contacted the bell hop to see if some was in the back room.  No such luck.  So, it was up to me to take my pounding head back upstairs to get my car keys and sunglasses and go out and about the town seeking a local Walmart.  Not good.  Then two days later, I encountered a man in the gift shop desperately looking for Advil.  You can see their sense of urgency in keeping needed items in stock.This leads to yet another negative experience.  Since I has recovering in my room mid morning, I had posted my DTD sign on the door.  Housekeeping passed me over, thank you.  They were kind enough to leave a note to call the front desk at a time when I was ready to have my room cleaned.  Which I did.  However, I came back to my room after 6 pm, hours later,  to find that they did not get the message to housekeeping, my room was untouched.There are positives about this place.  I can think of one right now.  The morning person at the concierge lounge was awesome.  She was very friendly and helpful.  And she even remembered me next day and was thoughtful in some of her comments.  World class service from her.  Minus points for me, I do not remember her name.  But there is nothing nicer than being away from home, traveling all alone and having a friendly face.All in all, so meh, the next time I find myself in this area, I will be steering clear of this hotel.First time at this marriott.  My room is exceptional.  Everything looks brand-new.   It is a very large room with a king size bed.  The bathroom is well stocked and very clean.   Check in was very quick and both employees were exceptional.   They even walked me to the elevator.   I highly recommend this Marriott.  Ask for room 543 if you want the one I had.Love this Marriott! We try to stay here every time we come to Columbus. Room and public space is very clean!This is a great place to stay. The beds are soft and the service is great. I am a major Marriott fan. I typically stay here when I am in Dublin. Its close to the office and I have a lot of choices when it comes to dinner.Stay here if you want to pay a premium for the bare minimum. Go elsewhere if you want to feel like your paying for more than just clean sheets and a lobby with a cathedral ceiling and clean floors. Until now, I never stayed at a Marriott where I had to pay for internet access for each individual computer. I wish this hotel would have advertised this ""feature."" I'm not a baby boomer, so constant internet access is needed for work and life. The options are to either commute to the lobby so everyone can see how cool I am with a G.I. Dell running Windows pOS (I've been hating on PCs since '87) while working on personal stuff with my iPad and iPhone, or I can dish out $20 for three separate connections per day. Thank god I left AT&amp;T for Verizon, so I can tether my phone (but only using LTE). I digress. This Marriott is run like Ryan Air: you have to pay for every convenience.We stayed here during a week long vacation to North Carolina and really enjoyed our night here. Dublin was not anything to write home about, but we prefer Marriott brand hotels and this particular one was clean and the staff was super friendly. My husband said the gym was very clean and the hours were a perk. The bathroom was small, but well maintained as was the rest of the room. We had breakfast in the restaurant in the morning which was absolutely horrible (I took one star off for the breakfast because it was simply that bad!), but having water and coffee in the hall outside the lobby during the day was an unexpected kindness.We just recommended our parents stay here on their trip home from North Carolina!i visited this Marriott while going to Dublin Irish Fest.  It is nestled in to an office park dominated by Nationwide leased buildings near Tuttle Crossings.The hotel was busy due to the event and other events happening in the Northwest portion of the city.     The staff was super friendly and the rooms were nice / modern.The only knock I have on this place was the restaurant / bar was severly lacking.   I remember over 10 years ago where they had more of a selection.    They offers beers and a very limited menu (I don't think they had any appetizers).The front lobby staff is very friendly and helpful.The bed, while equipped with Marriott's signature Revive collection, only revived me from being able to sleep comfortably. Incredibly lumpy, I had to constantly adjust my position. It certainly was not characteristic of other Marriott Revive beds I've slept in.The bathroom is a bit on the small side, but with ample counter space, and the water pressure out of the shower is good.The gym is located on the first floor and is open 24 hours. There are five treadmills and three stair climbers equipped with individual TVs. Apparently the Marriott also has an agreement with nearby Metro Fitness if you present a valid room key and ID. As for disclaimers, I have not tried that club, and the reviews are definitely not favorable.The Concierge Lounge is accessible via room key on the 7th floor and offers traditional beverages, food, and snacks for Marriott status holders. It is open between the hours of 6:30 am - noon (breakfast until 9:30 am) and 5 pm - 10 pm (hors d'oeuvres until ?) on weekdays.great food at the bar. nice facility. would stay hear again soon.Nice hotel and I have stay there a number of times.  But I still wonder why they don't have Comedy Central.  When it costs nothing to have 700 channels at home, why are there still missing staples in the room.  There are 6 ESPNs, Velocity, HD Net but no Comedy Central.  That makes no sense.Great hotel.  Good rates, wonderful helpful staff.  Clean and comfortable rooms.  I would definitely stay here again.",,,,,"['exactly', 'looking', 'used', 'book', 'reservation', 'thorough', 'check', 'hotel', 'prior', 'place', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'regularly', 'hotels',

These reviews are brutal!I typically stay at Marriott properties now (I used to be a Hilton member but switching jobs had me switching hotel preferences), and I personally chose this one for leisure because of it's proximity to Nationwide Arena and N High. The location is nearly perfect; just a half block walk away to the hockey game I was attending.When we arrived, we were told that valet and self parking were the same price. We decided to valet because we're lazy. We checked in at around 6:30PM, and Lizzie (I believe/hope that's her name), checked us in promptly. It should be noted that it was her first day, and although she had worked at other hotels, she was already very rehearsed in the layout of the hotel and the surrounding area.I see multiple complaints about the difficulty of the stairs between the lobby and the elevator. I totally understand how that could be an issue, but it wasn't a big deal for us personally. We headed to room 323 and we were more than happy with what was there. Two comfy beds &amp; a clean room.We didn't stay in our room too often as we were only there for one night. We went up specifically to watch a game and check out the bars and restaurants in the area. However, this hotel did exactly what we needed it to do: provide a comfy stay while we watched our Penguins rough up the Blue Jackets.So first thing I noticed is that you have to climb stairs to get to the elevator.... Really?!? In a hotel with lots of suitcases you want every guest to carry their luggage up stairs? Room was ok except for red splatter on my closet door that I'm hoping wasn't blood, some dark hair on my towels, and water damage on the artwork in the bathroom. Calling down to the front desk to ask for my car to be brought around I was placed on hold for 10min before I hung up and walked downstairs to which I was greeted by a front desk staff attending to no one. The morning I checked out I came down to the valet reading the paper, he didn't even look up from his paper when he handed me my keys. No thanks, I didn't need help carrying my suitcase down the stairs...or putting it into my car. I wouldn't stay here again.Passing though Columbus, so I decided to reserve a room near the brewpub I intended to visit. The weather was bitterly cold, so I wasn't going to walk far. The Courtyard seemed like the ticket. Not so much.Check-in is friendly and quick. Good valet service but they need a larger pull-in lane. My vehicle's rear end was sticking out in traffic while I waited for another car to clear. Probably not much to be done about that in a city. The next morning, my vehicle was ready in minutes after I called the front desk (their valet text service wasn't working).Room was fine. No complaints there. No noises, HVAC worked as it should.The big issue is the WiFi crapped out, which is super annoying when you want to plan the day's schedule in the morning. And when I went down to use one of the 'business' computers, the first one I jumped on was locked up. So I had to find another one. I was cranky by that point.Why is there no TV channel guide? The hotel booklet said to check the guide channel on the TV itself but didn't even provide the channel number for that. And you know how slow the channels change on hotel TVs (and why is that, I've always wondered?). Once I did find it - I think it was Ch 94 or something, not the first one when you turn on the TV - many channels that were listed weren't actually received.No free coffee that I could see other than the horrid stuff in the room. I think I'm spoiled by Hampton. They always have free coffee no matter the time of day.There's no security at all. I walked in from the street and used the elevator without even seeing an employee. The front desk was momentarily unattended. The elevator didn't have a room card reader. Yeah, I know this is how it is in many places I stay, such as suburban Hamptons, but it is not good for a downtown hotel and not good for the price I paid. I'd like to know that the only people on my floor are guests and employees.Bathroom was not clean - disgusting in fact, but I'll spare you the vomit-inducing details.  Called desk, manager visited, housekeeping came and re-cleaned.  Bathroom still not clean.  I asked if he had inspected after re-cleaning and he said ""yes"".  Only took me 1 second to find more grunge and hair all over floor.Manager came back, housekeeping came back to try again.  Better, but still not what I'd call clean.  Three strikes and you're out.  Follow up from management seemed more oriented toward apologizing than fixing the problem.  Apparently, they have no standards for cleanliness.  I checked out after one night and won't be back.No PARKING!! Only $20 valet, what? If you are there for work, don't trust their text system,the valet parking is mostly 20 year old kids and they hardly ever got my car on time.anyways, I was there for business. Rooms are big and clean, very quiet.There is a restaurant below but casual and not too many options.Staff is friendly and is located in a central part of Down Town .  Small gym, but not that bad.Plenty of restaurants open late at night.Not up to Marriott standards. Room is musty/smoky smelling and a/c is struggling to keep the room cool. Check in was pleasant and quick. I will not be returning.3 Stars- They are improving, but there are still a few things they need to workoutThis hotel has recently under gone a major renovation and they are still in the process of finishing some of the minor touches, i.e. one of the elevators. The Downtown Columbus Courtyard is now inline with the current Courtyard standards, including the Bistro/Starbucks combo, which can be a love/hate thing.Pro's:+Location- It is conveniently located within blocks of the Arena District and is located within a ~7 minute walk of restaurants. +Shower- This may not be a big deal to some, but the shower head was hung high , and I didn't have to duck to take a shower+Rooms- The rooms were recently redone. I love the number of power outlets that the room had. From the desk to the lamps, they incorporated additional connections in. Also, the bedding was brand new as well as the other furniture and the tv.+Work space Areas- There was a sitting area with a TV by the elevators near the lobby floor and another sitting area down near the Bistro where groups of people could hangout and talk. They also had a row of computers to use if needed down off the Bistro area.+Wifi- It was free+Staff- They were friendly and they handled a noise complaint in a timely manor. Cons:-Noise- Avoid staying in a non-interior room. You will hear the street noise. Also, there is noise that comes through the doors from the hallways.-Wifi- Yes it's free, so if there are a lot of people on, don't expect the best connection rates.-Shower- For whatever reason the water didn't stay a consistent temperature throughout use. There is nothing like a cold shower in the morning to wake you up.-Parking- The only option is to valet your car. The lot is right next to the hotel and you will be charged $19/day. Fair warning, if any thing happens to your car, the hotel/parking lot is not liable. I would suggest finding a garage to park your car or use another hotel's garaged parking.-Layout- Like other downtown hotels in older buildings that I have stayed in, the layouts for the check-in counters are a bit odd. The lobby is on the ground floor, but you must decent half a flight of stairs to get to the elevators. This is fine for the average person, but others may find this challenging. They do have an elevator for guests to take to bypass this, but keep in mind, it will take them more time to exit/enter the hotel.-TV's- This is not just a Marriott problem, but one that I have been noticing across all brands of hotels due to their cable providers, digital channels take longer to appear on screen than analog. We are talking upwards of a 10 second delay and it is annoying.Probably read about the fact that their is no parking.I had a run-in with the cafe staff - someone didn't get the ""Marriott"" training.  The hotel is super-handy if your working in the Nationwide complex.  Food is about 5 block walk away - so is the coffee.  I didn't bother eating here.There is one entrance that I know about, relatively small entrance.  Seems that there is always a congregation of employees hanging out at the parking valet desk outside.  The public sidewalk is actually quite narrow at same point, so they are always in your face.My alley view of the rear of the YMCA wasn't too bad since I didn't want to look outside the window anyway.They have the strangest sink faucets I'd ever seen.  Couldn't figure out how to make it work.  But here a tip, pretend that strange vertical metal thing is a joystick and you'll do fine.If you are a casual traveler or on vacation you will like this hotel. If you are a business traveler like myself (40+ weeks a year) keep reading, then go find a new hotel!*not handicap friendlyCons:-elevators and first floor rooms are 8 steps up from the lobby. Supper inconvenient with luggage and impossible for wheelchairs-when I arrived I knew it was valet only for $19 a day, what I didn't expect to find for that much as a cluster. This hotel is on a busy downtown street and there are 3 spots for valet. The valets attendants (lack there of) had me park in the street due to lack of space. Keep in mind this is an active busy downtown ST. See picture of someone's car, after he was told please leave your car in the street, it will be safe. As other readers mention it takes 15+ mins to get your car.- when I got my room it was on the first floor, ask to change and got a higher room with dirty sheets( although layout was spacious). Decided to take the 1st floor room. Super tiny room. Opened my blinds to find someone staring at me from the indoor  hot tub. No sunshine for me!- for breakfast asked if their egg sandwiches had milk or butter in them, no one had a clue, coffee was good though. And the girl gave me attitude for approaching to order when her cafe lights were off at 640a ( suppose to open at 630a)- I regularly leave a do not disturb sign up and opt out of daily room cleans, but no door sign. Ask for one at front desk and girl said she has no clue where they are and housekeeping doesn't work at 6p. Came back from dinner to a taped handwritten note on my door.- can hear everything through walls and door.-everyone at the front desk acts as if you are bothering them.- TVs on gym bike didn't workPros-clean updated gym. Up to 50 lb free weights- comfy bed-free wifi-location -standard Marriott feel.I will not be returning! The Hampton Inn down the street is the nicest I have stayed at in a Hilton chain. Only booked at this courtyard for Marriott promo and no rooms at any of the Hilton's.The recent renovations are lipstick on a pig. It's pretty clear that it's just cosmetic facade on a very poorly designed and dated building. Some of my experience is undoubtedly biased by the fact that they put me in a horrible first-floor room which was about the size of a medium security prison cell, with a view to match, despite charging my company a rather high rate.The parking is too much for a mandatory valet situation.The layout is terrible-nothing they can do about a bad building with renovations-and so the bar/restaurant has all the charm of a basement dorm cafeteria. Despite the new furnishings, that's what it feels like. Call it the ""first level"" all you want, if there are no windows it's a basement.This place is the first hotel I've ever checked out of early due to low quality. I'm surprised Marriot is willing to have their good name tarnished by this hotel.Ugh, I got athletes foot without ever stepping foot near the pool or gym. :( We stayed in the handicap room for two nights. I would expect them to wash the showers between guests.The staff were friendly, and they gave us an extra cot for a 3rd person.The two options for parking were street parking or Valet for $19. No complimentary breakfast.Another great stay.  We were upgraded to a suite for my wife's birthday.  Easy walk to the restaurant.  Helpful staff.Excellent hotel.  Very friendly staff, from the valet to the cleaning staff. I stayed in 229 and loved the raised separate area for my kids. Pool was freezing because the heater was just replaced, but still fun. Great location (close to COSI) and Starbucks on premise. We'll be back.This is where I stayed for the Columbus Marathon.I am so glad that I picked this location.  I knew in preparing for the trip that I would not want to have to walk far before or after the race to get to my hotel.  It is conveniently located in the downtown area, close enough to get to the marathon expo, start and finish lines.  For location for a marathon stay I give 5 stars.When we we're visiting this location was undergoing some extreme renovations.  Not only in the lobby but rooms on the second floor were under construction.  Now I understand that this may be necessary for any hotel during some point in time but it may be considerate to let your patrons know that this will be going on during your stay.  Luckily for us we weren't located by any of the rooms undergoing heavy/loud construction and I was able to get a good nights sleep for my race.  I feel like if I am paying top dollar for a room I shouldn't have to walk around caution tape, dusty floors and inhale drying paint.  Perhaps there should be some type of discount or at least let guests know of this before hand.  I could see how this could inconvenience people with allergies or even rooms that were disturbed by the construction noise.  Construction 2 stars.The staff was considerate and helped me out when I had finished the marathon but couldn't find my family.  My phone had died during the three and a half hour run so I was out of luck.  My only choice was to limp back to the hotel.  I barely made it but they gladly got me another room key, as I didn't run 26.2 miles with it in my pocket, I collapsed as soon as I got to my room.  Service 5 stars.Another moot point, I'm not sure if it was because of the construction but the shower in our room took a really long time to produce hot water.  Hotels usually don't have this problem so this was kind of a bummer.  Shower 1 star.I think this hotel is pretty nice and they have some cool stairs built in from being a shoe factory in the early hay days.  Friendly staff and very clean.  Has An ATM inside and valet parking only.  Very close (Walking distance) to the convention center.Wow, probably the worst Marriott property I've ever experienced. The only reason its two stars instead of one is the majority of the staff are really nice and doing the best they can with a fairly shabby hotel. When I checked in there was an angry mob in the lobby. Apparently there was a concert in town and many had hoped to get into their rooms at check-in time to get ready. It was almost 5:00pm and many had been waiting for two hours. The young lady working behind the desk was buried. It seemed like housekeeping was way behind or something. She was doing the very best she could and despite one upset guest after another getting in her face she remained polite and professional. The small lounge was offering happy hour prices to try to calm people down and the bar tender was handing out bags of popcorn to the waiting guests. This situation was a management or system failure that put these young staffers in this position and they were doing the best they could. Not being in a hurry I kicked it in the lounge and threw back a Makers Mark on the rocks, maybe two.Once I got into my room I had to double check that I was in a Courtyard Marriott not a Days Inn circa 1994. Worn furniture, work out carpet,  mystery stains in the bathroom and a small refrigerator that was dirty inside and out and was only ""cool"", not cold. It was like walking onto the set of Hotel Impossible in the ""before"" phase. I was waiting for Anthony to pop out of the closet and tell me this was just a test.No such luck. Here you go:Dirty bathroom. Not last-guest-dirty, but a decade of wear &amp; tear dirty.The air conditioner is the loudest I've ever encountered indoors. The carpet is peeling up and is completely worn out.Mystery stain on the shower curtain. Bubbling and peeling wallpaper.The fridge - worst ever. Doesn't belong in a 1963 VW van much less a Courtyard. The door is out of adjustment and I had to push it closed with my foot. The bar opened at 5:20p one night. The sign says hours are 5:00p - 11:00p.No HD at all on the HD LCD television. Lame.Slow internet connection!  The PCs in the lobby ""business area"" are Gateways! In room WiFi: 0.36 Mbps download and 0.18 Mbps upload with a 47 Ms ping, BAD.However, every single person that works here is very very nice. They are courteous and professional. The valet crew sprints to get your car for you, the hostess in the breakfast area are super friendly and keep your coffee filled. I'm a Marriott Gold member, pretty loyal to the brand, But until I see that this place has been given a complete remodel I will not stay here on my Columbus trips.Where do I start???  No parking....??? How can you be a Marriott without parking....so you have to valet (which is costly per day) or you can park in a garage down the street that charges you to come in and out....what a rip off.The girl who checked me in (I want to say her name was Kaitlin), she was pleasant &amp; checked me in swiftly. My room was clean.  It was actually a little nicer than I expected.  I was pleased with my digs....I couldn't get the TV to work w/ my iPad...which was annoying...no Netflix for me.I wanted to wash clothes...Dan was at the front desk texting &amp; I could have sworn he was high....I was talking to him &amp; he seemed tuned out.  I needed soap for the laundry &amp; he took forever to get it...I was super annoyedOverall, my visit was okay...but I'm used to having the luxury of parking my own car...that would be my biggest gripe...Of the Courtyard Marriotts where I've stayed, this is definitely my least favorite. Good luck if you're carrying heavy pieces of wheeled luggage. You enter the lobby and have to go up about 10 stairs just to reach the elevators. I really don't know how you would get to the elevator if you're in a wheelchair. For what it's worth, there were also two small stairs in our room, which we found odd.Housekeeping is a disaster. We had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our door, and the housekeeper banged on the door at 11AM until we opened it. And yes, we were still sleeping. We told her to come back later, and instead, she left a signed note stating the reason why we didn't have service was because we refused to have service. At noon, right before we were ready to leave, I called the front desk and requested the room be serviced. ""No problem!"" an employee assured. When we left, the maid was down the hall, and I said, ""Hi, we're ready now for service. Can you please take care of room #____?"" She gave me such a blank stare that I then just walked on. My friend said, ""Good luck - it took me 20 minutes to explain I needed a trash bag and had to motion trash on the floor."" Given that we live in the USA and English is the most common language in this country, I really think maids need to be able to understand and speak English. Later when we arrived back in our room past midnight, the room hadn't been serviced at all - total fail.The air conditioner in the room didn't work as well as it should have. We turned the AC to the second to the last knobs for both fan speed and cool temperature (no numeric temperature available). In the middle of the night, I had to get up and put the knobs on the highest fan speed and coldest temperature available because it was so hot. Even with the coldest temperature, the room really wasn't that cold.There were two good things about this hotel. We had booked under a room block, and the hotel provided a gift bag of small goodies (candy and bottled water), which was nice. The other thing is that they didn't charge me for two days of $19 daily parking (just one day), so that was a pleasant surprise. Nevertheless, I probably wouldn't stay here again. I'd probably pick a hotel closer into downtown.I had two recent stays here for work. I chose this property for it's downtown location and the fact that it was the only Marriott property with rooms available at my corporate rate. Overall the hotel was very clean. Both of my rooms were clean as well. The staff was very friendly and (for the most part) helpful. Unfortunately all of the furniture and fixtures are dated and worn. The sheer curtains had holes in them in both rooms I was in. The power outlets on the desk lamps in both rooms didn't reliably retain any power cable that was plugged into them. While the valet parking was the best option (with the option to come and go as often as you like) the service itself was spotty. Sometimes they were outside. Sometimes they were inside. One time upon arrival I waited well over 5 mins for someone to even acknowledge me. Had the buffet breakfast not been included in my room rate, I probably would have skipped it. At best it was your average hotel breakfast buffet. Two mornings I had to ask them to bring out yogurt for the buffet and one of those times the waitress just brought me directly a single yogurt cup without even asking me what flavor I might prefer rather than replenishing the buffet. While reviewing my expenses for my first stay, I found that they had mistakenly charged me for breakfast one of the days even though breakfast was included in my rate. Upon check in for my second stay I brought this to the attention of the desk clerk. First, she tried to convince me that I had charged something to my room. I advised her that I knew I hadn't. She told me she would have to find the receipt and investigate the charge, but she ensured that there would be either an explanation or a refund by checkout the next morning. When I went to check out it was obvious she had done nothing about it as the clerk at checkout (a different person) was completely unaware. The checkout clerk immediately acknowledged that I had been mistakenly charged and issue a refund on the spot. They have posterboard displays throughtout the lobby showing the details of the planned upcoming renovation. Although it looks like it's going to be very nice I would highly recommend avoiding this property until after they have completed their renovation.THE GOOD: Our stay here was pretty much perfect! The location was close to everything so that was awesome. We were upgraded to a King-sized room located on the fifth floor - great start to a vacation! The room was clean, not at all old and decrepit (like mentioned in other reviews) and comfortable all around. The hotel is pretty old but they seem to be in the process of upgrading so it really doesn't seem that bad. Good price and great service throughout our stay too! THE BAD: Their hot tub was out of service which was very disappointing as that was one of the reasons I picked this hotel. OVERALL: Definitely worth a second visit!","AVOID.I stay at a Courtyard Marriott several times a month.  This location isn't one of the worst Courtyards, it's one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at.  There are several other downtown hotels in Collumbus - I would stay at any other place before I would go back here.  It is simply not up to the standards we expect of a Courtyard Marriott.My complaints.  First, this hotel is not wheelchair friendly.  No, I don't use one and I'm quite capable of taking stairs two at a time.  But I do have family members who aren't as fortunate and I notice when you have to climb six or seven stairs just to get from the lobby to the elevators.  And if you have any luggage, you will have to lug it up those stairs.Second, there are two elevators and one was out of service during our stay. We had to wait more than 15 minutes just to get on to a totally packed elevator (which was NOT fun - it stopped on every single floor) to take us to our room on the fifth floor.Third, in the morning, we discovered that the water in the shower did not work.  No, this wasn't just no hot water... it was no water AT ALL.  We called the front desk to complain and the clerk acted like it had never happened before.  Ultimately, the manager told us that several guests had complained about the very same thing that morning.  There is no excuse for this.Fourth, we called to have our car brought up from valet parking about 10 minutes before we left our room when we checked out.  Despite providing that notice, the car was not there when we wanted to leave.  In fact, the valet guys hadn't even received the order from the front desk to bring our car up!  We had to wait about 15 more minutes for the car.  That's a nice touch for paying $19.To their credit, the manager ""comped"" our room that evening and admitted that the service we received during our stay was unacceptable.  While I appreciated her accommodation, I would have preferred to have paid and received the usual excellent Courtyard Marriott service and style during my stay.In summary, this property is not to the standards you expect from a Courtyard Marriott. There are other choices within a block or two of this property.  Use them.Nice rooms, modern architecture. The valet service is convenient even though it's extra. It's better than having to go park somewhere and paying for it when they will do it for 21 dollars a day. Our room was nice and clean. The staff is hospitable. We walked right down the street to nationwide arena for the bluejackets game. It's a great location. We will definitely return.This hotel is in a great spot downtown. You can walk just about anywhere from here without killing your feet. The staff is polite and friendly. Parking is kind of annoying. I had to drive around the building twice to see where valet parking was. They have a very small sign, which is hard to see if you aren't familiar with the area. There is a lot of construction going on right now, which made some of the hotel extras unavailable (pool/hot tub etc.).The room seemed nice enough, although it could have used more cleaning. There was visible dust around the perimeter.I really have no complaints about my overnight stay in this hotel. I read the other reviews before posting this one and all I can say is that I am glad my stay seems to have been more pleasant that most. The location is pretty decent. It is in downtown Columbus and there really isn't too much around in the area. We were in Columbus for a concert and would be there overnight so that wasn't too much of a big deal. The hotel is in walking distance from many bars, restaurants, and venues for concerts and sports. The room itself was pretty roomy and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and there was a desk and a chair in the room. The room itself was very pleasant and I was okay being in the room before the concert I attended and afterward as well. The one thing that was odd about the room itself was that the sink for the bathroom was right next to the door. It was outside of the bathroom with the toilet and shower. But I wouldn't say that it made the room horrible to be in. It was just odd. The staff was very friendly and we were even able to check in a couple of hours early. Our room was ready and I couldn't have been happier. If i ever return to Columbus for an event, I won't hesitate to stay here.Why two stars? So you have a stroller with a sleeping baby... how do you get from lobby to the elevator? What if you have a twisted ankle and need to do the same? Well... you will have to figure out how to get up those damn stairs. Really really really stupid layout of the hotel! We are not talking some motel here. This is one of the Marriott properties!Rooms really need some refreshing too. We had a suite and kitchen cabinets were really dingy. At least the staff is really nice.When I see some of the photos of the hotel taken just 6 months ago I'm surprised at how different it is now. Everything, as far as I can tell, has been updated &amp; looks very modern. Kind of a mid-century look in a way. Overall no complaints other than shower not being hot. Sort went in &amp; out, as if there was some kind of conservation device installed.Clean and comfy, and a GREAT location near the arena district.  Staff was friendly and polite and helpful.  Only two nits I can pick:  (1) the beds, although super comfy, were very low to the ground.  Others in the bar were asking/complaining about the same issue and (2) the AC/Heater in our room was very noisy.I am writing this review to counter the other less favorable reviews and felt the . I am not sure if this is due to recent improvements or if this hotel has always been worthy of high reviews but I am very happy with my experience. The included free wifi has average speeds comparable to other Marriott's. The non-complimentary valet parking is an issue, however there is plenty of alternative parking and street parking if you are stretching your money. The rooms are clean, unique, updated (flat screens, a/c units) and adorned with wall outlets. My experience was very enjoyable.Let me start by saying this review is specifically oriented to the ""suites."" We booked 2 suite style rooms the weekend I got married and were extremely disappointed. The only additional space was a kitchen area. There was no extra living space and the bathroom was TINY. Also, my bridesmaids and I had our dresses hanging in the closet, not very heavy at all, and the closet rod completely pulled out of the wall. I will not stay here again unless there are no other downtown hotel rooms available.Can't say that this is the best hotel in the world, as it isn't. What I can say is it is a place to stay for the night. What is remarkable about this hotel is that is exceeds at being nothing special. For instance. It has internet, but the connection is spotty and I would often only be able to do things when I was ready to hurl my computer accross the room. Maybe I should have reached that idea sooner and my work email would have loaded a little faster. There were a few free things laid out in the bathroom when you arrived, a few things extra, but I really want to say a few. There was conditioner but no shampoo, there was a facial soap but no hand soap. There were suppose to be towels in the bathroom but there were just wash clothes and handtowels. I am a big kid and the hand towel was hummors but not terribly useful. The location is very downtown, but nothing is really in downtown Columbus. You need to walk over to the short north area (it is north but there are only average sized people there) or near all the art school people. Also the conference areas where really small. Which was great because we were a small group. I want to say something good about this place, but the bell hop, either misspoke or I got a little bit scammed as he handed me a card for a cab to the airport telling me it was 15 bucks. But when I presented the card and the 15 bucks I was told it was a different price. All in all, this is a place to say for the night when you have had such a good life you need to be grounded a bit, you have had such a good trip you need to switch it up a bit. Maybe you want to see if your girl is the one for your, you can bring her here and see how she acts. See if she makes the best of it or she complains the whole time. This would be the best place in the world for that. Also, they had water, but only from 2 pm to 10am. For four hours during the day, they didn't have any water. Imagine being a germ-a-phone stuck in the bathroom with no water...There are only a few musts for a hotel for me. One of the top is free flowing hot water. Unfortunately the water in my room never exceeded room temperature :( and after 10 minutes went cold. Maybe it was my room, 116, but it was wretched.The AC unit was awesome, however! The blinds let in way too much light :( so i awoke at 530am!The mgr was apologetic and did offer me something from the shop for my trouble, and for that they got an extra star.I guess I have high expectations of Marriott Court Yards. For some reason I was a little disappointed with this hotel. The service was okay and the room was clean (it passed my bed bug inspection) but something was missing. I think it was missing the pretty Marriott feeling. The hotel had dingy carpet in the lobby and in the halls, old lighting fixtures in public spaces, and very limited amenities. Honestly the hotel just lacked the fresh clean glow. Every Marriott I have been to have had that Marriott magic. Not this one. If you are staying here for the brand name, you will feel like me--- disappointed. But I will go over some of the positives- We requested a fridge for no charge, the room was clean each day we stayed, the hotel was perfectly located (it is within walking distance to Arena District and Short North), there was parking available (although very expensive). My advice to you- Stay here if you are getting good deal (or if you have ""points saved up""), if not maybe try exploring other options. This is not the worst hotel in Columbus but I doubt its even close to the best.The service provided by Shawntae, Jeanine, Seilda, Samuel and Ryan was great.  However, my bathroom in my room could use a huge amount of Tilex it was filthy and I found hairs in the shower that did not belong to me.   The doors are not secure enough for my taste.  It definitely requires some rennovation.One word: unacceptable.   Tired hotel.  Terrible beds and outdated bathrooms.   Has the feel of an old Motel 6.  Not at all what I expect from Marriott.If I didn't know better, I would be convinced that Marriott had hand-picked and gathered all their best staff from the entire Great Lakes region and put them into this Courtyard. Seriously, they're that good!We held a work event here and, WOW! This was the first time (and one of the only) in my career that I felt compelled to write a personal thank you letter to a facility for their stupendous service. Even our clients repeatedly commented on the excellent caliber of the staff.Need something? German's your man (anything -- he can make it happen!). Rather eat your breakfast outside the dining room? Nancy will box it up for you. Parking your car? The valet guys will smile and chat with you like they've known you forever. Need a band-aid? Yep, someone will drop whatever it is they're doing to make sure that's taken care of too. The only ONLY negative to this wonderful hotel is the building itself. A historic building, I understand, makes remodeling complicated. So perhaps once the renovations have been completed here I'll be able to give them the 5th star. But until then, the slow elevators and ""eh"" sleeping rooms where you can hear *everything* around you leave it at 4.This is a summary of the events that occurred while staying at the Columbus Marriott on West Spring Street: Water was turned off within 15 minutes after checking in. No warning. Glad I was not in the shower at the time. Called to have refrigerator put in room. Three hours after I make the call and return to the room, the refrigerator is sitting there unplugged. After I plug in the device it does not work. Replaced with brand new one. Before going down stairs for breakfast, which was now complimentary, I requested that my car be brought up within 10 minutes. Upon my completing my meal it was determined that it was not called for yet. On another occasion after the car was brought out and waiting outside, the valet was not there. After a moment he appeared with the keys. The desk lamp has faulty outlets to charge a laptop or cellphone. I inform the front desk just to inform them and NOT to replace it until my departure on Saturday. I return from dinner to find that it has been replaced. And by the way the lights flicker!You cannot make this up. Sounds like the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles.This stay at that Columbus Marriott has been the worst stay of any Marriott over the past seven months. I would have checked out tonight (my second night) to make this a more powerful statement but it is just too much trouble and I am looking forward to see what can happen over the next few days.The last straw: 0n 2/23/2012 the hot water coming out of the sink was at best ?warm?. After calling the front desk to inquire if there was a problem, I was informed that this has been an on-going problem. Done. It appears that the ?owner? does not want make an investment in his establishment to retain customers. The front desk manager called back shortly to inform me that 3000 points were going to be added to my account, even after I had informed I would probably be checking out in our first conversation. The gesture on his part was nice but he knew that it was not going to keep in from leaving the hotel.I hope this information will be used to improve the quality of lodging offered by the Marriott on West Spring Street.Update: 2/29/2012; those 3000 points have yet to show up in my Rewards account (holding at 305,000) No word yet from the GM AFTER LEAVING MESSAGE EARLIER TODAY. No word yet from regional office. No more business for Courtyard Columbus. Now where is that Hilton directory?Update: 3/2/2012 - Spoke to the GM at the hotel who fully understood my frustration and reason for leaving. I was informed that he was going to add an additional 7000 points (for a total of 10000) to my account as well as having just had the boiler replaced resulting in plenty of hot water. This being done, I look forward to a return to the downtown Courtyard in the future.Holy crap, Marriott, WTF?Room is musty and damp, internet connection is beyond worthless and I can't get any work done, and the heater/AC unit in the room seemed to be set either to stank hot or freezing cold.  Courtyards are usually great, but not this one - won't be staying here again.I've stayed here once for 3 nights, and I would say ""average"" is the best word to describe this place. The rooms are really small, compared to other regular rooms in other hotels. There is a small gym down the basement that can probably accommodate 5 people max. This place is only great if you're attending a convention at the nearby convention center, which is about 3/4 miles away.I come to this hotel 2 to 3 times every year to see the Columbus Blue Jackets play at Nationwide Arena.  It is a great hotel that I have never had one issue with.  The staff is always very attentive and helpful.  There is a parking garage just one block west at the corner of Ludlow and Spring that I always use as it is a $6 daily rate.  Even if I go to a Blue Jackets game and don't stay there I usually use this lot.  Parking around the arena of course is high around game time.  Room are nicely put together and updated quite nicely with newer beds and LCD TVs.  I always hit the in house bar before or after the game for a beer or cocktail.  The prices are reasonable, but it is a hotel bar so they are a bit inflated.  There is an outdoor pool but I never get to use it because it is always winter when I am there.  Get to Columbus and hit a Blue Jackets game, the Arena District for a drink (Barley's Brewery is close) and the stumble back for some shut eye.I am a loyal Marriott guest, but this CY comes up short.  The rooms have  air/ heat units built into the wall which was both noisy and you could hear the traffic on the street. The beds were also in need of an upgrade.  On a positive note, the staff was great - friendly, helpful, and courteous.",,,,"['catch', 'hotel', 'good', 'day', 'reviews', 'brutal', 'typically', 'properties', 'used', 'member', 'switching',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-columbus-downtown-hotel-columbus,Renaissance Columbus Downtown Hotel,3.5,$$$,70,"Couldn't have been more satisfied with my stays at the Renaissance in Columbus- Friendly Staff - Quick Valet- Location is right in downtown- Rooms were quietSometimes I would get a room with two queen sized beds instead of the 1 King requested, so that was kind of disappointing but not a deal breaker. Would definitely stay againI stay at this hotel 3 times a year for business trips and the outcome is always the same. While at first it feels comfortable, decor modern there are few things that make this place very uncomfortable after a few nights stays.1) it sounds like water is running all night. Not sure if it's because of the elevators or what but the noise is constant.2)the showers have a half door that make it impossible for you to turn on the water without getting your entire arm wet.3)housekeeping never does a good job of cleaning in the morning (fresh towels, replacing things ect) my bed was barely made this trip. I also did not have a single trash can in my room until I requested.I'm still giving the Renaissance 3 stars because of the staff- restaurant-bar- and front desk. Just wish they could get it right the first time!As a loyalist to Marriott, I take issue with this hotel being branded as a Renaissance. It is still has way to many signs of the old branding of the days when Ramada owned the brand, from the sign on the hotel, to some of the questionable design of the bathroom, and decor.This is not how I think of the ""luxurious hotel with upscale amenities"". First off, the room was dirty. Yes, I know that housekeeping doesn't have that much time to turn over a room, but massive encrusted stands on the bathroom door, sink, table side bed, and other common areas is wrong. It looks like they tried to remodel the rooms at some point, but they really just added the standard quick designs enchantments, i.e lamps, bedspreads, headboards, etc. The beds, queens, are shorter than what I would expect and the bed is more typical to a cheaper brand because it was a pretty standard mattress that was on the harder side.The bathroom was a throw back with half a glass for the shower and no actual door. The room I stayed in ended up having a door that would fold in half and was cramped. The price charged for this property is not worth the quality of the hotel.This was a nice hotel with SOME luxury hotel options. Beds were great but still has quite a bit of old style, low budget hotel. You have to pay for internet at $269! HowI have to say that the staff was super nice and exceptionalVery nice hotel but the internet isn't free, we paid 300$ for a room and don't get free internet. The parking is valet so if you don't wanna pay for that you will have to find somewhere on the street to park. The rooms are really nice though, beds are super comfortable.I haven't written a 4 star review in awhile, and it's definitely not going to be now. For 270 bucks this place is a joke. Cons: valet parking only 25 bucks each night. the room was dirty. It had a cup of beer still in the mini fridge. The walls are paper thin, and we weren't even by the elevator but this is not a place you want to stay if noise bothers you. The grout in the shower was stained like it hasn't been cleaned. There was crud built up around the perimeter of the bathroom floor was built up with crud. The toilets are attached to the wall and are comically low, like I felt that I was back in India. The decor was kind of Art Deco mixed with early 1990's. Pros: comfortable mattress and our room had a view overlooking nationwide stadium. Pleasant staff overall. 9 dollar uber ride to short north. And bar open until midnight serving snacks.One of the staff at the small restaurant they have there was snide and rude and implied racist tones and prejudice values. I don't know how business is done in Phoenix and I'm sure that doesn't reflect the whole of Phoenix however this man was clearly in charge of things and if a hotel, any in fact employs such a character you can be sure that I, nor any one will want to spend money there. I am sick of this attitude people thrown out at others. What kind of person works in an area that serves others and as someone who fights for the equality of others, I am disappointed in this company that is part of an esteemed company. Is this the sort of values placed in this hotel?I stayed at the Renaissance Columbus Downtown Hotel for a couple of days when I was in town for business as it was close to the client that I had to meet and we had a corporate rate for the rooms.As its name suggests the Renaissance Columbus Downtown Hotel is located bang in the middle of downtown and has a plethora of dining options within a two block radius. It's about 10 miles form the airport and a taxi can get you here for about $25. I had a rental car so had to fork out another $25/day for valet as that's the only parking option available here. If you are only going to be in the downtown area I would recommend that you simply take a cab to the hotel and walk rather than taking a rental vehicle.I had booked a room with a king bed but as they were out I was given a room with two queen beds for the first night. The room was good but you can see that it is dated. In-fact the entire hotel looks dated and can surely do with a complete make over specially considering that the average nightly rate is $250 + $25 for valet + $15 for internet + $20 for breakfast + tax. For this amount I would expect a much better property. Fortunately I had a corporate rate so paid significantly less than they rack rates at-least for the first night. Unfortunately my return flight was cancelled and I had to return here for another night when they extracted their pound of flesh as discounted rates were not available during weekends. They provide Aveda products in the bathroom which I'm not a very big fan of. I was hoping they would have Thann like other Marriott's but that was not to be. Another annoying thing was that the water pressure in the shower was weak. Apart from this all other amenities were standard stuff that you would find in any other hotel so nothing special to report here (steam iron + board, coffee maker, cooler, alarm clock, safe). Check-in was as smooth as it gets and there is a taxi stand just outside the hotel's lobby so getting around is also a breeze.The Renaissance Columbus downtown hotel served me well given for my requirements and I would use them again if I get rooms at the discounted rates.My husband and I are moving to Columbus, Ohio and stayed at the Renaissance for a night while we met with a realtor.  I've stayed at probably over 100 hotels in the last 3-4 years... and I can truly say that the service at this Renaissance is on par with high end 5 star hotels.  Pros:* The Gold member lounge is one of the best. Not only did it have an incredible view and pretty good food, Kevin, the manager, MADE our experience!  When he found out we were moving to the area, he gave us his personal cell phone and encouraged us to call if we had questions.  He was awesome!* Rooftop pool. Enough said!* Room was spacious and offered every amenity you would expect from a Marriott* Front desk service was exceptional as well.  They made check-in and check-out a breeze* The lobby area has some beautiful intimate seating.  Cons: * I hate paying for parking.  It annoys me that hotels tack on extra room charges (internet, parking, etc) after you reserved your rate.  * The hotel is located in downtown Columbus.  It's pretty central and easy to get to-- although there isn't a lot within walking distance.Bottom line:  This hotel is PERFECT for a weekend getaway OR a business trip.  You will not be disappointed.Staff great and lobby very nice (and atmosphere much nicer here than at the Hyatt).Rooms are just OK. Water pressure not great, and room cold and hard to heat (in fact, the entire floor was very cold). Pool outdoors and so only available in the summer. Didn't love this hotel but I'd pick here instead of the Convention Center Hyatt (about a 10 minute walk from here to the convention center).Very good restaurants nearby (G. Micheal's Bistro, Wolf's Ridge Brewing) and so if you don't need to leave the downtown area no need to rent a car (walk or take a taxi).+ friendly and helpful staff+ clean hotel+ the rooms are very quiet - the only drawback is the tv channel selection. It's not as good as the Hilton's in the area.Comfy bed, decent bathroom and satisfactory service. If that's all you are after for a hotel, then this place has you covered. Please note that they will rape you on WiFi costs. So ridiculous that it's something close to 15 dollars for 1 day of terribly slow internet. It was a joke. Also the forced valet parking was annoying as well. You don't get much for your money for the New Years Eve bash here either, though I think the party organisers are to blame for this and not the Renaissance itself.My stay at the Renaissance was good, uneventful, and smooth.  I checked in Wed, July 23-25.  There were 2 large conventions going on, which I partook in one.  The other conventions participants were rude (not all of them, but maybe half of them), which didn't help my stay there.  Besides that, the employees were always very helpful, friendly and smiling.  I requested a room on the floor of the pool (4th floor) because I was hoping to use it, but the water was too cold for my liking.  They did have a hot tub.  Valet parking only ($25)Small Refrigerator in rooms :)Tiny odd shaped bathroomsThe best part of my stay was the employees!!!As a Platinum member for multiple years, I have had the chance to stay in hundreds of Marriott properties. One property type I try and stay away from are Courtyards, for one reason - they often have doors that slam and are incredibly annoying to other rooms nearby.  This is not something I would expect from a quality property like the Renaissance!  I am not sure how costly or complex adding a door stopper would be, but the constant slamming of doors around our room last night drove us crazy!!Separately, the organization of staff at the restaurant is comical.  There was a long line at the front and NO host.  All the separate people in line were basically joking how ridiculous it was until someone actually went and grabbed someone after no greeting from anyone for nearly 10 minutes.  I am sure the hotel knows how many rooms are filled and therefore can translate that into the likely crowd at the restaurant. The interior of the rooms are fine...nothing special, though I do find it funny that the plumbing for the toilet is reminiscent of a factory, not a nice hotel...This is a nice hotel with a few quirks.  I stayed here for a week, and overall I was pretty happy.The room decor is pretty, although the room was slightly cramped.  They gave me two beds when I was travelling alone, but I didn't really care to ask for a different room.  There are lots of convenient outlets near the desk and night stand.  The in-room toiletries are a step up from the standard shampoo, conditioner, and bar soap; they also give you toothpaste, lotion, mouthwash, a shower cap, cotton balls, cotton swabs, and an emery board.  The bathroom door, however, is this weird folding thing that sort of gets in the way, but the area is also too cramped for a full size door, so I'm not really sure what else to do about that.  There is also a hair dryer, coffee maker, and refrigerator in the room.In-room internet costs about $13 a day, which has unfortunately become standard practice in a lot of hotels.  Be warned that if you use an RSS reader or similar program that tries to download information from a lot of websites at once, their ISP will block you and you will have to call to get unblocked, even though this is a completely legitimate activity.  The outsourced tech support people were both very rude and unhelpful in explaining this to me; I had to figure it out myself after I got blocked twice.  However, the Renaissance staff comped the internet charges for the rest of my stay because of the problems I was having with it, which is above and beyond what I expected them to do.There was a huge window in my room that is poorly insulated.  I stayed in the winter during a snowstorm, and I quickly realized that my plan of sitting by the window with a cup of tea and watching the snow wasn't going to happen because of the cold air coming in around the window.  I wound up having to leave the blackout curtains closed at all hours and crank up the thermostat to try to offset the poor insulation, and I couldn't sit in the armchair--it was next to the cold window, and the room was too small to move it anywhere else.  Especially for a place that claims to be environmentally conscious, this is really inefficient, not to mention made my experience a little less pleasant.  Proper insulation goes a long way toward conserving energy.Transportation was pretty easy.  Taxis hang out on standby outside this hotel, so it was very easy to get to the airport.  There are also several bus stops nearby.  There are a few restaurants in easy walking distance, but not much in the way of shopping.  There are also a couple of theaters nearby, which I wish I'd had time to check out.  One major drawback of the location is that many of the local restaurants close at 5pm, so getting dinner can be a little difficult.There's a little business center with a couple of computers, a printer, and a copier.  You can print your boarding passes for free, but otherwise you have to pay to use the computers.  The printer was running low on ink when I was there, and the business center wasn't stocked with lots of things that I would consider basics--I had to go to the front desk to borrow a stapler.The fitness room is well equipped, with treadmills, stationary bikes, and elliptical machines.  There was a bowl of fruit provided for a post workout snack.  The pool is outdoors, so unfortunately it was closed when I was there.The hotel restaurant was mediocre, but I covered it in a separate review.  I didn't pay full price for a room here, so I can't comment on the value for the money.It appears much more elegant than it is. It's all about the details! The location rocks, and the amenities were all pretty cool, rooftop pool terrace was nice, the teak furniture was amazing. Gym was something I would expect (without the sauna) at a $80-100/night hotel. Was here for a convention/business meeting with catering provided, none of the meals were impressive, and you had to go find staff to replenish the serving pans. Rooms were nice enough, the bathroom was a bit cramped, and the towels were scratchy as hell - like sandpaper. I had a good night's sleep on the king bed, and I did appreciate the view of downtown Columbus.The advantage to this location is close proximity to the Ohio State House, a genuinely gracious and helpful staff and a quick $7 cab ride to German Village district. Following usual Marriott guidelines, the hotel is quite clean and your standard room is simply adequate. Upon our March arrival with local outside temps in the 40's we found the room to be a bit warm but the air management system controls responded to our programming and cooled off to our satisfaction. The standard bathroom is small but well designed for the one person that will be using it at a time. Do note the interesting shower stall. In lieu of a shower curtain there is an attractive glass half wall divider that forces you to reach into the stall from the back to turn on the shower. Expect a five second blast of ice cold water until the instant hot water kicks in (TIP: cover the shower head with a wash cloth for the initial rush of water.) The hotel concierge has the entire downtown area information dialed in and was most helpful with the loan of an umbrella to a traveling companion caught short in an unexpected rainstorm. There is a restaurant on premesis (not recommended, see review elsewhere for Latitude 41).If ratings were split I would rate the hotel at 3.5, above average. The rating would be raised to 4.0 if Marriott would (a.) provide better cable TV programming (you'll only get local network affiliates, five channels of ESPN, Sponge Bob and fortunately CNBC and Bloomberg Business channels); (b.) if the hotel didn't up-charge additional amenities like use of the Business Center computers (Instead I had the desk clerk print out my airline boarding passes, gratis) or (c.) the room charge for high speed internet (my Android smart phone avoids Windows OS and decoded the server just fine, at no charge). Room taxes between the local city and state will add about $25 to your daily rate. This is the first Marriott property that I have liked. A few policy changes and this could be one of the top tier hotels in downtown Columbus.Visited Columbus for work -- in the midst of a ""Polar Vortex"" stretch.  There was just no getting warm in the hotel.  However with the negative double digit temps....I wasn't really expecting to be warm.  Historic hotel located in the heart of downtown.  I, unfortunately, did not explore Columbus that much -- as the cold kept me indoors.  I am grateful there was a nice restaurant with meals options at reasonable prices that I could enter through the lobby.  Pros:1.  Aveda toiletries.  Nicely done. 2.  Great shower -- just the right water pressure.3.  Friendly staff -- who didn't let the cold get them down.  Even the men working to greet you outdoors.4.  Internet cost was comped when I was not able to connect to it without having to call the help desk.  Cons:1.  No pillow options for those that sleep on their belly.  I am a sucker for the historic hotel details.   If I have to be in Columbus again, I'd be happy to stay here.I was up in Columbus for a soccer tournament and my club booked us at this hotel. We looked at pictures of the rooms and other parts of the hotel, and we were satisfied. But when we finally got there we noticed there were pros and cons of the hotel.Pros:-Beautiful Fitness Center-Comfy beds-Nice lounge and bar-Quick and easy check-in/outCons:-The bathrooms are very small-The valet is a little slow not extremely thoughI've always liked Renaissance Hotels and this one was no exception. My late check-in was easy and there was even a big bowl of bananas at the counter, which was nice. My room on the 21st floor was very clean and had everything I needed. The area near the toilet/shower/bathroom door was a little tight but aside from that, no complaints about the room itself. Well, unless you count the thin walls. I wasn't bothered at all in the night - the time I found the loudest was before noon the next day when housekeeping was opening and closing (which sounded more like slamming) doors in the hallway.  I ordered a pot of coffee one morning which was on the pricey side but room service always is - you pay for convenience!I heard that there is a nice pool on the fourth floor but I never got to check it out for myself - maybe next time. I am hopeful for another trip to Columbus in my future and this is exactly where I would stay!","I love the Renaissance. While the rooms can be small, depending on the type, the beds are comfortable and the customer service is top notch.  At night its the perfect place to unwind. I stay here often and the bartenders, security and staff have become family. All they have to do is make the bathrooms bigger and this would be a 5 star review.I could not be happier w/my stay at the Renaissance in Downtown Columbus. The staff really know how to treat their guests. From the time I pulled up to the front door to the time I left, this place was class all the way. The room itself was really nice w/big, comfortable beds and most of the amenities you could want. The restaurant &amp; bar inside both were hits (the restaurant specifically had a breakfast buffet I gorged on), and it's close to everything you could need in Downtown. 10/10 would stay again.My recent stay at this hotel was organized literally at the last minute. I've usually stayed at one of several Marriott-owned hotels, however I decided to be a bit of a cheapskate on my 4-day trip to Columbus. Big mistake. The hotel I originally made reservations at came with a certain bed bug infestation as well as plumbing issues. I had literally 10 minutes to jump online and arrange to stay at an alternative hotel (at my own expense of course. I'm waiting for AmEx to credit my account for that nasty place). So I came to the Renaissance Hotel in the middle of the night looking for a breath of fresh air...and that's exactly what I got. The front desk staff were absolutely amazing and the in-house restaurant was delicious. I've learned a very important lesson this week: You pay for what you get!! Don't be fooled by cheaper rates elsewhere.The hotel is dated and the amenities are terrible. Service is not what you come to expect at a Marriott property. The lobby bar lacks ambience and the wine list is awful.  Avoid this property!Was at this tell for a recent conference, and was pleasantly delighted. Their staff was incredibly friendly from the valet and bell staff, to the front desk staff, to house keeping. The lobby was open and welcoming, and the room was positively lovely, very open and with beautiful linen. Honestly, my only complaints are how the nice hotels piecemeal every thing (no free internet in rooms, no free computers in the lobby, no free breakfast, etc), and their restaurant. Their restaurant took absolutely forever; 90 minutes to eat a sandwich at lunch, and both nights, were ""reservations only"" which is a problem for a conference hotel with few restaurants accessibly near by (for someone with a disability), and only pizza places to deliver. Hotel gets 5 stars, restaurant 2.5, so I'll even out at 4 stars.I stay at a lot of hotels and I prefer Marriott properties (elite). Very rarely am I blown away by good service but it happened tonight. Service at the front desk was fantastic!  Will stay again for sure.This was one of the visits I wished my flight would cancel so I could stay longer. Not a grand lobby, but very comfortable and modern with old photos of past Ohio Presidents.Loved the room decor, smart and sharp, very comforting.Nice modern bathroom with a large sink and nice sized shower. The folding door was funky. What I disliked most about the bathroom was that one must completely get inside the shower to turn it on, thus, I was blasted by cold water. There is no shower curtain, just a 2/3 wall of glass and the shower controls are at the far end. Did NOT like!Also not a fan of the public rest room-style commode, with the loud flush. I was alone in my room, but was thinking, had I had a guest with me, there is no quiet middle of the night flushing going on in this room! HELLO, I'VE FLUSHED THE TOILET, WAKE UP NOW!My room had hair everywhere! The woman who stayed before me must now be bald! Long, black, wavy hair in the bathroom, on the floor near the closet, on the commode, in the shower, and a nest near the entry door. It was like someone's head exploded! The housekeeper must need glasses.Very nice staff. I didn't get to the work out area, but my room looked down on the pool from the 17th floor and it looked nice. I did notice street noise late at night inside my room, however, I do sleep with a white noise app, so I slept very well.There was only one outlet...located on the wall behind the night stand. For those who need a CPAP, it's not the most convenient. And if you need more than one, bring an extension cord.With a location 2 blocks from the Statehouse in the middle of downtown, it was very convenient. I'd love to return!A step above most Columbus hotels- comfortable bed, updated decor, nice lobby bar area, but odd shaped bathrooms?Beautiful hotel with very crisp rooms.  Not a huge fan of the location unless you need to be on this side of downtown (would prefer to be on the northern end of downtown).  Great service.I stayed here a couple of times over the summer for work. Out of every Renaissance I have ever stayed at, this is my least favorite. They need to update their rooms. They are aging badly. The bathrooms are like closets and had to request to be moved more than once because there was mold in the grout. You do have to pay for internet and parking but can get some serious deals through Priceline name  your own price.Nice rooms, expensive parking, but not bad compared to downtown hotels in other cities, that's for sure. They accidentally gave me two queens when I had requested a king bed. The front desk got me another room without delay. The rooftop pool is nice, great place for a fancy party.The Renaissance houses Latitude 41, but there's several other dining choices nearby on Gay St. Try the Tip Top dinner and drinks, and Cafe Brioso for coffee in the morning.I wanted so badly to give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, there were some major issues.Pros:-Great amenities. The pool and hot tub deck are beautiful. -My guest agent at the front desk was extremely welcoming and was working as fast as she could with wedding guests arriving to check in all at once. (Thank you, Ashton! You'd get 5 stars yourself!)-Aveda products in the bathroom. SCORE!-Valet service was fast and friendly. $25 to park ($17 for us as wedding guests), but that's standard for downtown hotel valet.Cons:-Latitude 41 is great, but pricey. So is the bar. We spent $40 on 8 miller lite's. Really?-My first room had puke on the lamp. Gross. How do you miss that?! (I will say I was immediately moved and given a 1,000 Marriott Rewards Bonus, so at least they remedied it).-There was a difficult guest at the front desk when I was trying to get my room changed from the puke room to a puke-free room. One of the front desk agents flipped out on her, screaming ""This is a 5-star hotel! You need to leave a credit card for incidentals!"", among other things. I don't care how annoying a guest is, the response back and the attitude the agent had was horrific.-For some odd reason, my hallway's rooms were not as nice nor updated as the rest of the hotel. My parents had a beautiful room and a lovely bathroom on the 15th floor... my 4th floor room (the non-vomit one) was clean but just not up to par with other rooms.-My shower... it was more like a drizzle. No pressure.-My room was across the hall from the storage closet where they pull chairs for outdoor weddings. Fine. But please don't start pulling them out at 7am and SLAMMING them on a Sunday morning, not to mention talking loudly with your buddies on wedding set-up with you. Too early, too loud, no sleep.-The wedding we were there for... decorated beautifully. But it had problems. One of the bartenders was rude and snatched a beer out of my dad's hand and told him to ""wait 2 minutes"". We had to wait several times as bartenders disappeared (my assumption is they were getting more liquor or beer, but shouldn't there be a runner for them, maybe?). Overall, the catering staff was not very polite or welcoming.Not a great experience, Renaissance.Wish I could give a half star! This place is so lame you drop all this money on a room and stuff and they have a sick pool so you want to come back to the hotel and just chill in the jacuzzi but the pool is only open until 11pm on a Friday! Such a let down.So I'm a Wolverine in Buckeye town and my gut tells me I shouldn't like it here... but I do!  I've only been at this hotel for a few hours so far, but I'm impressed... Friendly staff? check!Spacious, clean room? check!Bathroom amenities? check!Comfy bed? check!And from what I've read in previous reviews, there is a kick ass workout room too!  There's also something on the room service menu called ""Buckeye Pancakes,"" described as Valrhona chocolate, peanut butter, and maple syrup.  I'll be staying away from those as it's too early in the year (read: new years resolutions and baby weight to lose), but they do sound delicious!I think I found my home away from home when I come to Columbus!Good place. Conveniently located. Good bar and in house restaurant. Will stay again.I am a Marriott loyalist, usually stay at the Residence Inn which is just down the street (it's in an old bank building which is cool, especially breakfast which is served from the old vault), but Renaissance is better.  Club level serves delicious offerings for breakfast or evening; the rooms are very comfortable, especially the beds.  But the Lobby steals the show, especially if you are a road warrior like me and would like to feel at home when you are on the road.  Bar and restaurant (Latitude) fit the bill.Pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would choose to stay here again if back in the area.Upscale hotel, but the walls are paper thin.  You can hear people talking in their rooms from the hall so I should have seen it coming.  At 2:15 a.m. we heard a bang of the door and loud talking for 1/2 hour after that...and that sucks, you would expect more from such a nice hotel. Other than that they have Aveda products for soap, shampoo and conditioner, which is nice.  And they have a bowl of fresh banana's when you check in.  But for me, noise is everything, I would recommend staying elsewhere downtown.  That sucks because this hotel is in a great spot, right near the river to run, great restaurants.That one star is for the breakfast buffet staff and Valet. Friendly &amp; sweet, even if they do move slow...Everyone starts with 5 stars.-1 star for my room. First glance, very nice then there was no ice bucket, no bathtub only shower, the water temps varied from scalding hot to luke warm, but no place in between.-1 star for thin walls and loud housekeeping.-1 star for tipping house keeping and all they did was change my towells and make my bed. Not empy my trash, not clean the shower(but maybe they just didnt want to play in that painfully hot water)-1 Big Stinky star for the elevators and lobby stinking like viniger. They passed the buck off to the kitchen, but that whole 1st floor stink, stank, stunk! there was no attempt to compinsate any guest who complained. Free meal, late checkout? something? NOPE just ""yeah it sure does stink"" and a look like oh well we got your money..Not t mention the high wifi fees and parking fees. And nont bother paying for your incidentals upon check out. These money hungrey thugs will find someway to charge your debit card. Needless to say ill Never Ever stay at this travisty of a 4 star again.This hotel doesnt deserve to be a 4 star. Holiday Inn statusGreat staff.  Clean place, but very dated accommodations.  Can't swing a cat in the bath.","The hotel staff were exceptional. Kudos to all of them! The accommodations were functional but not remarkable. I found the bathroom to be very small with an odd bi-fold door that was very cumbersome. There was a very spacious living area in the room, but the work area (where I spend more time) was ... for lack of a better word, ""klunky"". The chair rolled backwards into the bed, the drawers on the desk, when open, required me to stand to the side or else I ran into the bed. The whole room arrangement was ill-designed. It may, however, have just been my particular room - at the end of the hallway. The bed and pillows were ok - I found the bed to be slightly uncomfortable. Next time in Columbus, I will try somewhere else.There's nothing really wrong with this hotel (my room staff were exceptionally friendly and sincere), but they price it like they're in New York, and when you step outside, you're only in Columbus. A number of people who were going to attend our convention didn't come because they couldn't justify the airfare plus the room rates. It was three times what we paid for much nicer rooms in Las Vegas, a town with as much or more to offer. If you've ever had occasion to use the facilities in one of the rooms, you'll appreciate the slogan ""The Renaissance: Where the prices are high and the toilets are low.""This is a nice hotel to stay in when traveling on business.  The people were very nice.  The room was very nice.  Nothing extra special.  But nothing wrong either.  I would stay here again.Attended a conference here this past weekend, and was impressed by the hotel and its staff.  The public rooms are attractive and comfortable.  Our king-bed guest room was clean, comfortable and fairly large.  The meals catered by the hotel were excellent, with very attentive service.  And the two group cocktail services were also without fault.There was a charge in the room for wi-fi (don't remember the amount, but ridiculous to have to pay at all), and also a hefty daily parking fee ($25 per day).  Hence the four stars.  But the overall experience impressed me, and I would consider staying here if in Columbus again.So I paid for the hotel for 12 nights via the internet--it was close to work--so it was a win-win situation for me.  Per their website, they are a 4 out of 5 star hotel.  I was impressed with the check-in, the workers were waiting outside to load items on the baggage carrier to inside the hotel.   There were about 3 to 4 people ahead of me to check in at the front desk.  The total check-in process took about 10 to 15 minutes: (from getting out the car and being checked in).  Their lobby is very modern, and near the elevators you have the restaurant inside the hotel called Latitude 41 (see their reviews on <a href=""http://Yelp.com"">Yelp.com</a>).  Since I was spending a load of cash already, I chose not to buy from their restaurant.  You can order up to midnight to get room service.  I was under the assumption that they'd have a small kitchenette with at least a microwave--however I was kind of disappointed--no kitchenette nor microwave to speak of.  You do get a one cup coffee maker, an ice bucket, packets of tea, a small refrigerator, creamer (non-refrigerator kind), sugar, artificial sweetener (Splenda, Sweet-n-Low, Equal), paper coffee cups, coffee lids, and a small personal safe.  The ice bucket was oddly placed on the top shelf in the closet next to the iron so I put it on my desk.  I choose to eat at Subway to not spend so much on food.  You can find them on Broad St (diagonally from Chase Bank), East Town Street, Grant Ave (across from the Public Library), or the one on State and High Street.  You have other options to eat at Lexi's, Custom Chef, and Mitchell's Steak House.  There's a Starbuck's, too, but since they give you coffee in your room you shouldn't need to go there.    You can venture out to McDonald's or Donato's Pizza.  Their staff can recommend other options to eat, too.    I saw on their website they charge for internet and phone (boo), $12.95 per day (from 12 noon to 12 midnight).  I recommend bringing your wireless card and magic jack to avoid these fees if you really need internet and phone.  I believe they charge around $12/day for parking, but I didn't pay anything for that due to no car.  You will get a ton of pillows (6), and a comfy bed!  They had a small, brown seat and a comfy red chair with a big ottoman.  I had a king bed, so I could see two people being in the room. The room comes with cable TV, also with jack to hook up other devices (DVD/blue-ray, game system).  They don't have DVD/Blu-Ray player.  That could be a negative if you want to watch DVDs/Blu-Rays--be sure to bring along a player for them.  The bathroom includes a unique/strange door--it folds in two, and a glass partition in the shower (there's no sliding glass door or shower curtain).  It served my needs, but I know some people would want a regular door and a sliding shower door/shower curtain.  I found that you can hear people in other rooms (I've found that common with other hotels), however this one was more so.  For example, I could hear people talking, opening up their dresser drawers--so that could be a good or bad thing for you.The check out process took me less than 2 minutes.  The workers were very friendly always asking me for assistance.Stayed for new years eve. Surprised by the garage fee and the Internet fee which were not disclosed to me before I booked. Plus the Internet was ponderously slow. The bed was uncomfortable and the room was not what I booked. Staff was super courteous but I shall not use this hotel again.Room Tip: Check the heat before you unpack. Mine rattled like an 80 year old all night!!!I came here with someone who was attending a conference at the hotel, so we had a really good rate that also included parking.  Said person is also a Marriott Gold member so I was the beneficiary of free Internet, and we were also upgraded to a corner junior suite.Upon arriving to our room, I was really impressed.  There was a separate living area and bedroom area with a door that you could close in between the two.  There was also a huge desk/work area, which was a plus for me as I was planning on doing work while my travel companion was at meetings.  I was expecting the bathroom to be small as I had read the reviews before we got here.  They were not over exaggerating.  They are tiny and awkward.  When people wrote about the folding door, I was picturing something like a bi-fold closet door.  This is not the case.  It really just looks like they took a regular door and cut it in half and put hinges on it.  As someone also said, the shower (there is no bathtub) has a glass partition that goes 2/3 of the way across the shower.  So you can't really turn the water on without getting in the shower and, if you're not quick enough, getting blasted with cold water.As I settled in, there were several things that just make me think they didn't really think about the design of the room...the bathroom door being one of them.  It was like they bought the doors and then realized that the bathroom is so small that you can't open the door all the way...so, hey, let's just cut it in half and put hinges on it and fold it up.  All of these things were a little annoying, but wouldn't stop me from staying here because in the scheme of things, they really are little.  First off, I loved the huge work area, but it made it so you couldn't really get to the window to open the curtains.  I like to have sunlight in my room, but it made it a pain to try to get around the desk to open the curtains.  Also, the desk was so close to the cabinet that the refrigerator was in that you couldn't really get into the refrigerator all that well.  The TVs (one in the living area and one in the bedroom) were in these built-in cabinets that the TVs JUST fit in.  They were kind of in the corner of the room, so it would have been nice to swivel them toward the couch or bed, but it was such a tight fit that it wasn't possible to move them.  The safe in the bedroom was in the bottom of the built-in in cabinet and there was no other shelf in there.  It would have been nice if that wasn't a total waste of space and was able to be used to put some clothes in the bedroom (no closet or drawers in the bedroom except two nightstand drawers).  When I get to a hotel in a city that I really don't know, I always like to look through the books they have in the room about the city.  So I looked through that and was excited to learn that there was shopping nearby at the Columbus City Center.  I got on-line to see what stores were there and learned that it had been demolished in 2010!  I looked at the copyright on the book, and it was from 2007; five years old!!  Anyway, like I said these things were slightly annoying but nothing major.I like to have a beer or two before I go to sleep, and I was nicely surprised to learn that you could buy them from the little store by the front desk for $3.25 (for Bud Light).  But even better, there is a little cafe across the street (Mata Cafe, 100 East Gay Street), where I got a six pack for $6.99.  They also had coffee drinks, snacks, and hot food items that looked appetizing.During the day, I could hear our neighbors conversations in their room just as if I were in there.  So far it hasn't been a problem at night.  I think most of the sound comes through the connecting door.  Luckily that is in the living room area.  The living room is in between the bedroom and their room, so we have a little bit of a barrier, and if necessary, we could close the door between the living room and bedroom and probably wouldn't have a problem.All that being said, I still think this is a really great hotel.  Just a few little things that could have been done better.I stay in a lot of hotels for work.  It's like my job could be staying in a hotel... I wonder if Marriott is hiring.  My experiences at the Renaissance define what good, comfortable, clean, and friendly hotel experiences should be.Everyone from the director of experiences to the housekeeping staff is smiling and will greet you on the property.  After a few weeks, most people I came in contact with knew me by name.  Of the 15 or so weeks I stayed at the hotel, I never had a single problem (except for one morning where the hot water wasn't working... that night, I got back to find a letter stating that  it was a hardware problem and they would either comp 50% of the room night (which makes no difference to me as a corporate traveler) or give me a ton of Marriott points... guess which I took).  The rooms were always spotlessly clean, smelled fresh (this is ridiculously important... so many hotel rooms do not smell good, are stale, or have remnants of smoke).  The beds were always comfortable.  The valets were always quick to retrieve my car.  One of the things I appreciated the most was the *incredible* gym.  It was probably the best hotel gym I've ever used, and it contained seven or eight treadmills, free weights, several machines, weight benches, ellipticals, and bikes.  Plus, the gym looks out at the pool... a little motivation to work out, right?  The location of this hotel is also great.  You're within walking distance to the short north (especially on a beautiful night) and some of the hidden gems of downtown (Dirty Frank's, Little Palace, Barrio, etc.).  The concierge at the hotel, Kevin, is an absolute delight.  If you're staying at the hotel for any length of time, be sure to introduce yourself.  He knows everyone in the city... everyone... and will have a recommendation for dinner to meet whatever mood you're in.I wasn't the biggest fan of the bar... maybe it just wasn't my scene.  I can tell you, though, that their Bloody Mary's are made from scratch and are absolutely phenomenal.  Either way, the Columbus Renaissance is a finely oiled machine delivering brand excellence for Marriott.  If I could have this hotel in every town I worked in, I would happily stay in it, time after time.Stayed at this hotel last week for a conference. Somebody mentioned that it's not near much to do as far as activities.  That's probably right, it appears to be geared toward people who are there for conferences or business. And after back to back workshops all day most folk either just want to crash in their rooms or go down to the lounge area and chat with friends before crashing in their room to get ready for the 8am session the next morning. It's an absolutely beautiful hotel though with rooms very tastefully done.  HUGE work desk/area which I loved with wonderful shelving to put my books and conference literature and other work I had brought with me.  The bathroom is indeed small and if I were traveling with someone, the bathroom nor the room would work for me---even if it were a spouse --nope!  But for solo business travel it was perfect.  The staff is wonderful, polite and accommodating (Restaurant staff is slow, but that's another review.) Now they do have valet parking which is a rip-off and internet is $12.95/day which includes long distance calls in the U.S.  That is definitely crazy, but remember, folk, this hotel caters to business folk mostly and once you turn in your bill for reimbursement it generally doesn't matter---the company pays for it.  However, working for the church, the Trustees would look at me crazy if I ordered $13/day Wi-Fi (and I believe Jesus would too!)   I bypass those costs and use Boingo which gives me $9.95/month Wi-Fi just about wherever i go (including most Marriott Hotels like this one.) I'm glad somebody else mentioned the strange 1/2 glass partition for the shower.  I actually thought that was strange as well but again, I travel solo and have no fear of anyone walking in on me. I asked for a late check out for 1:30 and they accommodated me for 2pm.Emphasis: If there is such a thing as ""cost-effective, luxury business"" this might be it. Remember....HUGE, beautiful work area for working and spreading out your stuff in front of an expansive window with a city view;  Outlets around desk area, next to bed and around the room for your gadgets. Super comfortable king bed for sleeping after working. Yes, it's a modest size room (who's in the room? you're in conference all day); very small, but tastefully done bathroom. Big comfy chair with ottoman and a bench area with cushions.  Huge framed mirror in room that will allow you look at your outfit from one angle and align the mirrored closet doors for another angle.  I don't remember seeing a gift shop on the premises -- another indicator that they are not catering to folk on vacation. However, housekeeping does have those essentials that you might forget.I would definitely return to this hotel.I was scheduled to attend a conference in Columbus for a whole week and decided to head over on Sunday and check out the city a bit early. I did the whole Priceline ""Name your own price"" thing and got a night at The Columbus for $80/nt plus tax.We arrived, valet'd the car and headed in. The first thing I noticed is that this hotel is gorgeously decorated. Everything is very modern and sleek. They have a large lounge area that is separated from the lobby and actually feels like a place where one could relax in (which is exactly what we did later with a glass of wine).The rooms are clean, renovated, but a bit small. Same with the bathrooms.I probably would be much happier with The Columbus if after sleeping for a few hours, I came to the swift realization that they have walls like paper. I could hear someone distinctly talking in the room next to me from like 1:30 to 2:30 and then was roused from sleep again by noises next door that were a bit more 'intimate' than talking. Hey, at least they got to enjoy their room.If I never would have had to realize their walls have no sound proofing, I probably would give the place four stars. For eighty bucks a night, it's still a steal. There is just no way I would spend upwards of $150 a night there, though.PS - Almost forgot: you have to pay for internet in your room. That blows.This is my favorite hotel in Columbus. I've stayed quite a few times and loved it so much that we used it for our wedding. The front desk staff are always very helpful and friendly. I really enjoy the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms. I've never had a single compliant. When we reserved a block of rooms for our wedding, we were offered the largest suite at a VERY discounted rate and it was perfect for getting ready. They had rose petals, champaigne, and dessert waiting for us after we returned from the wedding.  I would recommend this place to anyone! Great location as well!Location is good.  Rooms are nothing to write home about.  Fairly cramped, but clean and well appointed.  I would be depressed if I had to stay in all night.  Fortunatley, there are a lot of good restaurants and bars within easy walking distance (and the restaurant and bar in the lobby are fine!).  Parking fee is excessive.  And, as always, the fee for internet connectivity is positively obnoxious (I mean, it's free at the cheap hotels, WTH?).  If you need to be downtown, this place will do!The Columbus sets a standard for service that we hold all other Renaissance properties to meet.  We were very regular guests in 2007 - 2008 before travels took us elsewhere and were pleased to find (upon our return for NYE) that the quality &amp; service levels continued to excel.  The restaurant produces wonderful dishes (get the mussels via room service) and the lobby bar has wonderful spaces to allow privacy or great people watching.The smallest bathroom known to man and we had a suite,weirdest small fold apart door to boot. Couldn't  really tell the housekeeper had even visited much less serviced our room. Interestingly they have no suites with king beds. Yes,it's pretty cheap but there has to be a better choice in Columbus.We couldn't have asked for anything more!  Our wedding guests stayed here 1-2 nights and everyone at the hotel (our event coordinator, the restaurant staff, front desk staff, valet, etc.) were wonderful!  They made everything stress-free, which is exactly what the bride (me) needed while planning and executing our wedding!  I am so happy with everything and I would definitely recommend this hotel.  I also love how close it is to the Arena District and Short North.  It provided nearby entertainment for our guests while they were in town.  Thank you, Renaissance!Used this hotel for our wedding guests and ourselves. Very nice rooms with great views of Columbus. The Valet people were super nice, and the staff put up with a lot of crazy requests from me and my bridal party as we made bouquets and stuff. The restaurant there is nice, and of course expensive, but we knew that would happen. Really pretty lobby too.The Renaissance Downtown Columbus is conveniently located near many restaurants with in short walking distance.  The rooms are very nicely appointed, comfortable with all the conveniences expected.  I found the staff very friendly and helpful.I really like staying at this hotel when I come to visit our aging parents when we come to Columbus.  I really like that the staff is so attentive and friendly.  We always check in late and the woman (Sarah I think is her name) who has now helped us twice at the front desk is so friendly and helpful.  Even though it's near 11PM when we check in she is always cheerful and makes us feel so good after a long flight from San Francisco and trip from the airport.  She gives us great recommendations for places to eat and check out in Columbus.At the hotel they have an efficient work area with printing which we needed for some reason when we stayed the last time.  The rooms were perfect and the beds are super comfortable.  They have a great bar in the Lobby that was recommended by Sarah at the front desk and it is open late and the bartenders were very fun to talk to and  their food and beer was just great!Nice property.  Room was clean, modern. Staff was friendly and efficient.Pool on the roof was awesome , food was great, across street from capital building, confortable","Stayed here with a AAA rate of $99 a night -- a great value at that price -- friendly staff, nice rooms and a comfy bed. The parking situation seemed a little problematic -- all valet parking and it gets backed up (though the hotel didn't even seem too busy). All things considered (especially the price) it was a very nice experience.Not a business traveller hotel. Rooms are nice but hit or miss. My room had no desk lamp, no plugs at the desk. Had to plug my Phone and laptop in the bathroom.  Come on! Definitely not a great value for 197/night. Internet is 13/ day. Restaurant really sucks, really.I was not sure about staying downtown, but I really enjoyed The Columbus hotel.  It is completely renovated with modern updated lobby.  The rooms are beautifully furnished.  I had a King Size bed with down comfortable and a lot of pillows.  Very comfortable.  There was a modern desk overlooking the city, a settee couch and another couch chair.  They fit a lot into a small space, but it seemed to work.  It was nice that they had a refridgerator and coffee maker in the room The bathroom had a funny door that folded in half but nice updated shower area and bowl sink.  Very nice decor.  One evening, we did go to the pool which is on the 4rth floor.  There were a lot of people out and the water was cool.  The jacuzzi was packed, but it was nice to be outdoors in the middle of the city.  The lounge chairs were very relaxing.  The website says parking is $26, which I could see paying in NYC, but this is Columbus?  There is a parking lot about a block away if you want to save on parking.I travel alot and this hotel is a meh. It's in a difficult location - there's very little to do in downtown Columbus right now within walking distance. Everything closes early and is closed on Sunday. In-room dining menu is provided by an on-site restaurant called Latitude 41. Unfortunately for me there isn't alot of traditional, comfort-type food on the menu. Lots of items with truffle aolis, if you get what I'm saying. That's fine if you're staying for a weekend, but feels very limited if you're there for awhile like I am (2 weeks). There's also no indoor pool/whirlpool, which makes no sense to me as it's COLD in Ohio. The gym is nice, though. The rooms are basic and have the small bathrooms have a shower only. The rooms and lobby are very modern and nice and provide a fridge but NO MICROWAVE, which I really could've used.  If you don't need to be downtown, stay at the Hampton Inn in the Short North. GREAT value for your money, pool, hot tub indoors, coin laundry (YAY!) and tons of things to do and see. Right next to the amazing North Market.This is the worst hotel ever in terms of security!!!!! At 3:30am when I am half asleep I wake up to a security guard opening my door to a random crazy drunk person into my room because the man claimed to be in my party?! What kind of hotel lets strangers into your room without photo id???! This is absolutely outrageous and I dont reccommend this place to anyone. Dont leave your belongings in the room because they will get stolen when they just let.strangers into your room!! this is crazy!So I have been staying at this hotel weekly since the end of August.  It's an extremely nice hotel and the staff is very accomodating!  If you're looking for a great place to say that's affordable for business travel, this is the place!!  Give it a try, I bet you'll love it!  Oh yeah, pass on the restaurant, it's not the greatest.  Mitchell's is right across the street &amp; it's much better!!Travel to Columbus frequently and enjoy staying at The Columbus.  Good vibe, friendly staff and centrally located.  This is part of the Marriott family of hotels and just underwent a super renovation.I just got back from a 3-day weekend here for a wedding. Surely, it's one of the nicest hotels in Columbus. Apparently they just underwent a multi-million dollar renovation, and the rooms as well as the lobby and common areas were very modern, clean and beautiful ... but not over the top. The hotel staff were very accommodating for the guests and the wedding events. We were a rowdy group at times, and they still served us drinks with a smile. Great outdoor pool deck on the 4th floor, nice gym, expansive lobby bar/lounge. I have no complaints except that housekeeping missed our room on one of the days ... probably because I slept in too late though. We had a special rate for wedding guests at $109 per night -- a great deal.The best thing about this hotel is their rooftop pool and hot tub. Even if you don't swim, it feels good to just relax in the lounge chairs on the rooftop. The fitness center overlooks the pool. The rooms are nice and modern. The bed is sooo comfortable. No couch though. The TV is not flatscreen and has a lousy reception. There is a $11 fee per day for the internet in the room but its free in the public areas. There is no bath tub and the space seems kinda small.  Dinner service from Latitude 51 is excellent. The staff needs grooming though. The bartender was outrightly rude when asked for the menu and they weren't even paying any attention to us. Maybe because they had some corporate party going on which took up all their time. I had to cancel my reservation once while checking in because they changed the rates on me. They made no effort to retain a customer. The bell captain, amazingly, appears only when you are checking out (probably looking for tips) but never when you're checking in and could really use the help. I've never used their valet service but they seem nice and friendly.The Columbus Hotel is a great, high end, business hotel in Columbus' Arena District. It's easy to get to from 71 N (Cleveland) and 670 (Airport, Dayton) in both directions, as it's about a mile off of both freeways on the same street as the exit. I was there for a four day conference. The meeting rooms are very nice. The ballrooms are very spacious and great for whatever purpose you need. The lobby is modern and clean. The rooms were very comfortable, as they were spacious and clean. My biggest complaint was the bathrooms, which at first glance seem industrial. The shower has no door and only a partial glass wall shielding you off from the rest of the bathroom, which leaves you with no privacy if someone walks in, and it also feels awkward to me showering with a big open gap in the glass. The views were good from the 11th floor facing south towards the rest of Downtown. The hotel has 21 floors. Overall, if you need a hotel in Columbus, seriously consider the Columbus, as you won't be disappointed.",,"['satisfied', 'stays', 'renaissance', 'friendly', 'staff', 'quick', 'valet', 'location',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-points-by-sheraton-columbus-ohio-airport-columbus,Four Points by Sheraton Columbus Ohio Airport,3.5,$$,32,"Clean.  Comfortable.  Great location.  The room was very nice.  Large comfortable bed.  Large bathroom.  I stayed for two nights (conference in the area), mainly using the room simply to have a good night's sleep and to shower/dress in the morning.  I secured a good price.  The location was ideal.  It's fairly new.  It was clean and safe.  I can't really comment on the restaurant/bar area since I didn't venture into that area. I didn't even partake in the free coffee in the morning.  The common areas seemed nice. Decor and design unique and welcoming. The parking lot was convenient and spacious.  Only complaint: wireless internet was fairly slow.  I would stay here again if the price was right; on the other hand, there are many similar hotels in the Columbus area that are just as nice.Four Points is a nice place to stay... Clean rooms for sure. What's lacking are In-Room amenities i.e there were no refrigerators (don't bring those left overs back from that awesome dinner you had) no microwaves (to reheat those left overs) no safe (to lock the stuff up you don't want to take). Finally the biggest complaint was WIFI simply put it was Horrible and Unreliable. If your in Columbus on business and need wifi look else where. It was slow and dropped out repeatedly. This was a big miss on the part of this SPG Hotel stay. I'm sure our large company won't be using this hotel for anything again unless the above mentioned things are corrected.So many things wrong with this property.1. Internet is SO S   L   O    W  - unacceptable for any streaming, video conference, YouTube, etc. In flight wi-fi comparable speeds2. paper thin walls - can hear everything - the elevator dings, the very very very chatty guests and their kids right near me. Woken up many times last night.3. Coffee/tea maker - sitting on a shelf in a cabinet - you can't fill it with water without taking the entire thing out of the cabinet. Bad placement.4. Blackout blinds in my room didn't roll up so in permanent darkness. Called to have someone fix it - he came right away. Worked great that night - rolled up, rolled down. Came back from work the next day, broken again. Replace the cheap ass blinds. If basic use by a guest or housekeeping breaks it, replace it.5. Iron and ironing board - the board is  tweaked and not opening correctly. Iron has hard water deposits already.This place is a pass.This is a good hotel for both the money and the location.  Rooms and lobby/bar area are ultra mod and very cool- great bathroom and pretty comfortable beds.  However, even though you might sleep well on the bed, you won't once you are woken up by the constant noise you hear through their paper thin walls.  Making it even worse is that it is an airport hotel, so there are many people slamming doors and making a racket in the hallway at 5 am to catch their 7 am flight.Front desk staff was friendly enough, and the shuttle driver was very friendly, offering to help me scrape off my car when he saw that I was using a map to get the snow off of my car.  This is a great choice for a quick overnight stay to catch a flight- even with the noise issue the place is clean and convenient.This was a nice, clean hotel.  We stayed there for one night on our way to Chicago. Room was a good size. Staff were very friendly.  There is a salt water pool that is a good size and ranges from 3' to 5'. Would stay here again if in the area.We are Sheraton people--Starwood members. Whenever possible we stay at Sheraton properties. This Four Points was not good. Nothing awful happened to us, and it was clean, but for the money the Embassy Suites at this location (airport) is much better. Our room was small--Manhattan small--and the typically great Sheraton beds were not up to par. The sheets felt scratchy. No fridge, no perks for Starwood members. Breakfast was good--though it was free at the Embassy (where the event we were in town for was being held). This is a small hotel compared to the ones across the street. My kid liked the choloclote chip pancakes--other than that it was a ho-hum experience.All dishes were good, but I'd have to say the Quesadillas were the best. Burger needed a little help and the Jambalaya as well. Service was great! Hotel was great!I spent Friday night here after a hellish travel day from Texas that landed me back in CMH around 11:30 pm. Here are my thoughts a few days out:1. The place is very fresh and updated. Pretty modern place. I was a big fan of the bed - very comfy - so comfy I actually slept for 8 hours straight without waking up (doesn't happen often). The check in girl was very friendly and she literally just gave me the key right away. I got this hotel on a priceline express deal for $64 bucks 6 hours prior to my stay - not so bad.2. The coffee maker is a nice touch, but it leaks like hell. The coffee was pretty good. They don't have a lot of mixers/condiments for the coffee though, so use sparingly. Loved the burlap sack the coffee came in. Also, I was a fan of the free bottle of water next to the door.3) The bathroom has a really nice clean look, shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the actual shower (which is huge). That was pretty cool. There are also 3-4 hooks in there to hang your clothes on. While the bathroom had the appearance of being clean it was DIRTY. DIRTY bird dirty. Well, at least the floor. I put down the mat, took my shower and when I got out and stepped on the mat, it was black all over from dirt. There were also many long black hairs in the bathroom, near the sink and toilet... Those definitely weren't mine, as I am ginger.4) I really enjoyed the coffee in the lobby in the am... It was a nice pick-me-up before a two hours drive. Why don't all hotels do this?Overall, I would stay here again.... I would just request a much cleaner bathroom (didn't really notice it was dirty until the am).AHHHH!  After two weeks in a crappy hotel in Fairborn, OH, I get to stay here.  Great lobby area, beautiful rooms, wonderful beds and just a fantastic, soothing environment overall.  I unfortunately brought a lot of perishables and realized that the room didn't have either a microwave or fridge.  So sad.  Hint for the WIFI:Username sheratonPassword serviceFirst, the good. The room was comfortable and well kept. The bed was very comfortable and the heat was easy to regulate and not horribly noisy. Unfortunately, my shower had a clog and it took me 3 times reporting it to get it fixed. The food was not the best either. I had dinner and breakfast there and the only thing I slightly enjoyed was the oatmeal and their beer selection, for which the staff his no idea about. Front desk staff was great and very helpful and the fitness center was pretty good.Nice choice for a room by airport, for sure.  One major drawback: their walls are paper thin and you hear every single door slamming up and down the hallway as if it's your own door.  Stayed here twice and same experience.  Clean and comfy, especially the beds.  1 mile from airport.  Would not want to hang here for 3 nights but that's not its purpose.  Lobby with fireplace, very cool ambiance, and it's squeaky clean.  Recommend highly; modern decor and pretty friendly staff.I've stayed here only one night due to a scheduling issue with work and our normal hotel being booked up. Truthfully, I didn't even notice that this hotel was there. I pass the area every so often and I guess never really paid attention to my surroundings. I had a very pleasant experience here though. The shuttle took a little while picking me up from the airport, but not excessively long. The driver was really cool and personable.Once I got to the hotel, I was greeted courteously at the front desk and they had my room and key ready to go. Very nice lobby area with a decent looking restaurant/lounge area. Around the corner to the back, is the gym and pool. Look closely because it's tucked away back there. I didn't make use of the pool, but I did use the gym. Very large workout room with new equipment in great condition. They have two HDTV's up on the walls too. I watched Deuce Bigalow while running my laps on the treadmill, LOL!The room was great! Well lit, clean, and trendy. You can tell from the pics I took. I apologize for getting a little too trigger happy with my camera. I absolutely loved the bathroom. The light bordered mirror is awesome and makes your eyes do that music videon thingie where you can see shaped light reflections in your eyes. I pray I'm not the only weirdo to take note of this. I love showers with glass doors, but have yet to see someone solve the ""splashing water in between the door pane"" problem. Just put a towel on the ground, you'll be alright!The last benefit to this place... Jimmy Johns right next door!Highly recommend this hotel not just for a stay near the airport but also for a stay around Columbus. Can't beat the price for this level of accommodation. Close to the highways, quick access to the airport, Easton, and even downtown. The lobby, bar and rooms are nicely decorated and the staff are friendly and helpful. Free wi-if, heated salt water pool and great parking. I know where I'll stay if I ever need to come back.This is bar none the best hotel in Columbus for the price. And regardless of price, it is one of the best hotels in Columbus.You'll find everything you want here from an excellent staff with quick and friendly service to all the amenities- a pool, gym, a bar, and VERY nice rooms. I've stayed here once for five nights and will be staying again next month. The rooms are spacious, air conditioned, super clean, and have a very modern design. They essentially have ""relax"" written all over them. I also appreciated how nice the bathroom was for just $100-something a night. The lobby is also quite elegant and inviting. Even though the rooms are only in the $100 range, the whole place easily looks like it would cost $300 per night.It's also in a safe area with plenty of free parking. Less than 2 minutes to the freeway and you're on your way to downtown/ OSU, which you'll be at within 10 minutes. Yet you're not too close to the airport that you hear all the planes.Stay here and you won't regret it.Arrived at the hotel  at noon. Check in is at 3 PM however, at other hotels we've arrived earlier and was able to get our room. This day we had to come back 1/5 hours later. When we returned the room was ready. When the clerk signed into the system he did not put in for the 2 nights as we had booked and I had to go back down to have this corrected. The room was large, bright and very clean. The bed is alright for one night but after the second night I felt it in my back. They either need a thick mattress pad (because the one that was on there is more of a mattress cover) or a new mattress.  I felt there was not enough room to hang clothes. They did not have a regular closet but had a combination coffee/tea server, iron and ironing board and clothing wardrobe. No refrigerator or safe for valuables. There was a long table for a computer and chair along with some cubbies (yes, just like kindergarten) for clothes, socks etc. I did not like this set up at all. However, even being close to the airport the airplane noise was not bad. The gathering room was not set up for seating the number of people who wanted to relax there. I would recommend this hotel but not for an extended stay.I was not sure what to expect from this hotel.  Surprisingly, it was a hidden jewel.  Duran made sure I was comfortable.  I was able to check in right away.  The check out process was smooth as well.Conveniently located ~10 minutes from the airport, it's a perfect place to rest your head during a business trip.  I did just that for four nights on a business trip - worked 17 hour days so I didn't utilize anything but my room in the hotel.  Nothing else seemed to be nearby (except a Jimmy John's across the parking lot).Very IKEA-esque with modern decor and clean linesGreat soft beds with lots of plump pillowsBathroom is nice but you get wet when you turn on the shower!  (Poor design!)Thin towels were cheap, motel qualityYou can hear the planes taking off/landing overhead, but not enough to be bothersomeTwo free bottled waters/dayFree airport shuttleAll in all, a good value near the Columbus airport... (although maybe the prices in general are cheap like this in Columbus?)Omg. The best food ever. If you don't try this place you'll miss out. The food is absolutely fabulousGood location. Good price.My first thought walking into this hotel was, How are we able to afford this? Every inch of this hotel is amazing.This hotel is designed right down to the soap dishes. Everything has matching colors and designs, and it's lovely. The thought and effort in the design was unmatched by anywhere I've stayed. Our room was beautifully equipped and the bedding was fabulous, soft and warm. The set up of the desk for an office was genius and perfect for working from your room.The bathroom was beautiful, with an oversized glass shower, and lovely tile on the floor. The shower head? Amazing. The pool was small, but quaint and again, the entire place was decorated in such an excellent manner.I drank at the bar until midnight, and it was a nice time.","Overall, yes it's a 3 star hotel but for 3 star hotels......it's 5 stars.  I stay here on a regular basis and by far is my favorite place to stay when doing biz traveling in columbus.I wasn't here to stay at the hotel as an overnight, but rather came as a part of the Columbus Young Professionals who were having a meeting here. I was a bit worried about finding it (I'm directionally challenged) because my GPS couldn't find the address, but luckily Google Maps was on it and brought me right here.  Be on the lookout though or you might miss it..its hiding pretty well!From the standpoint of a meeting space, the hotel is really nice.  It is a fairly new place and therefore is well equipped for meetings.  One of the staff members there took us me on a short tour looking at the various meeting rooms, workout and pool facilities and this would definitely be someplace that I would consider having a meeting.  What makes it nice for those coming in from out of town is that they offer a free shuttle to and from the airport AND to and from Easton.  For someone who may not have a car, and coupled with the fact that there isn't much going on near the airport, that could be a big sanity saver!I wasn't thrilled about this place. Let's first state the obvious - it's miles away from anything else. There was nothing objectively ""wrong"" about the hotel, but so many things that felt wrong. As a frequent traveler, your hotel could really make a huge difference in your day. It could make you feel welcome and comfortable - closer to home - OR, it could make you feel like you're stuck in transit. This hotel is the latter. The place...smelled funny. It smelled like cleaning liquid. It was extremely clean but felt impersonal, empty. I mean, the floor squeaked it was so clean. I don't like it when the floor squeaks. The staff was nice, but not that friendly. They didn't make jokes, didn't make conversation. I didn't feel welcome; I felt like an overnight boarder. The decor was not bad, but every Four Points has cool decor - some much cooler. Plus there was that ridiculously uncomfortable hot/cold thing going on. The room was freezing. If I turned off the AC, it went from freezing to extremely hot. Overall, I've come to expect more from Starwood. Try the downtown Westin instead.we flew into Columbus to visit family so we had a slightly unique booking.  Our brother was paying for the room but we were paying for any food or other charges.  At checkout they charged the entire bill to my credit card and could not understand why that was wrong since the room had already been paid for.  Once I got that straightened out I thought everything was taken care of until I checked my credit card bill a few days later.  They billed me for my dinner on the night I stayed there and then again one week later.  I have now called 3 times and no one at the front desk is able to help me and the one person who apparently can help won't return my calls.  If you plan to just use one credit card this hotel will probably be okay for you, the service at the restaurant was good and the room was nice but they don't appear to hire anyone who understands customer service in their management pool.  With several hotels within walking distance of this hotel I would not stay here again just to avoid any hassles.Got stuck at airport due to lengthy weather delays late at night. Decided to stay over and take early flight out. Picked this hotel because I saw all the stars. I think over rated. Staff gets five stars. But the entire experience only three. My room had no phone. The shower leaked water to a well stained wood floor and the towels were exfoliatingly rough. Lobby was nicely done. Wifi is free and speed good. Bed was comfortable. Shuttle service to hotel was prompt. Van was clean. Not the closest to the airport. If ever here again under same circumstances would probably give another property a try. I dont think the rate was even that great. Did the job but not a standout.This location is clean.  It is updated.  It looks like something from an Ikea Catalog.  The only bad thing about it is the hours at the cafe.  They are only open for lunch and dinner so if you want something good to eat you have to drive through the ghetto to get it.  The showers are the only other thing I would rate bad.  The bathroom is beautiful (all glass shower which resembled the WonkaVator) but you have to jump into the shower to turn it on.  This means having a lovely stream of cold water run down your body for 2 minutes until the hot water decides to come out.  The staff here is beyond nice.  I had a problem with my room one night and they moved me without hesitating.I had to downgrade my star rating because there was a billing mistake and I had to email them 5 times in order to have it corrected. The last email confirmed that it would be corrected, but I still don't see it. This last interaction with them tarnishes my thoughts about this otherwise great hotel.I stayed here when I was flying back and forth from my hometown to seek out places for residence and for school.  I think for what you pay, this is a very clean and nice hotel.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating and a plus that it's right off the highway and near the airport.  If I had to stay at a hotel here in Columbus, I'd stay here again (please note that this is from a newbie standpoint who doesn't really know her way around Columbus.. even to this very day).Conveniently located near the Port of Columbus Airport, this Four Points is very clean and well maintained.  The staff was very helpful and shuttled us back and forth from the airport to the hotel quickly and efficiently.   If I'm ever in the Columbus area again, I will be sure to stay here.i haven't taken a shower since i left OH two days ago ... hmmm, too much? it's just that my shower was THAT amazing, i still feel so clean!*i went on my first business trip this week with my new company and we actually landed on this place because, after some quick research, we noticed they had a schwanky gym (we had some co-workers training for a marathon) ... and the other place we typically stay at HAS no gym. sooo, clearly a win-win. plus one to aim's new place of employment ... they REALLY get me. besties for life. four points is a fairly new joint in columbus - it's obvi with their bright shiny lights that could be seen from the main road; their UBER DUPER CLEAN rooms where i coulda eaten my dinner off the floor from** and keen attention to being green. however, their schwanky gym's two treadmills, elliptical machine and recumbent bike were a FAR cry from ""state of the art"" ... but they had TVs which is a major step-up from other hotels i've encountered. now, seriously, is it REALLY that weird that i asked my (female) boss if we'd be sharing a room together?*** since we're so cool i had this thought that we could stay up late talking about boys and painting each others' toenails.**** again, too much?* - right now, i use that term quite loosely. ** - not that i tried. *hangs head in shame**** - no, that wasn't meant to be dirrrty. **** - yes, i've traveled on business before.Do not eat at this hotel! Yes, the decor is nice, slick in the Starwood way, but the hotel is staffed by 18 year olds that do not know what they are doing. I am a Starwood Gold and this is a property that I would avoid. The food is beyond awful and with so many other hotels near the airport in Columbus I do not know why you would choose this one. I will never stay here again.Clean, comfortable bed. Restaurant staff friendly, atmosphere modern and comfortable. We used a meeting room and it was well maintained, equipment worked well and was in good shape, staff was helpful and the general manager stopped in to make sure all was well. A very good experience.... Plus free WiFi...

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-hotel-columbus-downtown-columbus-2,Doubletree Suites by Hilton Hotel Columbus Downtown,2.5,$$$,55,"I've stayed at this property several times now and never found it to be anything but great. The service is always excellent, the staff is friendly and is very customer focused. Of course it doesn't hurt at all that this property is only suites. The food is good, the fact they've got a nice restaurant, full Starbucks menu and room service make it so you don't have to leave if you don't want to. They've also got a great all inclusive gym.Certainly not what I expected. Time for a makeover at this hotel.  Room was large with a great view but also poorly lit with mostly  drab color everywhere. Windows were filthy. Furnishings were also a bit dated. Wifi was a challenging connection so finding things of local interest was especially tough as no guide to anything in the hotel or nearby could be found. Thank heavens for the Gideons. At least they did their job.  Hampton at least has an in-room guide that always tells me about the free breakfast, where I can get a pizza and other items of local interest. Our stay came with a free continental breakfast. We arrived at the restaurant reception desk and were NEVER seated. We had to find staff and we were told we could just sit anywhere. After we realized that the continental breakfast was little more than toast we opted for the up charge buffet only to find NO PLATES. We solved this by sticking our heads into the kitchen and taking some off of a cart. We filled our plates and had a seat. Halfway through our meal we were finally asked if we would like some coffee.  Coffee was good. The fact that we were so poorly treated at 10:00 AM on a Sunday is unacceptable. Like many downtown hotels this property is not cheap. Maybe it should be.The rooms here are very large, if you get a conrer, the rooms are enormous.The rooms are quite nice.Thre are issues outside of the wonderful rooms.  As described in my previous review.Bumping up the rating for the huge nicely appointed rooms.I was pleasantly surprised by the Double Tree . Considering the low yelp ratings I reserved rooms with low expectations. However, my room was clean, plush, spacious, quiet, and comfortable. I spent 4 days here on business and would definitely return. My only gripes were with the elevator system and lack of continental breakfast. Also, the workout facility is really top notch. Puts places like planet fitness to shame.Rooms are spacious. Staff is friendly. Wifi works well. The area around the hotel is pretty and it seems like a very safe neighborhood. I liked the warm cookie I got when I checked in. Note: no radio or device to plug in your Ipod was in the room. Breakfast service in their cafe was painfully slow and expensive.Had to place a $50 per night hold on our credit card for a 4 night stay for incidentals???? I have stayed at this hotel a few years ago and this new policy change did not go over well with any of us. Also had to hold the entire price of the room on our card even though she wouldn't let us just pay cash at check in. Our room that is supposed to occupy 6 can only have 5 people on the check in and we only received 3 towels. I had ordered a few requests for our room on their website and none of those things happened. Staff was nice but not at all understanding of our situation. We are here for a conference and I know they cater to that but seem unprepared.Hotel itself is very nice, nicely decorated and our room is pretty large, but I would probably not stay here again.Check-in was E-Z, no issue, except they fixed our A/C within 10 mins after we reported. When we checked, I paid $22.00 for parking and the parking garage only charge $17.00 for overnight! Be aware!!!!I had a horrible experience staying at a doubletree several months ago and was given a certificate for one night to give them another try. My experience was worse than the last time! Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill...I will never stay at another Doubletree again. This particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors. I could live with that ..the issue was the cleanliness and the service. The king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean. Stains on the walls, bathroom was not clean , shower still had hair in it! The bar in the restaurant is fine, if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn't know the first thing about making a drink. Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant. I was not expecting 5 star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible! The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon, stale bread and bagels, eggs were never brought out. We sat down, lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins! As if that wasn't enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until 6 AM . We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing, etc. about 3 AM. We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it. These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us! Sorry, will not be staying here again. I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one!This hotel is not what it used to be when stayed last in 2009.    Not what we expect from Hilton.   The good:  location.   Spacious rooms,  very comfortable beds.    The not so good.    The room was not very clean.    The glasses on the bar had what appeared to be dried alka seltzer in the bottom of the glass.   Lights in the bathroom were burnt out.    Toilet seat broken.   Towel hook fell off the wall.   Bath tub won't drain.  The couch very hard and uncomfortable.   We used the pillows from the bedroom.   Our Amex was charged $ 100 dollars after we checked in,  we only found this out by our email alert on that account.   We called the desk and it was explained it was anticipated charges on the room.   The must be physic.   Did not like that what so ever.   Okay only four more nights and we are out of here and won't be back.   Takes too much effort on our part to stay here.In reality, I would probably give this hotel 3.5 stars for various reasons. It is recently renovated and has a clean welcoming feel; but there some flaws that could be fixed. Pros-Large room size, especially corner rooms -quiet and tranquil -Wonderful full fitness center (racquet ball, spa, sauna, steam room, locker rooms, clean quality athletic equipment)-Friendly service-Central location in the cityCons-Expensive restaurant, food not worth the price-House keeping isn't could be more through (dusty furniture, no sheets for fold out couch)-Central heating/cooling isn't very reliable--as of March 2015--air that comes in makes rooms feel warm and stuffy. Staff states that the air conditioning doesn't come on until AprilOver all, it is a decent hotel centrally located downtown with great access to Short North, OSU, CCAD, German Village, and more.It's not worth it.  I spent $220 for a Deluxe Suite (per night). Probably the 2nd most expensive room that they have. 1. parking is expensive and confusing. 2. stale cold cookies upon entrance. They also claim there are no nuts, but there's definitely nuts mixed into the cookies. 3. I reserved directly with the hotel and told them 3 people were staying. Nothing was set up for 3 people. Water, cups, towels, etc...4. bathroom fan didn't work5. refrigerator didn't work.6. heater hardly worked. Woke up 2 days in a row shivering. (During winter storm Linus).7. No free internet.8. rude, unhelpful staff. 9. Place is old and needs to be redone/refurbished. This is the exact conversation I had with the front desk:me: ""Hi, just an FYI room 916 has a few issues. The refrigerator, bathroom fan, and heater don't work.""Man at desk looks at me funny. ""have you informed maintenance about this?""How am I supposed to inform maintenance? I'm the guest.So I gotta give praise where praise is due. Jim and his team have completely turned around my impression of this Hotel. We arrived and immediately were taken to our room which had a great view of the river, city and the Fireworks. The room was amazing and once we got settled, a bottle of champagne and desserts came to our room for our anniversary. Jim took care of our room, parking and more importantly  memories of our 17 year anniversary. What a great surprise tonight has been. Jim thank you and your team for your Hospitality.TonyGreat hotel, clean, nice rooms, nice view of river...no compaints with the hotel itself and I would stay again, but...it's one individual: ""front desk boy""We called 45 minutes early for check-in, he said room wasnt ready...ok fine, rules are rules at this point, I'm taking it.  But not once did he say, ""while you're waiting there's a Jimmy Johns next door, we have coffee over here at the table, we have water and pop for purchase over in that cooler, etc.""...nothing.   The whole time he was rude and almost like a bitchy gay guy.  He's short so you'll know who he is.We ended up leaving and exploring the City after that phone call and forgot the idea of checking in, showering after a 4 hour road trip, and getting settled-in.  So we checked in really late and there was a different guy who was so nice.  Checking in took less than 2 minutes...for real.My MAJOR problem is we were charged THREE (3) times for our stay and it took so long for it to clear from our credit card.  The same ""front desk boy/bitchy gay guy"" also checked us out so we know he screwed up.  And, yes, he was bitchy then.  Real Mr. Personality.  I called a couple days later and they said it'll take awhile to clear, and that lady was really nice. UGH!Get rid of that guy, please.I'm a longtime Hilton HHonors gold member, and this location is not up to par with others. It's not run down yet, but definitely shabby or well-worn. Water stains on the ceiling tiles in the hall, frayed carpet, the usual signs that either maintenance is not being kept up or a capital upgrade is needed. I requested extra pillows through the app three days before u checked in, but either the app doesn't work or this hotel ignores those requests. I found only one bath towel in the entire room so I called the front desk for more. 30 minutes later I still had nothing, so I called again. They acknowledged the original request and said they would tell housekeeping again (I'm not holding my breath). Usually I would just grab one off a housekeeping cart, but when I poked my head into the hallway at 9:30 AM, there was no one in sight. As a person who spends 40-50 nights per year in a hotel, I know that is very odd. No housekeeping making the usual rounds first thing in the morning?The only good thing I can say is that the suites are incredibly large, at least on the reserved HHonors floors.The rooms were large and nice, and I was able to get mine very cold which I like. The breakfast for elite members was awful. No eggs no hot foods. Not even a pitcher of cold water for people who don't drink juice or coffee. I'll find myself a better breakfast next time I won't be staying here.On my second day, I waited for 30 rings before the lobby answered. When I told them I was checking out they said ok briskly and hung up. Very short and rude. I went down for my lame breakfast at 6:22 and both the full and VIP breakfasts were CLOSED (they open at 6a). I mentioned this at the lobby. They said, oh we can open it for you. I said its 22 min late. Don't open it for me. Open it for all your guests. I am leaving now.My husband and I were on a business trip &amp; stayed here many times on our visits to Columbus. Their staff service is always great no matter how busy they are they still do their best to accomodate. It is always very clean which is a MUST for me. The lobby is on the 2nd floor separate from the main doors... really weird lay out. The parking is a little weird too. There aren't too many restaurants walking distance, esp ones that are open late. This review is for my most recent visit. This last visit I am giving them 4 stars but it usu. would be 5.When we checked-in my husband (he's a social butterfly) hit it off with one of the receptionists which scored us extra cookies. Great way to turn my tired traveling frown upside down! We later nicknamed her ""Cookie"". When we got up to our asssigned room we couldn't open the door. Seems as if it was locked? We went back down and quickly got reassigned. The week we visited there were multiple conventions and parades going on so they were super busy and I think the staff handled it as best they could. You could tell they were a bit overwhelmed because my calls to the front desk would go unanswered and when we did request for towels, etc. it took awhile to get them but no biggie. Seems they were short staffed. We booked our reservations through expedia and was already paid for. We checked out and had no charges to our room. When we returned home there was a charge on our credit card for our whole stay at Doubletree! Man, how do you mess that up? Unfortunately, that is a big mistake that didn't sit too well with me. If I am to be a returning customer I need to be able to trust the staff to take care of things like this no matter how busy they get. We have been calling between Expedia and the hotel and both firms have been transferring us all over the place. We finally got it resolved today. Keep in mind, even though we had difficulties all staff members we talked to were very courteous. And even though they remained courteous while frazzled, it seems they were short staffed. The staff we encountered did the best they could with what they were given and we really appreciate that. Having a leadership development background, it may be likely their staff is struggling in areas due to management issues but who knows!My laptop was stolen from the room and the staff did NOTHING to help. They aren't even apologetic. If you stay here do it only out of necessity and keep EVERYTHING in your safe!!My husband and I had a romantic city getaway at this clean, cool, and quiet hotel during the Rib and Jazz festival. I used 12,000 Hilton Honors points and $50 to reserve the room, and because I booked online I was well aware of the $22 daily parking fee, which included in and out privileges. Our room was a king 2-room riverview suite encompassing about 625 square feet, which I believe is their standard room. The living room had a sofabed, chair with ottomon, bistro table and chairs, large desk and chair, tv, and wet bar with sink, mini fridge, and microwave. The bedroom was separated with double French doors and had another chair with ottoman. There were plenty of dresser drawers in both rooms. We found the size of the room and the view to be luxurious, and the furnishings and decor were new and modern. We do tend to book Hilton family hotels, and we will definitely be staying at this Doubletree in the future.Let me tell you about my terrifying experience at this hotel. I usually come to Columbus twice a month and stay at the Hilton Hotel on North High street but that hotel was booked at the moment. So I decided to stayed at the Double Tree hotel from July 14th to the 18th. The building itself was bit outdated but has been kept clean. When I checked into the hotel on July 14th around 6pm, I got the vibe the front desk staff are not as friendly as the other hotels I've been to in the area. When I checked into the hotel, I realized the toilet in my room didn't flush well. I had to hold the handle down for about 10 seconds to flush the toilet well. It still worked and I'm very OCD about maintenance or housekeeping in my room so I decided not to make a big deal. Here is when it gets worst. It was July 16th, around 10pm. I was taking a shower with the music on. While I was still in the shower, I heard someone's voice. I thought it was next door, but I heard the same guy's voice again. I knew nobody would be in the room because I had the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door knob. I turned the water off and yelled ""hello??!!"". And the guy yelled ""maintenance!"". At that moment my heart sank to the floor because I was so scared. Imagine being a petite female in the shower and hearing a random guy's voice in your own hotel room. I yelled back at him to ask him to please leave my room but I did not stop hearing his voice. He was obviously trying to tell me something but I did not care anything but my safety at that time. (I don't understand why he didn't immediately leave my room when he realized he invaded my privacy) When I didn't hear his voice anymore, I heard the phone ring. It was the front desk to let me know that the maintenance was in my room because the water leaked to the floor below me. I was so shocked at that time I was shivering and shaking. I went downstairs to speak to the front desk. They apologized and explained that the maintenance knocked on my door once they received a water leakage complaint from the floor below me. When I didn't answer my door, the maintenance decided to open the door. I asked for the manager because I was still shocked and furious at this situation. They said the manager was not here at the moment. Which doesn't make sense to me because I thought there were night shift managers on site 24/7. Anyways, to conclude my long review. I will list everything that went wrong at my stay. 1. Privacy invasion.2. Maintenance guy - poor judgement of the situation. He should have left the room immediately once he realized someone was in the room.3. Front desk - Instead of calling me after the maintenance barged into my room, they should have called me ahead of time to confirm if I was in the room.4. Manager off duty - Does this exist? No night shift manager? If it does, the manager should have contacted me once he/she was on duty the next day to check up on their customer.  Obviously they don't care how their customer's stay was.I made sure to tell my story to everybody I knew in Columbus, OH to ensure they don't experience similar situation. My colleagues travel a lot for work and I made sure to tell them this is not the hotel they will be safe in. If you're looking into staying here, please think again.I like this Hotel a lot.  The rooms are huge and suite-like.  There's a kitchenette in every room, coffee pot, and huge couch. The bedroom has a comfortable king size bed and a great view of Columbus.  The lobby is several floors up and that's a bit of a pain in the neck but that's because there's a big Parking garage under the hotel. There's free complementary drinks and snacks in the lobby and the workers are very friendly. If you're planning on attending events at the veterans memorial this is the closest hotel you can stay at","My cumulative experience here, over the course of three different stays, probably warrants four stars, but three is fair. On my last stay, I arrived to an empty registration desk at around 6 p.m. It honestly felt like I was on that ""Hotel Impossible"" show as a secret shopper who found poor service. The front desk woman arrived after a good 5-10 minutes, wearing a jacket and saying she'll get right with us. She seemed annoyed that she couldn't relax after what I assume was a smoke break. She checked us in quickly but stiffed us on the cookies, which was par for her surly course.The rooms are incredibly large, but it took my husband literally kicking in the door to see that. The electronic key was working, but the latch was sticking. That fits with the decor, which is dated. Yeesh... this is sounding like a one-star review, which it shouldn't, because the rooms are giant, clean and updated in the important ways. That is to say, modern TVs and comfy clean beds. Older bathrooms but with good showers. Lastly, and importantly, it's cheap and a great location if you're doing any business in downtown Columbus. I just wish they'd make some updates to the rooms and maybe some updates to the staff.The worst dbltree i've ever stayed at.  Stuff falling from bathroom vent on a daily basis.  Rooms are really dated.Hotel and garage parking is laid out sort of weird. Hotel is very convenient to my work, that's all it has going on for it.  If there were another hilton brand nearby i would be all over it.$22/day parking! The weekend cleaning of our room was inadequate/incomplete. We had water flowing out of the vent above the shower head onto the floor and when I called the front desk they said we will make a note of it! Understaffed front desk could not help me print a boarding pass. Not a place I would ever choose to visit again.Just skip it.  Keep driving.  Find a hotel in another city if you have to.I was in a smoking room that smelled absolutely rank.  When I entered the hotel room, I put on socks because I didn't want to go barefoot--and I was so glad that I did!  The bottoms of the socks were filthy after only an hour of walking around the room--and I wasn't pacing the room or anything.  Perhaps most revolting, the bedskirt looked like there was blood on it.  The furniture was old and everything looked like it was from the 80s.  The room was very expensive (208 for the night) and, though the room was large, it skeeved me out.Downstairs, the hotel was very understaffed.  There was only one person working the front desk at any given time and only one person working at the bar.  Service at breakfast was also slow and the food was mediocre.Sorry folks. The management of this Hilton-based hotel is inexplicably inconsiderate, uncaring, and only out for himself. I was treated very rudely when an emergency arose and I tried to appeal to Joseph Jones, the manager, but he refused to respond to me.  I had to escalate the matter to Hilton Corp.  I have been a long-time Hilton Honors member and have decided to decline to stay at Hilton after this incident.  Staff  get orders from management...and all are rude.  Buyer beware.First time at the Doubletree Suites in downtown Columbus. We got one of the newly renovated suites so my review is much better than most of the others I read, who apparently got older suites.Amazing suite with lots of space to ""run around naked"" if you want to. No, we did keep our clothes on... or DID we?Was presented a warm chocolate chip cookie for each of us at check-in. OK, realtors use this trick at open houses and I'll fall for it every time! Free wi-fi and all the usual free shampoos,conditioners and body gels.I'm an environmental advocate who works hard to recycle as much as I can to save the environment. The Doubletree has small garbage cans throughout the suite that are divided in recyclable and non-recyclable items. Never saw that before!I would have given the Doubletree a five star rating if my shoes didn't stick to the floor in the lobby bar and the three bartenders each covered a specific part of the bar. They seemed lost - wandering from customer-to-customer and not noticing that we had been standing there to order a drink for almost 10 minutes before we finally spoke up to get their attention.Horrible! Small beds, couldn't get the heat to work properly, nowhere nearby to go for dinner. Will not be back.Unsafe.  Garage is haven for thieves. Food is taco bellish. Old hotel.  Parking outrageous. $30. Not very good for priceRooms are nice. Nice TVs, nice gym, and lots of space.Why two stars you wonder? Parking is expensive, no free internet and no free breakfast and worst of all the rooms are disgusting.My room had trash on the floors, chewed gum on the counter and clipped toe nails on bathroom counter... Completely unsanitary and smelled horrible.Management was nice to change me to a different room. The new room was clean but the bathroom still smelled odd. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as for $150+ a night you can find something way better! (Something clean anyway) the more I write the more I think they deserve less than two stars....don't stay here.The staff is very friendly and the rooms are decent, buy unusable Internet performance in this day and age is unforgivable.  Smoke signals would be faster.I checked in late the night of 6/23. Midnightish. I was tired after getting in after a long flight. Went up to my room and it was hotter than hot. I called downstairs to mention it. The person on the other end ""sighed"" and said ""we're are working on it, should be fixed soon"".Being that it was late, I trusted this would get fixed, particularly because the sigh was telling;  this was an issue and this will be fixed. It didn't. I woke up multiple times in the night, sweating waterfalls. Ever woken up in a hot room in a wet bed? Not a comfortable feeling. The next morning rolls around, probably 3 hours of sleep, none of it ""good"" sleep. I'm not upset at this point, just frustrated. So as I leave for work, I ask about the A/C. They tell me it will be fixed during the day. Cool, one night's hellish experience is over. Move on.I come back in the afternoon. 95 degree day, just walked from Nationwide Arena. Hot as all hell. Can't wait to get up to my room to feel the AC on my face. Open the door to my room........ hot. I call downstairs why trying to rip my clothes off to cool down. Ever tried that? Ripping off sticky clothes? It feels gross. They say ""we're still working on it, we have a 3rd party here fixing it."" Whatever. I put my clothes back on and go to dinner.Come back from dinner, guess what's not fixed? I call down again ""it won't be fixed until tomorrow morning"". Goodness gracious. At this point I don't even think they care. They are getting my money and they are happy. What they need to do is set people up in other hotels and pay their way. Or at least rent me a car I can sleep in in the parking garage. At least I'll have AC.Worst of all, the maids know the situation, and they refuse to leave bottled waters in the room after the first night. So here I am sticking my head under the sink trying to cool off.I stay in a bunch of Hilton family hotels, and can recommend if you're in Columbus to stay in the Hampton of the Hilton (proper).It was as if I was at a separate hotel from the other review that were negative. I have to assume that perhaps some folks have been out into rooms that have not been remodeled yet. Mine was huge, new carpet, new counters, Two giant flat screen televisions and a river view. It is a Shame because I was so nervous about the quality and it was awesome!Yes, parking is inconvenient, but you are in the heart of downtown! What would you expect? Valet would be a nice touch, but not something to complain about. If you are concerned, ask for room 310. You won't be disappointed.This is a two-star hotel masquerading as something nicer.I'm saying that as a road-warrior who spends 50-ish nights in hotels yearly.During a 2 night stay, nothing was quite right;  the entire hotel WiFi &amp; back-end computer systems went out for 3 hours one night - housekeeping simply did not service the room at all one day, the front desk people were somewhat surly - the 'guest help' line was never answered (just rang and rang), and overaly, it was just a very meh experience.The one plus;  the rooms are large, I'll say that.Next time I'll pick any number of other options in town over this hotel.I've stayed at the Doubletree Suites in downtown Columbus over 20 times in 2011 and 2012, and so it's been my home away from home. I've stuck with it, because the hotel meets all of my criteria: a Hilton chain with a large room, a full gym, and complimentary hot breakfast.Pros:Each room is a true suite, where the living area is connected to the sleeping area and bathroom by a French door. Each area also has two TV's. The rooms here are easily the largest I have ever stayed in.The hotel is connected to the Capital Club, which features a full-size gym. The gym is old and pretty modest compared to a 24 Hour Fitness, but is very complete compared to other hotel gyms.One side of the hotel faces the Scioto River, and offers a lovely view of downtown Columbus. If that matters to you, then make sure you get a Riverview Suite.Lastly, I've also stayed in one of the three bi-level rooms once here, which had a staircase, a bar area, dining room table, and an extra half-bath downstairs. It was quite comfortable.Cons:The hotel is old, in general, and the rooms are outdated. Aside from a LED TV, each room would look better suited for the 1980's.Most of the rooms have dirty carpets, and so house slippers are a requirement for a comfortable stay.The wifi service has a mind of its own, and can come and go as it pleases.The service is pretty basic here, the restaurant, called the Caucus Room, serves average food at best, and the breakfast gets old quickly.Conclusion:At the end of the day, if you're a Hilton HHonors member, then the Doubletree is a decent option. There is a brand new Hilton a few blocks north that just opened, but as of this writing, I have yet to stay there.This is a business hotel at best. Very minimal service, no fluff type hotel. I don't mind, since it was just one of those business trips; the rooms are quite spacious (though maybe could use a little renovation (the fridge and the microwave look a little worse for wear). I had a double suite, so there is tons of room (living room space, bar area, office area, bedroom, closet/vanity mirror area, and bathroom). They do have two TVs in the doubles which is surprising (both flat screen TVs too... probably the newest things in the room).Housekeeping didn't replace the toiletry items when they made up the room... but they were more than happy to bring an extra set of stuff for me to use. It's some variant of the Crabtree and Evelyn citrus and honey stuff which I like a lot surprisingly (I've never seen these at a Hilton). The shower was a bit on the old side and took a little finagling to make it work properly, but nothing terrible.The beds are comfortable as usual (Hilton generally does a good job here) and it is relatively conveniently located in downtown Columbus (across the street from the Supreme Court). The restaurant (the Caucus Room) isn't particularly great, but it does the job for the morning (you can see my review for that too). The gym has set hours... didn't get to check it out this time around, but you need to get a pass at the front desk.I'd probably end up coming back, but only because I have to... they do give crazy good cookies at check in though! (They are terrible for you though... so watch out :D)I have been going to HH honers hotel for a few years. This by far the worst hands down. From arrival to departure it was awful, employee Adrianne, Leniss, and even Joe the front end manager, their customer service is lacking. They have policies that aren't shared with the chain, and they can't even give wake up calls. The problem lies when you have seeming competent people not doing their job and having zero respect for the words HOSPITALITY!! I paid $140 a night for no internet and disrespect of management!! Spend your hard earned money somewhere ELSE!!Terrible.  Avoid at all costs.  Not much has changed since Frank C. reviewed this place last May.  Frank C, your review was spot on!  My room was very dirty.  The bathroom was especially gross and the bedding was drab at best, but I just about lost it when I discovered stripper glitter all over the place.  Sure, all kinds of things happen in a hotels and I'm not passing judgment, but I expect the cleaning crew to make it so I don't have to ponder the types of business conducted in the room I've just inhabited.  Lame.On my day of departure, I let the front desk know I was going to be checking out just at check out time, noon.  At exactly 12:02, some over zealous wannabe tough guy in a Doubletree uniform pounded on my door.  When I opened it, he immediately told me to get out.  He claimed I was trespassing and that they were gong to alert the authorities.  I'm no customer service expert, but as a Hilton Diamond member (their highest ranking) and as someone who is all of 2 minutes past checkout, I don't see the long term benefit of accusing me of criminal activity.  The front desk staff was proudly indifferent to my complaints about this interaction.  Some other issues:1.  The parking is lame as is the path to the lobby (down a urine-soaked hall way in the parking lot, up an old, dirty elevator).  The door knob literally came off in my hand on one of my expeditions from the garage to the lobby.2.  The food served in the restaurant is inedible.  Stale fruit, flavor-free mystery meat and other such delicacies served with dirty forks and knives.The ONLY good things about this hotel...in order1.  Hilton points2.  Ummm.  That's it.So I  thought I was really going to like the place when I checked in. the room was a bit dated but not bad. The Gym is very nice.  Then the nightmare happened. No water for my first day and I was woken up by drilling two days at 8 AM.  When I informed the front desk of these problems they said I could take a shower in the gym and that there ""is no drilling""!!!!!!!  I held the phone up to the room so they could hear the noise and then they said.."" oh,  we will check into that"" NOTHING was done.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  I travel a lot for work  and this was the most indifferent I have ever seen a staff.  No attempt to make it right.  No effort at points or any sort of compensation for the money I wasted trying to get a good nights sleep and to be able to shower in my room. The staff said if I had a complaint to contact corporate then corporate said I had to contact guest assistance then they sent me back to the hotel. IT has been nothing but a run around and I wish I had never stayed there... Oh and to make it worse... my wife got food poison from breakfast on the last day of our stay. Do not stay here. they don't care about you at all.I guess I'm probably more of a fan because we stayed here free on a won gift certificate, but still this hotel deserves a bit more credit than what has been given so far.It's just an older property, and has the same feel of older properties in other major cities. I had no problems going in or out of parking (also free with my stay), I work downtown so I generally knew where the garage was already. It's location is good for many things in the downtown area within walking distance. The room was neat and tidy, and came with some free cookies on checkin. Aside from that, like I said, a bit dated, but not out of shape. Overall a very pleasant stay for us.We stayed here for work and got a great rate!!! As a Diamond Hilton member I am accustomed to being treated well...I like the Double Tree chain as they are infusing millions into bringing things up to current standard through-out the chain...and I am a cookie monster. Love their cookies!Location--4 starsRoom size--5 starsBeds--5 starsBreakfast--2 starsParking--2 starsI rented a meeting room for our group for two days at $300/day...that was bad enough until I got wacked a 22% SERVICE FEE TOO. All I asked for was water service and I have to ante up $66 for that? nope!! They graciously wiped it off my billso I was a happy camper!Everything was clean and neat...some of the breakfast staff were really attentive (Carol) and the others were really bad...teeter-totter.The parking is not owned by the hotel so there is no ""comp"" for Diamond members...the entrance is not intuitive to the hotel entrance and a bit pricey for Columbus.One observation I had was that this hotel is centrally located to all the government offices and corporate offices in the downtown area but yet it doesn't have the appropriate higher-end feel that it should have. Its just a tad off the mark...I would stay here again until the new Hilton opens later this year!","Dirty and gross. Housekeeping made one of two beds, didn't vacuum. Sister-in-law's room had mildew, reeked. Stains and rips galore. Pretty sure it should be called SingleTree.Either I'm reviewing a completely different hotel than the others are who have posted reviews, or this place has had a major remodel since the last reviews. I only stayed there overnight -- I was coming in late and leaving relatively early, so I searched mainly on price -- looked for an inexpensive Hilton property downtown Columbus. I booked at the government rate, which was $80 -- an exceptional value for what I got.The location was great. I was on the 10th floor and had a great view of the Ohio Supreme Court building and of the river. It is within walking distance of many downtown amenities -- COSI, the Columbus Art Museum, and the Greater Columbus Convention Center were the three that I was most interested in. Check-in was extremely efficient, and the front desk staff were helpful. Parking was quite easy as well -- the entrance to the parking garage is on the side of the hotel, which seems to flummox some of the other reviewers here -- but the signage is clear and the garage easy to navigate.  All of the spaces allocated to the hotel are close to the elevator.  And the $20 per night parking fee, while not cheap, is reasonable for an urban downtown hotel.  The breakfast buffet was somehow free to me (I think it was because of HHHonors membership).  It was not exceptional, but decent and clean. I don't think I would have paid full price for it, but for the price of the tip it was great. The room (suite) was huge and very nice.  All of the furniture was newish.  The rooms were immaculately clean.  Nice bed and bathroom. The technology was good -- large flat-screen TV and free WiFi. I'm really not sure what else anyone would want out of a hotel.Don't waste your time or money here.  Go one block up to the Marriott Residence Inn.I had been looking forward to staying downtown for weeks. We had never stayed at a Hilton brand hotel before and entered with high expectations. In the end we left very disappointed that they were not met.I would like to thank Patricia for her warm welcome at check-in. We arrived rather late and were ready to get some rest. The large suite and view of the river were initially impressive, but unfortunately, the nauseating smell of marijuana detracted from any hope of a pleasant stay. I regret not returning to the desk immediately to speak up and hope that this isn't indicative of every room or location.Besides the smell, downsides included the non-working light over the vanity, ineffective climate control, and the milky, clouded water that each tap produced.  A ball of hair was left on the edge of the tub from a previous visitor and the only bath towel had a huge stain on it.The woman at the desk in the morning couldn't even be bothered to respond to the issues that we brought to her attention . Our first stay at a Hilton brand hotel was also most definitely our last. Overall: don't waste your money. There are plenty of other hotels in the area that can offer a much better experience for the price.Ok, where do I begin??... I in fact WORK for Hilton and this was probably my most ridiculous hotel stay to date! My boyfriend and I came up here for a friends wedding so we were here for almost a week... First thing that happened is their parking garage is not marked very well so we pulled around to ask if it was the right one and the parking attendant was less than friendly about it. The rooms were 100 degrees basically even though the thermostat was ALL the way down after wed been told by the front desk that they had been fixed weeks ago. Here was the main issue: construction. As an employee I realize renovations happen, but this was ridiculous. Woke up EVERY MORNING to drilling and hammering after being jet lagged. Bf goes down to front desk and the idiot moves us one floor up on the same side.. Long story short we end up moving rooms 3 times and chick at the front desk is super rude to my boyfriend. She said at some point (about the construction) about me ""well she's in the business, she should understand!"" Um yeah, I understand to an extent but this hotel is huge and you can move us farther away from the noise than ONE floor... The list goes on but don't expect to be comped for anything or upgraded in rooms... They just don't care unlike the property I work at. You think as a fellow employee they maybe would have at least wanted to make a good impression. I would not stay at this location again. The only reason I give two stars is for the nice renovated rooms and cleanliness.I checked into this hotel for a weekend stay in Columbus, Ohio for a convention and stayed only one night. So this review is limited.Pros:I love the decor of the hotel. The lobby is decorated with dark wood and nice tile.The rooms are very large. I was staying in suite with one king bed. The room had two flat-screen TVs and a great view of the river. The bed was decent but the sheets were a little stiff. The room had a large bathroom and overall was a nice surprise.COOKIES!!! GLORIOUS COOKIES!!! They have free cookies, all you can eat, and they are seriously the best cookies I have ever had. I ordered 8 the night I stayed.Cons: I had to wait 30mins for my room to be ready, after the 4pm check in time. The hotel was really busy, so I should't complain to much, there were two weddings and two conventions going on at the same time.This hotel nickels and dimes you like crazy. $20 per day for parking (with in and out privileges). No free breakfast, which is a killer for me, it is one of the reason I love staying at hotels, free breakfasts are the best.Overall the stay at this DoubleTree was not bad. I have stayed at better hotels and I have stayed at worst. I would come back if there was nothing else available in Columbus.Pros:* spacious rooms(we were in a suite and that can easily be shared by 5 people as the king bed is large enough to fit 2 comfortably and 3 if you're on a budget, and the sofa-bed definitely fits 2ppl)* very friendly staff members from the folks cleaning/re-stocking the rooms to the front desk to the bar and kitchen staff* very well situated if you're in town for work Mon-Fri - (there's a CVS &amp; Subway barely a block away)* good lord, the cookies (we didn't get any as we checked in, only when we requested them)* we were in town for a friend's wedding &amp; they held a brunch at the hotel in a conference room/wing of the hotel which looked and felt very glamorous and beautiful, but the actual brunch was ultimately just so-so &amp; overlapped a lot with the regular b'fast menu)* it seemed super easy to get get a cab called via front desk almost instantly* i don't watch TV for families that do - the suites have 2 of 'em - so no fighting!Cons:- breakfast is not included (this is the first time i've experienced this) but luckily enough there's a bunch of cafes again, around the corner barely 2 blocks away- the food was good, but nothing i'd write home about- there was a game this past weekend &amp; the hotel was slammed and there was only one elevator working between 9 floors (got maintenance anyone?!)- the sheets+towels were indeed stiff (i noticed someone else said this in their review, but to be honest wouldn't you rather have stiff clean sheets than softy dirty ones?!)- if you place/remove the appropriate sign on your doorknob they will come change sheets &amp; re-stock your bathroom supplies - but only if it's the right sign!- notice i said nobody actually cleaned the room (we had spilled chips on the floor &amp; crumbs were still there from the night before, which leads me to question how often carpets ever get cleaned, which just creeps me out so i take it back *shudder)Ultimately would I go back? - sure, but i'd do my best to find something with a little more personality, free b'fast, softer sheets &amp; working elevators, if not, the doubletree it is.I can't attest to price &amp; parking woes as I didn't pay for the room, which i guess means i don't technically have any right to complain......so i'm just Yelping out loud instead.DO NOT STAY HERE, THEY'RE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!  Terrible construction noise coming from, what seemed to be, directly above my head.  Then absolutely nothing done on the part of the hotel to try and make up for this inconvenience.  Everything was deferred to corporate, who would in turn defer it back to the hotel.  And in the end they provided no recompense at all, not even extra rewards points.  It was a cluster.  To top it all off, they accused my friend of lying about a credit card which was definitely stolen from her room while she was at work.  I travel with a large group of people, which I understand can be a challenge for hotels to deal with, but I've never seen it handled so poorly as it was at this Doubletree.  NEVER staying here--or perhaps at any other Doubletree--again.The Doubletree Columbus gets three stars for the spacious rooms but would otherwise garner only two. The parking is on the lower floors of the property and they charge $20 with in and out privileges. That said, you have to take an elevator 6 floors up to the lobby and change to the hotel elevator for rooms. The clerks were pleasant enough but not terribly professional. Oddly, the smoking rooms are on the lower floors. Hello? Doesn't the smell travel UP through the ventilation system? We had one river view room but the river was blocked by a building. The other rooms were, mmmm , ugly courtyard views. Our rooms were HUGE. There was a living room with a couch, comfey chair and footstool and a refrigerator/bar area. The bedroom was quite spacious but the bathroom was a bit small. There was a nice marble counter just outside the bathroom but no stool to sit on to make it useful. The room had a coffeemaker. We stayed over on a Saturday night for a hockey game and the hotel is convenient to Nationwide Stadium - only a 5 block walk. We did not explore downtown but it was pretty quiet on a weekend. Columbus seems like a nice little city and I'll be back when I have more time. The breakfast was standard Doubletree fare at the buffet. There is no sign mentioning made-to-order omelets but after inquiring, we found they do have them. The omelets are much better than the buffet food. If you get the buffet included with your room, take it but if you are paying $13.95 plus tax and tip, head out to the deli up the street. For the January sale price of $89, the Doubletree worked well for our group. If we had to pay much more, I'd explore other options.Not the greatest but not bad for business stay. Food at the bar mediocre but enable should be consumed only if you have no other options. Although, service at the bar was really good and friendly.WOW! what a shit hole! I will never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I don't even know where to start. Well, I will start by saying I had nothing to do with picking this hotel. We had a group of 100 staying at this hotel from Buffalo, NY, so this is where I was told the reservations were. For starters, finding the parking ramp sucks. Even though it is on the side of the building, there is two garages that go under this building. And why the hell is there no valet?? Also, when you enter the hotel from the street, you have to take a elevator up to the lobby. the elevator is from 1956. When you get to the hotel lobby and the floors, this is where you ll notice this is a shit hole. It looks like somebody took a bunch of furniture and carpeting and wallpaper from grandmas house. Also, this place is so dirty from the lobby to the elevators to the rooms. The rooms are Big, there was a living room with a couch old and very uncomfortable , chair and footstool and a refrigerator's area. The bedroom was quite spacious but the bathroom was a bit small and extremely dirty. There was a counter just outside the bathroom but no stool to sit on to make it useful. The room had a coffeemaker. We stayed over on a Saturday night for a hockey game and the hotel is convenient to Nationwide Arena- only a 5 block walk. That's the only thing it has going. Last but not least, this will disgust you so don't read on if you have a soft stomach....... Lift up the mattress, like The whole bed frame and mattress. underneath was so filthy and i mean filthy. Crumbs, dead bugs, dust, dirt anything you can imagine. Also, i took the sheets off the bed and the mattress and a huge piss stain...disgustingHUGE rooms.  Seriously 600 square feet is a huge suite.  Our two rooms were clean and well maintained but the parking is pricey and so is the restaurant.  If you stay here make sure you get something for breakfast before you're in for the night.OHHHH and I totally forgot....$9.95 for internet access.....when you can get it free at McDonald's now???  Ridiculous!!Great hotel.  Easy fast checkin, clean rooms, good TVs, good wifi, good bar with decent food.  5 stars.  The only place I will stay in Colmbus.Rooms are spacious since they're suites, but man this whole hotel needs a complete overhaul.  Everything looks so old in this place.  The carpet looks so outdated and gross looking.  If you've read my other posts on hotels you'll remember that complex I have about walking barefoot on the carpet.  nuh uh..Not gonna do it.  I was in Columbus for almost a year and I've stayed at this hotel for months only because I'm a Hilton status holder.  If it wasn't for that I'd choose another hotel in the downtown Columbus area.  So I'm moving onto the bathroom.  In some of the rooms I stayed at some of the shower stalls had ring around the tub or something.  I'm thinking dude what the hell took a shower in this tub today.  I was grossed out and and went back downstairs to ask for another room.  Since i've got high status with Hilton I got one of those preferred status rooms, and you'd think those rooms would be well maintained better, but I guess they're all like that or possibly worse.  I mean the staff  is super friendly, but the place isn't well maintained.  Don't even get me started with the restaurant.  They offer a free buffet for me and I head down one more and it's your usual American fair as I'm walking down the buffet line scanning the items and reading them out in my head, ""ok we got scrambled eggssausagebaconbreakfast potatoesyogurt, milkbut when I got to the fruit medley...fruit with a swarm of fruit flies flying around them...I'm thinking where did all these flies come from and how gross is this.  these guys were partying it up on the fruit medley.   If you can relate I walked right into this grouping of fruit flies and realized it too late before you take a couple in your mouth just like when you're walking outside and when your'e not paying attention you walk right into one of those little swarm of gnats and catch your mouth open.  That wasn't my idea of breakfast.  I was grossed out and left the buffet.  From that day I only ordered directly from the kitchen.  I never touched the buffet after that.  The kitchen staff are real nice people so I'm just conflicted why they had the buffet in that condition.  I mean granted it wasn't like that everyday, but I'm looking for consistency.  Unless you have status at Hilton I'd just try going somewhere else.",,,"['property', 'several', 'times', 'never', 'found', 'anything', 'great', 'service', 'always', 'excellent', 'staff', 'friendly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-m%C3%A9ridien-columbus-the-joseph-columbus,"Le Méridien Columbus, The Joseph",4.0,$$$,23,"Room - 915PROS: The WiFi in the room was fast and free for up to 5 devices. The room was quiet facing facing I-670. The beds, bedding and pillows were amazingly plush and comfortable. The 2 queen bed room was spacious. The spaciousness of the room was especially noticeable between the two beds - there seemed to be more room there than is typical which was great. The beds were modern with a wood headboard going all the way up the wall and half over the bed on the ceiling. On this ceiling part were two reading lights one for each side of the bed. There were 2 outlets and 1 USB port for each bed and the same by the desk. The Illy coffee in the room is great and the machine is easy to use - Keurig style. The curtains were sufficient to black out all light at night. I also loved the shower head - a big rain spout with great water pressure. The walk in shower was spacious too. CONS: The only bad thing about the room was the sliding bathroom barn style door which would not stay closed unless you got it in a particular spot. Since the door faces the side of one of the beds instead of the entry way this was particularly problematic. SpaPROS: The masseur, Robert, was great. I loved how he incorporated hot towels in the massage and helped me with various neck stretches. A 60 minute massage was $111 and a 30-minute was $58. His technique was great and he can definitely deliver pressure.  To start of the massage he asked me about any trouble areas and then gave me a couple of oils to smell, and told me their benefits, so I could make a selection as to what he would use. I also liked that after the massage you get 30 minutes in the spa suite if you booked an hour treatment and 15 minutes with a 30 minute treatment. There isn't too much to do in the suite alone, but there is a pretty awesome shower that throws water at you from above and all sides - about 9 different angles. CONS: Maybe it was just forgotten, but some music would be nice in the suite. Also I would like heavier black out curtains. The room ends with windows on two sides so the light from High Street flooded into the suite through the drapes. Either black out shades and mood lighting is needed or eye masks need to be handed out when lying face up. The 9 jet, 8'X11' shower could also use another drain - the 3"" circle drain got a little overwhelmed to say the least. NOTE: Even if you are a hotel guest, go first to the front desk to sign-in for your massage. Someone will then escort you up to suite 401/2 for your massage. Robert told me I was supposed to be escorted out after my massage, but when I finished with my 30 minute relaxation no one was around so I just left. OverallPROS: Overall the hotel experience was great and I would return here in a heartbeat. It really feels like a boutique hotel, but of course with the rewards/status perks of a chain. The front desk staff was friendly and always greeted us as we walked past it to the 2 elevators. Upon check in they provided good recognition of elite benefits/status and when passing the desk after my massage a front desk employee recognized me and asked how it was. The doorman always had the door open and was always friendly. Upon arrival he offered luggage assistance. The hotel location cannot be beat. You can walk right out the door of the hotel onto High Street in the Short North to shops and OpenTable's highest rated restaurants. This hotel is the perfect home base for a weekend getaway. CONS: Valet was very slow. It took them a long time to retrieve cars. The valet staff were very friendly and considerate people, but the length of time it took made it take awhile to get your car when you wanted to leave, and also made getting close to the hotel to a point where you could drop your car off take some time. The road in front of the hotel was often backed up with cars the valets had not yet taken away. Another oddity I noticed occurred when I was watching another guest print his flight boarding pass. This had to be done on one of the two front desk computers. So the guest had to come behind the registration desk and use one of the computers therefore cutting the efficiency of the desk's check-in/out ability temporarily in half.The hotel restaurant is The Guide House. See my positive review of breakfast at this restaurant.Gorgeous, bougie hotel in downtown Columbus. I stay here when I'm in town for business (aka I would never pay to stay here with my own money.... lordy). In the heart of the Short North (the Soho of Columbus, they say), this place is conveniently located right next to the Convention Center and awesome bars and restaurants. Everyone is nice and polite, will get you whatever you need, et al - typical bougie hotel.A few notes from a non-bougie, practical person like me... - The decor is so modern, it's almost suffocating and stuffy. The furniture is so square and the drawers and armoire open very weird, wide angles and hard-to-grab handles.- The outlets along the bedside table are behind the bed and up high, making them... kinda inaccessible. - The shower is amazing with a great huge shower head, but getting in and out has its own design flaws, and so does the handle to turn the water on (gotta stand and reach in very awkwardly while trying to adjust for temperature and not burn your goods?). - The towels are surprisingly harsh and the robe doesn't have loops to put the tie in??? So you're basically standing in your room, adjusting your robe and then it drops and you're buck naked (Go Buckeyes!). Weird feeling.- The pillows look luxurious, but turn to dust when a single hair lays on it.- Haven't eaten at the downstairs restaurant yet (The Guild House), but even the menu and the prices look uppity. Hello, we're in OHIO, why is a ribeye steak $35?? Come on now.All in all, although this is a beautiful hotel, a lot of the amenities and accessories make it somewhat inaccessible. Still, I shall patronize this place with the most glorious amenity of all - my corporate card.A lot of reviews say this is just an Aloft trying to be something upscale. I would agree but for the price, we paid 220 plus taxes, You are really just paying for location which is great with everything in walking distance of short north. This was $20 more than the Hilton downtown and was more or less similarly priced for the standard room.  Parking/ valet is $ 30 a night. It's the same price if you just left your car in their garage overnight. Again this is due to the location. It would be a nice perk if parking with no valet was free with your accommodation. For example if you were just going to leave your car in the garage and walk/or just give one free validated parking ticket!Everyone  from staff/guest services were great. The entrance has a cool, funky vibe that also has a  funky strange smell , something listed on many reviews that we read. But the decor is chic,almost to a point where it's forced. The room is modern, they kind of beat you over the head to make sure you know this, and was fairly spacious. The view is eh but its Columbus what are you going to do!  The room is loaded with mini-bar price traps so if you have kids make sure to put that stuff away! (Review up date: we got charged $11 from the mini bar after our stay and we did not touch a thing....beware its a trap)There is an Illy coffee machine with really cute cups, but kind of just a keurig. The bed was clean,as was the room, and very comfortable. The room has pretty nifty decor it screams Ikea but I loved it. The bathroom was fairly baller. I'm happy they watched any episode of HGTV and threw in a walk-in shower with some subway tile. The bathroom door is a large warehouse sliding one, again their designer is on that HGTV.  The upgraded rooms also have a beautiful bathroom, but why in the buns would you pay for that when the water barely gets to warm. This was the sad face. I was all ready for my walk-in subway tiled HGTV flip that house hot shower and that shit barely got to steamy. I was inconsolable. I thought maybe this was just during a heavy use time so I tried it again hours later.....and nope.  This is disappointing. I can get a hot shower at a red roof inn plus or literally any hotel. No I am being difficult because this is an  upscale Aloft. If I was at the Rodeway Inn I would be presently surprised. Overall this is a 3 star stay. Everything was okay. My price point for this would probably be $150-$200 for a standard room. The rooms are nice/clean, service was good, and location is great.  If you want to splurge and get that baller room just be ready for a lot of ""Okay"" with nice decor.I have stayed at this hotel twice when travel for business in Columbus, and I have no complements, service is great, rooms are spacious &amp; trendy.  Good Work Le Meridien.Stop in at Soul Bar at The Joseph &amp; see Jason &amp; Kristen!  Jason's cocktails are AMAZING!!Absolute great location. The hotel is upscale and modern with great finishes. The staff is absolutely amazing from the Valet to Front Desk. Everyone is very helpful and friendly.This is a cute hotel in a great location. The hotel was clean and modern. I loved all of the artwork throughout the hotel. My only complaint is that the room is not very sound proof and the valet takes a very long time to retrieve your car.We went to Columbus for a wedding and stayed in the Le Meridien because the shuttle to the reception was going from the hotel. When we checked in there was a large group that were going to the wedding checking in, but ours was the only room that wasn't ready yet for some reason. We waited approximately 20 minutes and were given our keys. We were happy to find that we were given a room overlooking North High Street, which probably is one of the better views at the hotel. From then on, our experience at the hotel improved.The room was clean and had nice toiletries. Unfortunately, housekeeping knocked on our door right before we were going to leave and, although we said we'd be gone in 10 minutes, they never went back to service our room. We also had an issue where the door locked us out with the latch at one point and the service crew had to assist us to get back in. The front desk staff said that happens all the time, so luckily it was a quick fix and we got right back in.We went to the bar both nights. The first night it was empty other than us and the second night it was packed with wedding guests. I don't think that they were prepared for that many people showing up, as there was only one bartender both nights and some people from our group left the second night because it was taking too long to get drinks.We went to the gym twice and both times we were the only ones in it. It had several treadmills and exercise bikes,benches, some yoga mats and weights. There were some snacks available (oranges and apples) and a water dispenser. Overall, the hotel was clean and well located. We would stay there again.I had the chance to visit The Joseph several times over the weekend, since my parents were in from out of town, and I told them they had to book a room there. The interior is so clean and modern, and there's some very cool artwork hanging up all over. I was actually expecting there to be more art pieces, but I'm actually glad it wasn't made out to be it's own art gallery. Check out the water bottle chandelier on the stairs going from the first to the second floor. Really neat. My parents were on the 4th floor, and the view from their room faced South and was one of the best views of the Columbus skyline I'd seen. At night time, it looked especially amazing. The rooms have some modern artwork as well, but I'm not as big into this as my mom, and I was more into admiring the huge flat screen TV. We spent a couple cocktail hours at the Soul bar down in the lobby. I loved that it was right in the lobby too, so that you could drink and watch people come into the hotel. You felt immersed in everything whether you were drinking at the bar or arriving for the first time. It was very lively. The Guild House is right next door, but you can also order some dishes at the hotel bar. Next time I'm there, I'll have to take a picture of the menu. My mom loved the house cocktails they made. I did have a Ginger one though that I wasn't a huge fan of.Everyone was working there was incredibly friendly, and the bellhops and valets were about as helpful as you'd expect at a hotel of this caliber. It's definitely not a cheap place to stay, but if you have some friends from out of town looking to spend some time in Columbus, and you want to impress, I'd definitely recommend them booking a room here.All I can speak for is the Soul bar and the  art gallery here, but they are both fantastic! As I walked past a slew of tiny overcrowded bars in the Short North, The Joseph was a spacious and beautiful respite from the chaos. There was plenty of open seating in the lobby which was available for drink service from the Soul bar. I ordered a cocktail for $10 and got a $6 craft beer for my boyfriend. The service was friendly, the atmosphere is top notch, and it was surprisingly not nearly as crowded or expensive as I expected. After ordering drinks, we were told we were allowed to wander around upstairs with our drinks and check out the gallery for free. This made for quite a lovely and affordable date night in a drop dead beautiful location.I'm solely reviewing the Soul bar and not the hotel. The atmosphere is really cool and hip. There are seats by the bar and two communal tables with additional seats. Lots of great cocktails to chose from. The back door is connected to The guild house.I come to Columbus a few times a year for work and typically don't love the hotel options...until now. This was my first time staying here and I have to say I was very impressed! Beautiful decor, friendly/attentive staff and a great bar menu. The icing on the cake was the card I was handed from the front desk welcoming me to the property. The attention to detail was noted and most definitely appreciated. I have a new home away from home in Columbus and can't wait to stay here again!!Very clean and modern.  Furniture and bedding all very comfortable. No exhaust fan and terrible acoustics in the bathroom, plus the door is sliding and metal.  So if your roomie has to go number two you might hear more than you'd like. On arrival we were given a room that wasn't yet cleaned.  Went back to front desk and it took way too long to give us another room. Cleaning staff walked in on our room twice without knocking.  Not cool. If you want to hang out in the Short North, this is your place.Way overpriced for the quality of room and services. Room is a Hampton Inn, nothing special, just overpriced. Paid twice as much for room service then most 4 star hotels...got half the quality. The only thing decent is location. The bartenders were nice and so were the check in personnel.This  lovely hotel only opened in January 2015 and not only has gorgeous and spacious rooms but also exceptional service and extra friendly staff.Huge and comfortable beds and very modern bathroom; complimentary illy coffee maker in the room. Will book again!I've spent about 120 nights in Starwood hotels now, and this is my favorite of them all.Pros:1. Location.  The hotel is on the only street worth visiting in Columbus.  All night life and most good food is within walking distance of here.2. The room. Tasteful modern furniture in the suites.  There's an Eames chair + ottoman in my room!!  Expansive floor to ceiling glass for half the room overlooking high street...beautiful!3. The shower and tub.  Both are great, and the wall in the shower room is a giant window that overlooks high street, so high street gets a show unless you choose to lower the shade.4. The wifi.  30 megabits per second.  The best of any hotel I've been in.5. The TV.  Not that garbage hotel cable you find everywhere.  It's a normal HDTV with a normal lineup (all the sports channels and HBO, not terrible Showtime or Cinemax).  The channels change quickly, just as with a normal TV.  This is what it's supposed to be like...why don't all hotels do this?!?6. The noise.  It's quiet.  Not the quietest place I've been, but you're on high street, so it's great all things considered.7. Food. Guild House is connected to this place, and it's one of the best restaurants in town.8. Drink. The bar downstairs makes really good cocktails.Cons:1. A little pricey, but you have to expect that.  This is probably the nicest place in town.  Parking is ridiculously expensive ($30/night in Columbus!!), so I suggest Uber if at all possible.  It's about $12 to/from the airport and way faster than if you were to rent a car.  This is the only hotel I ever choose when I come to Columbus.Probably the best property in Columbus, certainly downtown. They did a great job. Every member of the staff was genuine and went out of their way to help us. We stayed in the Executive Suite and had a great view of the fireworks at Red, White &amp; Boom. SW views are the best. The room was large and spacious and very modern. We travelled with a 2 y/o and a 2 month old. The crib was already in our room when we arrived. They also provided a list of nanny services. The location is perfect too. Surrounded by really good Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. Walking distance to Goodale Park and the Arena District. Get a sandwich from Press Grill. 2 huge complaints: the valet situation is an absolute disaster and detrimental to the experience. Don't rent a car if you don't need to. If you do, use a parking garage 2 blocks down. Coffee in the lobby is not free. Literally every $200+ a night hotel I've stayed in offers complimentary coffee.We arrived 1/2 and hour after our 3pm check in time. We were told that the room had not been cleaned yet. The guy at the desk was very nice and it was not his fault, but the wait was annoying.  The room had an AWESOME VIEW of the city! We were on the 9th floor. The room was nice, The bed is comfortable and the shower is nice as well. Overall the place is good, not sure 350 a night good though. Doesn't have the 5 star feel you'll get at other hotels, but Its new. Valet is a pain. Costs 30 a day and expect to wait 30 minutes for them to fetch your car.Awesome amenities. Great location and beautiful interior. Much better than the hiltons at Easton shopping center.First impression is that they have very attentive staff. Opening the door for you all the time, and when it rains they hold an umbrella over you while waiting for a ride. On to the front desk! The morning staff were great! Sociable, happy, and more importantly very well informed about local recommendations.  One of the managers also struck up a  delightful conversation about local recommendations. The foyer is well done decorated with marble floors, elegant furniture, and art work.  The room is very modernly decorated.  The bed and pillows were 5 star all the way. The shower was perfect with a valve that controls full range of pressure.  Room view was nice for thunder storms and aerial view of high street. The price, slightly over priced. However, they earn it with everything previously mentioned and location. Some of the best brunch, breakfast, and dinner places are all a couple blocks away.","Loved this hotel after my first stay.  Unfortunately during my repeat visit, the hotel used a heavy epoxy to seal the showers on one of the floors.  Hotel is not inhabitable however they didn't shut it down, notify guests, or provide alternative accommodations.  Rather a fully booked hotel of guests stayed and got il!!! Very poor management.  When we checked out, they said they've been sealing the showers one floor at a time for the past several weeks.  Why would they not do the right thing and close the hotel for several days to repair this issue without toxic fumes causing guests to become ill!I am an SPG Gold Member and this was my second stay in this hotel. My first trip this summer was a 2 night work trip.  I was so impressed by the location, staff, food, decor, cleanliness and overall vibe that I booked another 2 night stay for my family (including 4 young children) during my Christmas visit with my family.  I was a little concerned since this hotel is rather hip and new and wasn't sure that my kids would not be the best fit here.  I have to say that once again the staff was top notch and made our stay nothing short of fantastic!  The kids were greeted each time in and out of the hotel, often times by name by the bellman and the front desk staff.  We had connecting rooms, one room with 2 queens and the other with a king.  The accommodations couldn't have been more ideal.  We ordered room service and food quality and presentation was incredible.  The guild house, like most other Cameron Mitchell restaurants, did not disappoint!  Thank you to Thomas, the food and beverage manager, George and all the other front desk team and the bellman staff for another memorable experience, we will certainly be back!I travel weekly for business and I am a big fan of Westin hotels. Helpful staff - but all I kept thinking was it is an over-priced ALoft where they wash the comforter covers.  $30 a day for parking is ridiculous - even by DC standards. Switched to three different rooms - strong chemical smell in all of them that left me with a headache.  Overall - disappointed.",,,,"['room', 'room', 'fast', 'free', 'devices', 'room', 'quiet', 'facing', 'facing', '670', 'beds', 'bedding', 'pillows', 'amazingly', 'plush', 'comfortable', 'queen', 'bed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-columbus-downtown-columbus-3,Hilton Columbus Downtown,4.0,$$$,73,"I stayed at the Hilton in Downtown Columbus for 4 days 3 nights for a conference by my employer. The Lower Level is where the meeting area was held and it was quite accommodating for various sessions / sizes of rooms. The staff brought cold water to each table each session which was very nice.Breakfast supplied for the conference attendees was not stunning. while it was good, it was nothing more than run of the mill pastries and yogurt.I posted a separate review of the Gallerie Bar &amp; Bistro located inside the hotel which I did not have a good experience with.The Room: I thought the room I stayed in was fantastic. I was on floor 6 room 21. The only real gripe i had with the room was the shower door. There is about a quarter inch gap on each side of the door like in a public restroom stall. So water goes through and onto the floor.The hotel is within walking distance of many great restaurants which I was happy to try also.I would definitely stay here again.Sweetie had eaten at the restaurant here before, and it popped to the top of the list as we searched for a staycation/anniversary/babymoon splurge hotel.  Yelp helped- thanks everyone, your reviews are always useful!We parked ourselves, but it is probably worth using the valet ($24, instead of $20.)  It was a hike, and there are no handy elevators in the garage.The lobby is beautiful, check-in was superfast, and the service in general was great start to finish.  Our room was on the 7th floor, with a view of downtown.  The room was a little small, but plenty for us.  The decor was modern and comfortable.  The bed was firm (perfect for us,) with cushy pillows and comforter.  The bathroom was very sleek, and warm despite a tile floor.  Location is perfect- close to (and connected to) the convention center; right around the corner from the North Market; and a short walk to downtown or the Short North.  Plenty of great restaurants and shops nearby.  I would highly recommend it to anyone coming into town for business or otherwise needing to be downtown.Some negatives:  our room, on the south end, was far from the elevators.  Seriously, another bank would have been nice.  Plus, there were train tracks directly beneath our window.  Not super loud or frequent, but the trains were occasionally intrusive.  There was lots of noise from the hall.  And the shower took forever to get hot.  Still, it was a great experience.  Price was very reasonable for the quality.  I would recommend it (though hey, I live here, so I might not have much reason to stay here again...)I've stayed here twice, both times the experience was fine. If you can get a room below $150 it's in a very convenient spot. Ok pillows, a little flat. Mattress also OK... I would not want to stay more than three nights on it though, my back was aching for home by the time I left. Typical for a hotel like Holiday Inn but your expect a notch up in comfort here.My issues are mostly around the HVAC and staff.My room was freezing when I arrived, although the thermostat said 65-ish. I cranked it up to the max of 75 and I swear the system was blowing cool air. I am a cold climate person and enjoy cooler temperatures but even this was a bit much. The second day I return to my room and find housekeeping had shut it off completely. Cold again.The bathroom was ok. Flawed shower design which caused some leakage on the ground and either low pressure or a low-flow shower head made me wish for a little extra force in the mornings.The restaurant in the hotel was very forgettable for breakfast. Nothing I'd eat again. I will recommend the Italian restaurant on the corner from the Hilton, Martini, which has better cocktails and incomparable food.All in all an ok hotel experience. I think I got a funky room and some zealous housekeeping staff. Next time I may try the Hyatt across the street.Solid in every respect.First of all, it has a fabulous location. It's literally across the street from the Convention Center and in case of rain or snow, you can use the skywalk off the hotel's second floor. You are a five minute walk to the wonderful North Market, and within a ten minute radius there must be 25 restaurants and saloons. The area is safe with a lot of people out on the street, but I did see a few vagrants and panhandlers out there.The hotel is absolutely gorgeous- everything from the lobby, to the center atrium to the sweet Gallerie Bar and Bistro on the second floor accessed via a majestic spiral staircase. On the first floor, there is artwork all over the walls on the way to the conference rooms.My room on the tenth floor was spacious. Comfy bed, great work station, fast wifi, and a big bathroom with a glass shower and plenty of water pressure and temperature.The room had a few cool features, like a big hand painted mural on the ceiling, a nice radio alarm clock with an iPod jack, a Cuisinart coffee maker that makes two cups at the same time, and nicely marked light switches for the desk area, window area, and headboards. There is a full length seating area by the windows and the seats have built in storage areas to give you a few extra dresser drawers.  Lots of nice touches everywhere.  I attended a private reception in the Robert King Suite (a first floor conference room) it went very well with a cool bartender and great catered food.I'd definitely stay here again.After we landed and got our rental car we made our way to find our hotel. Using my phone as navigation it led me to the hotel but could not find where to pull in to valet the vehicle. Drove around the hotel twice where there was a lot of people walking around like there was a big event going on. Finally found where you pull into to park the car. The valet guys were nice and helped get our luggage out from the trunk. As we walk in I was amazed how nice the lobby was for it all looked brand new. I quickly noticed all the artwork hanging on the walls and the articulate furniture. I had already checked in online but still had to wait at the counter. We were given a room upgrade and made our way to the 12th floor.The 12th floor is the top floor and executive level meaning you have access to a private lounge that serves free breakfast and light hot food items in the evening. Free drinks are available and only alcoholic drinks are paid for. The food lounge items were excellent and got addicted to the bacon every morning. There is a large TV, sitting areas and desktop computers to use like printing out airline boarding passes. The person working there is very nice and friendly.Our room was a mini suite where one had a sitting area and the other a king bed. Two bathrooms but only one had a shower. There was no tub in this room. Two 50 in. TVs, mini fridge and lots of places to sit and relax. The couch was a pull out. We had an excellent view of Nationwide Arena and could see the fireworks at the Huntington Park (baseball stadium) next to it. The room has excellent lighting and comforts like the bath items. It was also very quiet at night. Our room was cleaned well and had no problems with the room. The bed was comfortable and slept well at night.On the second floor there is a nice bar and restaurant with more art on the walls along with more computer stations and seating areas. This floor also houses the nice workout facility and indoor pool and spa. I gave it a try where the pool water was chilly and spa was hot. Towels are provided to dry off. There is also a nice gift shop to sell items you may have forgotten or to snack on. They do sell the Buckeye candies in there. Along with the gift shop there is also a Coffee Bean also in the lobby level. There is a sign saying there is a bee hive on the roof to provide fresh honey. Below the lobby is a convention hall space for parties.A main highlight is the location where you can walk to the convention center, sports complexes, and numerous bars and restaurants around it.At the end we had a very enjoyable time staying here and will do it again when we return to Columbus.This hotel looks likes like a scene out of a James Bond movie. It's STUNNING. The architecture is mind blowing. The atrium runs right up through the middle of the hotel with beautiful views of the entire hotel. The staircases are literally works of art. Speaking of art...the hotel is full of it!I've stayed in my fair share of hotels and this is easily in the top 5 as far as most beautiful. And y'all know I'm a modern girl. I like clean lines, fancy food, and a good stiff drink. Here are some reasons why I think this hotel rocks. PROS:- Pool- Fitness Center- Full service bar- Full service restaurant THAT IS ACTUALLY LOCAL! - Comfy beds- The most comfortable pillows of all time (I seriously almost bought one at check-out)- Probably the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. Everything was spotless- TV has cable and descriptions on each channel. You'd be surprised how many hotels do not have this. - Great location. It's actually connected to the convention center! - Beautiful art work- Visually stunning to just walk around and look at. - Great customer service. - IT'S CHEAP! (somehow)CONS: - You can literally hear everything. And this is the ONLY con, but it is a big one and the only reason for the -1 star. Families and kids running rampant through the halls. The cell phone on the side table in the room next to you. The TV's. Once I turned my TV and I worked an event until 2am I pretty much passed out, but I can't imagine how annoying this would be if you weren't exhausted and staying here.Overall the most beautiful hotel in Columbus in my opinion and wayyyy underpriced for what you get. Also won the #1 hotel in the USA last year in the Hilton family of hotels. (At least that's what the bartender told me) Would definitely return! *Shout out to Mark at the bar for making me a killer Bloody Mary and for generally just loving his job. I adored his smile and the way he took interest in my stay. Love that.So overall it was an enjoyable stay. Well located between restaurants and downtown arena it was a good choice for us. However, for the money I dropped for a one night stay I expect a little more for the staff. They were professional but not friendly by any means. Granted we were here on a very busy Saturday night, but little things like how the front desk staff didn't take an interest in us, how I tried to explain that I tried to download the digital room key but it came up with an error and the woman behind the desk snapped that I had to be there at the desk to get the digital room key. Oh OK. My bad. The whole idea behind the fancy room key is that you don't have to wait in line to check in. We ordered room service and the woman was very nice but the food was o.k. at best. The whole reason we had to order room service was because when we tried to go to the bistro in their basement they told us the kitchen was closed....at 10pm...on a Saturday. Not, ""were on a limited menu, or sorry the kitchen is closed but our room service still has plenty of options"", just "" oh sorry the kitchen is closed"". The room was clean and safe and lovely, the decor is gorgeous and the downtown location is great, and that's all you're paying for so expect nothing extra.This is the most amazing hotel experience I have had yet in my life, who knew I would find it in my favorite city Columbus Ohio?  I will absolutely come here again.  Highlights:--staff:  here for a work offsite so using conference facilities.  Extremely responsive staff across the board.  Really friendly front desk.  Very professional restaurant crew.  --ambiance: common areas are clean and very cool.  Neat open second floor restaurant and bar area.  Hotel rooms are updated and uniquely decorated.  Small but well used space.  View of parking lot in my room but you can't have everything:)--food:  OH THE FOOD!!!   I am so incredibly impressed with the food I have had here.  Everything has been amazing from restaurants and from conference facilities.  I don't know how this wasn't first.  I haven't eaten this well over a 24-hour period, potentially my entire life!Doesn't look like much on the outside and the ridiculous parking price ($24 a day I think) makes me sad.  Also some hotel rooms have inward view of lobby and I am sad for anyone in those rooms.Overall HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for your next trip to Columbus, conference, wedding, party, Etc.Just stayed here for 3 nights. Very nice hotel. Clean. Quiet. &amp; close to good restaurants. Rooms are kinda small, &amp; pillows were awful! (I hate down pillows) but if you like that kind of thing, then you're good. Mark at the bar is fantastic. &amp; if you are there you have to try the bourbon infused with peaches &amp; pecans. Sounds weird but it's seriously so good! &amp; I don't drink bourbon! I would for sure stay here again. The food at the restaurant sounded gross so I never ate there. Martini modern Italian next door is a must &amp; also the north market next door is a must!This hotel is in a great location, and is seriously beautiful on the inside. I didn't even mind that the only window in my room faced the atrium and not outside. The second floor atrium is really cool - full of lots of comfortable places to sit and relax, as well as the beautiful Gallerie Bar and Bistro. There is also an indoor swimming pool on that level.Everyone I encountered at the Hilton was extremely friendly, especially the employees at the in-house Coffee Bean stand. The only thing I found confounding is the questionable housekeeping of the room I was staying in. You'll have to take my word for it when I say that I'm not one to complain about hotel room cleanliness. For example, upon walking in to the room for the first time, it smelled bad...really bad. I figured the previous guest may have thrown away a poopy diaper or something, and the smell lingered. Well, three full days later, the smell remained, and it took my by surprise every time I entered the room. That might just be a plumbing issue.The housekeeping was okay, but again: not to the standards you might expect from a Hilton. For instance, every time I got back to my room, the toilet seat was left up. One time, the toilet seat was left up AND the blow dryer was still plugged in, and had fallen into the sink. Neither is a big deal - but I have a weird tendency to not flip the bathroom light on sometimes, if there is enough light coming in through the hallway (peeing with the door open is an inexplicable luxury of living alone). So.... I didn't fall into the toilet, nor did I electrocute myself. But it was weird. The complimentary water bottles in the room were nice, but were never replenished. Here's the thing: I cannot stand entitled, smug people who complain about weird minutiae, and I NEVER want to be like that. None of these issues were worth bringing to anyone's attention while I was there, and I'm not even sure why I'm even bringing it up now. I don't know. Finally, I did not order room service, but I thought about it. It was the first business hotel I've stayed in that had reasonable prices for room service. All in all, I would definitely stay again... hopefully in a non-poopy room.The reason I'm a fan is because of it's location!  They are right where you want to be for anything in the area and c'mon! Right next door to the North Market?  We stayed there recently for a convention in the convention center and it was nice to just walk across High Street in the walkway and not have to deal with the rain and cold that was happening at the time.The hotel itself is beautiful and great for events like weddings etc.  The front desk staff were a bit dry to me but eh, it happens.  Now where they lost a star with me was our room.  They never mentioned when booking about the room differences.  All the rooms are supposed to be the same based upon what kind of room but they neglected to mention the atrium view rooms.Here I am thinking we will get a room with a view of High Street or the city or something but noooooooooooo!  We got a room that faced the atrium which meant that with the curtains open we could see everyone in the hotel and vice versa!  No view of the outside!  Unless you like that kind of thing I would make sure when booking the room to not take these.  I should've asked to change the room but felt I could live with it.  Really didn't like it but had emptied out my suitcase and shot over to the convention and wasn't in the mood to repack and move until check out.The room felt a little small to me although the bathroom itself was a nice size with a huge shower and a sink that was partially stopped up and they were a bit spartan with the supplies in there.  There is also a small fridge in the room which is great for that late night slice you might bring back ;)  Self parking in the garage is $20 while valet is $24.  The thing with that is valet parking is right behind the hotel while self parking means you will have to drive further into the garage and further away from the hotel.  I would return to the hotel providing I did NOT get one of those atrium rooms - ick!My go to hotel when I visit Columbus. It's the newest hotel in the area. I like you are in such a central location and can walk to some top notch restaurants.The rooms are nice and the suites are even nicer! The beds are comfortable and the linens are quality. I love the art on the ceiling... Just a nice touch. The bathrooms are a nice size. Good shower, plenty of vanity space, and nice towels. Many amenities such as a restaurant which serves a nice breakfast. The executive lounge, hotel bar, fitness center, business center, and a coffee shop. The service has alway been solid... valet, check in, and house keeping all have been excellent. I would recommend this hotel!FOOD: I've gone to the Hilton for a few events. The most recent was an art auction. The food selection included grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato bisque, caramelized bacon, sirloin sliders, and more. Everything was delicious! There was also a salad topped with grilled chicken and a sweet dressing. One of the best salads I have ever had.I was here for a conference.  Location was excellent.I liked hanging out at the bar area, above the ground floor.  The room was what I expected.  There was free Wi-Fi, although that may have been through the conference I was attending.If I was back in town, I would stay here.This hotel was designed to be a jewel in the middle of downtown, and it shows.The lobby is a beautiful, open space that takes advantage of natural lighting to highlight the marble, glass, and granite construction whenever possible, and naturally leads you back towards the reception desk. Rooms are nicely arranged and even the relatively small one we used was laid out to give you as much space as possible. Staff were friendly, helpful, and positive, and the coffee bar featured tasty (if basic) sandwiches at breakfast, plus an amazing pumpkin latte that actually had pumpkin blended into it!The only slight downsides are that parking is, unsurprisingly, very expensive ($20 for self parking / night, $30 if you use the valet), and that while the rooms have wide windows that give a great vantage point, 1/2 of the hotel basically just gets a view of the convention center instead of a look out at the city. Still, that really can't  be helped given the location.I have to admit - we stayed here for a little weekend getaway because I had a bunch of Hilton points saved up. Normally this would probably be out of my price range - but if you have the money, the points, or the expense account to make it a viable option? This is where you want to stay in Downtown Columbus.Well, I'd have to write a several-chapter memoir to give a complete review of this Hilton as the venue for my wedding. I will be as concise as possible. First, If you would've told me that I would get married at a HOTEL CHAIN when I got engaged, I would've slapped your face. I decided fairly last minute (in August of 2013) to have my wedding that New Year's Eve, provided we found a venue I didn't hate. Which, of course, would be a challenge with such late notice. This Hilton is the reason the NYE date even worked, and so many other positive things have flowed from the decision to get married earlier than originally planned. This Hilton feels NOTHING like a chain, Hilton or otherwise. It feels like an artistic metropolitan boutique hotel. There's lots of local flavor in the art, and the architecture and interior design is unique and current without being overly trendy or overdone. I wouldn't say this metro-contemporary aesthetic is really ""my"" personal vibe. I think it's beautiful and I appreciate it, but it's not exactly a reflection of ""me."" With that said, all that went out the window when I considered the fact that my wedding would be on NEW YEAR'S EVE, in Columbus WINTER. It felt glam and polished, and I didn't have to leave the hotel all day, and neither did my guests. I even stayed the night BEFORE the wedding here, and had my hair and makeup peeps come to me in our drop-dead-gorgeous-amazing-huge suite. I'm going to switch to lists to save some space. Amazing things:- BLAIRE, the event coordinator. She made this experience exciting and easy. Can't say enough about her. She was bubbly and knowledgeable and helpful and ... on and on. 10 out of 5 stars for Blaire. (Example: having cake -and other goodies like some snacks and champagne- sent up to our room after the wedding.) A billion other things, but that's an example of her above-and-beyond touches.- The suite we had the night before and day-of. Beautiful and accommodated the 50 or so people who moved through there that day.- Taste tests before the wedding! We were able to try and customize all of our food with the chef. We came on a separate day to try our signature drinks. Like a mini-celebration each time.- Location. All these appointments were easy because of the convenient location from work. And it was awesome to be downtown on NYE, duh. We said we wanted it to be like Columbus was a ""guest at the wedding"" -- and it totally felt that way!- Their standard chairs are actually cute. I didn't have to rent chairs or major table linens. For those of you that have planned a wedding, you know how huge this is.- Didn't have to rent ""conversation"" furniture either. We were able to pull ottomans and armchairs from other areas of the hotel for our use.- Service was spot-on. Gracious, seamless, professional, helpful. - Having our after-party on the glass bridge over High Street. What a memory!Some things that could've been a bit better, but are definitely eclipsed by all the amazing things above:- Some trouble getting our contract right, which caused a little stress. The writing didn't reflect our oral agreement on some of the charges, and the lawyer in me was freaking out over it. We eventually got it right, but it took a lot of prodding on my part.- A little nickel-and-diming going on, but that's old news in the event/wedding world. I would've like the option to get some things charged by VOLUME and not by GUEST. Example: we wanted fun toppings and additions to a coffee bar (since the wedding ended at 1 am, and the charges per guest were outrageous. We eventually worked some of this out. - The bar by the bridge was supposed to be open during our after-party, but the rowdy NYE crowd (not from our wedding) caused it to close early. Some of my guests were able to talk the bartenders into giving us a case of beer though, ha!- The ballrooms are in the basement. But! They're pretty, customizeable, and even though they're below the lobby, some have big windows. It seems weird at first, but we created our own little universe and it was a non-issue. Thanks, Hilton! A year later and we're still getting compliments on our wedding and fabulous venue.A good choice if your visiting Columbus! Staff is very friendly and helpful, hotel is very clean with a beautiful entrance! I loved the rooms, beds and shower (although it took my knucklehead self 20 minutes to figure out how to override the energy efficient lights, duh!). Very short walk to good restaurants, bars and a fun market place behind it. A great choice for anyone traveling for a convention as the hotel has a direct access skywalk to it. My only complaints are how expensive the convenience shop and restaurants inside the hotel are, plus paying $9.95 for wifi... C'mon it's 2014, not cool Hilton!One of the nicest Hilton's we've ever stayed at. Beautifully renovated and modern chic. The only small complaint was the musty smell of the rooms which comes from the air conditioner. It disappears after the AC runs for a while. Other than that great place!+ friendly staff+ clean rooms+ great tv channel selection + gorgeous hotel+ relaxing atmosphere I stay in hotels weekly and choose this one over all others in downtown Columbus.For the cost, this is a difficult place to stay.  For one, you have to pay extra for parking, whether it's valet or the ten minute hike to the garage that's not but ten feet away.  The other, for such a fancy place, the thermostats only go down to 68 or up to 75.  HUH???  All the doors open out into the atrium inside, and we could hear a bunch of jocks screaming at some party down there all the way from the tenth floor.  The curtains are translucent and some of them face the inside.  ... and only one set of towels?  The shower... felt like being peed on.  Where's the water pressure?  Yeah, the place is fancy, but they get too many of the little things wrong.","Great location... About a 7 minute walk to the LC Pavilion, which is great. Thought the $20/day parking was a little steep, I suppose business travelers don't care about expenses as much for these type of costs, being across from the convention center, their business is driven by the turnover traffic from there. The room was great, big shower, nicely appointed tile and wall coverings. Big flat screen, very comfy king bed. Wifi and Ethernet ports built in to big desk area and fridge under cabinet. Breakfast at the bistro was horrible. Two people breakfast for almost $50 included 1 egg and two slices of toast with a yogurt parfait. Then a Belgian waffle plus two cups of coffee. Coffee tasted like it had been sitting on a burner for way too long. The service was sloppy, waited for syrup while my waffle cooled down. Went to get it myself. Wife had no spoon for parfait, went to get that myself. Quality of food was... Ehh. Could have gone to a Best Western and got the buffet with the same level of food quality. The nice table settings and silverware can only demand so much of a premium. Bistro was very empty, but now, not surprised. Front desk was very helpful. Directed me to events I needed to find and made great suggestions for food and entertainment in area. I would stay again when in Columbus. Wouldn't go to bar or breakfast again, and would park across the street for $6 instead next time.If you want a quiet place to rest or work this IS NOT IT.   Loud unattended barking dogs are allowed even in the evenings and at night and morning.  They or it barked for hours.  Loud sounds in the room from machinery not in the room but somewhere is the hotel.  Hard to park if you can find it.  Valet parking was $26 a night so you end up spending $300 a night.  Bring your earplugs.Very modern and clean hotel in a great location. It's a lot like Columbus itself - nice but a bit sterile and soulless. I'm not a big fan of the central atrium style and the standard rooms are small compared to other hotels I've patronized in Columbus, but overall it's a solid choice.The location is great if you're looking for something close to the convention center.  There's a bridge on the 2nd floor that connects.The staff is friendly and welcoming - everyone from the front desk, gift shop to room service.It's nice, has a bar and a restaurant.  There's only one restaurant on site, coffee bean (although they don't have the full range of coffee bean menu - just coffee bean roasted beans).  This hotel is swanky so if that's your thing then you're in for a treat :)I love this place! I don't even know where to begin... It's so swanky!  The hotel is beautiful, the staff is amazing, the location is perfect, the views are stunning, there is art every where (am I'm not even an art lover).  When ever I'm here, I feel so...'classy'...BUT...what really makes this hotel awesome is that the ""executive rooms"" have 2 bathrooms!  2 bathrooms!!!!  1 for me and 1 for him!....no sharing!!!!I love this place!Was in town for our business conference at this location. I was very impressed with the hotel. The meeting facilities were very good, and the food was actually decent for hotel banquet food. The staff was very nice and my room was also very current and nice. Downtown Columbus is a nice area and there are many restaurant choices within walking distance.I had stayed at a Doubletree by Hilton the night before in Austin that was a bust...so I was happy to find such a delightful hotel. I was greeted very nicely when I came in. Given a bag with two bottles of water and a bag of fancy popcorn. My room wasn't large - actually a bit tight but it was very functional which is most important to me. Great location and lots of electrical outlets. The bathroom in particular (loved the shower and tile) and the rest of the room had a nice modern feel to it.We held an event there the next day and I just loved the decor (pictures) around the hotel. I also had a chance to meet with the events people and they took such good care of getting me and provided an absolutely delicious lunch (I was a presenter and had meetings afterwards and no time for lunch). I wish I could remember the Events women's name but she was great! Took care of us in the Edith Hopkins room (with Gartner). I should also mention that the comforter was SO cozy. Absolutely wonderful! Check out was also attended by a lovely staff member as well as the gentlemen who took care of my luggage (Nathan in particular).I really enjoyed this hotel.I can't speak for the drinks. We decided to stop in after a birthday party at Barley's so others could get a night cap.Definitely a different, sleek modern look. White/light grey marble. I don't like the giant carpet squares on the main floor, where the seating area and front desk are. It's got big light purple and bright neon green splotches on it - it looks like someone puked on the carpet. I hardly ever am in the Arena District, thus I don't frequent the establishments in that area. I probably won't ever come to the Hilton again - even the restaurant is not realistic - $25-30 per plate is not even worth a second glance at the menu :( The high-end clientele feel of the joint made me feel somewhat uncomfortable, as my personal likings do not quite fit this hot spot.Beautifully and tastefully decorated ""modern"" Hilton hotel just south of the fantastic Short North district in Columbus.  Clean, well priced, and love the location.  A brisk walk gets you back to the heart of downtown or up to a plethora of fantastic offerings in the Short North.  As with most Hilton hotels you have to deal with the lack of free WIFI which I still find mildly irritating, however this is probably the only negative I can bestow on this fine hotel.  Staff was helpful and the valet is very proper and prompt.  Will certainly be staying here again.Maybe because it's all new &amp; shiny but this Hilton is my new favorite hotel.  The design of the hotel is very unique with some of the rooms facing inwards and overlooking a huge atrium. I was worried about getting a ""inner"" room but the huge glass roof let in plenty of natural light and I liked the different view of the restaurant and surrounding rooms.  You can tell Hilton looked at other chains like Kimpton and Element and really upped their game with this new property.Our suite was well decorated and our bed was super comfy. And there are electrical outlets EVERYWHERE! Finally a hotel understand how important outlets are! And they also have wifi boosters throughout the hotel to ensure you always have a strong wireless signal. BRAVO! Shower was very nice and the fitness center has some of the newest Precor equipment.  Staff was incredibly nice and took care of everything we needed.  The only negative is that the connection to the parking garage is bit wonky.  You have to go down to get to the hotel and then up to the lobby once you get in the hotel.  Plus our room keys were never able to open the parking garage gates. Not a big deal but just annoying.We absolutely loved our four night stay and this will be our hotel of choice when we back in Columbus!I came to the Hilton for a conference and my stay was wonderful. The rooms are classy, the food they served for conference was good quality, and the staff were all helpful and up-beat. I would stay here again. I didn't get a chance to go out in the city too much so I don't know how good the location is, but there are some great bars and nice restaurants near by.I feel like I'm only writing negative reviews lately :(.I've stayed here twice.  The first time was with a friend who was in town right after the hotel opened a couple of years ago.  Beautiful hotel, had a great time.I just checked in tonight (at a rate of $190/night) and parked (at a rate of $20/day).  Made it up to the room to find that their WiFi is ALSO $10/night.I guess I just don't understand why.  It's exploitative and not really good business sense to nickel-and-dime customers for every small service you provide.  All it accomplished in this case was annoying me enough to write this Yelp review fifteen minutes after walking in the door.  Of course, that's tethering from my iPhone because I'm not going to pay $10/night for what other reviews indicate is slow WiFi, and that's not even mentioning the extra fee for ""premium"" Internet access (are you fucking kidding me?).Blah blah I'm crotchety and cranky, but whatever.  Just roll it into the cost of the room so your customers don't have to watch their bill go up with every minor convenience that you've decided to bill as a service.We paid for a block of rooms, and stayed with guests on our wedding night. Now the night we stayed was fine. The rooms are nice. The reason I am giving this place two stars is because their customer service is horrible!! We paid this place in full a week in advance, then they demanded more money from us when two of our guest accidentally booked outside the room block. She also wanted the. Check we turned in a week earlier. I said we paid, and she said ""our financial dept couldn't find it"" We cleared that up, but then the lady refunded us $398 (which was 50% of what we gave them)The check bounced over our honeymoon because the hotel waited 3 weeks to cash it.  When we met with her she said it would be deposited on that Sunday. So it bounced because some automatic payments went through, and now their demanding the full amount again!!! Do not stay here!!They have no idea what they are doing with you money!!!They gave half our money back to us, and the amount they want now.... The math doesn't add up.I'm only going it two stars because the view was nice and the bed was comfy!!!Stopped at this gem on a business road trip. Check-in was speedy and efficient. The rooms were spacious and clean. I especially loved, loved, loved the bathroom! Oh and the view from my room was amazing. I could see into the middle of the hotel where the dining area is located. The staff is amazing. They accommodated my traveling partner and I with loading and unloading A LOT of boxes. Parking is not free, but it is secure. If you are a HH member the Wi-Fi is free of course. I truly enjoyed my stay.Absolutely perfect home base for a weekend in Columbus. The front desk staff has been helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to the best place to walk our dog. The Ohio burger was recommended by Mark in the bar and is a must try. We will be back with or without our little dog.I got a chance to check out the new Hilton Columbus Downtown at the 25 year anniversary of local non-profit Homeport. Checking the hotel's website, it looks as though maybe it hasn't opened to the public yet, but it certainly looked completed to me. I saw no signs of construction in most places, right up to the rooms, all floors of which were accessible by elevator. One portion of the restaurant was blocked off, but if that was construction related, they were definitely putting on finishing touches. (Update - the Dispatch says it's open for business: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dispatch.com%2Fcontent%2Fstories%2Fbusiness%2F2012%2F10%2F20%2Fwelcome-mat-is-out.html&amp;s=ecd3b6f586e0799b05e79b614ac1b6f2d9c634c2a8adc2080243703be8aaffc7"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">dispatch.com/content/sto...</a>)The banquet rooms were all definitely complete, and I take it the kitchen was too, as there were lots of delicious Hors d'oeuvre coming out all night, the most amazing of which was the coconut shrimp. I could not get enough of these! The staff was excellent: friendly, fast, courteous, and helpful. Most of the design and architecture was impressive, but the lobby, atrium, and stairs to the restaurant were the highlights for me. The bar/restaurant upstairs was a bit slow moving; enough so that I only had one drink. Once the dining area off the bar is open, this establishment will be capable of seating quite a lot of customers. I am sure it will do well. I still take issue with Columbus residents' tax money going to a corporation as large as the Hilton as an incentive to get them to build downtown, but politics aside, it was an impressive new construction.My first night of four is complete and I would agree with other reviews that this new, modern hotel is beautiful. Everyone from the doorman to the bellhops has been pleasant and helpful. The rooms are well designed, plenty of light and clean.  So far it has been a pleasurable stay. For breakfast the servers are friendly, but the service is slow--really slow--like plan an hour unless you give them a little nudge. The location downtown is very convenient to restaurants and of course the convention center.  Traffic can be a little crazy if there are events going on downtown. The hotel has parking that is popular for events- $10.00 -a good deal. I would definitely recommend to my friends to stay here.Love the Hilton properties. This one just opened up a few days ago and it's still somewhat under the new construction so you need to be patient with some of the ""in between"" stages as it just opened up. Staff? AWESOME. Drinks at the bar? ROCKING. Parking? PLENTY and you have an option of 24/overnight via valet or 18/self park. I was also here two weeks ago for a business meeting and the catered Mexican food was amazing. Healthy options and very tasteful. The rooms are spacious and very clean.  The bathroom as self monitoring lighting which is huge for me. I can't stand screaming bright lights without any options for self dimmering as it's the biggest pet peeve I have regarding hotel rooms.  These are cool in that you can lighten up or lower down to your preference. Conveniently located across from the Convention Center (my old stomping ground where I worked for 5 years), this property really continues to add and build up downtown Columbus. My best friend left her phone charger by accident. All it took was one phone call and they are mailing it to her. Fabulous property. Fabulous experience. Loved it. Would totally stay again.Beautiful hotel! I love the art everywhere and the variety of furniture styles (I know that might sound stupid but I have a huge furniture fetish. They have a green chair by the check in desk that I've been trying to figure out how to steal....) The rooms and everything else where sparkling clean. Every single staff member we talked to, from valet to front desk to housekeeping) were extremely friendly, and that's pretty rare. The room was pristine and very comfortable. And we loved that the room came with a mini fridge. My one issue was we could not figure out the bathroom lights! I'm a high school math teacher and my husband has a Ph. D and after three days we still were getting stuck with the lights going out on us in the bathroom. Maybe we'll figure them out next time we stay. :)This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. Wonderful service. Beautiful rooms. Great location to Short North with lots of restaurants, bars, shops, etc in walking distance. Nice pool and gym. Lovely atmosphere and decor. Great bar on the 2nd floor, but its not very popular. If you are looking for a fun happening bar, go to Bar Louie across the street. The only downfalls:- the wifi SUCKS! I couldn't do any work on my laptop because the internet was so slow. also the wifi is expensive.- i wish the bar was open a little later every night - breakfast stops at 11am (with the time difference, we were waking up at 11am (8am PT), so we had to rush and get our order in every morning), and there's no late night room service options. Also, the room service food is overpriced (same as every hotel). A regular can of sprite costs $5! However, they have a Pete's Coffee downstairs, so you can go there for breakfast instead of spending a lot on room service.Even with these few small issues, I plan on staying here every time I visit Columbus. I highly recommend it.","This hotel is 2 years old and still feels new. The food was amazing. The caliber I would expect at a 5 star hotel or independent restaurant. I ate in the hotel every meal because of it and skipped my annual excursion to The Pearl down the street which is exceptional. The staff was professional and attentive in EVERY department. Room service was particularly outstanding.The staff should be proud to work there. Guests are lucky to stay. I travel a lot and it is so nice to have your whole experience....just perfect.Clean and nice hotel. Comfortable bed and neat design. Buffet at $18 not worth it. Visit Nancy's at California and High Street. Nice but small gym. Fire alarm went of at 0300 hours due to a water leak that shorted a ight but i can fault them. Great location next to hockey area and good eats.I recently worked in Columbus for a short stay. When I arrived my work travel coordinator had assured me after a red eye that my room would be ready at a nearby associated hotel-it was not. At 6:30am, Heather took 4 of us in and got us rooms at the Hilton Downtown. We were given great service and complementary room credits as well as pleasant help finding restaurants, shopping, and a convenient Coffee Bean downstairs. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Columbus, Ohio. We were so well taken care of.The room was very clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  Very nice big bathroom with huge shower.  Great location across from Convention Center.  It has a restaurant and a bar.  Highly recommend it.This hotel brings swanky to Columbus. Located downtown in the Short North arts district this Hilton does not disappoint. You can't miss this hotel as driving past it would require you to miss the beautiful lit up, color changing, glass bridge the hotel has connecting to the convention center. The exterior of the building is also visually appealing to the eye as it is also all glass and very contemporary in style. After the valets park your car, your enter the lobby which is a very chic all black and white with wood accents. There is a big grand staircase that leads upstairs into the restaurant and bar area. That night I checked into a suite and I was not disappointed. There were two bathrooms fit for a goddess, decked out in beautiful granite and other stone tiles. The bed was beyond plush and comfy, and on the ceiling was a beautiful work of art about the size of the bed. The room overlooked downtown and a few of the local bars and bistros as well as Hyde Park. The lounge are was also very classy and there was a nice little wet bar as well. Since I didn't stay here very long I didn't have a chance to use the one site gym or the pool, but I did get a chance to see them and they were very up to par! Highly recommend staying here if your planning a special night downtown and want to party in style! P.S staff were friendly and helpful too!While the amenities in the rooms were great, the bed was comfy, the bathroom was clean and modern, the WiFi at the Hilton was absolutely atrocious. I was there for a 3 day work conference, and all of the sessions require the use of Hilton's WiFi for one reason or another. We spent more time on fixing ""technically difficulties"" than learning from the courses. It was quite annoying. The best example was when I attended a 4 hour hands-on computer course that requires the WiFi network to be working seamlessly the entire time, and of course it wasn't. The signal was spotty at best. At its worst, the entire class was completely stalled when none of us could connect. A four hour class turned into a five hour class, and we didn't even cover all of the information we wanted to go over. It makes the host of the conference look really bad because they are known for their very well maintained data center and are almost obsessive about making sure the users are always connected.The WiFi in the rooms were horrible too. I stayed in a room on the 8th floor (out of 14) that had the view of the courtyard and can clearly see the sky through the glass ceiling, and I could barely get a signal. Since the windows don't open, the closest I could get to the sky was right up against the window. I don't care about looking ridiculous, because I'm sure many other people were doing the exact same thing. I'm sorry, but if you're going to advertise the hotel as a place that work conferences should come to, you really need to beef up your WiFi network, because it was simply unacceptable. I hope this message gets passed along to other Hiltons so I don't have to keep giving 1 star on my reviews.One of the nicest hotels in the Columbus area. The rooms are clean, modern and designed beautifully. Bottom line: GREAT LOCATION!The hotel is within walking distance of the bar scene (Brothers, Gaswerks, Cantina, etc.) Walk back to your room, even in 6-inch heels! ^_^ And if you're craving a late night snack, there are a few restaurants nearby as well.Minus one star? You have to pay for Internet.If you find yourself in Columbus for a couple of overnights, you can't get any better than this.  The location is perfect, just a short walk to the Short North and the trendiness it invites.  Great restaurants and watering holes are nearby so leave the car in the attached parking garage and give your Nikes a workout.  There is also a walkway that connects you to the Convention Center right across the street.The rooms are new and modern with some good views of the city and locally produced artwork on the walls.   Room service is quick and tasty.  The hotel bar is really a nice change of pace for your usual Hilton bar, it seems less like a businessman's hangout and more like a place were you can meet real people.  Plus, the bartender poured a really decent Old Fashioned!I stay at Hilton properties all over the country, this one is in the top tier.  Great staff, super quick check in if you are a Diamond.Hotel in general is great to stay at.  A few things kind of bother me though when it comes to staying at a nice hotel.  No free wifi, no soda/pop machines available, no late night food options (after midnight), no cups to drink water...   had to order Papa Johns in order to get some food and drinks.  I'm surprised they don't charge extra for direct TV here.Yes, this place is new. Yes, there are tons of shiny things in this hotel: furniture looks new, large screen TV, new fitness equipment, super neat looking pool... let's just say it's nice to be in a newish hotel. If it wasn't for this... I would never consider looking back and choosing this hotel again on my next business trip... though it probably is the most upgraded Hilton in Columbus, Ohio. I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but it really deserves 2.5 stars... because it is not ""A-OK"".. unfortunately Yelp doesn't have half stars... so 2 it is.The issues I have with this hotel:1. The internet. Holy crap. They make people pay for this internet? <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F2444297057.png&amp;s=5862340e886e08068945b8285899380f664f772a879ac87f821579a74dab5187"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/244...</a>. Check that out. Worst. Internet. Service. I have EVER seen in a Hilton. You can't use it. Can barely load webpages... give up all hope now of ever watching a video. This was what the internet was like all 4 nights I was here. My boss called down to the front desk to complain and they basically said that it is what it is. Ridiculous. Can't remote desktop to my work computer... this is supposed to be a business oriented hotel (it's across the street from the Convention Center). This by itself is game over.2. The room temperature control. For my boss, he couldn't make it cold enough. For mine. Much too cold. The thermostat doesn't go below 68 and doesn't go above 75... which is not a big deal usually. I get the environmental consciousness thing... the problem is... 75... is not 75... it only kicks in early in the morning and after... maybe 1 am.3. Minor gripe for service. Front desk was great and friendly (though it is weird that they make you carry your own water bottles up to the room now... is this standard Hilton practice now?). Everyone else? Yeahhhhhh... the staff at the restaurant... hit or miss... ate here a lot (all my breakfast meals and a couple dinners). I'll be writing a review about this later... just... eh. Really hard to get their attention for anything... *sigh*. There were good ones though.4. Minor gripe, maid service. Wow. Talk about inconsistent. I'm not usually picky. I don't ask for much... but this is relatively poor for what is supposed to be a top class hotel. The first night, they cleared everything. They tossed the soap, the shampoo, conditioner... I hate being wasteful... I try and use the little toiletries as sparingly as possible because it is kind of a shame to have to toss them every time I'm on travel. The second day was ok (something irked me but it was minor)... the third day they left everything... but i finished using it all... the soaps were fine to leave, but there was no shampoo or conditioner left. I had to call the front desk to get more (luckily they were pretty quick about it). They also folded the towels and left them on the love seat? Never seen that before. The last day they didn't replace the tea/cups :/Interesting design (rooms overlooking the atrium is kind of a weird design choice... I'd much rather look outside), nice that everything is brand spanking new... but this hotel has a long way to go if they're going to be top notch.Good hotel overall. Rooms are small. Feels like a W Hotel. Real trendy. Brand new; pristine.Nice infinity pool.Only complaint is that housekeepers were slamming doors all morning up and down the hallway and I was trying to sleep in.I stay at a lot of hotels.  I travel a lot for work and have become very picky where I stay.  I checked in for a few days just before their grand opening and it was a blast.  The best part:  EVERYTHING IS NEW.  Their work out facility is top notch, they have a pool, secure indoor parking, great everything.  Decent lounge with a nice area to relax and do work.Location is prime too, love the short north.  Good night life and always something to do after work.  Very easy to get a cab too if you need it.  They also have a restaurant in house which looks very nice, but didn't eat there yet.  With so many great dinner options OUTSIDE the hotel, it's a no brainer for me to take advantage of that.  Come stay here.  I guarantee that you'll love it.After speaking with Christian at length, he informed me that he had been present that weekend on duty at the hotel.  Of course, the question this brings one to offer is why after 9 phone calls/ complaints over 18 hours, he didn't feel it was necessary to contact us personally to resolve the situation?  I have declined his offer for a free stay/ dinner at this establishment due to the fact that I would rather not expose myself to the potential for this type of customer service.  As this is primarily a convention hotel, perhaps some corporate training from those at the Hilton Austin Convention Center and Hilton Baltimore Convention Center may be in order.  Multiple stays at both in the last 18 months were both inviting and professional.We spent 3 nights here during the Summer Fencing Nationals this year. Beautiful hotel! Warmly welcomed by attentive staff. Beautiful room with a not-such-great view but I'm not here for the view. The room is immaculate. Wonderfully comfy beds, cuddly pillows. Towels are large and wonderful. The bathroom is large spacious with a  lot of room to put toiletries, but alas, no extra towel hooks. My favorite was a wonderful tabletop mirror to use for makeup. Only had breakfast which was very good although a bit slow &amp; greasy. Had to wait too long for milk for my coffee.Not so happy with the valet service. They had a fender bender with our rental while they were bringing it to us and at first tried to get our insurance involved. They flat out blamed the other driver but that seemed a bit suspect to me as they had many powwows out of earshot. Then I found evidence of a picnic in the car-ketchup packet, sticky console &amp; crumbs but no evidence they they went for a joy ride thankfully.I would absolutely come back here-loved the hotel &amp; felt VERY welcomed and at home but I'm still a bit shaky when they drive off with the car.This is a gorgeous hotel! The design and decor are beautiful and it is well worth the rate per night. It is also convenient if you have meetings or gatherings in the downstairs areas. Just a great place.Awful experience overall. I hate leaving negative reviews but this one deserves it. This hotel seems to lodge mostly high school and middle school students on a field trip. You can expect simple elevator wait times to be between 25 or 30 minutes. (Due to the teenagers switching floors every 10 minutes) the hotel seems poorly staffed and the nickel and dime effect is very apparent. The business center computers require a credit card to even access the computer or print a birding pass, as do many features of this hotel. This hotel has been one of my top ten worst acclimation as a business traveler.  Think twice about this hotel if you appreciate peace , quiet, and a professional setting.Eh, its OK, its a Hilton. Very friendly staff, but clueless , truly clueless about any of the local questions I asked. I was shocked.  WiFi is HORRIBLE.  Good location, both directly behind and to the north of the hotel there is a lot of options.  I guess this is a good as it gets for Columbus, but for goodness sake, where is the training on local knowledge  PS  I really got pissed when I saw a cab driver giving a bellman $2 so I could get in his cab. I find it highly unethical.New modern hotel. Stopped in later in the evening without a reservation, because the hotel we had booked down the road was horrible. The Hilton was able to accommodate us and exceeded our expectations. Room was clean and spacious; staff was exceptionally courteous and helpful. Would definitely stay again.I just tried to find out how much it would cost to stay at this hotel from Nov 18 -23, waited on hold forever, was transferred to a centralized booking group, where I could barely understand the man answering my questions: online, I found a AAA rate and wanted to see if a better rate was available. After waiting way too long, while he checked with someone, to see if that rate was available (no, I wanted to see if there was a better rate available to me), I hung up. I have a really bad impression of Hilton hotels from this experience, and I used to love Hilton, had a frequent stay membership...not anymore.Beautiful hotel, pleasant and helpful staff, and rooms and all common areas so well kept.  It was a pleasure to stay here.  Very convenient to restaurants and of course the convention center.  Would definitely stay here again.","Great location. Convenient for walking to food clubs and shops. Great amenities and wonderful customer service.I came here for a conference and found the hotel absolutely beautiful.  I mean, really impressively beautiful.  The spaces for the conference were nice, though I will say the food we had was not overly impressive.  But back to my stay-the room was lovely with an enormous shower.  The room was smaller than most, but that was not a problem for me as I had everything I need.  The bed was insanely comfortable as were the pillows.  I often have a hard time sleeping in hotels, I did not here.  Overall, the service was pleasant, the hotel impressive, and the location good.  It was definitely fairly pricey, even at our group rate.  That rate also did not include breakfast or wifi, which is somewhat expected for a downtown hotel, but would have been nice.  Overall, I would stay here again, and recommend it for anyone staying in Columbus (unless you're looking for a super cheap room)My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day and it was an amazing experience. When I checked in I tipped the front desk and they upgraded me to a suite. He asked offhandedly if we were celebrating valentine's day and I responded 'yes"". I went in and it was HUGE. We had 2 bathrooms! I left to pick up my boyfriend and when we went into our room the staff had put out flower petals from the front door leading into the bedroom and left a card. I know they probably do that with everyone, but it was really sweet and cute.Later we went and got dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was SO DELICIOUS (totally recommend). We went up to the front desk to thank them/ see if we could have  a check out time later than 12. She was like""oh sure, what time? 1:00? 1:30?"". She acted like it was no big deal at all. So we got to stay til 1:30 instead of 12!The staff is friendly and thoughtful, the hotel is REALLY cool. The structure on the inside is really great, the location is nice, and the decor was impressive and modern. They had a TON of chairs that I wanted to try and we both like that they incorporated a lot of local art inside. AND the tunnel that leads to the convention center is really cool on the inside (I still have mixed feelings about it from the street).If you want a really nice modern hotel to stay in, I definitely recommend the Hilton.I stayed at the Hilton Columbus downtown for one night (yesterday). Although my time there was short,  I was please. It is a new hotel, and it showed. Beautiful design, and super clean. Walking distance to several dining establishments and helpful, friendly staff. The rooms were a tad small, and I did not like the atrium view. Next time I will ask for a room with an exterior view. All and all, a good experience.1st stay and it was great. New, clean and the staff was great...I stayed here on 12/23/14.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff is friendly but I do have a few major complaints.  First off when I first arrived there was nobody present at the valet station.   I waited over ten minutes for someone to show up then decided I would park myself because I was in a hurry. Once I found a spot in the parking garage I quickly realized I would be carrying all my bags down several flights of stairs. I spoke to the front desk about the problem and she did have the valet move my car but this was after I carried all my bags down flights of stairs. The second issue I had was, while our room was very nice, it had a smell which I can only describe as body odor.  I was out on the town most of the night so I just let it slide since I would only be there for a few hours of sleep anyway. I love staying at Hilton hotels but this one was just not up to standards, especially for a hotel this new.A brand-new Hilton. I love the look in the common areas as well as in the guest rooms. The bar area was lively without being too loud (and the drinks were great!). I like the area; you can walk to the Nationwide Arena and the convention center, as well as several top-notch restaurants. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Columbus.You will not find a better hotel in Columbus.  I travel more than most people and can attest that this is a superior hotel.I've stayed at this Hilton a few times now and have been impressed each time. As most of the previous reviewers have noted, the hotel is new and has a sleek, modern feel. Every time I have checked in the staff at the front desk has been nice, courteous and always willing to assist with any questions I might have. I do agree with some of the previous reviewers in that the WiFi is pretty bad and the rooms are fairly small, but I never spent much time in the room or on the WiFi so they didn't really bother me or ruin my experience. The rooms are clean, showers and bathrooms are large, and beds are super comfy (one of the best qualities of the hotel in my opinion). I like the fact that the hotel is in downtown and there are a lot of restaurants and bars close by to walk to (Covention Center &amp; Arena District). I've also had a few drinks at the hotel bar, which were moderately priced and fairly stiff. Overall, I've always had a good experience at the Hilton Columbus Downtown and would recommend it to anybody staying in the Downtown Columbus Area. I will be staying there again sometime in the near future.Just returned from as nights stay in this new Hilton. Can't say enough good things about it. Very helpful and professional staff new everything. Professional valet service with autos parked at the hotel. Yes, Professional valet service, doesn't sound like a lot to ask for but last years stay at that sh!thole Hyatt across the street cost me 3 weeks of my Acadia in the body shop with close to $6K worth of damage. Do yourself a favor and stay here next time your in the Columbus area. You will be impressed.I stayed at this hotel over a weekend because it was hosting a conference for my fraternity. Everything about it was wonderful. It was clear that everything was new, and I appreciated the modern feel of the decor. The staff was always very kind and courteous. The hotel was also responsible for catering the conference and they had excellent food. I myself am a vegan, so I did not eat the buffet-style foods they had. Instead, I talked with the staff to ask about dietary restrictions and they were more than happy to accommodate by providing impromptu meals for me at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. These meals were delicious, so I would only expect the planned food to be even better (my friends said good things about the bar as well).The rooms were very roomy and comfortably fit 4 men to sleep through the night, and we had 10 of us hanging out in one room without any trouble and still room for more. There isn't much else to say, besides the fact that I had a wonderful experience at this hotel and will  return if my adventures bring me back to Columbus.The bar was miserable. The food selection was not very accommodating to people with dietary restrictions. Getting a menu was like pulling teeth. We had to walk to where the server was hiding out to get service multiple times. To top off the experience, as I was pouring a glass of wine the server snatched the bottle so that he could give the rest to a person in my party (very close to spilling on me). Never will we have an event there again. Not worth the walk or the trouble.BRIDES BEWARE!! I am getting married in May and called January 3rd to make a room block for my wedding guest. The event people told me you can not book it farther then 4 months from the event. She said that is there policy for weddings, she took all my information and the dates I would need rooms for and said she would contact me closer to the 4 month mark. This was pretty annoying because I had to wait on ordering my wedding invitations,  to find out if we were going to use The Hilton. Also any bride will tell booking a hotel 4 months out from the wedding is cutting it pretty close and it really added to my stress level. I waited anyways, because the hotel looked so nice. I called it exactly 4 months to the day and talked to the same girl, she was very nice, but she still did not have any information for me.  She said she would called later that day or tomorrow. Well tomorrow goes by and I call her in the afternoon and she says her boss has been in meetings and she is waiting for a price from her, she says she will call tomorrow. I finally get a call the next day, to find out that they do not have anything available! That they are already too full and can not offer me a block!! I asked her how that could be when I was told you can not book until 4 months too the day. She said all of the convention center business is a priority and there is already stuff booked for them. If this is true, why could she have told me this almost three weeks ago when I first called.  I understand the booking policy, but I would of appreciated it more if they had just said I'm sorry we don't have the availability, you should look for a different hotel. So here I am not less the 4 months to the wedding, till no Hotel booked and I haven't printed my wedding invitation either because I was waiting on them. All I'm saying is this is not the place to do a wedding block, unless you really want to stress yourself out close to your wedding day.",,"['downtown', 'days', 'nights', 'conference', 'employer',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-columbus-at-easton-columbus,Hilton Columbus at Easton,3.5,$$$,65,"Absolutely Perfect Service Makes for a Great Stay!We stayed here along with approx 30 other family members for a family event nearby.  The first impression was how excellent the service was that we received from the staff.  It started with the valet parking attendant, and continued with the front desk staff, the maids, the servers in the restaurant, even the bartender in their sports bar!  Everyone was very polite and very good at their jobs.  It makes such a difference, and lead to a really wonderful stay.  I would absolutely go back here when the chance arises.  The room was very modern and clean.Their ""dining room"" restaurant is way overpriced for the service you get. Had a horrible valentines day dinner here. Salads came out at the exact same time as our meals. No apologies were issued. Menu can be very limited for special occasions. (I.e. Only 1-2 choices only)I can get a Way better experience for $50 a person at other places.Not a great day for our lunch fourtop.   Most everything was out of synch.   We waited to be seated.   We waited to be greeted at the table.   And we waited for our food. It didn't seem to be particularly busy on a Monday at 130. Once we got the food all was well.   My guess,  a bad day at a place that is usually very serviceable.Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Speaking of thanksgiving did you all know that the Hilton does a wonderful buffet for this special day that we give thanks? It is just phenomenal.I was with a private party and if anyone saw my check in it was roughly 50 to 60 ish people in the family. We started off at the Sports Bar where everyone had a cocktail hour and got to mingle/take photos/etc. It was there I learned that Bloody Mary's are not my drink because man was that drink overly spicy. I had to trade it in for a dirty Shirley Temple and that was so much better! After the cocktail hour, we proceeded to the main room where our big party sat down to give thanks. Then we went out to the buffet area where they had your choice of carved beef, carved turkey, pigs in a blanket (their version of ham with bacon on top). There was a salad bad, a seafood bar, a dessert bar. So many options, I definitely had to pace myself!The turkey was so moist you could taste the juices. The steamed vegetables, mashed potatoes, sweet potato au gratin were all wonderful. My husband even said the brussel sprouts tasted better here than at the Hilton Polaris. They were fully cooked to perfection, while still having the full flavor.We then got tempted by the dessert table. They had cupcakes, pecan pie, strawberry shortcake, gluten free chocolate cake with whipped topping. Out of them all I really liked the strawberry shortcake. I didn't eat them all, but what I heard was that the strawberry shortcake tasted better out of them all due to the berries soaking into the shortcake. In between eating, our private party got to meet the chef who was in charge of the entire buffet at the Hilton today. I would have to say he did a phenomenal job, because his food was way better than the Hilton in Polaris. Having the right chef in charge of all the food makes a world of a difference in how the food will turn out for a huge event for one day. I know this from experience.I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking at places to eat for Thanksgiving to definitely make a reservation here. It's definitely worth the money.Years ago I had stayed at this hotel for a convention so I was looking forward to coming back since I did not get the opportunity to explore Easton Towne Center during that visit.This hotel is currently under renovations but it has a lot going for it. First of all is it has a self parking garage (if you are willing to walk a bit) to protect your car from the elements. They do offer valet parking but with this feature you really don't need it. Also the hotel has entered the technical age. Being a member of Hilton honors I was able to ""choose"" my room from my phone. The Hilton honors app would let me know when my room was ready for check in. When I arrived I was prepared to give them my credit card and inquired if an upgrade I had requested was available. I was told there wasn't one and that the concierge level was undergoing renovations until the middle of next year. They told me that my phone would work as a digital ""key"" since I had Bluetooth and if I experienced any problems to let them know.As I heading to get my car I ran into two maintenance personnel who gave me advice as to where to park and how they could make my stay more enjoyable. All I really needed were a few towels. So when I moved my car and entered the room I found a card from those same people offering me a free buffet breakfast! I was literally blown away! Also this digital key really does work! My room is renovated and consists of a glass shower stall (no tub) in the bathroom but there was plenty of room. There's an in room safe and small refrigerator with a card that told me that the two bottles of water inside were mine to use.As a Hilton honors member I got free WiFi in the room. I was happy too that I got a room facing away from the Towne Center since I wanted a good night's sleep. When I got up I went to the buffet. It is your typical breakfast buffet with both cold and hot breakfast foods and made to order omelets. They even had a multigrain oatmeal which I loved. This buffet normally runs for about $26.00 so with the cold weather I was glad I didn't have to go out and find a discount place just to get an affordable breakfast.When I went to check out I was told they would e-mail me the bill. Remember how dreadful it is finding it slid under your door the day you leave?  The main thing is to make sure you stop at the front desk in order to check out because if you are using this process, then there is no way they can tell you have left the hotel. I asked for a printed copy of my statement for record purposes only just to play it safe.It was worth staying onsite and being able to enjoy the evening activities that Easton Towne Center has to offer.Decent stay. Close and convenient to the airport. Staff was friendly at check-in. Room was nice, however housekeeping missed a few things. Old coffee filter from previous guest still in coffee pot. Yuck! Room service was fast but I would not recommend the chicken soup. It had more grease than broth. Double Yuck!!""F"" on housekeeping2 days in a row they left their own black kinky hairs in and around the tub Numerous complaints ....... WIFI ..... Absent Lied to about no one else has internet access problems ... Told us it was only usWhen I went to look for maid  where her cart was she was gone but the room was open and belongings of guest in plain sight to steal .. Then noticed numerous other Rooms she left wide open  while she was ? Well. Where was she ??? Not protecting anyone's belongingsBartender totally ignored me  whole catering to 1 male guest / sexistA shout out to Alicia at front fest for wrapping out Christmas gifts and to Matt for finding carrot cake for us these. 2 were the only bright spotsThe good: Awesome location.The bad: See also, ""The Ugly"".The ugly: All of it. I couldn't believe the experience I had at this hotel...a Hilton no-less! I travel about once a month for business, and can honestly say I haven't had a worse experience at a hotel. Now I must admit - MY bad was not saying anything, but by the time I had a break from the conference to do so, I felt it wasn't worth it. -The room-Immediately upon walking in, I thought my room hadn't been properly cleaned. There was lint and part of a clothes tag on the ground, the pillows were disheveled, washclothes were folded sloppily, and the shampoo bottle was half empty. I also never got comfortable: I had the air turned down to 56 degrees (!!!) and it was still balmy. My co-workers had the same heat/discomfort experience. Much to my dismay, on the second day (after the room had been ""cleaned"") all of the same problems were present - stuff still on the floor, sloppy folding and disheveled pillows, and another half empty shampoo bottle. I couldn't believe it. -The service-Front Desk Staff - I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but what I did have made me feel half informed. Upon arrival, I asked the front desk staff about a taxi back to the airport. I was told that there was a shuttle - free of service - so I was happy to use this instead. Upon check-out, I walked downstairs at 7:15am only to be told that the shuttle left in every half hour increments - not what I had been told previously. I didn't have 15 minutes to spare (and if I had, I would used it to sleep some more!), so I begrudgingly paid for a cab.Bartender - After the first day at the conference, there was a Happy Hour. I always attempt to get a ""drink"" that only resembles alcohol, so I asked for a virgin bloody mary (very quietly). The bartender all but yelled back at me ""virgin?!"" and then proceeded to pour tomato juice in a glass and hand it to me. I said, ""...Do you have anything to add to it? A lime, lemon, olives...?"" I got a horrible glare, and one small excuse for a lemon plopped in my drink. I don't know at what bar plain tomato juice passes for a ""bloody mary"" but remind me never to visit it.Server - In addition to drinks, appetizers were being passed. I always ask - if the server doesn't tell me - what the option is. At one point, a server carrying a plate of what looked like small baguettes with a soft white cheese dip walked over, and stood in front of us. ""What is this?"" I asked...to which the server replied...""Cheese."" ""Cheese?"" I questioned...surely there was more to that...nope. She stared at me while I hesitantly tried the unappetizing ""cheese"" thing.Room Service - Lastly, I have to mention this conundrum. We had a very early dinner, so I was starving come 9:30pm. I perused the menu, but none of the greasy options appealed to me. I found the easiest breakfast item I could - a fruit and yogurt parfait. Granola, yogurt, fruit - DONE. I dialed the button on my phone three times, but it kept hanging up on me. So I called the front desk...got transferred...and five minutes later, was told that the Chef changes, and ""the night Chef doesn't know the recipe"". Recipe?! I get it, this is the least of my concerns, as I was ordering off the wrong menu - but give me a break...this shouldn't be hard.To spend $440 for two nights (a discounted rate, mind you!) for this location is disgusting. The lack of service, attention to their patrons and the rooms, is unacceptable.A long time Buckeye, previous Columbus resident, and fan of Easton Town Center ever since it's construction, I've consistently been disappointed in the Hilton there. We've stayed there several times since it's construction and just recently (July 2015) to visit Columbus for a wedding.The good: Close to Easton Town Center, one of the premier places in Columbus for shopping, food, and drinks. Excellent parking and close to the airport for travelers. Relatively clean and spacious lobby. Nice workout facility and pool.The bad: The internet access and speeds are horrific, usually trying to upsell customers to ""premium internet"", which if purchased does not guarantee any increase in speed or availability' WiFi was consistently dropping on both routers. The redesigned bathrooms are broken, the shower doors don't seal on the bottom, resulting in a flood every time you shower it's as if they constructed the showers backward. Atrociously dated and slow TV/Cable package.I suppose in the end most of the blame rides on Hilton in general as a chain and their contracts with vendors; their antiquated internet access, entertainment, and bottom-dollar renovations will definitely lead us to trying out nearby competitors in the future. Bottom line, get with the times Hilton, you're falling behind.I stayed for a week at this hotel for business and had no complaints. From front desk to the housekeeping staff everyone was friendly, accommodating and provided top notch service. The room was large and I did not feel cramped as I have in other hotels. My only suggestion is that the quick service coffee area that is serving Starbucks coffee adjust their prices to come in line with the chain operated Starbucks which is a minute walk away. I was a little shocked when the employee told me how much I owed for a cup of coffee when I would have walked to the Town Center Starbucks.Stay away from the bar! Just charged $48 for 2 drinks!!! Complained to management - got us a response ""those are our prices"".Insane. I feel bad for out-of-towners visiting Columbus &amp; having that little surprise. Not cool Hilton - not cool.I have only been here for conferences but its a very nice hotel and they always handle it very well.Its a very beautiful building and very clean. The food that has been provided by the hotel has always been great. The staff is always friendly and helpful and seem to be on top of any problems that may arise.I also appreciate the free, easy parking thats right in front. I've never stayed here or tried their restaurant (just their catering) so I am not commenting on either of those. If you were to stay here, you would be right next to Easton mall which is awesome with plenty of dining options for all taste buds and budgets.UGH.My husband and I were here for an event not too long ago.  Yes, we paid for it.  And the food was awful.  It's a nice location, being close to the mall and all, but I will never ever eat here again.  Even if it's free.That being said, my husband thought the food was good.  Which was weird.  He never likes that kind of food.  We were served salads first - mine was covered in nuts, and I have a nut allergy.  Which they were informed of.  Maybe the message didn't get to where it needed to go.  But no biggie - I flagged down a server and asked them if they had anything available that was nut free.  He was very kind about it and brought back a plate with a tasty looking salad on it.  I was two-thirds through the salad when there was a BIG HUGE PINE NUT sitting there on my plate.  Staring at me.  I stopped eating the salad.So then the entree course came around - and a rather nutty looking breaded chicken came around.  We asked - yes, it contained nuts.  So they whisked it away and brought me back two very dry pieces of chicken breast...My husband said his nutty chicken was very tasty.  And moist.After weeks of useless phone calls and emails re the hotel GM's public comment about the desire to ""make it right"", the Hilton management concluded that their staff did nothing wrong and that I did, in fact, cancel my own reservation and Simply Don't Remember Doing So.  Certainly, there are less irritating and inconvenient reasons to order a new credit card.Four of us went to the Hilton specifically to have a three course meal special they offer.  There were three choices for the main course, two weren't available.  The waiter said ""people won't eat them and the chef won't serve them.""  We were offered a substitute of beef ribs for the pork ribs which was very good with mashed potatoes.  I it came with salad and all of our salads were not fresh.  It came with desert ""cobbler"" non of us were happy with it.   It was cooked fruit in a dish that's it.  My brother had a beir and cheese soup I tasted it and wasn't good, he was very sick later that day.  I vas very disappointed in what I expect from Hilton and paying over $30 for a meal.  No wonder their was only one other party besides us at 6:00pm.My new favorite!!!!! I will never stay anywhere else. The property and facilities are amazing! Close to shopping and restaurants, although the onsite sports bar is reasonably priced the staff is friendly and helpful.I sent my family there to Christmas shop using my rewards points. Even though I had already checked them in, they were forced to wait until  6 pm to get in their rooms. This caused the cancellation of activities they had planned that evening. The hotel staff was rude and when I contacted them with my concerns (hoping no one else would have to go through that) they would not return email or phone calls. Shame on you! All you had to do was talk to me. I'm a long time Hilton user, but I will not use this establishment again.Great seafood for the cost..sushi was great, but needed servers to clean up more frequently. Had to remind themWe had dinner at the Hilton Friday night, which has their seafood buffet and sushi bar. We have eaten there several times, but this time was bad. If I could give them negative stars I would. Raw Oysters were warm so I had one and stopped. Their crab legs had been in the pan for so long they were dry, almost the same texture as the shell. So I thought we would try something else, there was something like a seafood stew, but it was just basically tomato juice, there was some kind of chicken curry and salmon, but couldn't get past the dried out chicken and salmon covered in sauce. Yuck. There was suppose to be rice pilaf, but it was just plain white rice. Desserts had been picked through and didn't look very appetizing. Sushi was OK, but you need to make sure you don't eat if it's warm. We didn't feel very well that night. Sunday we decided to try the brunch they do have a nice omelet station, sausage and bacon were good but after seeing the same chicken curry and same  seafood stew. I stopped eating and we left. I would think for the price they charge, they should be able to afford to put fresh items on the buffet. Will not be going back. The hotel is nice but don't eat at the restaurant.Literally just the breakfast buffet with my husband. The food was  not hot or warm at all. I was so disappointed  that we spent $60.00 for garbage! We live here I Columbus and I heard great things and wanted to give it try. The biggest waste ever!","I come here once or twice a month for the Prime Rib Seafood Buffet. You won't find anything better for $30! My first plate is always loaded with sashimi. Not only is their sashimi very very fresh, each cut is thick, unlike other ""sushi buffet"" places. By the time I've eaten two places of their sashimi, I'm pretty sure I've already eaten over $30 worth of food.  Next, I will go get a couple slices of their prime rib, and other dishes.  They also have pots of other food, like seared salmon, gumbo, and others for you to choose from. On the other side there are crab legs and clams, which are all super fresh. There is also an option for you to choose your own veggies and meat and have someone cook it all for you.  I got this once, but it was way too much food, I didn't have any room left for anything else.In the middle of it all is a dessert bar. Their desserts are delicious! The chocolate is always thick and creamy. The perfect ending to an awesome dining experience.I love this Hotel.  This has to be one of the nicer hotels I have stayed in the Ohio area.  I've stayed here probably a total of 15 times in the last 7 years. Each time, my stays were for business, but that didn't stop me from enjoying what this hotel has to offer. The staff here is great. From the bellman to their front desk, they're efficient and customer oriented.  This hotel has it all...bars, restaurants, spacious/luxury rooms, and huge conference rooms.  This hotel is is fairly big, but it doesn't take forever to get from one end to the other.  The love the convenience of elevators on each side of the hotel.  Never fails when I stay at a hotel. Usually my room is miles from the elevators, which I hate. Here, your no farther than halfway to an elevator. I also love their spacious lobby where you can relax and talk shop with your business partners. Regarding their rooms, it really depends on which rooms you reserve. My previous stays were all in spacious and luxurious rooms. My most recent stay was in one of their smaller rooms. The room is still nice, just not as nice as my other stays. One thing I really appreciate about their rooms is the amount of outlets so close to the bed.  Totally comes in handy when you have an iPad, iPhone, and laptop to keep charged.  Now for their amenities. I include Easton Town Center as one of them.  This hotel sports a nice indoor pool and decent fitness room with free weights. For a fairly large hotel, it's still a bit cozy. I'm not saying that this hotel is huge and grand. It's obvious that this hotel is good for conferences and business.  When I'm in Columbus for business and have a choice of my hotel stay, I'd choose this Hilton every time. TIP: -Wifi signal is weak and I think they charge unless you're an Hilton's Honors member.  My suggestion, bring your own wireless card if you have one. I'm a member but again, weak signal and had to use my wireless card.-The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the airport every half hour.PS: People out here rave about their restaurant. I haven't had the opportunity for dinner, but breakfast here is good.What an amazing evening we had thanks to the staff at the Hilton. I joined my mother for her event for the columbus board of realtors as she was being honored with an award. Assuming there would be somewhat of a food choice on the menu I panicked when I saw it was just filet. (I'm a vegetarian) the staff quickly accommodated me and the chef gracefully prepared me a dish. Sheila was the BEST part of our evening. She was one of the banquet servers and was hilariously funny and very efficient at clearing our table, providing wine/coffee, and general entertainment. Our table had so many laughs with her it was great. Overall I was extremely impressed with the quality of the event as I know much preparation goes into these things. Thank you all for making it such a memorable evening.I just returned from a stay at the Hilton in Easton OH. The outside is beautiful, I thought it was a courthouse or government building.  The lobby is classy but had comfortable chairs.  The desk staff was very friendly and I was off to my room in a few minutes.  My room 335, had just been renovated, I love the new electronic lock where you just have to hold the key card up to it. A plus when you have luggage or packages.The room is a very nice size with a King bed, couch, chair, desk and vanity in the entrance area.  The bathroom was very modern with a huge walk in shower.Everything was spotless, the bed was super comfortable.  I also got free wireless, and Continental breakfast.   The WiFi was pretty slow, there were times it didn't work at all, but I'm not someone who needs to be online all the time.The continental breakfast was the only low point in an otherwise perfect experience.  There wasn't much to choose from, the bran muffin I tried had some sort of candied cherries in and had a weird taste.  I didn't even attempt to try the bagels because I live in NJ and I know they won't measure up. I would stay there again, hopefully I can see more of the beautiful shopping center right there.Ambiance: 4 - It's extremely beautiful inside. Very elegant with well-placed furniture; it really looks expensive. It's extremely well lit at night. The only problem is that the inner room's facilities are just okay! Actually, the toilet in my room flooded the entire bathroom with just two flushes, and we had to ask to have our room changed. Service: 4 - The service was excellent. They really care about their customers! When our toilet flooded, they were able to move us to a better room with a better view. Even when we reached our room, they met us there and decided to give us free internet charges, free movie passes for on-demand on the TV, and even wanted to comp our breakfast. (Which we politely refused the latter, because we didn't want to take too much.) Food: 3 - The food that they served us as a group, let's just say our last day when they served wraps was probably the best food of our weekend. I believe when serving big groups food, you should really work on improving the quality of the served food and the kind of food served. Even for breakfast, it would have been nice to have something like croissants rather than bagels--creating a more sophisticated breakfast is key!check-in: Quick, painless, easy. It took all of 50 seconds. Love it!Room: I got a king bed suite. The sitting area was nice with sofa, chair, and breakffast table.  There was a bathroom in the hallway with a shower, and a bathroom in the master with his/her sinks and tub-shower (extremely spacious- i'd say about the size of a NYC studio!).   There was a desk in the bedroom with a chair &amp; ottoman. It was a very cozy but spacious area that made my 2-night stay in enemy territory (I'm a wolverine!) enjoyable.Lounge: The executive lounge on the 7th floor is also spacious and welcoming. Breakfast in the morning was simple- omlette, hard-boiled eggs, juices, cereals, pastries, toast, and coffee. Evening reception was also delightful, but alcohol was charged to the room. Parking: free surface parking.Misc: The hotel is right next to a shopping mall, within walking distance. There are plenty of restaurants around that you can walk to, including the Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang's.Great stay and great staff!  Pool was excellent.  Super friendly check in (and fast--there was a line but more people jumped in to help right away).  Very clean.  Starbucks in the hotel is nice add on and the seating in the lobby was nice w live music.  We didn't eat in the hotel but it looked great!My family decided to host my sister's graduation dinner here last week. There were only two tables occupied in the dining room. It took us well over an hour to receive our food, most of which was cold and tasteless. The wait staff was horribly slow as well for only having two tables, and three waitress present. The room however was beautiful and quiet, but almost too quiet...there was no dinner music at all.Great hotel, beautiful and spacious rooms. Came down for a conference and the front desk staff was very helpful and polite. Even staff walking around said hello. Room was clean and newly renovated. The location is perfect for walking to gym, restaurants and shopping.  Can't wait to come back !!!Probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in Ohio. The location is great and the services offered are top notch. My biggest problem and the reason for a one star docking, is the lack of free WiFi, except for the lobby. I mean, come on, you get free WiFi at Best Westerns and the like. Similar to Jason's issues, you can get free WiFi if you are in their Hilton Honors program and have enough points or whatever, but i think this is silly and a big problem.The room I had was great. I did call ahead and made sure that a small refrigerator was in my room, I recommend you do the same. There seemed to be pillows of different firmness levels and I appreciated that. The TV was large although on some HD channels the signal suffered from some snow artifacts or signal loss. #firstworldproblems Everyday I received a paper under my door. I wish I could have opted out of that as I find it such a waste of paper and a source of guilt as I would like to read it, but didn't have the time. ha ha.  Ok, the gym situation. Decent and good enough for the majority of people. There are tons of treadmills. The free weights only go up to 50lbs. The cable machine is set apart in a room that includes a TV and hand sanitizer. The pool is connected to the gym and while I didn't take a dip in it, looked nice and clean. I wish I could have tried out the hot tub, my aching body would have loved it. In closing, if your work is paying the bill, stay here, if you are paying, you might want to check out more reasonably priced options.The Hilton Columbus at Easton went above and beyond to make my husband's birthday special. :) Back in December, I was looking for a fun place to take my husband for a special night out, since my family planned their annual Christmas gathering in Columbus on his birthday weekend (D'oh!). Since he loves the movie theatre at Easton, I thought staying On-property  would be a fun and convenient way to treat him. When I made the reservation, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and asked if they could do ""something special"" for him. When we arrived, the staff was welcoming and courteous, and when our room was not quite ready, they held our luggage and called a shuttle to drive us to the Theatre so we wouldn't have to walk in the rain. We returned to our hotel room to check in, and we were given our room assignment, which they had upgraded to a better view, and we given vouchers for breakfast in the hotel dining room the next morning! When we got up to the room, there was a beautiful balloon boquette that said ""Happy Birthday!"" on it. Thanks, Hilton Columbus at Easton (and Ashley at the front desk), for making me look like the best wife ever! ;)Remind me why a room is over $200 bucks here? The rooms look like your typical Holiday Inn.  The TV's cable doesn't work and had to wait an hour after check-in time because they didn't have any room ready. Hm. The lobby is pretty, but I'm not staying in the lobby. On a good note, I like the lit makeup mirror. It lit up. Other than that, might as well save a 100 bucks and stay at the Holiday Inn.Disclosure: I am a Hilton Honors Gold level customer. I also design and build web sites.Without question this hotel has the very worst WiFi ""system"" I have ever encountered at a Hilton or anywhere else. I have found the entire brand uniformly bad but none quite this bad.Having been burned before, I carefully quizzed the desk clerk about the log in process. I was given totally wrong information to include the password.Several phone calls ensued with very nice people who were rightfully embarrassed but equally unhelpful. It soon became apparent that the staff is even more annoyed than I about the ""system"". It wastes their time and energy having to deal with irate customers all the while insuring a drop in employee morale by making them look like idiots for a situation completely out of their control.Finally two  people, again nice people, showed up at my door and were able to log me on...using their own password... and suggested leaving well enough alone and not logging out. Should you you wish to use your iPhone or iPad in the lobby however, guess what, you must log in again to a different ""system"".To say that the Hilton brand relies on AT&amp;T for WiFi is an outrage is an understatement of the highest order. If you require WiFi stay somewhere else, anywhere else, but a Hilton brand.I had the Friday night buffet. The experience was not bad, but I expected more for the price.Buffett was so so.  Service was so-er so-er.  Prob won't be back.Had a great time getting awAy from home even just for one night. Had wonderful food &amp; drinks very nice !!! Thanks to one if the chefs !!Good wedding venue..I stayed here for my step-brother's wedding, and we had the wedding reception/dinner here as well.The hotel portion was decent, and what you'd expect for a Hilton.  Heated mirrors are a nice touch in the bathrooms, though the height of the heating element was such that the de-fogged portion was too high to be of use to me (I'm 5'7"").  Being adjacent to the Easton was nice, as it let me walk places (I was car-less).The wedding was small, family affair, with less than two-dozen total, and the bride and groom elected for a fancy dinner, rather than a reception.  Dinner was in the hotel, and the meal was impressive.  The went for a grand tour-de-force, with 12 courses.  Notes are as follows (and images are uploaded as well):1) Fresh tomato mozzarella with balsamic glaze - nice presentation with a sliced tomato alternative with fresh mozzarella slices.  Balsamic glaze drizzled over the plate, with fresh basil and pesto as a garnish2) Stuffed artichoke hearts - menu had a typo of ""Articoke"", but again, good presentation, and a nice amuse style artichoke heart3) Cheese and vine fruit - ridiculously large portion of cheeses and red and green grapes4) Portobello mushroom soup - rich, and a bit salty5) Grilled salad - never had anything like this before; it was a wedge of Rommaine that had been grilled, with some prosciutto and cheese, and a balsamic dressing6) Lemon Lime Sorbet - a nice palette cleanse before leading into the entrees7) Rosemary chicken with smashed potatoes, broccoli, and glazed carrots - the smashed potato balls were the highlight8) New York Strip with baby portobello mushrooms, asparagus, and Parisienne potatoes - strip was tender, and the sauce and mushrooms were fantastic9) fresh berries with lemon and cane sugar - this came with an edible flower, which was the first time I'd had one of these in person10) Creme brulee - massive; basically a small, tapered cocktail glass filled with creme brulee11) Chocolate lava cake - this was super rich and decadent12) Chocolate truffles - the group called it quits at this point, and we had this to go; I never got around to eating it . . . Overall, rad presentation, but  the food didn't seem to match the appearance.  I get that two dozen is a large party, but the food definitely tasted like banquet/buffet style food - high-end banquet/buffet, but still a bit rubbery on the chicken, a bit overdone on the beef, and generous use of sauces and salt to make up for shortcomings in prep.The courses were surprisingly large for a 12 course meal, and the timing was just off.  The wait staff seemed on it, but the food just came out with large delays between courses - the whole meal above took almost four hours, which was fine as we were celebrating the union of families, and everyone was hanging out and having a good time, but as far as dining goes, definitely room for improvement.We had brunch at the hotel the following morning as well, which was good as well.So, overall, the Hilton is what you'd expect - high-end hotel, but still mainstream.  Nothing that knocked my socks off, but everything from the room to the fitness center, to the meals was executed competently, and leaving no room for complaint.Easily one of the best suburban hotels in the country.If you're going to have a business meeting in the Columbus area, this is the place to do it. There are several restaurants within walking distance (probably 100-200 yards away) that would be suitable.Let me address some of the concerns I saw in the other reviews.The price: The Hilton is geared for business travelers and charges prices . If you're looking for a better price with some sacrifice in not having to coordinate driving dozens of people around, the Hilton Garden Inn is about half the price and 2 blocks away.There is WiFi in the rooms and throughout the hotel. It's free if you're Gold or Diamond HHonors. It's fast, too. I was able to use FaceTime without any issues.Bed was great, shower was hot and the iron worked. There's free parking and the parking lot is laid out very well so that you're never far away. There's really no need to use the valet here.The short version is, if you're in the upper tiers of HHonors because you travel frequently, this hotel is for you and you'll appreciate it. If you're a casual traveler, you're probably going to find it expensive and you'll probably be happier with the Hilton Garden Inn.After seeing all of the good reviews for the Friday night Seafood and Prime Rib buffet, we decided to try it. If it was possible to give negative stars for a rating, I would. We made a reservation, as suggested. The dining area was very busy. I started with a cup of clam chowder, eight pieces of peel and eat shrimp, and one oyster on the half shell (it was the last one available and I had seen several on plates around the dining room and passing by). The soup had okay flavor but the clams were a little chewy. The shrimp was fine and cleaned properly -- it's hard to mess up peel and eat shrimp! My boyfriend had returned to the table with more oysters, freshly stocked and had eaten them right away. When I ate mine, I immediately realized they had not been kept cold enough. The oyster was warm. We moved on and tried the crab legs, which were barely warm and they were water-logged. We stopped after a couple of those. I could see the sushi table from where I was sitting and could see there was no way to keep the sushi cold. After the oyster incident, I knew I wasn't risking sushi. The risotto looked sticky and unappealing and there were no au gratin potatoes refilled while we were there (not long). The real treat came later when we were both sick from consuming the ill-prepared food. There is no way I could eat $36 worth of the horrible excuse for food that was served. I gladly pay that price at authentic seafood restaurants, such as the Pearl, Bonefish Grill, or Hyde Park. I expected way more from this Hilton establishment. Terribly disappointing to say the least.","Seafood buffet was mostly delicious!! There weren't a wide variety of selections, but whatever they had was tasty from the fresh fruits to oysters on the half shells! All the fruits I had tasted so sweet! There was a salad bar, one type of soup-clam chowder, and a pasta station with a chef ready to make you a plate of pasta with your choice of mussels, shrimps, clams, scallops, and vegetables. I chose a mix of sauces for my pasta and it came out well flavored and zesty! There was also prime-rib, but it was a little dry. We were there when they had just opened for dinner so we got slices from the end, and not the pink center of that chunk of prime rib. We were there for the seafood so we can overlook this mishap!We also had fresh sashimi and sushi there. There was a chef at the sushi station preparing and cutting the fish so you know it is fresh!!! The salmon sashimi literally melted in my mouth!! I went back to the sushi station for thirds!They offered other dishes of cooked salmon, flounder, stripe bass, chicken paella, potatoes, asparagus, and yam. I tasted all of them. I was more than impressed!Last, but not least, our gang wrapped up a satisfying dinner with dessert!! They must have had over ten different choices. We tried the tiramisu, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and some type of sticky nutty pie!! Let me tell you, they were all to die for!! Overall, the best experience with a seafood buffet in C-bus!! The service was friendly and prompt- our water glasses were never empty! Bottom line, I would come back to this place, and recommend it for you seafood lovers!The price is $31.95 per person for the seafood buffet, which is every friday from 5 pm- 10pm?? I believe.Friday seafood buffet is one of the best deals in Columbus if you like seafood--raw oysters, chilled snow crab legs, chilled shrimp with tasty housemade cocktail sauce and fresh-prepared sashimi and sushi!  The pasta station allows you to create your own sauce, I recommend mixing half Alfredo and half marinara sauce.  From the sushi bar the seared tuna and salmon sashimi are great.  There is also cooked fish with capers, cucumber, egg, and tomato garnish.  The dessert bar is great, having all sorts of cakes including cheesecake and carrot cake.  My favorite dessert was the tiramisu. Would definitely come back again!The Friday night buffet at the Easton Hilton has been in the talk threads lately. All seafood loving Yelpers should check this buffet out as soon as possible. We made a reservation and they showed us to our table as soon as we arrived. The dining room is not very big, so the buffet line was never super crowded. There were a lot of great choices the night we visited. Sushi, sashimi, smoked salmon, crab legs, oysters, peel and eat shrimp, and lots of hot entrees including prime rib, pork loin, grouper, and jambalaya. There was a delicious sweet potato gratin that I could not stop eating. There's also a nice salad bar, a big spread of fruit, and a selection of rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious. The only part of the meal that didn't wow me was dessert. Everything was cakes and pies. Delicious for sure, but it would have been cool if there were some cookies or brownies or chocolate covered strawberries. I guess I was looking for more colorful, smaller bites. Service was great. I encourage you to check this buffet out as soon as you can. We had a fantastic meal and we will be back!I am a frequent business traveller and a frequent patron of Hilton hotels and, unfortunately, I was not a fan of this hotel.  They charge an arm and a leg for a room here and it definitely didn't live up to what I'd expect.  I arrived late due to hours of flight delays and had to run through the airport for the last shuttle.  I called the hotel to tell them I was going to be there right at 10:45pm when the last shuttle was scheduled to leave the airport but they were still about to pull away when I ran up at 10:45 on the dot.  Why not hold the shuttle for one minute people?Upon arrival, rooms on the concierge floor were sold out.  That's fine, I'm used to that.  I was put into a room with double beds instead on the 4th floor.  Here's the kicker...The room had no heat.  Seriously?  Now it's after 11pm and I need to get up at 5am.  I have zero energy to switch rooms, deal with maintenance, etc.  I instead opted to sleep with the blankets over my head.  It wasn't fun.  The fitness center is decent (two rooms...one for cardio equipment, one for weights) and the pool is quite nice.  I had trouble with the audio on the tv on my treadmill but no big deal...At least I arrived early enough to not have to wait for one.  The concierge level breakfast is standard.  Good coffee, some fresh fruit, lots of seating in the lounge.  The business center is convenient and free but no WiFi in the rooms.  It's about time to equip this place with wireless.  If you don't have status there, you pay for the very, very slow hard-wire internet which is your only option unless you sit in the lobby.  I informed the front desk of my heat troubles upon check-out.  They said they'd have someone go up and look at it.  I expected some sort of reparation (toss me some Hilton Honors points like Marriott does when something like this happens) but no dice.  I did submit an online feedback form and got a call from someone at the hotel but haven't had a chance to call them back yet.  It's nice that they replied to my feedback but again, it's unfortunate that I had to go that far.I stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night as it was close enough to cab to my work holiday party. You have to check in at a podium before you enter to make sure you were really a guest. You have the option to valet,but we self parked in the adjacent garage. Warning. It is a hike to the lobby from this garage. Especially when you are trying to play super heroes and carry everything at once! Room was nice, but I feel like they could have included a small fridge and free wifi for the cost of the room. I have paid less in downtown Chicago. The trash cans were minuscule as well. This would be fine if you could recycle, but I didn't see any receptacles to do so. Also, the signal kept going in and out on the tv. Annoying more to my husband than to me. It is in a nice location, but I probably won't stay there again.My company of 7 partners (along with their significant others) decided to hold our Christmas party at Easton including hotel rooms at the Hilton. While I had never stayed there before, I had always understood the Hilton was the ""flagship"" hotel (whatever that means) for the Easton area. In hindsight, while we will continue to do our Christmas get-aways every year, we will definitely NOT be at the Hilton.It started with the valet parking and went down hill from there. It's snowing in Columbus, but they chose to park our car outside by the entrance rather than the normal valet parking garage. Gee, thanks. And before we checked in, we found out the hotel screwed up our rooms and gave us full size beds rather than the reserved (confirmed) king sized beds. So we asked at the desk but no Kings were available. But of course those of our party who checked in later managed to get King sized beds. Would have been nice if they could have told us we could have Kings if we waited. But that would require someone at the desk actually caring about their customers, which I assure you, they didn't. We found the desk service to be cold and perfunctory.So off to our room we go, and they have given us an ADA room. Oh, now I'm just loving this place. Perhaps they could have mentioned that at the desk and asked us if that was alright. Sadly, no. So between the curbless shower that soaks the bathroom, and the closet that doesn't function, I'm pretty disgusted given the money we paid for our rooms.So we head down to the lobby bar where we find the only bartender in Columbus with little or no personality. In fairness, he wasn't rude, just cold. Not the way you normally expect to be treated in the bar. Fortunately, we spent the rest of the night at local restaurants, so all went well.But the next morning (and yes, this is the honest truth), we awoke to the sound of a jackhammer operating inside the hotel. Apparently, some bathroom maintenance had been scheduled for 8:00 Sunday morning. At this point in time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there.While I am sure most people's experience isn't as dreadful as ours, we certainly won't be returning. And the icing on the cake was the apathetic attitude we got from the hotel staff. It is my intent to show them the same attitude.We come to Columbus several times each year for a quick weekend vacation, and we almost always stay at the Hilton at Easton. Why, you ask? The gorgeous property, for starters. If I didn't know better, I'd never guess this hotel was in Columbus, OH, let alone the midwest, just by looking at it. The styling is both elegant and contemporary. Next, the attentive staff. In the 20+ times we've stayed in this hotel, I don't think we've ever come across an employee who wasn't up to Hilton's high service standard. Seriously, everyone from the valet attendants at the main entrance to the clerks at the front desk are nothing less than helpful and friendly. In many cases, they've gone above and beyond to ensure that our stay was enjoyable. Also, the location simply cannot be beat. With Easton Town Center just a quick walk across the parking lot, you'll be entertained for an entire long weekend. Valet parking is available for $10 per day, and they keep most of the valeted cars in a well-lit area directly in front of the hotel's entrance. Overall, the Hilton at Easton is a great choice if you're looking for a relaxing stay in Columbus.This place is not good but if you want to be in Easton it is the best. By any real city big hotel standards, this place wont even place, so be sure to adjust your expectations. The staff are generally uninspired so don't expect to feel special at all at any time. I don't really need that, but when the same guy checks you in 6 sundays in a row at 9:45PM, you expect a ""welcome back"".  The guest rooms are truly designed to make you feel like you are sleeping in your grandmother's guest room: old beds, worn carpets, striped curtains, dark wood with gold-ish fixtures. The real treat with this place is that the wireless internet is terrible (so don't expect to catch up on a new show) and if you wake up at the wrong time you will NOT have hot water. To me there are three things that any hotel has to do: not have bed begs, have hot water, and have good internet. The fail at two (dont worry -- you probably wont get beg bugs though the carpet is very old). Cant wait for the next 20 nights I have to spend here for work... enjoy.One of the most disappointing business hotels I've stayed in and definitely not up to Hilton's standard. The hotel is fairly new but the condition of my room was poor. At 7 am there was no hot water in the shower. To make things worse, the tepid water didn't drain fast enough and by the end of my quick and frigid shower, I was standing in ankle deep water.Wi-Fi in my room was very weak.  If I was standing near the door to the room, I had plenty of signal.  If I was sitting at the desk, I had absolutely 0 signal.  My room by the way was not at some distant end of the hotel.  I was about as close to the middle as a room could be.  Fourth floor, six or so rooms toward the middle of the floor from the elevator.In the room, one of the electrical outlets on the desk didn't work, one of the wall mounted fixtures in the bathroom was hanging out of the wall, and the fluorescent bulb over the toilet was unbelievably dim.The only good thing I can say about this Hilton is that it is conveniently located to the mall at Easton (not sure the official name) and there are several acceptable restaurants within a very short walk.The next time I'm in this area I'll stay at the Courtyard by Marriott which is also at the mall at Easton.One of my favorite hotels to stay at. Great service and the like. One complaint....internet should be free...especially for Hilton Honors Guests. Im paying enough to be here....no more nickel and diming.This has to be one of the finest hotels not only in Columbus, but in all of Ohio. It is beautiful! As soon as you walk into the foyer, your wallet starts shaking! You know right away that you're going to drop some coin in this place - even if you don't stay overnight.The rooms are georgeous. The restaurant is spectacular. The decor is breathtaking. What more do you need in a hotel (except affordable pricing) :-) It's a great place for weddings and business events as well.The best part about this Hilton Hotel (to me) is the lounge on Saturday nights. The live music is absolutely fabulous. Typically, you will hear one of the finest Jazz bands around. Get there early, because this is a real hot spot.Wonderful experience.  The room was a comfortable size, the bed was very enjoyable.  A big plus were the pillows, exactly what we would have wished for.  The towels were awesome, for a moment there I had to fight myself against asking if they were available for purchase.  Check-in was a breeze, very friendly too.  We didn't make a lot of requests, but every one was quickly and cheerfully attended to.  We enjoyed brunch Saturday morning.  The brunch items were a little cool, but not too bad.  Terrific selection and great job keeping things fresh.  Loved the make-up mirror in the guest room.  It was a wonderful surprise that current movies were available on the pay per view.  After a long day of being out and about we loved curling up with our dessert carryout and watching a movie that was playing too late in the theater across the street.  We will definitely do our best to go back again...and again.From the moment you pull into the parking lot, it is clear this is a fancy, expensive hotel. This is absolutely a 5 star place to stay if you do not care at all about how you spend your money. I'm not one of those people. It keeps three stars for a clean, well-designed room, a very comfortable bed, a very nice pool and work-out facility and a pretty good location. Some don't like the fact that this hotel is sandwiched between a mall and the Easton shopping center, but I think many travelers would appreciate the convenience of a variety of shopping outlets and eateries, all within walking distance. The food delivered from room service was also very well-prepared. I would give 3.5 stars if I could. It loses one star for charging $10/day for internet. I'm not saying I will NEVER give 5 stars to a hotel that charges daily for internet, but it would take a LOT for me to do so. I'm taking away another star for a lack luster personal experience I had. To try to keep a boring story short, I was told by the front desk staff that I could find a deck of playing cards in the hotel gift shop. I was NOT told that the gift shop was currently closed. So I came down, saw the gift shop was closed, and turned around to head back to my room. One of the bellboys asked if I needed anything and when I explained that I had just come down to get cards not realizing the shop was closed, he helpfully said, ""No problem! I can get someone to get in there and get them for you."" Wow, I thought, that's really great service! Not so much. It turns out he just got a manager (which took awhile) to get into the shop, and charge the hotel's 7.25% sales tax on their already exorbitantly priced cards in addition to a 7.25% ""after hours"" tax for going into the store less than an hour after it closed. Furthermore, the manager couldn't be bothered to find out how much the playing cards actually cost. And of course, they could only charge it to my room.Very fresh sushi and amazing taste. Seafood buffet is the one you don't want miss for your Friday dinner. The only problem that bothers me may be the cost.Had my wedding reception (brunch) and stayed for a couple of nights in a suite. My wife had the room the night before our wedding and I stayed at Best Western off 71. Wow I loved the suite. It was amazing and fun to be in a great location. A lot of people go, ""Wow expensive for a shopping mall..."" But come on -- Easton is not just a shopping mall. It is an awesome location, but parking can be an issue.Internet is $10, but if you can afford to stay at the Hilton you can afford the $10 -- and I know it's a nuissance, but still.Can't wait to go back and spend a few more days in a suite.The Hilton is the nicest hotel offered in the area but I found a hair in my bathroom when I first got to the room and when I picked up the phone to call housekeeping, there was another hair under the ear piece.  The wifi is not free, bad instant coffee in the room - don't waste your time and the room service is expensive but overall, good stay.Very nice hotel. We stayed here for a wedding. The reception was in one of the ballrooms. Even though there were other weddings going on....it wasn't bothersome. The room we stayed in was nice but the decor was kinda ugly. It was comfortable though.Pretty average Hilton. If you're shopping at the Easton Mall it's perfect. It's older. The rooms are fairly small. The bed wasn't too great. It's was super crowded when we were there which made check-in seem like it took a lifetime. I'd only stay here if you plan on shopping, eating, and drinking in Easton.This was my second trip and although it's billed as a ""Prime Rib Buffet"" the real star of the show is the sashimi.  I had two plates of it and debated skipping everything else and just eating more of it.  But I didn't.  I had a small piece of prime rib and some vegetables, and some pasta from the pasta bar and a pretty big piece of strawberry cake.  Whew!  The same price, $29.95.  This is an amazing price when you think about it.One of Columbus' top hotels. This place is great. Five stars from me!  Beautiful lobby. Small bar, but plenty of cushiony areas to sit and enjoy a drink. Beautiful restaurant. Rooms are very nice. Top-notch hotel. Stay here if on the east side of Columbus!","Very nice property.  A bit expensive for staying at a shopping mall.A bit pricey but overall a nice hotel. In a fantastic location, close to shopping and restaurants. The rooms are a bit small I feel but the staff is super accommodating and friendly.Very nice convenient to shopping and food. I enjoyed my stay for business. Suprising that they do not have wireless in the room but do have a fairly quick wired. We ate the restaurant in the hotel which was very nice. The concierage floor was well stocked for breakfast but no oatmeal. Come on I need a healthy start. I rate it a 3, not because it was bad just because it was ok for a Hilton of this size.Very nice, impressive hotel with great facilities. Stayed here a week ago for business travel and was quite happy with my stay. Like all Hiltons, it's perfectly standardized so everything is convenient and familiar.Nice location out adjacent to the shrine to chain-based gratuitous consumption that is Easton, if you're into that stuff. I was there on a sunday night and so it was calm, but I can't imagine what a zoo that place gets to be on most nights.Glad I was there on business....yikes, that's a lot of money for the suburban midwest!!!Great hotel in a wonderful location. Walk to movies, restaurants, shopping, or whatever you want. Full service, wonderful hotel. Definitely stay here on your visit to Columbus.",,"['absolutely', 'perfect', 'service', 'makes', 'great', 'along', 'approx', 'family', 'members', 'family', 'event', 'nearby', 'first', 'impression',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-columbus-columbus-3,Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Columbus,2.0,$$,22,"Stayed here for two full weeks for work in January 2015, had my trusty yellow lab with me, and we both enjoyed our stay very much.  This place may be a little older, but it's affordable and it may be on the end of an access road but it's far enough from foot traffic, and the general public that there's no ""omg crime!"" feeling to it. I guess I'm a connossieur of shady alleys and vacant lots as it were...The room was very clean when I arrived.  It had a kitchenette with a dishwasher, full size stove and oven, a microwave, coffee maker, and a full size fridge. Even had plates, glasses, and silverware!  Bed was comfy, diagonally sprawled dog notwithstanding. Free breakfast wasn't terrible, coffee, cereal and fresh fruit worked for me.  Management were super friendly, and very helpful.  After reading the other reviews on here I feel like I stayed at a different hotel than the rest of you...Awful. The staff are fine, but this should really qualify as a motel. In fact, I've stayed at better motels. Non-smoking room but downstairs they smoke so you're screwed anyways. Breakfast is barely edible - go elsewhere for your breakfast, really. Although rooms are spacious, they look so ancient and the bathrooms so worn out that it takes a lot to pretend you're paying money for this. So why did I even book here? It was the cheapest last-minute booking I could get that claimed to be near the airport. Yes, CLAIMED, because it's not close. Think 15-20 min ride. Oh and the shuttle is an independent contractor so you have to book 24hrs in advance. The only reason this even gets a star (other than that Yelp doesn't let you put 0 stars) is there is a mall nearby you can escape to, and the sheets and towels are clean. I had a great time in Columbus, this definitely made the experience less than.Really crappy place in my opinion - avoid staying here.Firstly they advertise free shuttle to and from the airport but you've gotta book that 24 hours in advance, which you discover once you phone them. Then they tell you it's a $20 taxi ride. Actually it's a $35 taxi ride from the airport. Then I get there and the first room is literally wet inside - they'd just had a rain storm come through and the roof leaked in multiple places leaving literally a desk soaked in water and the carpeted bathroom soaked to the bone.The staff were friendly enough and changed my room. But the second one the AC wasn't working properly and emitted a nasty bug spray/mold kind of smell that made me literally cough and gag and felt like it was burning my eyes. They had no other rooms. Who knows what I breathed all night, but at midnight I was out of options to go elsewhere. I saw a couple of other people leave, telling the clerk that the hotel wasn't fit to stay in, so it wasn't just me.If I was doing this again I'd stay closer to the  airport in a better hotel - while it'll have a higher room rate, you'll save on taxis and you'll sleep without worrying about your health. This is not the smart place to stay - the bad reviews you read on here are absolutely accurate. The people who say they like it - there is no way it's this hotel, or maybe there are 1 or 2 rooms out of the many that they just got lucky with. If there was a zero star option I'd do it.Whew if I could give zero stars I would! The male staff was great, the room was okay besides the couple of giant spiders and the fact that my door barely shut!!! The main issue was the fact that there are several people who LIVE here and the minute you show up its like you showed up to the wrong neighborhood! People glare at you constantly and they are outside loud as can be all hours of the night in the parking lot like a block party and the front desk seems to deal with it because they live there! Also the wifi was ""not working"" for the whole four days I was there! Avoid this place like a plague! The whole area around this place is not good at all either! Not female or kid friendly at all!!!This hotel is one that should permanently stay off your radar.  The hotel is old with very few upgrades and did I say old?  It has a grimy feel to it...the wall paper in the bathroom is coming off due to age and water damage, the appliances are outdated, the furniture is old and needs replacing, the TV is way too small for the room and you physically can't view it from the bed because it won't turn that far, the room as a whole was fairly clean in appearance but with everything else it didn't feel clean.  Check-in was extremely painful and slow.  The hotel doesn't even have a credit card reader...the attendant who appeared to be the owner had to type my credit card in (seriously...are you kidding me).  This place is a total waste of money if you are looking for any creature comforts.  However if you like a sub par establishment that has fairly large rooms in a crappy location then look no further because you've hit the jackpot.  In all seriousness save yourself some time and stay at the Hampton across the street.  I'm surprised that Wyndham would even link their name to a run down place like this.  I personally will never stay in a Hawthorne again!!!  This was a blind pick for a one night stay and thank God for that because if my stay were any long I would switch hotels.  I truly hope this feedback helps if you are thinking about staying here.  Take this humble advice and don't!!!!Would not stay here again. Shuttle only operates 6a-11p. Both my flights were outside of these hours. There were no sheets for the pull out bed. The couch was dirty. The pool was not usable. Need I say more? NO. Pass this oneIf I had to choose just one word to describe this hotel, I would say ""dirty"".Upon walking in our room last night, the smell hit us as we opened the door. I don't know how to describe the smell but unpleasant and musty will give you a good idea. Then I was actually pleasantly surprised, as the hotel was set up like many Residence Inn properties are. But that was just upon first look, it was actually an old Residence Inn that they had let fall apart and not taken care of.In the bathroom, the toilet seat was stained yellow in some spots. As I sat there the ceiling dripped on my head! I looked down to see a puddle at my feet. It was a rainy night but we were on the first floor! The ceiling was also breaking off and dropping as it continued to get wetter and wetter.I peaked in the tub to see a dirty tub floor and a piece of toilet paper dried to the side of the tub. No clue how it got there, or more importantly why it was not cleaned off.There was a HUGE cobweb over our bed on a picture frame. I killed two spiders, a handful of ants and had to just let the flies and gnats fly around all night. I can understand bugs get in but there was evidence that they had been there and the hotel made no effort to seal the holes which they came through or clean up the webs and other areas they had made. The housekeeping clearly does the bare minimum. There was a piece of food in the utensil drawn (could have easily been picked up when cleaning), food pieces underneath the sink area and my favorite, a curly hair on the drinking glass by the sink.This place is dirty and not well taken care of. The only good thing, which also happens to be one of the most important things is that the sheets looked clean and the bed was comfortable. This is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1, if the sheets were dirty- forget it.I would not have stayed more than one night and at that, I would not have chosen to stay here in the first place, except all of the hotels in the area were completely booked on a Tuesday night! This was my first and last Hawthorn experience.Not pleased. That was how it started.The check in was slow, but I really wasn't too bothered by that. We stayed here because we got a really cheap deal and wanted to stay somewhere on the way to where we were going to do our 5k the next morning. However, after that it got really weird. We made our way back to our room towards the back of the hotel complex. Upon getting to our room we noticed the window was cracked and we could hear the TV was loudly on. We knocked. No one answered. I double checked the room number on the paper work and key the front desk gave us and it matched. I then figured maybe the maids had just left the TV on. I opened the door... and there was a man laying on the couch watching TV. He looked surprised when we opened the door, but he didn't get up right a way. ""Sorry!"" I exclaimed and started to walk back out and away. Then he got up, turned off the TV, gave me a confused look and scurried out the door softly mumbling ""Oops! I'm sorry."" I stood at the door confused with my husband... not feeling very keen on the situation.I called the front desk, and they said ""Oh! What did he look like....(long pause)... That must have been one of our property maintenance workers. It should be fine. I'm sorry.""""Do I need to do something, Is the room not ready?"" I replied.""No, it should be fine. Don't worry about it, your room is ready for you.""Uhhh call me picky, but that isn't ready. I know they may have been unaware he was in there, but I was just not down with this whole experience. Additionally there was a spot in our room where there was obviously water damaged by the bathroom and the floor was soft with the carpet damp. It was not the cleanest room I have ever stayed in. The check out was also painstakingly slow. This hotel is close to the freeway, but not entirely convenient to other things. There are some grocery stores and restaurants in the area... but its not great. The breakfast in the morning was okay.. but it was upstairs in a small room and it was very crowded. I have had much better hotel experiences from other hotels in this same price range. I will not be coming back to this hotel. Just. No thanks. No coming back from that initial impression.Hawthorn Suites for the price, king size bed, full kitchen and  free breakfast is worth it.  I don't know if I would stay here for business for several days but, if you need a clean, roomy, comfortable king size bed this place will do.  We fly into Columbus from the west coast so we get in extremely late.  This place is not very close to the airport and the neighborhood is a little shady after dark if you keep driving down Hamilton Rd.It is right off the highway and now that we know where to go it's a 10 mins drive from the airport.  Anyhow, this place is clean, our room suite was spacious for 2 adults and 1 kid who slept on the pull sofa.  They did have linens for the pull out which was nice.  The free breakfast included all 3 of us and the breakfast staff were very accommodating and friendly.This is the place work put me in and for a guy that works 18-20hr days it ain't a bad setup although outdated and I had to buy cleaner and cleaned it myself to know it is clean it's not to bad BUT it's Easter Sunday breakfast ends at 9:30 and at 8:30 the lazy worker who probably wanted to go home early said I couldn't make pancakes thanks for ruining my Easter had to set my alarm to get there early and now I am starving and awakewouldn't suggest staying here, the rooms are dirty the couch all stained up, the bath tub was corroded and dirty, the front desk was useless, shady people hanging around outside,  and to top it off I'm pretty sure it's a hooker hotel,  6 hookers and their pimp at the breakfast...  Gross...I booked through Orbitz which thought it was close to the airport- NOT-  in small letters on the hotels website it says they have transportation to the airport- false advertising-  I paid $40 to the airport by taxi and $40 back to the hotel-  I missed my flight leaving Columbus because of having to wait for taxi to arrive-  rooms were dirty, there were exposed outlets without covers, sheets were thin and mended- overall one of the worst stays ever.If you want a DIRTY MOTEL, on a dead end access road, this is the place for you! When I heard I was booked at a Wyndam Hotel, I was originally happy. My happiness was put into question when I pulled up and got into my room. It's obvious the cleaning crew does not care one bit about this place. Or, maybe the owner will not put up the funds to actually clean and keep up this place. Tubs are stained, walls roughly patched and not painted, dirty handprints around all door openings, greasy head stains on couch, stains all over chair at my desk, spider webs, filth and dust on walls in cooking area. This place is just gross. I think some people may actually live in some of the units. Traffic in and out of some rooms all through the night. My colleague in another room had restless people up all night walking around in the room above him. Do yourself, your family or your employees a favor and stay somewhere else. Actual photos of my room to be posted soon.Rooms are large and the staff is very pleasant. This is where the good stuff stops. Only two burners on the stove work which fits since there are only two pots. The bathroom ceiling is falling in  the furniture is all stained and worn out. TV is small. Ants in the bathroom. Maid service doesn't come until 7pm. For long term stay it was terrible. I had already paid for a week but would not stay any longer. They wanted $84 dollars a night. Should have been around $34. It's run down in a crappy neighborhood.This place sucks! A group of 8 of us stayed at this place (which we were told the rooms were big enough to accommodate), and each of our keys didn't work when we got back to our room three times! They never cleaned, never supplied enough towels and we're always out of things. It's not a very nice place to begin with but the least they could do is run the place like a hotel. Don't stay here, you've been warned.You know that feeling when you step onto a subway platform in a large city and you're suddenly afraid for your life? The stench of urine is so strong, you're just sure somebody must be making stew out of it.  The homeless guy sitting on the ground looks as though he'd like to relieve you of your personal belongings. Small animals are in the trash cans, digging for their dinner, and the lights are flickering on and off like a b-roll horror film?Welcome to the Hawthorne Hotel by Wyndham in Columbus.When I read the reviews for this place, I must have missed the bit about it being in a dead end back alley, surrounded by abandoned businesses and condemned buildings.  The premise for this place is fantastic. The setup would be perfect for a family to visit here, and it was probably a great place 20 years ago.  Since then, holes have been punched in the walls, stains have been mysteriously left on every upholstered surface, and the bathrooms have been drenched in urine. (I bought my own cleaning supplies, trying to rid the bathroom of the smell, but it didn't even touch it.  I assume someone had terrible aim and got the ceiling or wallpaper behind the toilet.) When I complained about the stench, I was told, ""Yeah, we've been having a problem with housekeeping.""The outside trash cans were teeming with stray cats, the other guests were mostly fixing cars in the parking lot and letting off fireworks at 11pm.  Some lovely young lady, obviously well over the legal blood alcohol limit, and what should have been her own personal limit, really, came to visit our door at 1 in the morning, screaming for, ""Yvonne! Get out here!  Where Yvonne?""I will say, the linens were clean and fresh and the refrigerator worked very well.Other than that, run! Run far, far away.Unless, of course, you have a wayward teen and you want to scare him straight.  If so, by all means, bring him here!Just make sure you have all your shots first.I ended up staying at Hawthorn Suites due to a cancelled flight and last minute need to book the absolutely cheapest hotel possible.Unfortunately, this place as the word ""airport"" in its name and Expedia listed it as such.  Take note, fellow desperate travelers, this place is NOWHERE near the airport.  It's a $35 cab ride away from the airport.  So much for saving money?Upon my arrival I meet a surly woman at the front desk, who is swearing rudely at someone on the other end of the telephone, explaining that whatever the issue was, it was not the hotel's fault.  After a few minutes of uncomfortable waiting in a humid, dirty front desk area that could only remind me of the Howard Johnson's I stayed at when my parents visited me while I was in college where someone was murdered the same night we stayed, the front desk agent greeted me by saying ""Expedia people suck.""  To this, I could only respond with tired sarcasm stating that I just booked on Expedia and was checking in.  By the way, I don't suck.I am given a key to a room and am provided with a vague, poorly drawn map that would help me find where my room was.  I get lost while going there and have to drag my bags through a few puddles and mushy grass.  I was in the back of this place at the end of a shady road and considering the amount of windows in this suite, I was utterly convinced that I would be murdered that night.Needless to say I was not murdered.  The room was a total dead zone for both phone and wifi, so connecting to the outside world was a bit tough.  If using an electronic device at Hawthorn is on your to-do list, cancel your reservation.The breakfast was atrocious.  It's a buffet brunch gone bad.  Please, can hotels/motels start offering real food?  Otherwise, just stop.The shuttle to the airport must be prebooked so do not forget to take care of that 24 hours before you leave.  It's another long ride back to the airport, so plan accordingly.  The driver was nice enough but started getting into a bit too much of her personal business while we chatted on the drive back.  It was awkward and I almost felt bad for the woman driving me.In short, unless you absolutely need to stay here to gain the convenience of a suite with a full kitchen and living room set up, skip this entirely.I'm in Columbus for business several times a year and this is always my go to hotel.  The standard suites are like studio apartments complete with full kitchens.  For a real treat, go for the penthouse suites (2 bed, 2 bath) which are even nicer.The complimentary breakfast is quite a step up from the traditional continental breakfast found at other hotels.This hotel offers quite a lot for a reasonable price and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Columbus.  It's conveniently located about 10 minutes east of Downtown right off I-70.This hotel is slopppy, smelly, dirty, and not close to the airport like I thought.  When I asked for something simple like towels, I was told they housekeeping staff had went home and I had to come get them from the front desk which required me to get re-dressed, go outside and walk to the front desk. If you can avoid this hotel, please do! Its not worth the money. If you just need a place to sleep and nothing else, then this is a place for you.I definitely agree with Nijole's assessment that this is not a 4 star hotel, but the service and rooms definitely make your stay worth it. I was a bit skeptical about the location / neighborhood and how affordable it was. My assumption was sketchy neighborhood + low cost = bring a sleeping bag. Yet, after checking into the Wyndham and settling into our room, there was no doubt that we made a wise decision. Our room was more like a spacious one-bedroom apartment than a hotel room. The comfort of the bed, the open floor plan, and the kitchen caused us to want to stay longer than the one night that we had booked. When we awoke and went to breakfast, my wife and I were floored by the choices - fresh fruit, yogurt, milk, juice, breads, bagels, waffle bar, and cereals. Typically, when we travel, we have to eat after we leave the hotel because there are very few options available to individuals with a gluten allergy. This was definitely NOT true here. On top of the aforementioned non-glutenous options were several bins that contained eggs, sausage and hash browns. We toasted some gluten-free bread to make breakfast sandwiches. Sandy, the woman setting up the breakfast, was very attentive, genuine and gracious. She went out of her way to check on us and ensured that we lacked nothing. Our stay here was full of friendly staff and good food. Good food, friendly staff, comfortable beds, and an affordable price.  We will definitely stay here again.","I had checked with the hotel beforehand about airport shuttle availability, because, you know, a lot of the times places that have ""airport"" in their name aren't that close to the airport, and are trying to save on the shuttle and don't run it at all times, or run on an infrequent schedule, or else the shuttle has to be reserved in advance and is booked out for the next morning by the time you arrive in the evening... the answer the hotel gave was ""the shuttle runs until 12:30 am"". I arrived at CMH at 1218 am and called the hotel immediately for the shuttle. Hotel called back at 1222 am and advised that shuttle was unavailable, cab had been ordered, estimated arrival 4 to 8 minutes. Fifteen minutes later, no cab. After multiple calls to hotel, hotel advised that Cab 839 was on the way. No Cab 839. At 1244 hotel advised taking first available Orange Cab, and said this was agreed upon with the Orange Cab company. I asked the first Orange cab in the airport line; its driver refused to convey, and stated he wouldn't get reimbursed by the hotel. I then asked the same driver to carry at the regular, non-negotiated passenger rate. The cabbie refused again. I called the hotel and informed that I would take the first available non-Orange cab, and asked the hotel to reimburse the ride. The hotel refuses to reimburse, and states again that Cab 839 is on its way.At 1258 hotel called and advised Cab 839 was at the airport ready to pick up, however there was no Cab 839 in sight. At 0102 am Cab 839 finally arrived (promised time was 1226 to 1230 am). I take a picture to document the arrival time. Cab driver then refuses to convey. I call the hotel and ask to cancel the room, and refund the rate (Expedia prepaid). The hotel refused.I then called Columbus police, it arrived, along with the cabbies' super. The police and the super instructed the driver of Cab 839 to convey. I finally arrived at the hotel at 0144 am.Now however terrible this Orange Cab may be, which is a separate matter, it wasn't me who opted to bring it into the picture. The hotel chose not to operate the shuttle, and it was also the hotel that chose to contract with this Orange Cab. It was also the hotel that refused to reimburse a regular taxi fare once difficulties surfaced with a contracted cab, and it was the hotel that refused to cancel the reservation after it became obvious that getting to the hotel would be an issue.Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a 4 star hotel, my experience there however was.This was our first ""home"" in Columbus and we stayed in one of their suites for a month.Everyone there, from the managers, the cleaning crew, the lady in charge of breakfast and the rest of the staff was very very friendly, accomidating and made us feel welcome and a nice introduction to what we were about to encounter in Columbus.The pool was clean and well kept, as well as the hot tub.They have a good variety at their breakfast which is included with the meal.My son enjoyed making his own waffles every morning and I had a hard time deciding between the fresh bagels, jogurts and cereal or going all out with potatos, eggs, sausage and fresh fruit, so I usually opted for a bit of everything which held us through till dinner.That is also free on wednesdays.Our suite was clean and had a living room, full kichen and plenty of storage for the whole month.We also got a great deal on the whole month stay.The only  thing I could complain about is the partys on the weekends, but one call at the front desk and that was taken care of as well.Great location (in a bit seedy area) at a good price, I would recommend staying here!",,,,"['full', 'weeks', 'work', '2015', 'trusty', 'yellow', 'lab', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'place', 'little', 'older',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-columbus-worthington-columbus,Hyatt Place Columbus Worthington,4.0,$$,24,"This past weekend we drove to Columbus from Cleveland.  As a Hyatt Gold Passport member,    I couldn't get into the Hyatt Convention Center downtown, so opted to try the Hyatt Place Worthington.  I was blown away by not only the cleanliness and layout of the room (as well as the shower pressure - what a great shower!!), but the staff made the visit.  From the time I called on the day of check in to see about an early check in and was told by Shawn that it would be absolutely no problem to check in as early as we liked to Josh, who was on duty at the front desk area, when we did check in.  Josh was so pleasant and helpful at check in and after.  I'm not much of a breakfast person, however we both enjoyed a buffet of eggs, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurts, sausage, and muffins/toast/bagels.  Really nice spread. This great experience at HP made this a really nice quick trip out of town for us and we will definitely be back.Hyatt Place always is a plus in my book.  This location may be surrounded by construction at this point, but that's not the fault of the hotel.  Rooms are clean and spacious and they have a large variety of dining options.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the super slow elevator and loud (but amazing) AC unit.The place was clean and efficient which you could argue is the most important thing in hotels. My stay was comfortable even if everything wasn't up-to-date. Some appliances were old. The coffee machine start and stop button didn't work so I had to plug the outlet in and out every time. The bedside lamp switch had a glitch and I had to try it a couple times before it turned on. Food was typical hotel food. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall nice stay and for the price will definitely consider this place.I made a last minute change, checking out of the nearby Doubletree 2 days early due to a horrible experience there.  Hyatt totally saved my business trip by showing me what true hospitality is all about!  Nice hotel. Room was spacious and clean.  Bed and pillows were comfortable.  Their 24 hour kitchen was a real surprise.  Didn't use that option but very cool that they offer food options 24 hours a day!  Breakfast was very good.  Not vast but a decent variety of hot and cold options and the food quality is very much upscale in execution.  (Not something somebody just unwrapped and nuked!)   The have a small bar for Starbucks or adult beverages which is nice if wanting to either get a coffee pick-me-up or a cocktail to relax and unwind at the end of the day.    Price was lower than other nearby hotels like the Sheraton, Doubletree, etc...   Every staff member I encountered was absolutely and genuinely helpful and friendly.   This is my new ""go to"" place when in the area!My wife and I made no formal arrangements during our trip to Ohio. Booked this room at 1am on our way to Columbus. Great rate, clean, spacious single king with a living room. The water pressure in the shower was AMAZING. So refreshing. Solid continental breakfast. Fast wifi. And added security at night as they lock the front door in order to screen who comes in (fear not they are paying attention and let you in quickly). The staff were friendly as well.This hotel was a less impressive than the website made it seem. First, as of October 2014 there is MAJOR construction before entering this complex. Getting to and from the hotel was a huge ordeal each time and nearly caused an anxiety attack. The room was spacious, there was a nice mini fridge. But the bathroom was so small, I could barely move and there wasn't a fan so it was hot! I also didn't like that the bathroom sink was right across from the beds, which disturbed my roommate in the middle of the night. The hot breakfast was good, I enjoyed the sandwiches and wide variety of foods but I do think they should get their dishwasher checked out because many of the dishes seemed to be a little dirty still.I thought this hotel was a little overpriced, but still a comfortable stay!Stayed here for 4 nights. Here's what I experienced:- Good location, not far from Polaris shopping and highways.- Friendly staff, especially at check-in.- Good morning breakfast.- Nice large screen TV but it's odd viewing it from an angle from either side of the room. Unfortunately a lot of the TV channels are not in HD so they have poor resolution.- Room was dated. Needs updating badly. Stains on the carpet. Nothing looks ""fresh"".- Housekeeping wasn't the greatest, they didn't always replace tissues, ignored my full melted ice bucket on the floor, etc.- The mattress pad was uncomfortable to sleep on, It was wrinkled/old and left indents on the skin of my back.- Room had 8 feather only pillows---why not 4 feather and 4 foam?- WiFi was slow.  Did not respond to requests quick enough.- Pool is outdoors, so it's only available during the summer.- Air conditioner beside bed runs all the time, so it's noisy in your room all the time, unless you shut it off completely. That makes it hard to sleep. I called the front desk twice about this and they were clueless. They didn't get back to me on any solution or alternative.- I'm a Hyatt Diamond member, there was no benefit other than a free beverage, which I never received.Patrick the GM needs to tell the owner/HQ to overhaul the property badly.Nice place to stay, clean, modern lay decorated, offers drinks and snacks in the evenings at the little bar in the lobby,staff is very hospitable. Beds are comfy. Lots of space to sprawl out.This is the first time I have stayed at a Hyatt and I must say they give exceptional service. I travel often, 6-12 times a year, and the I can say the staff went above and beyond. You usually get a different type of service from day vs evening shift but not here. The night shift was very courteous and helped me find my way around Columbus, gave me plenty of good tips, and overall very friendly.  Oh, Liz helped me last night. The evening staff met and exceeded the morning shift. Micky was wonderful tonight. Due to the crazy winter we are having I am having to leave a night early and Micky and her staff helped me check out quickly. More so, I was checking out very late, 6pm, which is 2hrs past normal checkout, and they were still able to help me not pay a full nights rate. Even though they would had been 100% in the right to charge me, they understood that with the adverse weather and having to drive 6 hours back to Chicago where the bad weather is coming from, they only made me pay half.  They really didn't have to. They can not rent the room tonight so they can not recoup their money. I appreciate all of there help and next year when the Arnold Classic is held again, I will be checking back in. Thanks Hyatt!Great service and the rooms are great. Room service food is decent- I would definitely come back.5 reasons for 5 stars: 1. Nice &amp; clean rooms. Layout is nice nice with a living room &amp; bedroom area. Only negative on the rooms are the TINY bathrooms &amp; small closets. 2. WIFI included3. Hot breakfast. Eggs, french toast, sausage. Also had cereals, fruit, yogurts, pastries and lots of varieties of each. 4. A 24 hour menu &amp; room service is you need a bite to eat and don't want to go anywhere. 5. Location is excellent. Right off the freeway. Plenty of restaurants near. Polaris is a 5 minute drive. I could give plenty more reasons: excellent staff, nice outdoor pool with plenty of seating, clean hotel and public spaces. Price!We stayed here this weekend and couldn't be happier with the quality of the room, the level of customer service and the general operation of this hotel.  We both travel often enough to decipher a good experience from bad, This by far was a good experience. On a side note, the free breakfast was even better than the competition and the elevators smelled clean and fresh!This will be my hotel of choice in Columbus. It's very competitively priced at about $120 per night (this was over the weekend of a OSU football game). It's a bit far from OSU campus, but if you have a car, it's not that big of a deal. I picked this location because it is within walking distance of a COTA shuttle to the Horseshoe on game days. Hyatt Place looks brand new - both the lobby and the room had a very modern, comfortable design. The room I stayed in had a 42"" TV and a comfortable couch. Free wifi and everything worked as expected. Staff was friendly and parking was plentiful. Will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in Columbus.OMG. We live in Avon Lake and never has such great service and qualify of food. Must try!!Decent hotel w/ great customer service.  Bathrooms are really small.Nice hotel in a great location.  Right off of 270 and plenty of variety in nearby (walkable even) restaurants.  Staff is very friendly and you can get a good price on it sometimes. Breakfast if just cereal and juice, coffee and tea, and bread products.  After breakfast time if you want any coffee or tea you have to pay for it.  So what is amiss here?  The room itself!It is a very good size but they did not think it out well.  There is a great huge sofa to flop on as well as sleep if you want.  Nice desk with chair to use computer (free wi-fi but rather slow) and cool thing is there are connections where you can hook up your computer to that VERY nice big screen tv.  Has a wet bar with mini fridge and teeny coffee maker but no microwave.Then you get to the sleep area.  This is where we have the fails.  Bed itself is nice and comfy but there are no nightstands, you get a shelf.  And that closet????? What closet? You can barely put anything in there and forget any suitcases.  The sink is outside of the bathroom and that bathroom is claustrophobic! Open door, slide in sideways, have back to tub, then close door.  And the heat/AC is this big clunky behemoth that juts out into the room practically against the foot of the bed.It's not what I expected, but after adjusting to how to stow our things it was good for what we needed.Good location. Great room layout, free wifi, HDTV.My wife and I found his Hyatt Place to be in an ideal location in Columbus since we were visiting multiple areas around the city.  I gave this Hyatt Place five stars because of the amazing customer service we received throughout the whole stay.  In particular, an Hyatt employee brought us food even though she was leaving for the night.  Each day she impressed us by her sincerity in making sure all hotel guests were extremely happy.    If you are looking for a Hyatt Place in a great location with superior customer service then this Hyatt Place is the place.Oh, I almost forgot... You must try one of the chocolate chip cookies.I stayed here for three weeks while working out of Columbus, but I wouldn't recommend it.The location is decent, but not great. There are chain restaurants nearby, but the highway exit (exit 23) to get to the hotel often has bumper-to-bumper traffic at rush hour. If I left at 5pm, it would take me around 20m to travel about 4 miles.The main reason my stay was frustrating and the reason for this review...The room service wouldn't stop coming early in the morning (8:30 am). I explicitly called and requested that they come no earlier than 9:30 am, because that's when I'm usually out for work. They said it wouldn't happen again. A couple days later-- I'm woken up by a knock at 8:30 am! This has happened thrice since I called, and they never apologized.I was pleasantly surprised with the Hyatt Place on my last trip to Columbus.  The lobby is clean and up to date and the front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful.  They do have a 24-hour coffee bar, brewing up Starbucks finest, but take this warning: Starbuck Baristas the Hyatt employees are not.  My latte was a little on the rough side.  Also, stay away from these blueberry muffins...The rooms were better than I expected, especially since I consider Hyatts a very mid-level hotel chain.  My king bed room included a large sofa for lounging, a huge flatscreen and an extremely comfy bed.  Um, can I mention the bed again?  I never sleep well in hotels, but I was out like a light at 10pm each night.  Well, that could be due to my grueling meeting schedule during the day, but still...Hyatt Place serves up complimentary continental breakfast every morning, too.  Double bonus when you want to grab something light to eat before you start your day.","I belong to the Hyatt club and had a free night I had to use within a year.  I used it here and was so happy with this location.  We spent 3 nights, very reasonable @ $99 per night for the remaining 2 nights.  The location was perfect, rooms were so clean and large. Large flat screen tv.  Close to the Polaris mall and other shopping centers.  We staying on the 6th floor which is the top floor.  Could not hear street noise, doors slamming or any noise coming from the hallway.  What a Joy!  Great views from the room as I left the curtains open all night.  Amenities were replaced each day and everything was cleaned beyond expectations.  Staff is real friendly and the complimentary breakfast is more than you can ask for.  3 different types of heated food and various other breakfast food such as breads, cereal, yogurt.  3 types of juices and Starbuck's coffee.  Very clean and modern lobby.  The person who complained about not having HD tv - hello?  where do you get HD in a hotel room?Great hotel near A LOT of restaurants. The staff is friendly and remembers me every week. As a platinum member with Hyatt they give me a free drink coupon good for even alcohol!The room is a standard Hyatt Place room, nothing new- and thats what I like about it. You know what you are getting no matter what location you are in. The price was awesome too, with my corporate discount the room was only $104!If I'm going to Columbus and looking for an inexpensive hotel, this is my first choice.  It's not new, but it looks it... modern, clean and bright.  Rooms are nearly spotless, even the bathrooms (which appear to have been repainted white a hundred times - but at least they're clean).Love that the rooms have sofas and flat screens with easily accessible AV inputs.Only complaint is about the air conditioning units in the rooms - they are individual units by the window instead of central AC.  They are noisy and either blow freezing cold air or none at al.Free breakfast is nothing special, but fine for a quick bite to eat.  Cereal, coffee, juice, muffins, etc.Hyatt Place is rapidly becoming my hotel of choice.  Love the decor (each hotel is exactly the same, right down to the gingko leaf glass over the registration desk), very friendly and clueful staff, clean rooms, stylish furnishings, and they cater to geeks.  You can be almost 100% human-interaction-free if you'd like, with self-serve kiosks for checking in, checking out, ordering food, paying, etc. Free wifi, a ""starbucks-lite"" in the lobby serving coffee, sammiches, snacks that you'd actually want to eat, etc.Can't really go wrong, especially for around $115/night.  I'm fairly sure Hyatt Place is a newer brand of Hyatt, so most of these properties are newly built (or mega-renovated); maybe in a few years they'll be meh.  But for now, I'm happy!",,,,"['past', 'weekend', 'drove', 'gold', 'passport', 'member', 'convention', 'center', 'downtown', 'opted', 'try', 'place', 'blown', 'away', 'cleanliness', 'layout', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-columbus-2,Embassy Suites,4.0,$$,21,"SO happy we picked this hotel!This was one of the best hotel choices we've made in the last couple of years. We tend to not have much luck with our hotels when we go out of town. This one however, was a great choice. We were in town for a concert, and were hours late, driving from Akron in a blizzard. When we finally got to the hotel, the man checking us into our room informed us that the bar was an open bar for the night and we should help ourselves after we're situated in our rooms. Too bad we were dead tired from our commute, but we did grab some food and a couple drinks from the bar on our way out to the concert that night. Really great options for food and the bartender and waiters were very accommodating, very impressive.Our room was so spacious, and the beds were so comfortable. I loved the view of the city from our window at night. The bathroom was the perfect size for me (we have a small bathroom at home so I appreciate a good-sized bathroom anywhere). Everything was very clean and laid out for us and they even gave us complimentary robes!Fantastic stay.Room is huge, clean, new, efficient at a great price! If only the bar was stocked, bourbon please, sorry-out, olives for vodka-sorry-out, bartender is always missing &amp; im the only one at the bar at 6pm, he definitely is not into this job, annoyed I'm ordering drinks &amp; food.This is a fairly new location. It is located right beside the airport. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast at embassy is always amazing, cooked to order pancakes, french toast and omelets.The reception hours in the evening are pretty nice as well. The drinks are unlimited and they have a few snacks to choose from. Whenever I can find a embassy hotel that is where I usually stay because they never disappoint.My husband and I were here for about 6 days last week and were very pleased by the amenities, service and cleanliness of the hotel. I would recommend this location to anyone.I went here for a national company seminar and meeting. Hotel was very clean, and staff was professional. Facilities nice and roomy.  Room service was quick, food was good.Thank you for making our stay a pleasure.Haven't even checked into my room yet. Having dinner in the 5star restaurant. Highly recommend. Service is great. While sitting here waiting for my room to be ready, the front desk clerk came in, handed me the room key, told me my luggage had been taken up and that I was all set. Love this service. More later. Here for 9 days.check in: Pleasant staff. I checked in at around 9 PM. There was only one person working so there was a few minutes' wait, but unremarkable.Room: The room was very clean.  Flat screen HDTVs in bedroom and in the living area. Microwave and refrigerator were very clean. Bathroom was very large with a nicely-tiled stand-up shower (no tub). Linens and towels were clean.  The room was very comfortable and I would definitely stay here again.Parking: free surface parking.Breakfast: The layout of the breakfast area has very poor flow. Many guests, myself included, were running into other seated guests as we were making our way through the cooked-to-order omlette line, coffee/juice station.  There are no servers and I couldn't find any water in the breakfast area, which I found to be frustrating. The quality of the food was unremarkable as well- they had the usual breakfast items: bacon, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy, potatoes, waffles. I couldn't find anything too healthy in the buffet line. I would rate the quality of food to be about 3.5 of 5 stars.Wifi: If you're gold/diamond, you just ""bill"" wireless to your room and it'll come off of your bill. Otherwise, you're stuck paying for wi-fi, even in the lobby.Check-out: painless. No complaints!Great location, staff was very friendly, offers very clean rooms. Very nice, new hotel with a clean modern interior. Lots of items to choose from for Breakfast, plus made to order omlets YUM!Stayed for Ohio State Game Vs Michigan cost of cab from hotel was $20.00 for 2 people.Great hotel! Seems like new construction. Friendly staff, nice rooms with big flat screen tvs, excellent free breakfast, free wi-fi and newspapers.  Hotel , grounds and rooms all immaculate. Very close to the airport, but little noise from the planes.  The room is so big, I feel like I'm living in an apartment.Very nice hotel, good rates, hot cooked breakfast and finger food and drinks in the evening daily free. Very neat and clean and close to airport.I am in Columbus at least once a month on business.  This places offers very clean rooms and awesome service from the staff. The management reception is great too. It goes for about two and a half hours. During this time, unlimited house booze and draft beer. They also provide some light snacks.  Every morning there is also a nice breakfast offered with an omelet station.  This is also FREE!!!!!  Everyone loves free, right?I definitely recommend!The hotel itself is great. The staff is nice and professional. The rooms are very clean, large with lots of amenities (2 TVs, refrigerator, microwave). The management reception is great. Despite being next to an airport, the rooms are incredibly quiet. There is a nice breakfast, exercise facilities, pool, etc.The reason I gave it 3 stars, however, is that their internet access (wifi) is terrible. When I travel for business, internet access is essential for me. Their wireless is very flaky, forcing me to log off every 10 to 15 minutes. It's pretty frustrating and is pretty much a deal breaker for me.Stayed this holiday weekend with my family.  We have stayed at other Embassy Suites and other hotels in the Columbus area.  It has been challenging for the six of us.  This is an excellent hotel.  Clean, new.  Great service.  Nice indoor pool.  Breakfast is amazing, although the staff has difficulty keeping up with busy times.  The happy hour is great.  The restaurant is great for breakfast, but not visually appealing for dinner.  The food is good, however, either via room service or at the restaurant.  No free wi-fi is a pain.I was coming back to Columbus to see the family for Christmas and wanted a decent, newer hotel to spend the time. I'm a dedicated Hilton person and really wanted someplace nice close to Grove City where the family lives. After ruling out the dated Garden Inn and Hampton in Grove City and knowing the Doubletree downtown had seen better days, I decided to stay at the Embassy Suites-Airport and liked it. Hotel is newer and has a decent looking lobby.  Rooms are good however I found the bedroom a bit cramped. There was really no room to store two bags.  We kept those in the living room. Staff is good and friendly. Fitness area is standard newer Hilton with decent amount of Precor equipment.  However, Wifi sucked! I've experienced worse Wifi at the Conrad Chicago and theWit but those were downtown locations.  I don't really expect dropped signals and having to fight with the neighboring McDonald's AT&amp;T wifi signal. Hotels need to realize that a good strong Wifi signal is a VERY important feature. And as more people have tablets, that little Cat5 cable connection in the room is not going to cut it. Also, I choose this hotel strictly on the fact that it was the newest Hilton brand property in the city. On my next trip to Columbus, if the new Hilton downtown is open, I will be staying there. This Embassy Suites is not a bad hotel at all. And it's great if you need to stay near the airport and it's a quick drive to Easton but I'm a ""downtown"" guy.  I want lots of stuff around me, besides a Turkey Hill and McDonalds. Also, if I wasn't a Hilton Diamond member, I would choose the new Sheraton Four Points across the street. It's a newer and cooler hotel than Embassy Suites.The ""Gold Standard"" for Embassy Suites.  New place, modern look with great open and large rooms with multiple flat panel TVs.  Staff was nice, the bed was super comfortable.  Conveniently located close to the airport (although deceivingly not right next to it with a location on ""Airport Dr""), easy access to downtown and close to Easton.  I will stay here again if I come back to Columbus.Very nice, new hotel with a clean modern design...which I love. But, there's nothing to do or see near here. If you want to go to a bar you have to drive 15 min into town and risk driving after drinking, no bueno!...or go to North to Easton, which is a bunch of lame chain restaurants. It has a very nice, large gym with state of the art equipment and nice indoor pool/hot tub. (The pool deck tile is slick a snot when wet, be careful. I almost fell several times!)Rooms are very modern as well with separate bedroom and two large flat screen LG TVs.I've stayed at this hotel almost every other week over a period of four months. Got to know several of the staff at the front desk, restaurants, the shuttle drivers, and of course room service. The staff are very good. The place is a really good deal for the business traveller. Not your average budget hotel. Rooms are spacious, well furnished and well-kept. Just a few minutes from the airport and the Easton area. Breakfast is included and isn't that bad. However, this hotel has had some serious problems with the menu, in terms of quality and consistency of the dinner and lunch options. Depended on who was in the kitchen that day. You won't go wrong with the burgers (classic and veggie), the house salad with grilled chicken, and on most days with the grilled salmon with rice. Stay away from the mussels!! They were terrible. All else is mediocre.Wow, I'm pressed. Easily the nicest Embassy I've been too. Super nice staff and the rooms are VERY nice. Two huge flat-screen TVs, a huge stand-up shower and brand-new through-out. My new go-to hotel in Columbus.Horrendous. I am a pilot and spend over half of my life in hotels. For an Embassy, this place is terrible. If not on top floor, you will hear the toilet flushed as it is a high pressure system. The staff is stiff. Most have zero personalities and not friendly. The breakfast is a hassle. Every morning they either screw up a basic over medium, no bananas, no Earl Grey tea or something like that. The service line for coffee, drinks and toaster is crammed and can't get anything from there without bumping the diners  seated nearby. Management is apathetic. I have complained every other day during my 20 plus days total I stayed here. The rooms are nice and place is still new and clean.  Quiet rooms on the seventh floor, especially the back, odd numbered rooms.another great hotel I stayed at while travelingan Embassy Suites free breakfast is the best you will get at any hotel chain across the US I believe =)","Great, great hotel near the airport.  And because it's Columbus, you're not more than a 15 minute drive from just about anything.  Spacious new rooms, clean and tasteful decor.  All 2 room suites.  Rates are reasonable too.  Best hotel option near the airport.  Good fitness center and pool, very well kept property and comfortable hotel.",,,,"['happy', 'picked', 'hotel', 'best', 'hotel', 'choices', 'made', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'tend', 'much', 'luck',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-columbus-airport-columbus,Days Inn Columbus Airport,1.5,$,22,"I was in Columbus a few weeks ago for a work event and our party of 9 stayed at this hotel. I can confidently say that I have never had an experience quite like the one I had there. First and foremost, the parking lot was full but it seemed like the hotel itself was pretty empty. The outside looked like it needed a good power wash, but it wasn't too bad at first glance. Our rooms?? Very different story. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because of the friendly staff. Everyone we interacted with was as helpful as they could be, given the circumstances and tried their best to accommodate our requests.  Now, back to the rooms - one half of our group had a beautiful room! Clean, looked relatively updated and overlooked the pool area. MY half of the group wasn't so lucky....our room was nothing short of terrifying. There were stains on the covers, the bathtub was dirty, handprints on the walls, our fridge looked like it fell off the back of a truck and rolled down a hill, there was something crusted to the phone... And that's not even the end of it.  When we mentioned our dissatisfaction to the front desk, the young lady working happily moved us to a different room on the other side of the hotel. Admittedly, that room was nicer, but BARELY. I'd say this hotel is ok for someone quickly passing through or maybe has an early flight to catch, but I'd looks elsewhere for anything long term :/OMG, all I can say is stay the hell away. Had to book room in Columbus for a convention. In efforts to save the organization some bucks and having to stay 5 nights, did some extensive research, reading reviews and pictures and was hopeful about picking this one.Started off ok. The front desk ladies upon check-in (saw 4) were chatty enough and helpful when I engaged them in conversation asking for restaurant recommendations and traffic to downtown.I asked for a quiet room so they put me in the last room on the 3rd floor. As soon as I stepped in and took my shoes off, had a bad feeling. The carpet seemed soggy and felt there could be mold (though I couldn't see). Knew the part of the place was undergoing construction so I specifically asked for a room away from that.I go to the bathroom and it seems apparent this room hadn't been used in a while. The sink counter was sticky and unclean. I cleaned the entire top before I dare lay out my toiletries on the counter, even with a towel underneath.I take a shower and despite the curtain being closed, the floor is kinda wet. At first, I thought it was me, having missed closing the shower curtain shut in some way. Then consecutive days, the longer I take a shower, the greater the pool of water on the floor. I see that they tried to spackle the tub area probably due to leakage but it seemed to leak up from the tiles and other places. So needless to say my foot towel was always soggy from trying to dry off all the wet spots.I could tell the tub and floors did not get cleaned thoroughly everyday cause there was still hair in the tub and powder spots on the floor.In the mornings I usually have the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and when I leave I take it off so the room can be serviced. I left late one morning and the room wasn't serviced. Figured I missed the cleaning lady's time so the next day, I told the front desk as I left, to ensure the room gets serviced.And then, I come back that day and there is hardly a quarter of a toilet paper left on the roll. Also, instead of leaving shampoo and conditioner, they only left shampoo. Usually they have a spare roll (there certainly is a spot for it). So alas, I ran out of toilet paper in the middle of the night. Not wanting to be bothered I survived using the facial tissue box which I left on the counter to bring attention to the fact that there was no toilet paper. I leave the next morning and come back in the evening. Was so tired I took off all my clothes and went to the bathroom and voila!, the empty toilet paper 'stick' is on the counter and the box of facial tissue just the way I left it. Seriously, hotel doesn't have toilet paper?!?! So I promptly call the front desk. Or at least I tried to. The buttons on the phone that notes housekeeping didn't work. I press the front desk button, didn't work. I dial '0' and it rings and rings and rings. Nobody picks up. So finally I used my phone to find the hotel telephone number and called them. I asked does the hotel phone work? The answer; it should. I said I haven't had toilet paper in 2 days. Before I could even ask them to send them up, she goes come down and get them. I said, what? Could you send them up? She says I can't leave the front desk. I was thinking WTF?? So I put all my clothes back on guessing what lousy management to have only one staff at the front desk. I go down and I see another worker right there on the phone, chewing gum. I said you gotta be kidding me. So with an incredulous look, I said, how could it be that I don't have toilet paper for 2 days? To which she promptly replied with her hands up, I ain't got nothing to do with that. If she doesn't who the F does?!?If a client calls to say the room is out of toilet paper, wouldn't the first thing out of a decently trained staff, or even just common sense say, I'm really sorry, we'll send some up right away??I want to give zero stars but since I can't, so be it. I was just too incredulous at not only how badly the place was kept (not kept); having pieces of plaster literally covering the hallway in front of my room to having a microwave that wasn't connected to electricity (had to move furniture and McGyver things to connect the short microwave plug and then the refrigerator to the extension outlet which was waay too short to get it too work, to having no privacy curtains so unless you wanted to provide a peep show, you couldn't open the curtains while you were in the room, to non-functional phones, to elevators that take literally a minute and a half for each floor (it's a 3 story building) which means it takes 3 minutes to go up 2 floors and on the way down it's slower and automatically stops on the second floor to  toilet paper and the staff's attitude and response, there could not be a worse combination of indifference, ineptitude and lousy management.Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to stay...This place was disgusting. There was an upside down cross drawn on the wall above the bed, a huge stain on the comforter, the phone was sticky and crusty, hole in the mattress, the bathtub was sticky, the elevator didn't work well, exercise equipment didn't work- only had 20 pound dumbells too.  Please stay away.An absolute dump to say the least.  The only thing that makes this hotel nice is the staff, which I have always found to be extremely great people.  I won't go into detail, as the other reviews are spot on, but I will say this...if you've ever seen the Simpson's episode that featured the Sleep Easy motel that had the neon sign with the bulbs out that read ""Sleezy Motel"" with the mayor coming out with a hooker...I think they were talking about this place.Really you get what you pay for.  I booked a room for ~$65-$70 during the Columbus Marathon.  Parking lot is worn out which should tell you something.  Lobby was decent and nice.  The layout of the hotel is odd.  There's a central portion where continental breakfast is served and leads to the pool.  We checked into our room, where you realize that a bulk of the rooms overlook the pool, so you have to pull the curtains if you're changing in the room.  Bathrooms were fine, room was ok, no signs of smoking in our room.  The continental 'breakfast' really wasn't much of anything at all which was a negative.  When we checked out after showering after the race, we thought all was good.  In the end, my credit card was charged that I used to book the room, not the credit card that we gave the front desk when we checked in.  How hard is it to say I want this credit card to be used to pay for a room?This place was a complete dump. Stains on the carpet, shower curtain was so nasty I took the bottom snap part off before I showered, the walls had crap all over them, the fridge shelves were missing and bottom was all stained not including it look like it was from 1960 and was rolled down the hill befor put in my room and the heater/air didn't really work and sounded like it was going to catch on fire as loud as it kicked in and off. The hallway was stained and had holes in the floor (be careful don't trip and fall, kinda deep). It smelled like cigarrets all over since they mixed smoking rooms with non. The breakfast was left out all the time it was nasty looking. The outside was not a place you wanted to be after dark or maybe not even at all. The run down trailer park across of the street with the little store had people standing out there all the time with cars driving up doing god knows what and driving off. STAY AWAY!!!! Oh I will say the gentleman that shuttles the bus to the airport was always smiling and saying good morning... But that's all they will get from me, it's a complete dump! I'll post pictures on Yelp and other places, because it won't allow me to do so here, but managed to post some under photos.OK... where do I start? This place is so bad that I'm writing this while still in the ""hotel."" Just need to vent before ""hitting the hay.""The photos on their website are not an accurate representation of the facility. The most impressive feature of this hotel is the lobby. It's downhill from there.I booked two rooms - one for my wife and I and one for my daughter, her husband and two year old. At first glance, our room looked and smelled OK. My daughter's room had a musty smell and mold growing where the walls meet the ceiling. The staff allowed us to move my daughter and her family into a room that was in much better shape.Our room had the clock radio and both night stand lamps unplugged. Once plugged-in - one of the lamp's bulbs were burned out.There were no facial tissues in the dispenser. Makes you wonder what kind of quality control checklist the housekeeping staff uses.The elevator made a loud clunking noise each time it started from the first floor. Didn't feel too safe about that one.The TV didn't show stations higher than channel 20. My wife was looking forward to watching HGTV (one of the channels higher than 20) - something she has missed since we dropped cable at home. When I called the front desk, they said the maintenance man would stop by to take care of it. When asked how long that might be - they said it would be after he returned from shuttling guests to/from the airport. So we have a maintenance man/shuttle driver that never showed up in the 2+ hours since we called the front desk.Had we known the maintenance man wouldn't show up, my wife would have joined us by the pool to enjoy our two year old grandson splashing in the water.So it's 10:30 at night and it's off to ""dreamland"" - or should I say, ""Nightmare on Stelzer Road""?Worst choice! Got an asthma attack do to the dust in the room.plus the whole place smalls like chlorine from the pool! I checked right back out the same day because my boyfriend get sick from the smell and had to take him to the emergency room. We had to come back the next day to get our money back because the manger was not there on the day! asked for our money back and the manger was super rude. It has been two weeks and still have not got our money back. Would never recommend anyone to stay at this hotel/motel whatever it is.Very dirty, service was slow . Sitting in the lobby waiting for delivery ( don't walk outside) 4 people were getting their rooms switched . I accepted why I got, as I know nothing else could be better . MAZE INN,,, confusing where rooms areThis place should be immediately demolished. The staff has been trained in BAD customer service. C'mon. Didn't know places like this still existed.Outstanding front desk service from several different folks. Very nice spot for the price. If you're looking for the Hilton for $70 a night this isn't it. But the interior pool was quaint and the kids were really enjoying it when we walked through the lobby. Yes our room was a bit outdated but it was clean, efficient and smelled fresh. It looks like there might be some updating in progress. The lamps were new and the drapes modern. Did I mention how nice the staff was each time we interacted? Not sure why this place has some grumpy reviews. Seems like their expectations might be unrealistic for the price. Also the pool area view was adorable.If I could give this place 0 stars I would. It was dirty, smelled like urine, and we had to switch rooms because of the dust balls and cob webs in the corners and filthy bath tub. We barely spent any time in there before we realized we would definitely never sleep on the beds (that were missing comforters and sheets) so we called down to see if we could move rooms. The phone had a crusty brown smear on the mouthpiece and it turned out it wasn't even plugged into the wall. Once we switched rooms we thought we would be fine, but that was not the case. The room we switched to had a sagging mattress with an enormous stain in the comforter. The chair had what looked like a stab and cigarette burns all over it, covered in stains. People had drawn on the walls, the picture above the bed fell off the wall with one touch and the other picture across the room still had a yard sale tag on it. The bathroom flooded with one shower and the wall paper was peeling off in there. There was also an open soap packet in the shower like they hadn't even cleaned it from the previous user. ""Continental breakfast"" was cereal (no milk....what....?) and 3 kinds of cheap bread for toast. No juice or fruit. Coffee was watered down dirt water and Seriously, I could go on and on about how nasty this place was but I've given you a good idea. Pick ANYWHERE else before here. Don't be forced to sleep with one of your t-shirts as a pillowcase like we had to!!!!I'm giving this a one star because I have too... Let's start at the gate! The Lobby was uncomfhumid with no climate control. My room smelled like cigarette and the ac/heater smelled 100x worse! I requested a wake up call, Didn't get it ! the only thing good about this experience was checking out !I'm so pissed to even give one star!  I'm a flight attendant so I stay in hotels often and this one was of the worst nights stay ever. Our first room didn't have a air conditioning so we got a new room however which was worse. Dirty and old. The bedding is just 70s, which makes me hesitate to even sleep on it.I'm certain there was prostitution or some scary sex crap going on in our hall and next door. I had to wake up at 5am and I probably got 3hrs of sleep cuz of the noise. HORRIBLE. I will never stay at a Days Inn.Meh.  If you need to be close to the airport and not pay much for your room, the Days Inn is ok.  Just ok.  Room was fairly clean.  Plenty of parking.  Hot water.  The TV was old school, though, with a tube and a curved screen and all that.  I'm not much of a TV watcher so who cares, but it's worth mentioning, I think.Worst thing about my stay here was the ""breakfast"".  Whew.  I guess I'm spoiled by numerous stays with a rival hotel chain but I expect breakfast to be decent.  No eggs benedict or mimosas, ok, just not sucky.  This was uber-sucky.  A loaf of bread someone bought at the grocery on the way in that morning.  A gallon of milk and a gallon of OJ - forget about individual cartons or a dispenser with cups.  Single-serving cereals (which is fine, but I need more than 2 choices if I'm forced to settle with cereal).  And the coffee was so bad.  Oh man, was it bad.  I only had one cup - about 1/6 of my normal intake.Not good, Days Inn, not good at all.  I will not be back.So, here's my review for the Day's Inn Columbus Airport. I chose the hotel due to it's location from the airport (less than a 10 minute drive from the hotel room to the airport's drop-off/pick-up, and I mean literally - no traffic) and it's amenities.My stay this past weekend at this hotel was kid of a loss from the moment I recieved my e-mail confirmation. Although the website I viewed said they had a wonderful indoor pool, the e-mail warned me that it was out of service.Strike one.After driving there for six hours from Chicago, I wanted to rest a little before seeing my family. The woman behind the counter was very pleasant, and very helpful. That was the only positive part of the whole place.When I stepped into my room, I was kind of shocked at the depressing 1990's decor, the torn off trim on the wall, the filth behind and under the table between the two twin beds, and the lack of any kind of upgrading in service. (I was glad that I brought my flip-flops so I didn't have to walk barefoot on the sticky carpets.)All this for $59.00 a night!I figured I was only going to be in this room for only a few hours and the rate was cheap, I stuck it out.I wanted to order food from their in-house restaurant, but I was told it was CLOSED FOR REPAIRS too!Strike two.The analog tube TV was easy to navigate, and the room didn't smell like cigarettes (but other rooms near me SURE DID), and the beds were haphazardly made, but clean.Plenty of towels, the sink's cold and hot taps were set backwards (almost got burned - ouch), and the shower was good.They had a workout room, but I wasn't around enough to use it.I slept okay, and it was quiet. The airport is about two miles away just north of the hotel, but I heard nothing.I had to leave early in the morning, and the ""continental breakfast"" in the oddly shaped lobby consisted of single serve boxes of cereal, a banana, some apples, some bagels and a few coffee rolls, coffee and milk.I made it out of there and checked out quickly by merely presenting the card and saying I was leaving.All in all, it was a sub-par room with two twin beds and no real amenities, low to non-existent guest services, no pool, no restaurant, no bar, a very barebones breakfast but an easy checkout.I've read the other reviews for this place on Yelp, and I didn't see any hookers, but then again I wasn't looking for hookers. There is a gentelman's club up the road a few miles called the Centerfold Club and read their reviews, learning that sometimes the sleazy dancers end up there, but I don't go into that kind of crap, either.Anyway, this is my review. I'd say avoid it if you have real standards, but if you're looking for a room close to the airport with no frills and no real hassles, go here. It's okay, I guess. I'm not dead or don't have bedbug bites, so it's all good.one of the most revolting places I've ever stayed at. It smells.. rooms are just gross.very bad part of town.. the pool was pretty much infested. the store across the street run by a gang. definitely a must miss!!! EXCEPT... the front manager was an absolute doll!Would not recommend this place. Very rough neighborhood and very dirty hotel. Room had peeling wall paper and lose wires under the bed. We were on the 3rd floor and elevator made loud noise the whole way up very scary place, spend the extra $75 and stay downtown.So gross, there are stains all over the sheets and comforters. There were no towels in our room, saw actual hookers downstairs. There was a suspicious man in the hallway and we ended up keeping all of our stuff in the car which also felt unsafe here. Only nice thing about this place was the front desk girl who was helpful.This place certainly has the potential to be an enjoyable hotel.  After a little looking around, it is obvious that the budget for maintenance is either meager or nonexistant.  The front desk staff was pleasant enough.  Breakfast is scarse at best, with coffee andbagels available.  There appears to be a large number of rooms that are not being used.I hope whoever makes the decisions here has a plan to resurrect this business.","Do not stay at this place! It's a complete dump! Small, dirty rooms. Tv looked like it was from the 90's. Hooks where pictures should be on the wall, holes in the wall, mirror and pictures were crooked which means no takes care of this place. Just a broken down hole in the wall dump.Its cheap, near the airport, and they will pick you up from the airport. A life saver if you really just need to crash for the night and go about your business the next day. There are better hotels in the area, for sure, but it's cheap and easy here. Just depends on your situation. They have a nice large lobby with pastries and coffee for breakfast. There is a gym, which I've never used, but it seems pretty well kept. The hotel is decent enough. I've heard horror stories about dirty rooms, this and that, etc. I personally have never had any significant problems here. Once I had to change rooms because the heater was broken. Some rooms have fridges and microwaves. Just various little things here and there. One time, there was no hot water. So it's basically a hit or miss hotel. The WiFi is not that great, but it will get you on the internet to do minor things.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-columbus-dublin-dublin,Hyatt Place Columbus Dublin,3.5,$$,21,"Not sure why other reviews are saying wifi didn't work, worked fine for me! The beds were SO comfortable. Rooms were spacious, nice and clean. Check out time is late, 12, but the breakfast should go later...ends too early. The one morning we did have breakfast, it was really good. The people at the front desk were kind of rude but I guess they were in training. No microwave in room. Otherwise, nice stay.I've stayed in many, many hotels in my day, but to my surprise, this was one of the nicest. I've stayed in $400/night rooms a few times and this exceeded my expectations. On a random night, my husband and I decided to Priceline a hotel in town just to not stay at home. We booked this place on a bid for like $53. The staff was super friendly, bed was comfy, room was really clean and still looked new. There was a couch and kitchenette which I always appreciate. Ample parking that is free. And there are a lot of food and shopping options within walking distance to the hotel. Because of our experience at this Hyatt Place, I'd be willing to stay at another in the future.A $150/night hotel should not have rooms where the heater generates a strong burning smell and sets off the fire alarm.Also, Internet connection is barely usable for basic browsing. The 4G hotspot on my phone is faster.So often people write bad reviews for questionable reasons.  This is not one of those occasions.  My family and I had driven over 3hrs to stay upon arrival we were told we had no room.  We had a reservation and they had over booked and choose us randomly to have our reservation cancelled.  I am a Hilton honors silver member and still was cancelled.  They seemed to care little as they checked In No less than 6 people after telling myself, wife and 11 years old daughter we had no where to stay.  All other hotels in Columbus we're sold out due to the Arnold Classic in which my daughter was scheduled to compete the next day.  The lack of regard for us as customers was disappointing to say the least.  I am thoroughly disappointed.   It shows a real lack in management at this facility.  They did finally find a room at a lesser establishment. It wasn't near the standard we were expecting.Clean hotel well priced for biz travel.  Breakfast included but mostly carbs. Small gym with 2-3 cardio machines.  Suite type rooms but BIG downside for me is due to layout cannot watch TV while working at desk.  4 stars ut I'll not stay again.Clean and convenient but if you need Internet service during your stay don't count on it at night. Second year in a row here that I've had glacially slow internet.Amazing customer service, especially from Manager Kevin who was able to assist us with a reservation mix up. The staff is professional, the rooms clean, the free breakfast is great, and the location really convenient for us when we visit relatives. We have used the heated pool on a prior visit and that was a welcomed break from the road. The hotel room size, floor layout and location are perfect for my us - including my son who loves to run around the hotel outside.Any place is nice on the company dime but the room is  spacious and clean with no lingering ""funk smell"".....That's a plus!!!Teeny tiny little nook of a bar but coworkers made it WAY more fun anyway....nice little breakfast buffet to enjoy but I couldn't....Still WAY to full from the previous evening!!!Great hotel! Room was clean and had separated sitting area with a sectional and tv. Can plug gaming systems into the televison as well. Breakfast was great.Here on company training so can't complain on price.  Room was clean and nice.  Wasn't too small. Would definitely stay here again. Breakfast in the morning was great.I hate to say anything bad about this place because it is a really nice hotel (room wise), but my family and I experienced some not so great customer service when we stayed here recently.We stayed here to attend the Dublin Irish Festival this weekend. My uncle was the first to reserve his room, after reading on the website that they have a shuttle that runs from 7:30am-10pm within a 5 mile radius. Not only does the website say that but he specifically called this location to ask with regard to the festival and was told that there would be a shuttle. We got there and got ready to leave and went to the front desk to get the shuttle and were told that there wasn't one. That it was only for 'companies' or business groups, which is not specified on the website and was not told to my uncle when he specifically asked about it. The front desk person tried to ask my uncle ""who he'd spoken to"" --- which, of course he wasn't able to tell her because he reserved the room way ahead of time. Maybe that's his fault for not writing it down but I checked the website AFTER we stayed there and it does not specify who is allowed to use the shuttle. I suspect that they were going to offer the shuttle, but for some reason at the last minute wrote a note at the front desk informing that it wasn't to be used for the purposes of getting guests to and from the festival. So we had to take a cab instead. Luckily they had vouchers available at the festival for some cab companies so our ride on the way home was free. I don't expect the front desk person to go against what the employees are instructed but she didn't even apologize for the misinformation and it basically made me feel like she was blaming it on us, which is not great customer service. I will be the first to take responsibility for a mistake, however the shuttle ride was the reason we booked at this location and would have looked elsewhere had we known it would not be available. I've stayed at the Hyatt Place before (this same one actually) and I do think it's very clean and comfy. I like the set up of the room really well and everything else was great....this situation just left a really bad taste in my mouth about it though and when there are many other nice places to stay I'm not sure I'll choose here again.Per normal, Hyatt Place in general gives an extremely high bang for your buck, and this one lives up to that standard. Friendly staff, comfortable spacious rooms, giant HD TV flat screen, modern and comfortable living room area inside the room... You just can't miss by staying here. If I could give it six stars I would... Book with confidence!Nice place. good breakfast, unfortunately not for the gluten-free challenged once.. rooms are clean and nice. Staff always friendly and smiling. You can get a Starbucks-Coffee there if you wish. Location is close to an interstate and there are a lot of restaurants around and a shopping mall very close by. like it. :-)My wife and I randomly received a free 1 night stay here through our credit card.  I don't really know why they chose us but it was nice nonetheless. The hotel is easy to find as it's visible from 270.  We arrived around 10 pm and we checked in with ease.  They gave us a free non-alcoholic drink at check-in. The room is very spacious with a 42"" flat screen in the middle.  It pivots in either the direction of the bed or the couch.  The bed is quite comfortable and I absolutely loved the pillows.  The bathroom was quite small especially when the door is open.  I had problems with the shower as the water temperature changed drastically from cold to hot several times during my shower.  However, my wife didn't have that problem.  Sleeping wasn't too bad although the sounds from the highway are pretty loud.  I also seemed to constantly hear doors slamming at night and in the morning.  It seemed as though the walls weren't too thick.  Breakfast was decent with a good selection of fruits and breads.  I have never been impressed with most continental breakfasts and this wasn't much different, but it's free so I can't complain about that.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, but I gave it 4 stars because of the traffic noise and the loud noise outside our room.For this business traveler this place has one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.  The room was spacious and the TV was gargantuan.  I would definitely stay here again.  It was priced around $100 a night.Although the hotel isn't located in downtown, Dublin provides many amenities. The hotel is very clean and my biggest complaint lies with the size of the bathroom. When you open the door, it literary takes up the entire bathroom. I can appreciate having a separate toilet and tub, but the size it just very small. The rest of the room on the other end, is very nice. You have plenty of room around the sink, as well as a small closet. The TV is rather large (42"" I think) and is placed so some can relax on the couch and others can relax in bed. Plenty of walking room in the middle and a nice area for the office and a separate sink for drinks and a fridge. This hotel room is designed differently than most I have stayed in, electing to remove the often uneeded drawers and freeing up some space. If it wasn't for the bathroom, I would give it four stars. Free Wifi too, although there were some issues getting logged on by myself and another guest.The room is spacious and very nice. Breakfast was good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the pipes in the shower made a terrible ear piercing squeal for the duration of my shower. I'm not sure if this is normal for the hotel or not.This was a great find.  The staff is very friendly.  The room with a kingsized bed was a great value.  Hyatt Place has a good formula that is a bit nicer than the Holiday Inn express but not too expensive.As much as I like this hotel, I have to downgrade a star.  My coworkers and I had a late flight into Ohio and we didn't arrive to the hotel until 10:30pm or so.  Upon arrival, my boss was told they didn't even have a reservation under his name.  I was told they had my reservation, but they didn't have a room for me.  Um, what?  I was tired, grumpy, and hungry.  NOT a good time for this to happen.Apparently they overbooked and we were told to head to the Marriot down the street.  I was comped a room at the Marriott which was nice, but this experience definitely changes my view on Hyatt Place.This is a very nice hotel.  The staff was nice, The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  The television was very nice.  No problems with Internet.  Breakfast was great with a lot of healthy choices.  Loved the sectional sofa and bed was comfortable.  Nice area with a mall directly across from it and plenty of dining choices.","I'm glad my aunt picked this place out, it was great! And it was a chain hotel, so that's pretty unusual from what I usually see.The room was really a suite it was spacious with the bedroom area being partially divided from the living room/office area. It looks nicer in person than in the photos on the website. Free wi-fi! No gross polyester bedspreads.The living room area had a huge L-shaped couch and if I had time I'd kick it there a little. Gigantic flatscreen that you can plug your devices into. You can also pivot the tv between the living room area or bedroom area. The bed was SUPER comfy, I did not want to get up in the morning. The bed/sheets/blankets/pillows were high quality.The breakfast was...eh...but free. When I stayed there in June they were still working on a remodel of the place, so there was construction in the lobby. They did mess up when I first got my room and assigned the same room to someone else. I'd only been in the room 5 minutes and someone else's keycard unlocked the lock! They do have a physical lock you can throw that's not hooked up to the keycard that would keep anyone else out. I had it on, no one could actually get in. However, I'd guess it was a fluke since they were doing a ton of construction around the check-in. Thought I should throw that out there. I would stay again and not worry. Totally worth the money, I think the room was around $90 total and they had a discount rate on the weekends. Crazy right? But I think it's mostly a business hotel.",,,,"['sure', 'reviews', 'saying', 'work', 'worked', 'fine', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'rooms', 'spacious', 'nice', 'clean', 'check', 'time', 'late',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-columbus-worthington-columbus-2,DoubleTree By Hilton Hotel Columbus - Worthington,3.0,$$,22,"Comfy beds. Large bathrooms. Good breakfast in the morning - not free but good. They have a phenomenal gym for patrons as well as -wait for it- a golf indoor range that is computerized.  One hour for TWENTY dollars.  Are you serious? All over that. There was no one waiting so the guy gave me a free extra half hour.  Decent restaurants nearby. Great place to stay in Columbus.This place doesn't have enough recent reviews to weed out some of these picky comments. I didn't come here for anything special except for a weekend trip to columbus. Not sure if my experience was completely different because we are Hilton honors silver members and was placed on the honors floor but my experience was great!! From the time we checked in Jasmine was a sweetheart, fast, efficient and really welcomed us to the hotel. The room was excellent! Decent size, bed was comfortable and everything was clean (trust me, we check). We had mini fridge and microwave which for me is always a must when your outta town. The bed and pillows were beyond comfortable (which is usually the case anyhow with the Hilton brand). I've been to lots of hotels and this one meets my expectation in all areas, definitely worth the price.(P.S this is conveniently located next to some of the top restaurants in columbus and a movie theatre (all in walking distance).Pretty hotel, nice folks running it, great big room, black mold in the ceiling.My wife and I were attending an event at the hotel last week and had some severe problems. First though, the good things.The folks who work at this hotel are universally friendly and helpful, maybe the nicest I have seen at the many hotel stays we have had the last few years. The room was, well, roomy, had a nice couch, a comfy bed and the usual mediocre hotel bathroom (I hate bathroom hotel sinks with a passion, all of them).The first night I thought I was coming down with a cold. Stuffed up and uncomfortable through the whole night. Oddly enough, it went away within an hour or so when I left my room. During the first couple of nights, a friend posted on her FB page about how her bathroom ceiling had collapsed, revealing a lot of black mold. I'm wondering now how much of that was my problem. So, beware if you have a severe allergy. This hotel could be dangerous for you. When we attend this event again, we will stay in a different hotel.Hotel is very worn out and tired looking. Elevators broke down, hotel staff are not friendly except for a few. I think they are tired of the surroundings themselves. Please update and repair things.Normal hotel. Good enough beds. View is lame but that might be the area. Over all a good enough hotel for a conference or a short overnight trip would stay again. Nothing extraordinary good or bad.The room we got has 2 double beds but we had requested a king. Ok, we'll des leith that, but our room was like "" we really don't need this storage closet, let's make another room.  It is at the end of the hall next to stairs and that is fine but there is a tiny closet and bathroom, no towel bars and like 8"" of bathroom counter top.  The carpet in the elevator is dirty and the luggage cart was filthy.  The room and rest of the hotel is reasonable clean.The road construction outside makes getting to and from the hotel take forever during busy times.Unfortunately, zero stars isn't an option...I've stayed here many, many times and the hotel keeps going downhill.  Last straw this week.  Horrible room, unclean and appeared to have many bloodstains on carpet in my room.  Upon complaining to the front desk, the employee only laughed at my situation and offered no solution or apology.  I checked out two days early and went up the street to the Hyatt, where I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my week in Columbus.   The staff and condition/cleanliness of hotel continued to disappoint with this week's experience sealing the deal... I'll never spend another night here.Every year I attend a two-day conference for my job, and every year they choose this location.  Since I live in Columbus I can't speak to the hotel portion of this DoubleTree.  I'll limit this to the conference center and break out rooms.I tend not to comment much on service.  Service experiences, good or bad, don't mean much unless it is consistent over a number of visits.  Service is like officiating during a sporting event: if it's good, it's often invisible.  Having said that, service has more than invisible during the last four conferences I've had here.  Stuff just worked.  Food just got served.  It wasn't anything I had to concern myself with.  The rub, if there really is one here, is that the place is getting long in the tooth.  Nothing, from the parking lot to the lobby to the ballroom, has been freshened up for quite some time and everyday wear and tear is beginning to take a toll.  It's not a hotel I would choose if I wanted to impress some key note speaker from out of town.  The ballroom is underlit, and the P.A. system is weak at best.  Not sure if it's the speakers or the connections, but guests invariably say, ""Okay, can you hear me now?"" with alarming regularity.  HVAC in most of the common areas seems to be fine, but it varies widely in the breakout rooms.  DoubleTree could use a facelift, and facelifts cost big bucks, but it might be worth it if they want to complete with the myriad of other hotels in the professional services park it inhabits.Not bad, but not particularly good. This was categorized as a 4 star hotel when I booked it...and it's certainly not that. It's in a nice location and there are a lot of restaurants in the area. Traffic is awful, especially now since there is construction. I have no major gripes, but the quality of the hotel overall is 3 star in my opinion.I reserved a king room several weeks ago and tonight I was given a handicap accessible king room without a closet to hang my clothes. So I will have the wrinkled look tomorrow at my meeting. The room is old and uncomfortable and there are patches on the bathroom door and most walls, the carpet needs vacuumed and the bathroom counter is too small to place my amenities. I called the front desk and was told they are sold out sorry. I reserved this room weeks ago so there is no excuse. This is a horrible hotel, stay anywhere else!Martina at the front desk is so kind and professional, she's a breath of fresh air.I was here for a conference; however, I also stayed here at the hotel for four days.As a conference venue, this place is top-notch. The conference rooms are large and spacious, and the staff here was as helpful as possible. However, what surprised me the most was how amazing the DoubleTree catering service was. While most hotel catering services are lazy and focus more on being economic, their catering service was the nicest I have ever encountered -- and this includes private catering services at weddings. The staff was amazing and the food was even better.The hotel was upscale. The rooms were always clean and tidy. The pool was on the shallow side and the fitness center was small and modest. However, the one thing that really, really hurts this hotel in my rating was the air here. I've been to plenty of hotels during my life and I've never gotten sick off of the thick, unfiltered air like I have here. As soon as I would leave the hotel to go to the bar after training, I would be fine. I think they need to fix the AC here. Badly.Don't be spooked by the very dated exterior when you arrive at this hotel.  The inside is totally updated and the rooms are an excellent value for the price.  I'm not sure when renovations were completed, but both the lobby and my room appeared to be recently redone.  My first floor room included a spacious bathroom with granite (or faux granite, but in a hotel, who cares?) countertop, excellent lighting, and a very clean shower with excellent water pressure.  The sleeping area itself had comfortable beds with several pillows, conveniently located outlets, and a nice big flat screen on a rotating stand.Despite being located in a typical pedestrian-unfriendly, suburban highway exit area, there are several restaurants within safe walking distance.Hotel is ok, but theivery is rampant in the parking lot, so watch your car like a hawk. I stayed there  and a work truck got ripped off on Monday and another on Tuesday. Cops won't do shit except write a report and disappear back to guarding the donut shop.I was happy with my stay here. The beds were clean (plain white comforters and no weird dated designs meant to hide stains or anything here). The beds were the key thing I was worried about and I was glad to see they were inviting. The bathroom and room was otherwise clean and the decor was decent. The carpet and drapes might need an update soon, but I felt comfortable in the room. The bathroom shower was easy to operate, good water pressure and good hot water. The wifi was free with my stay and could get a little slow, but mostly worked fine. I ended up getting room service for lunch -- a crab cake sandwich with fries and a hot chocolate -- and it ended up costing me about $22. That was perhaps pricey but it was delivered quickly and was very good. They said to pur your tray outside your door when finished and it sat our there for like two days -- but I did have an end unit around a corner so maybe they just couldn't see it. I didn't end up using any housekeeping, instead opting to keep the ""do not disturb"" sign up for the duration of my stay. I did realize that hotels offering free breakfast are actually pretty good deals if you will eat breakfast everyday. DoubleTree does not offer free breakfast.If you want to go out for a meal, this hotel is in a small subdivision with several restaurants. A restaurant and bar called the Winking Lizard was almost literally across the street, and there was also a Chipotle and a movie theater nearby. No grocery stores in the immediately vicinity, but when I looked online there was a Kroger less than half a mile away. You would be able to at least walk to a couple restaurants from the hotel if you didn't have a car. So the location itself was pretty convenient too.The vending machines kind of sucked. The one on the second floor only accepted coins so I went to the front desk for change and then I realized the one on the first floor accepts $1 bills. But the vending machines only had water and soda. If you wanted any snacks or medicine or anything, you had to go to the front desk and buy it. My room key got deactivated somehow by accident, which was annoying. They said if you keep it near your phone it can deactivate. I have never heard of such thing. So it was inconvenient for me to have to go around to the front of the hotel and get my key re-activated after I went out to my car.Overall though, I'd say I did enjoy my stay. At $109 a night for two nights and $277 after taxes and my room service meal, I just wish it would've been just a bit cheaper.Nice and big..good location near 270 and 23...but dated.  My bathtub had mildew stains and I mentioned that to the front desk....they were not able to get them out.  Overall OK..I do not understand why this hotel has such low ratings, maybe it was bad before being updated? I have stayed here several times and never had an issue.The exterior can be deceiving, the interior is completely different: much more modern. The rooms are always clean, including the bathroom and the bed is comfortable. I have never used room service (nor in this hotel or any other for that matter) nor I have had the chance to use the pool or any other amenities.  It is conveniently located and fairly priced. There is a Starbucks, some restaurants and a cinema at walking distance, which considering the suburban location is a plus. Parking is free.I'm taking time to update that having attended here as a meeting planner, I am reducing my review. While the majority of the front of the house staff is ok, I had problems with most a few of the ""upper level"" people to the point that my event is considering alternate locations for next year.It's a shame, because it's generally a nice hotel, but when you overhear the front desk staff insulting your convention, there's hardly a reason to stay.Stayed for two nights.  Seems like a older hotel. Not at all what I expected from a hilton chain. Rooms were ok- nothing special- no ref-no DVD player. Bedspread had a stain when we arrived and room seemed slightly dirty - like hair on bathroom floor. Overall not worth the extra money ( single ply toilet paper is not worth more than 2 stars )I didn't actually stay at this hotel, I was only there for a conference, so I have no opinion about the accommodations.The conference facilities weren't terrible, but the were a few flaws.  The biggest issue was the heating/cooling.  The room we had our meals in, along with conference-wide programs (keynote, awards ceremony etc.) was probably about 60 degrees.  It was absolutely unbearable.  I was too busy thinking about how cold I was to actually pay attention.  During the keynote speaker, I had to leave the room because I was shivering.  A few of our smaller conference rooms were the same.  Then, on the other end of the spectrum, were the rooms that were about 80 degrees.  Not a single room's temperature was properly regulated.The food was very boring, but in my experience, this is typical at conference hotels.  The chicken was overcooked, the potatoes were cold, and the carrots were hard.On the positive side, hotel staff were very friendly and all of the facilities were bright and clean.","Hotel options in Columbus are pretty slim compared to some metropolitan areas.  We stayed at the Doubletree for a long weekend surrounding the 2009 USC vs. Ohio State game.  Being Trojan fans we were not received well no matter where we visited in the Buckeye state.  However the woman working the reception desk at the Doubletree was a Michigan fan and we were a pleasant break from the myopia she has to experience during football season.The Doubletree isn't a bad hotel but it leaves a lot to be desired.  It is clearly geared more for small conventions and business travel but it could still use a little more artistic flair and polish for this traveler. Technically there is a lounge, restaurant, gift shop and business center but none of them are really comforting or engaging.  For example, the gift shop is nothing more than a double door coat closet with some basic sundries that I can only assume you would pay for at the front desk.  There were six of us in our travel party yet the only place we could sit together as a group was in the bar or restaurant.  The rooms were typical Doubletree rooms.  Adequately appointed but nothing to make you forget the comforts of home.  They were clean and fairly well maintained which is all we really cared about on this trip.Would I stay here again?  Yes, but only if I needed some place cheap and easy to stay.  It wasn't a bad hotel, it just wasn't a good one.Kinda dated exterior. Wifi blows-could not get connected with three devices. Air stuffy. Chair in the room too low for the desk. Forget about working here.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blackwell-columbus,The Blackwell,4.5,$$$,42,"Stayed here over the weekend for a wedding. Because the wedding party had rented a lot of rooms, they were offering a discounted rate for a room. I'm not sure what they are usually are, but my room with a single King size bed came out to $110 per night. Parking for two nights was $20, I think. You can park in the garage just North and literally next to the building or you can valet. If you are staying overnight, park your car on the upper levels. The lower ones are used for others not staying overnight. The hotel is very clean. I was in multiple different rooms during my time here and did not see anything out of place or bad that stood out. The bed was comfortable and looked and felt clean. I had everything I needed in order to iron my suit and shirts. The bathroom was clean and the shower was nice. I didn't use the TV, so I can't comment on that. They had an older radio with an iPhone dock, but the dock is for iPhone 4S or before. I wasn't spending a ton of time in the hotel, so it wasn't a problem for me. I accidentally left my jacket at the hotel in the closet. I called and spoke to the housekeeping/lost and found group who located it and shipped it to me for a small fee. I appreciated their prompt and speedy shipping. I received it the next day. It's a solid hotel and it's right on campus. You could get cheaper, but you can't get a better proximity to Ohio State.This is a very convenient hotel to host meetings and conferences near The Ohio State University. I've stayed in the rooms as well as hosted visitors to the hotel and it is a very nice university hotels. It is also a great place to have meetings. They have several conference rooms that get booked well in advance, but they are great for workshops, project review meetings, or larger conferences. The also have an excellent selection of menu items for breakfast, lunch, and dinner to be served at such meetings at fair prices. I've rarely been disappointed by either the service or the quality of the rooms at the Blackwell. I highly recommend it.This hotel was pretty nice, but I don't feel like any thing ""wowed"" me during my stay.They have a shuttle service to and from the airport as well as a local shuttle service that takes you within a 3 mile radius. This was really nice and convenient because it meant that I did not have to rent a car. The service was mostly timely (give or take 5 min) and dependable, a definite plus. Everyone that worked there that I came across was obviously a student. As a student myself, I completely get it but I think it potentially affected the quality of service I received, which I will explain below. However, there are two things about this particular hotel that stood out in a negative light. First, when I pulled back my sheets, there was a makeup stain on them. Not okay.Another issue I had was I had to be at the medical center by 7a, along with two other people (we each had our own rooms). We asked one of the drivers if it would be possible, as their car service typically starts at 7a. He's mentioned that exceptions have been made in the past and to inquire to the front desk regarding it. When we asked the front desk about it, they stated they could not take us prior to 7a. Seems silly to me that they couldn't make an exception for a 5 minute drive for three paying customers. I couldn't help but wonder if the management at more investment in their job (aka it was a career vs just a job for a student), if that would have been permitted.The walls are really thin, to the point where I could hear the lock motor unlocking when a person in the hallway swiped their card to unlock it. I definitely woke up a few times due to noise - people weren't particularly loud, the walls were just thin. Overall, a clean room, nothing particular specular but nothing amazing either. I probably wouldn't stay here again if other hotels were comparable.We stayed here on a Friday night when we were in town for a show at the Newport. There was some sort of conference going on, so it took a minute to get checked in and then we had to push through a crowd of lingering humans to get to the elevators. Aside from that struggle, there wasn't much wrong with our stay. The room was fairly large and clean from what I could tell. The shower was a little weird and I felt a bit like I was in my grandma's bathtub, but other than that, it got the job done! Of note: there was a strange humming in the walls. I thought it was maybe someone using an electric razor or a vibrator, but it went on and on and on...and once I heard it, I couldn't distract my ears from it. Overall, a good place and I'm sure we'll be staying here again in the future.Clean, newer, great location. So why 1 star? Quite simply THE most uncomfortable bed Ive ever (tried) slept in. Mattress is firm like a slab of granite. The pillows are stuffed so think and full of concrete that my neck is twisted to the point that I hope I pass out from the pain just to get some shut eye. I went to school at OSU and honestly, my dorm mattress was easier to sleep on. Blackwell, get some decent beds. I am rarely envious of the homeless but I promise you that a piece of cardboard laid over gravel is at least 3x more comfortable. Oh, and please allow patrons to control a fan in their rooms on these thermostats.Very clean and comfortable room. I'm on the forth floor and have a beautiful view of the horseshoe stadium! There is free internet, and a nice bar and restaurant walking distance from all of OSU! This would be a great place for family visiting students or future students wanting to visit and see the the campus, so they are close to everything.It's the little things.I enjoyed staying at this location. Mostly because my event was located on campus and it didn't make sense to spend more money to be near the downtown area and still have to get to campus for my event. It can be at least $50-$60 less than downtown. Cabs came in under 5 minutes. While the decor wasn't the most contemporary or updated there were little things that made the stay worth it - potted REAL plant, chocolates on the bed after turn down and free wifi without some complicated login code. It isn't near Short North, in terms of walking but definitely within 10 min drive.The reason why it isn't 5 stars is because noise travels from the hallways pretty well. It's not fun to hear someone chatting it up on their cell.I was booked at the Blackwell Inn by my assistant (note to self - no bonus for her) for my weekend business trip to Columbus. Maybe I'm spoiled from traveling so much, but there are certain things I expect when I stay at a hotel that I didn't get from my stay at the Blackwell. It did seem as if the staff that had the most interaction with the patrons (doormen, front desk) were teenagers so maybe that's why the professionalism I'm accustomed to when staying at a hotel wasn't there. Who knows.Strike 1: when my colleagues and I arrived via taxi the doorman did not greet us and help us with our bags. He did however hit the handicap button so the doors would open for us. I guess we should be grateful for that act of kindness.Strike 2: check-in time is 3pm, I checked-in at 3:23pm, and was informed that my room was ready, but showing as dirty. I was asked if I wanted a different room or wanted to wait. Now, I don't know why I needed to be informed that my room was showing as dirty. All the young man who was checking me in had to do was say, ""Sir, the room we had for you isn't available so I'll put you in a different room."" Or he didn't have to say anything to me at all and could have just switched me to a new room. I would have never known. When I went pass the check-in desk about an hour later I heard the employee giving the same ""dirty room"" message to a couple checking-in and the look on the lady's face was priceless.Strike 3: When checking-in we were never informed of the services the hotel offered (i.e a free car service that you could book for drop-offs and pick-ups) or where the restaurant and gym were located. We spent about $30 on taxis before we found out we could have been requested the hotel car take us where we needed to go....I'm glad I can expense the taxi fees otherwise I would be one angry Yelper.While I focused on the negatives with my stay at the Blackwell Inn, I do want to recognize the positives i experienced.1) My king size room was indeed spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable.2) The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was delicious. The buffet had a good selection to choose from and even had a made to order omelette station.3) The staff working in the restaurant was on top of their game providing excellent service.The Blackwell is an exceedingly comfortable hotel, with spacious rooms (mine had a very long desk with two chairs, ample outlets for charging phones/computers/ipods; a king sized bed, and a nook with a fridge/coffee pot), and very comfortable beds.  The folks working at the hotel - many of whom are very young, and I assume in some kind of hotel management/hospitality program - are incredibly willing to be helpful (though sometimes you have to ask specific questions like ""When will my shuttle to the airport be here?"" to get the answers you want).  And the small touches they have here - Lindt truffles on your bed every evening - are nice.  The only downsides - the rooms aren't the quietest - by 7am, I could hear folks walking up and down the hallway, and housekeeping knocking on doors, and that was about an hour earlier than I would have liked.  And, the room service breakfast was mediocre (watery tasteless oatmeal, and the promise of a bread basket which was actually a tiny croissant and a big danish that looked straight out of a NJ diner circa 1985.) But these are small missteps - the Blackwell is a very comfortable place to stay.I am rating the Blackwell from a wedding venue standpoint. I used the Blackwell as a reception location as well as a hotel for my wedding guests to stay. When I started planning my wedding I really wanted a reception venue at a hotel because many of my hotel guests would be traveling from out of town. I really wanted a place where they could enjoy themselves without having to worry about driving to another hotel. The Blackwell was perfect for this reason and so many more. First of all when you book at the Blackwell the cost includes a wedding planner. Rachel was absolutely amazing ensuring everything I needed was perfect. From out first meeting to organizing the tasting,  and  meeting with us multiple times she was always professional, helpful, and a great guide in the process. When we ran out of a certain size room she found more, when my mom wanted to add a breakfast, it was done. She gave a head strung bride piece of mind. I didn't have to worry about a thing. Everything was coordinated,and organize creating a smooth, and fun wedding reception. Lets talk about the food. It was the best wedding food I have ever had. I cannot tell you how many of my guests told me the same thing. The options go way beyond the typical steak or chicken. There are so many options the in house chef offers that you will find something delicious to meet your wedding needs. The icing on the top of the cake was the presidential suite offer to the bride and groom on there wedding night. It was an probably will be the best hotel room I will ever stay in. Lets just say I think it was bigger than my house :) I would highly recommend the Blackwell to anyone planning a wedding, you don't even need to be a die hard Buckeyes fan.The Blackwell Inn and Conference Center is simply terrific. This moderately priced hotel is surprisingly modern. If you pay for the car valet service, you can text the valet and they'll shoot you a reply indicating when your car is out front. As a regular traveler, this is the first I've seen of this type of service. Naturally, this is The Ohio State University's hotel so it is full of OSU pride. However, the pride isn't obnoxious the way it could be elsewhere. Instead, desk and other staff turn that pride into striving to provide the best and friendliest service possible. Honestly, it's the sort of thing you wish for from all service-oriented establishments these days, yet hardly find in big name hotel chains... Additionally, the hotel room was spacious, modern and comfortable. The closet and desk space areas are better than average. Outstanding.Rooms are large, well appointed, clean and comfortable. Location is excellent on OSU campus, gym is good, restaurant and lounge are top-notch. They hosted our medical conference with smiles and great service. Don't believe the ""low"" reviews. This is no Four Seasons, but it's the best in Columbus, Ohio and would love to stay here again. The Hilton down the street was a nightmare.I have stayed here a few times while visiting an OSU student. The customer service never ceases to amaze me! The staff is friendly and courteous every time! I highly recommend this hotel!Awesome hotel. Why? Because EVERYBODY here is super nice. They anticipate your every need. From turning down your bed, to a forgotten toothbrush, to passes to the athletic center. The rooms are spacious and super clean. The price per night is fairly reasonable. Good place and folks!i stayed here over a weekend when i was traveling to Cbus for a 2nd interview with OSU. i agree with everyone else that the doorman/front door staff were not as attentive but they are teenagers. i called for my car well in advance but it was not there a few of the times. the room was clean, the breakfast buffet was really good and they even would give you a to go cup of coffee for the road. the dinner was good though the menu was limited, the staff were very attentive. rooms were clean and the gym was clean as wellI really enjoyed this hotel. The rooms were spacious and the hotel was very clean. In addition, they had morning and evening service. And in the evening they left chocolates in the room (the expensive kind). The amenities in the room were also nice such as the coffee/tea/hot chocolate maker and the television had a massive number of channels. The internet connection in the room and in the meeting rooms were excellent. Finally, the gym was good for a hotel. Big size and a good mixture of aerobic and weight machines. I recommend this place highly.A quick note on my review: I was at the hotel for a meeting with a group that booked multiple rooms. So, I'm not sure on the cost of the room and whether the internet is always free. I'm also not sure if all rooms receive morning and evening service.You couldn't find a better place to stay if visiting The Ohio State campus. The room was beautiful - very large with every amenity you can imagine, including a scale. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location is within walking distance of all sports venues and the campus.Had business on OSU campus and The Blackwell came highly recommended for it's convenient location. The lobby was much nicer than expected, albeit a little small. There were a lot of athletes staying in the hotel that night and when 15 or so of them are hanging in the lobby -- it makes for a tight squeeze. To the side is a bar that served really delicious food (especially when you take into consideration that it is a hotel).The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. Apparently there is turndown service and the attendant leaves chocolate and a weather report card though somehow my room was missed :-(Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by The Blackwell and will without a doubt stay here next time I am in town!I booked this place through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> when I needed a place to stay close to the medical center. It fit all my criteria: free airport pickup, free transport within three miles, and easy on the budget. I was most impressed when I arrived to find it was waaaay more luxurious than I expected! Beautiful lobby, friendly staff at check in, and a gift shop with all the scarlet and grey stuff you could ever want-- seriously, I never stay in places like this. My room was clean, comfortable, and outfitted with more desk space than I knew what to do with, plus free Wi-Fi. It is very obvious that the Blackwell was designed with the business traveler in mind. An in-room Keurig and fridge completed the setup. The bed was super duper comfy and  overlooked the university campus. Other happy occurrences:The turn down service where they left a Lindt truffle and a card with the next day's weather forecast on my bed. The super precious college students who happened to be my drivers and gave me more of a city tour than any official tour guide could, plus the skinny on where to go and what to do in the city. The fact that this hotel is IN THE MIDDLE of the OSU campus, so I got to wander the beautiful grounds when the weather was nice. The other fact that this hotel is a stones throw from the football stadium, so I wished I wouldn't been there a day earlier so I could've tailgated. I could not have asked for a more lovely lodging experience.I have stayed at The Blackwell once a year, 2 years in a row, each extended stays, and each time having btwn 5-10 rooms booked for our group. I coordinate this trip, so I hear all the complaints, or compliments. We are always very happy w our stay. The staff are wonderfully friendly, and like other reviewers have said, genuine. The staff seems genuinely happy to help - this is SO very refreshing! Questions, needs, requests are never a bother or inconvenience - they get its part of their job. Hooray! The rooms are great - from comfy beds to ample work space to awesome bathroom. I *always* have problems w the coffee maker though :( They always send up coffee via room service, but I'd just really prefer to make my own &amp; not greet a stranger in pj's. We've eaten in the hotel restaurant twice, once breakfast, once lunch, each time we've been very pleased. From reading all the other reviews, I'm realizing The Blackwell has WAY more amenities than we were aware of, they can do a MUCH better job ensuring folks know of these, esp the extended stay folks. We''l definitely be taking more advantage of these next year! But all-in-all, this is a GREAT place to stay. We'll be back!","I've travelled a decent amount and this is my favorite hotel yet. Amazing service ( including nightly truffles) and the local shuttle service alone is worth 5 stars. Rooms are very nice and spacious, my to came with its own kuerig machine too!Very close to a ton of food options, an the driving staff will even take you to Starbucks down the street for your morning fix. I you have the opportunity to stay here, do it, you won't be disappointedGreat food - great hassles. I attend a catered dinner and awards night each year hosted at the Blackwell. It is a beautiful venue and offers accomodations for out of town visitors. Recently, a new chef took over and introduced special items for our organization. The food: Very good. They can cook a filet perfectly. There's a bit too much going on for a plating. I had a surf and turf - steak and sea bass (I only wish it Chilean, but alas it wasn't). There was well-seasoned sauted spinach beneath the sea bass, but the sea bass was covered in tasteless parsley and lacked salt or pepper. The filet was atop a balsalmic gravy (tasty, but unneccessary) and was cooked too perfectly to require much additional seasoning. In fact, the gravy was a distraction. There also was a delicious sweet potatoe mash, well-seasoned spaghetti squash, and squished tomatoes. This was too many ""other"" items that detracted from the dish.Servers and Service: Sadly, it goes downhill. Maybe this is a management problem, maybe not. Several tables never recieved their entrees! They just forgot to serve them dinner, but served them salads and desserts. What a mess! The coffee service is nice and the food was served at temperature. They did two rounds of wine service (I'd rather they just leave a bottle at the table). I look forward to another tastly treat again soon!I hate the Buckeyes, but The Blackwell was great!When I found out that this hotel was basically on the campus at Ohio State, I was ready to not enjoy my stay at all. It was a long few days of travel and finding out that The Blackwell was on the Ohio State campus, for some reason, put me in a foul mood.  I was ready to find something wrong with the service or the facility. I'm usually a pretty positive and upbeat guy, but I just wasn't ready to enjoy staying here. All that being said, this place was fantastic.  It was absurd how every need seemed to be anticipated, every face was genuinely smiling, and all of this in a very well appointed room at an excellent value.  It was almost disturbing that these guys did so well...everyone really knocked it out of the park on this one!  I'll continue to not like the Buckeye sports teams, but will go out of my way to stay at this hotel again.  Great job to all of you at The Blackwell.I stayed here for a wedding I was in. My husband and I arrived at 3pm on the dot and there were no rooms ready. Kind of bummed since we had a ton of stuff to carry up, so we waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes. The room was nice enough, had a lot of desk type space and since we were sharing the room with another couple, that was nice. It had a fridge, that froze everything we put in it, and a speaker dock, that didn't work. There is a keurig to make coffee. No fan in the bathroom, which is not awesome when four people need to take showers and get ready. The bride was on the executive floor which was where we got ready and they have a little snack area set up with a cool coffee maker and pop/juice free for the taking. The housekeeping staff was great. We had the do not disturb on our door and when the one lady saw me going, she stopped and asked if we needed anything for the room. She definitely went out of her way. The paper is also hanging on the door each morning, it was the Columbus Dispatch. Valet parking for $17/night and you just text them when you need your car. It was ready every time I needed it.I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the Blackwell. I've stayed here a few times as I have a student at the University and it's very conveniently located on campus. The majority of the front desk help are University students, extremely polite, very helpful, and courteous from the minute you pull into the front entrance. The Hotel has a car you can use if need be, and there is also a hotel shuttle that will take you where you need to go within a few miles, with free transportation to and from the Airport. Who needs a car?? Anything you ask for, they seem to always have the right response, so helpful. You have a morning newspaper at your door every morning and your bed is turned down for you at night. Rooms are very clean and bathrooms well equipped. Great coffee, and tea in the room. The Hotel Restaurant has wonderful food. Although it is a little higher in price in comparison to a few of the others around the area, the amenities that are included make up the difference, and the service is so worth it. I highly recommend the Blackwell.One of my favorite hotels.   I've been staying at the Blackwell roughly once a year from almost the time that they opened, more than a decade ago.   The Blackwell was the very first hotel at which I stayed where there was (free) internet in the rooms, and I've been impressed with this place from the get-go.    Very comfortable beds, a kitchy turn-down service in which chocolates are placed on the bed and the bedside radio is tuned to music that features the likes of Barry Manilow, the Spinners, etc. (these being two of the featured artists in songs that were playing when I entered my room last week).    The shades are true blackout shades - the room can be pitch dark at high noon on June 21 - and everything is comfortable.       My only negative comments about The Blackwell are that the exercise room is really quite lame, an indoor pool would be a great addition, and the breakfasts - while good - is not ""fantastic"" and really should be comped to the guests at the hotel.I stayed at the Blackwell for a wedding I attended that was held in the banquet hall. The hotel room was clean though it felt a little small. The staff was professional and friendly though, and the room was comfortable.The weddng itself was a little generic. The food was just ok, the bar set up was less than ideal and seating during the cocktail hour wasn't easy to find or comfortable. The Blackwell has a great location for all Buckeye related events, but they know this and charge accordingly. This is usually the very last place I consider when I'm coming to Columbus.right on campus. Easily a 4 star hotel that has excellent service. What surprised me was that it is apparently completely run by the school and the students at OSU. They have a valet service which you can use which is $15 a night or you can park at the parking structure right next door and that caps at $10 no matter how long you stay there. Again, it's right on OSU campus so I can't imagine you staying anywhere else except here if you're visiting someone at the school or the school itself.The Blackwell is an amazing hotel with absolutely stellar service. I attended a technical conference there and I couldn't have been happier. The food was tasty and it was well located within Columbus.The rooms were extremely comfortable and I had no complaints about anything. I did have an unfortunate experience with the front desk, where they didn't know too much about the running trails in the area. I was directed to run in the OSU campus, rather than taking the nice riverside trail feet from the hotel door. The trail was very nice, whereas the campus would not have been a very nice run.This hotel is all about excellence. I stayed here for three nights as I was visiting the school for an interview, and also because it was the hotel the school recommended me to stay at. I am truly impressed with everything about this hotel. The airport shuttle service was convenient (be sure to call in to reserve a spot), and the shuttle driver was an undergraduate student at OSU so I had the opportunity to hear about the school and the area from his perspective.Checking in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly in handling the matters. Since I had the room to myself, it was especially spacious and very clean. The business style desks were nice and the leather chairs complemented them pretty well. What surprised me most was when the hotel staff came by my room at night around 8:30 and offered me ice, chocolate, and a card with weather info for the next day. I was quite impressed by this and I could tell that the hotel accommodates their guests very well. For nights when you're not around, the staff tidies up your room again, which I also thought was very considerate of them (as if making the room during the day wasn't enough).The bathrooms throughout the hotel were very clean. They have hand towels for you to use if paper towels aren't enough for you. The business center was open 24 hours (as long as you have your key card on you), so if there are any Internet or printing matters that needs to be taken cared of you can get it done there.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Blackwell. I highly recommend it for those visiting the school or even if you're just visiting Columbus. I will definitely stay here again if I ever come by Columbus again.The Sunday buffet was good, great variety and good quality of food. The staff was TERRIBLE. At the buffet they were unsure of items (whipped cream or butter?) and were not very personable. The dining room staff did not clear plates and had to be flagged down multiple times for a drink refill with a 30% capacity dining room. Gratuity of 20% was added to our buffet bill for a group of eight.reasonably priced boutique-y hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff. Valet parking only-so add that to the cost. Skip the over-priced restaurantExcellent hotel--4.5 stars (rounding up)!! I stayed here before finally transferring to Ohio State. *The beds are so comfortable, and the pillows are fat with stuffing!* The service is generally great, from its airport shuttle to its concierge, and its wireless connection is excellent--as is the business computer lab, which is amply soundproofed despite its location near the reception hall (where I gather many a Buckeye wedding party is held for alumni couples).A special shout-out to the airport shuttle drivers, who I notice are usually OSU undergrads, and with whom I've held pleasant conversations.My only minor gripe would probably be the valet drivers/doorpersons, also undergrads. Sometimes they kind of just ""hang out"" there, talking about their party exploits or something of the like--or maybe that's just what I just keep running into when I encounter them? So maybe it's just me.Anyway, I honestly wish I could dorm here. :-DOoooooowah.  Super fancy.  I loved the his &amp; hers desks across from the separate beds.  It was totally convenient, and really spacious and well designed.  There's like 7 HBO channels but we couldn't find anything good to watch.  TV today, honestly.  If I could find anything negative to say, it would be that the staff was almost....like, TOO helpful and accommodating.  Like, they came to our room around 8:30pm with ice and chocolate.  Those silly helpful guest services people!  And they held the door open nearly every time I entered or left the front door.  And the beds were sooooo comfy.  I slept like an angel in a fluffy cloud.The family and I just returned from a weekend in Columbus.  We stayed at The Blackwell for 2 nights, and enjoyed our visit immensely.The hotel is very warm and inviting; the rooms are large, clean, and well-appointed.  We stayed on the third floor, which was really quiet - the only neighborly noise we heard was the odd toilet flush or shower turning on. There are a LOT of TV channels - way better variety than I've experienced elsewhere.  The location is also phenomenal; we did visited a few different areas of Columbus, and were never more than a 10 minute drive from any of them.Tips for you:+ Join the hotel's loyalty program and make your reservations through that site (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iPrefer.com&amp;s=1c0fb051c94486f7cac5f3c5cc2d796ddc08ba6cf0dfd637eb6888720ea80d3e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">iPrefer.com</a>) to score better rates and some freebies.  On this visit, we booked for about $20 less than rack rate, received vouchers for breakfast in Bistro 2110 (which I'll review separately, so as not to mar the hotel's rating), and were comped wireless Internet access.+ If you will have a car at the hotel - consider parking on your own at the Lane Avenue garage right next door to the hotel ($7/day during the week; $3/day on the weekends).  The hotel charges $15/day for valet, and they're parking your car in that same garage.  The only way it wouldn't be more economical to park on your own is if you will need multiple in/out privileges; you have to pay each time you leave the garage.Overall a great hotel that you should have few, if any, qualms about booking.  We'll definitely stay at The Blackwell again.My first stay at The Blackwell was pleasant.  The staff was professional and I was greeted promptly.  Our room was relatively spacious complete with cable TV, a marble bathroom and decent sheets.  I woke up to a USA today at my door which is always a nice touch.  The lobby was decorated for Christmas and very pretty.  They went a little too far with a cinnamon scent, they really don't need it and it gave me a headache.The banquet meal was good.  What you would expect from a hotel.  I'm rounding up a 3.5 star to a 4.  The hotel met my expectations and I applaud the students who run it.  They are doing a great job operationally but at the end of the day this is a business hotel, it is not the Ritz Carlton.I've stayed here during two visits to THE Ohio State University. The Blackwell is an amazing hotel, and I'm flabbergasted that students of the Fisher School of Business can run an establishment like this so professionally. Check-in:The door is opened for you with a smile and greeting. A comfy lobby greets you, with a seating area and stairs in the center. To the left, the check-in desk and gift shop; to the right, the bar and lounge with a wonderful fireplace and big TVs. The front desk attendants are very friendly and efficient. I request a ""no-post"" (no hold on debit card) on my room and they are happy to comply. I get my key and head up in the elevator.The Room:Both visits, I've stayed in a Double room with Queen Size beds. The rooms are very large and well-appointed. They feature ultra-comfy beds with lots of pillows and a down comforter. The window offers a great view of THE Ohio State football stadium and other recognizable buildings. My favorite feature of the rooms has been the large built-in desks, with power outlets built in to the surface. I have plenty of room to spread out all of my papers and computer peripherals. Between the desks is a very large flat-panel television that serves as the centerpiece of the room. The bathrooms are clean and fairly large. I always enjoy the showers with adjustable showerheads, and the large bathtub. The food:Excellent!! I had several meals during the most recent event that brought me to The Blackwell. Most memorably, a catered dinner that featured a huge spread; salad, prosciutto and asparagus trays, portobello mushroom ravioli, garlic bread, squash, steaks, and some *incredible* stuffed chicken breasts. I returned for seconds. The Blackwell is an awesome concept, and I applaud Fisher and its students for doing such an amazing job. If I'm ever in Columbus again, I know where I'm staying!The hotel, itself, was above average. Rooms were clean and comfortable, and the hotel was easy to navigate. We met at the Conference Center next to the hotel, which was great for the purposes of our meeting. One large meeting room with breakout rooms nearby. The setup was just perfect for my company's retreat.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.The staff went above and beyond, helping me coordinate my stay and get little things accomplished.  The shuttle from the airport is great, runs about ever 90 minutes, just have to call ahead.  A pretty good setup to avoid renting a car if OSU is the focus of your stay.  Everyone I worked with was friendly and professional.Free HBO!  A block away from THE Ohio State Football stadium!  Near campus! Near Hide Street (good collection of restaurants and the like)The rooms were comfortable, with a well stocked restroom and closet.  The business center has free internet.  The Bistro wasn't too bad either.  Room service came by frequently and checked to ensure that we were in good shape for services.Definitely not a bad place to stay when you are snowed in, like I was during my trip to THE Ohio State Grad program","Expect to catch a bite before the 3pm checkin to your room.  Don't.  I should have eaten at the airport.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-columbus-hotel-at-capitol-square-columbus-2,Sheraton Columbus Hotel at Capitol Square,3.0,$$,61,"Nice, city hotel.  We were in town for the weekend and this one looked like I'd expect from Sheraton and we got what we expected.  Front desk staff was pleasant and seems genuinely sorry for a room key error, so it was not big deal.  Room was decently sized and very clean.  We stayed club level and the club suite had everything we needed and very friendly staff.  We didn't eat at the restaurant and the street level Starbuck's is just a Starbuck's.  Nothing special about it.  My one issue with the place isn't really even their fault - parking.  As a lot of yelpers have written, the valet is extremely slow in retrieving your vehicle.  I realize due to location of the cars, the traffic, and the one way streets, it takes time.  At $28 or whatever it is, it's certainly not worth it.  You can park across the street for $17 a day and have your car in 2 minutes.  The valets also won't let you use the luggage carts without them taking them to the room.  It didn't bother me too much and our guy was very friendly and helpful, so that's a positive. Overall, a nice, clean hotel with good views and one I would return too.I liked the location but I didn't like the fact that when I left the hotel I couldn't come back until the evening because I only had 1 free valet per day.  I looked at their room service and noticed the 22% gratuity and thought it was a little excessive.  Plus I never meet anybody from the conference I went to which sucked. Plus why was every restaurant around the State Capitol closed after 10pm during the week day? I thought a bigger city would be a little more liberal on that front.  I came to this hotel in July.  I found it annoying that they had no premium channels.  I did get this hotel at a really cheap rate ($99) which was nice.This Sheraton was real nice and centrally located in DT C-bus. We dida last minute booking (same evening) &amp; scored an amazing ""name your own price"" deal. Even considering the 3rd party , reduced-rate booking type, they still awarded my SPG points and perks for a nicer room &amp; free H2O btl. The lobby is very modern and pretty. All facilities we saw were clean and room much updated and spacious! Staff was very friendly and professional. Would definitely stay here again and also recommend.Nice hotel, friendly staff and very comfortable beds but the worst shower I've ever experienced!  Water just randomly changes from warm to scalding hot to cold and then stays cold. Bathroom dusty and not very clean.Everytime I stay at a Sheraton Hotel I'm always impressed with the customer service and attention to detail used in there design of the lobby and guest rooms. I suggest becoming a Sheraton club member because you always get the automatic upgrades and added perks during your stay. This Sheraton had a Starbucks in the lobby that was top notch and made the stay that much more enjoyable. The restaurant was 5 star and top shelf drinks and entrees. Try the steak nasal lions and spiced vegetables. Truly amazing in every way. I recommend staying here even if it's out of the way. Well worth a try!! :)This review is for the Sheraton as an event location, not for the hotel itself.Sweetie and I came for the Ohioana book festival, held in several banquet rooms here.  It was a good place for such an event- plenty of room and amenities, clean, easy to find and get around.  Parking is right across the street at the Statehouse.  Columbus Commons is right nearby if you're going to an event there.  The lobby has comfy chairs and some working areas, plus a Starbucks.For a conference, trade show, wedding, etc., this would be a nice facility in a prime location.Attended the Columbus Arts festival last weekend and the Sheraton, which we found out is the official hotel of the festival, helped us out in a last minute pinch, when the property we originally booked had a water main break &amp; cancelled all reservations.We were graciously welcomed when we dropped off our cars and walked in the lobby to check in, the check in process took minutes and we were on our way.Our room on the 10th floor was clean, AC worked well, bed was comfortable, got a restful nights sleep. Only qualm was the bed &amp; bathroom linens were pretty warn, yes they do get lots of use in a big hotel, but could have been newer, better quality.Stayed here for a wedding weekend.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The valet parking is a bit steep but it's not hard to find spots on the street or in nearby lots on the weekend.We had a lovely view of the Statehouse from our room.Keep in mind the Starbucks located in the hotel has limited hours and the adjacent retail shops and restaurants were closed on Saturday.We did not eat in the hotel so can't speak to the food quality.  Just a few minutes drive to plenty of eateries and attractions.Good place to stay while visiting Columbus for a business trip. Amenities are average and I wouldn't say there was anything special about this place. I was impressed that they had siggis yogurt at their catered breakfast. That's my favorite yogurt!While I believe this may be on of the nicer starwood properties downtown, there are a few other properties in general that are a tad bit nicer. So why do I stay at this location:(1) Overall, the staff is excellent. Sometimes their desire to be friendly causes slow check-ins, but when it is your turn, you don't mind so much.(2) This property has a club level and I usually take advantage of breakfast and or appetizers in the evening if I make it back in time.(3) Location as others have been mentioned is pretty decent and when the weather is nice makes for a nice walk into more populated areas of the city.On the other hand, this hotel really can go from good to great with some slight finishing touches (updated bathroom fixtures, decor, better gym design). Oh how I wish they would, but it's not enough to keep me away.Our alumni association recently held its Hall of Fame reception and ceremony at the Sheraton Capitol Square.  This review does not cover individual rooms, guest services or bar/restaurant.I worked directly with room, catering and A/V services.  They are a very buttoned-up group from start to finish.  Mine was a relatively small group (130 guests) so 2/3 of the Governor's ballroom became our choice.  We held the reception in the lobby area outside the ballroom then opened the doors to seating (15 ten-round tables) with speaker's riser, two podiums with mics, one handheld mic for audience participation, screen and projector for powerpoint presentation.Everyone was great to work with on the project.  We enjoyed butler-passed foods, had cash bar service and a veggie, cheese and crackers table for attendees.  The catering staff put together the menu (standard but delicious, coconut baked shrimp, chicken, and other nice warm foods).  Each time I requested a table or chair set-up it was done.  The A/V team knew answers to things when we asked them.A couple notes.  Elevators to that area were difficult to locate and we needed on for a 92-year old attendee.  The valet car-park area is very tight.  The staff hustles but on a busy evening my bet would be on the time clock running awhile before your car appears.  Congested.Location, location, location..... the Sheraton Capitol Square also served as one of our company's clients for the 2013 Presidents Cup.  With Columbus Commons being an adjacent site, this is very convenient and very nice view.I'll take groups back to the Sheraton Capitol Square.  Yes!Worst place I've ever stayed in. The HVAC was loud all day and night, and they didn't change my comforter.. I was there for 3 nights! I realized in horror the last morning. Didn't even have HBO or Showtime smh. Don't book it.When I search for a hotel in a moderate sized city and immediately see the ""Call"" word next to just about every option, I get worried. I get worried that I'll have to either pay a) an exhorbitant amount of money for an even ""decent"" hotel room - if said room is even available or 2) I'll have to stay miles and miles outside of the city center in a random motel. No thanks.Thus, I wasn't thrilled paying $280/night for this hotel stay during my last trip to Cbus, but I truly didn't have any other nearby option. Let's roll down the pros and cons...The Good:-Starbucks in the lobby-Friendly staff-Comfy beds and nicely appointed rooms-Modern decor-Choice toiletries that include shave cream, shampoo/condo, body wash, lotion, mini shower loofah, nail kit, mouth wash, soap-Keurig in room-Club rooms are spacious and offer a nice for additional snacks and continental breakfast food-Jeni's ice cream available in the lobby coolerThe Meh:-That price was craaaaazy-Location is decent but facing a busy street so grabbing a ride of any kind can be on the challenging side -Elevators are on the slow side-Room service options are lackluster at bestWhile this wouldn't be my first choice for a Columbus hotel, it provided the necessary means for a comfortable night's stay.This is, by far, one of the best options for Downtown business hotel!Large modern rooms and hallways.  Great linens.  Nice furniture in rooms. Towels are good.  Bed is very comfy.  Alarm clock is great quality.The second floor has a large and comfortable lounge and dining area - I love it!I always got my coffee off-site from here...Location:On MON/TUE catch the happy hour sushi specials down the street at Rishi Sushi Kitchen &amp; Bar.On WED/THU, at 7:30, catch a $4 movie at the absolutely beautiful Ohio theatre - this is on the same block - this is a MUST DO.For coffee/ breakfast/ lunch, go to Au Bon Pain - it is 1/2 block away, or Tim Hortons a bit further, or if you are really -SERIOUS- about your coffee, go to Cafe Brioso.For cocktails or a bite to eat, go to Gay street - tip top - 2 blocks away - just a bit further than Au Bon Pain.Or go to the establishments across from the Greyhouse station - El Camino Inn is one of them,For dinner - well, I haven't found anything -great- yet, so keep looking.Columbus has a lot of cocktail bars with good prices, and multi-level parking garages.Nice hotel, very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The gym is on the 22nd floor and has an awesome view of downtown the 2nd floor bar has decent food and friendly bartenders.  It's probably not the best deal in town price-wise but I wanted a location that was walkable to all the places I needed to get to.  Besides 'overpriced' in Ohio is still cheaper the 90% of most other places.My only complaint was the lack of a vent/fan in the bathroom, luckily my sht doesn't stink but you're probably not as fortunate.Like others have mentioned...the beds are comfy, the rooms are spacious and the location is in the smack dab center of the city.  And the refurbishments are nice.  So that is all good.The lounge sucks.  Well actually the service sucks and the food sucks, the lounge itself is decent.The staff totally blows.  The front desk is a bit surly.  I don't know if they have more than one luggage cart, but if they do, they are missing.  They have a bellhop who will ""put your name on the list"" to come get your crap but how about just having more carts....?  The valet guys are nice, but get your name on that list too because it takes a while.  They like to charge for everything.  $10/day for crappy internet, $23/day for valet, $10 for a fridge.  Sorry, but if I am here for 2 weeks, you can probably throw a few of those things in.Also the housekeeping is terrible.So yeah, it sucks.Nice hotel. Very clean and with in walking distance to many of Columbus' top attractions. The wifi isn't the quickest, but it isn't too bad and very usable. The bathrooms are large and the beds are comfortable. I'm disappointed in their resturaunt. It's pretty terrible even for a hotel resturaunt. But there's a full Starbucks in the lobby. Coffee lovers, drink your heart out!My review is for the restaurant only. We stopped in because it was close to the theatre and the rolling rain storms are not kind to dress clothes.We were seated by the hostess whom we told we were stopping for a drink and dessert before a show at the Ohio. We waiting ten minutes before the bartender  noticed no waitress had servers us and took our drink order. We waited another ten minutes before flagging down our ""server"" (whom only stopped by to refill the water the bartender provided us) to order our dessert.The bartender poured generously on the glass of port wine I ordered. The dessert ordered was fine (it was a brulee, but it was really cold as if it wasn't torched fresh).On our way out we passed a sad looking wine cabinet that only had two bottles in it. The rest of the restaurant seemed nice, but more as a bar to cater to the hotel guests, and not the fine dining experience they were trying to make it out to be. It was pretty darkly lit as well, matching the drab rainy day outside. It's also confusing to have to take a roundabout escalator or elevators to reach the restaurant itself.The dessert and drink was acceptable. The neglectful service was not. I will not be returning with other fine dining options well within walking distance.Great, comfortable room.  Good view of downtown.  Perfect place to end an evening after dinner at De Novo and a drink at Sidebar.  Oh, and a bellman who looked like Ryan Johansen.  He said he gets that a bit.The rooms were pretty decent. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The shower takes about 10 minutes to get past lukewarm. The coffee provided in the room was Starbucks which was nice. The coffeemaker was kind of messy though because the individual coffee pods were too big for the holder. The bar/restaurant lounge on the 2nd floor was nice. We didn't grab food there but it was comfortable. There were a couple of televisions playing the football games. The bartender was extremely nice. There was a loud, obnoxious group of people at a table behind us so we chose to leave. It rained the night we were there so we didn't venture too far by foot but there are a few bars within walking distance. The valet the night we were there deserves about 1 star. It is $25 for overnight and we waited for 10 minutes on the street before we could even pull into the drive. When we finally got to pull in, there were still a bunch of cars and 2 valet attendants standing there socializing. I don't know if the attendants need to go, or the valet area needs to be larger.","Staying here for two weeks on business trip. It's a fine hotel, but certainly not worth the money. Not a value. I would recommend staying elsewhere for this price. Friendly staff, good location, and clean premises. However, the decor is very dated. Popcorn ceilings, dark brown wallpaper and carpet, and black furniture. Very dark rooms regardless of windows.  There aren't sufficient power plugs. So, if you are planning on bringing a few devices, like a phone, computer, etc. bring a multi-outlet adapter. The AC is amped up - very cold!  Even after turning off air or turning on heat (which doesn't work in summer) it is extremely cold. If you visit during the summer pack sweaters and warm pajamas. Our toilet was running (because it's really old, the ones they used to make in the 80's before water efficient toilets were mandated by law) and on the third day actually flooded out the bathroom (not from it being plugged up nor from debris). They were very accommodating and prompt to help us move to another room. Again, very polite and kind staff. But we had a lot of stuff to move, as we are here for two weeks. It was an inconvenience. The toilet in the new room also runs, which is noisy and annoying, but hasn't overflown yet. I think this must have been a really amazing hotel back in 1980, but unfortunately it still feels like the 80's in here. On the website, it says it was established in 2011, but it seems like that might be when Sheraton bought it from another hotel company, because this hotel and decor is certainly much older than that. Again, it's an average hotel with nice staff, but certainly not worth the money.Exemplary ServiceThis was the most consistent A+ service throughout. The check-in desk staff all had bright smiles. The server in the lounge had a smile and was friendly. The room service was discrete and observant (left extra shower gel without being asked). The Club Floor rooms were great and I loved the upgraded elements. All around A+ for the service and attitude for the employees. Would definitely recommend again.First, let me say the beds are sooo comfortable. The rooms are spacious, but could be better lit. We had a decent rate, so I don't think it's all that overpriced.Here are a few tips for making the most of your stay here:* We chose this hotel in part because of the shuttle, which we needed for transport to the convention center. However, the hours the shuttle runs are very, very limited - something like 7 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Weekdays only. The shuttle driver is very nice, however, and even started his day a little early for us. * We ordered in-room breakfast and specified two people. The first day it arrived late with service  items for one person (we ordered two items and wrote in the number of persons).* The yogurt parfait has a ton of jam in it. If you're okay with this, it's huge and will fill you right up. Happy to see someone posted a photo - check it out before you order.* Housekeeping will not change the sheets if you leave anything on the bed, including pajamas. We found this out the hard way. The next day, we made a point of clearing the beds of non-hotel items; they were made, but no clean sheets (this was on our 3rd day). The next morning we left a note explicitly requesting a change, and, ta-da, fresh sheets at last!* The bathroom was generally clean, with the exception of a little mold at the bottom of the shower curtain. * Beware of the hotel glasses. The ones in the bathroom had a layer of toothpaste (not ours) at the bottom. Instead, use the disposable cups. Pro tip!* The WiFi here is *painfully* slow! Also, it costs $10/day; should be free. * On the plus side, there is a beautiful park just behind the hotel with a Neo electronic playground. There was even live music playing there on Friday night. The Starbucks in the lobby is also quite nice. Also, they provide free bottled water in the rooms.Good location for a hotel. However, it was the second highest priced room I could find in the city, and yet they charge $25 for valet on top of room price and only provide parking in an adjacent building where you get charged by the hour.  Furthermore, I am visiting for Columbus pride; came to the room at 3 am and just wanted to order room service. The menu is lackluster (reminiscent of airline snack for purchase food), and when I called to place an order I was informed that they were not serving food tonight of all nights even though the menu says 12am to 6am everyday. They couldn't even recommend a restaurant that would deliver.Oh, final note: there is no vent in the bathroom. So if you go for number 2, bring some deodorizer. Overall, this has been a pretty bad experience for the price I paid. I Will choose a cheaper motel next time and will probably have similar or better amenities and service.One of the worst hotel stays we've ever had! We still had fun in Columbus because we know in the grand scheme of things, these are not ""real problems"" Life is too short to care about petty things.  However, given we were in an American city staying in a well-known chain hotel with the amount of money we spent each night, we expected to have a smooth stay.What worked?-The valet guys were on the ball! Professional, prompt and good-humored-Large comfortable king-sized bed-Room service delivery was timely and the food was well-prepared What didn't work?-Room was dark and stuffy-Lame excuses and inexplicable passive-aggressive/weird behavior. Examples:-Had to put our dining trays outside after wait staff was no show when we called down -We came in around 3am after attending the High Ball halloween festival. It was late but we were not loud. We were undressing and watching videos online. Perhaps we were louder than we thought we were, but I believe the walls are pretty thin. Security came up to warn us that we were disturbing other guests...by laughing in bed. Hmmm-At one point, in the middle of the night, someone tried to enter our room. My boyfriend went to the door and no one was there. He lingered and a hotel employee came around the corner. When my bf asked if it was him who tried to open the door, after a series of incomplete, indirect answers, he finally said yes they were making the rounds. But couldn't really explain why he was trying to open our door.  -When we called down to front desk to see if we could get a couple of bananas before a run, a man told us that it would cost $25.00 to enter the ""platinum member"" restaurant and how allowing us to buy two bananas would not be ""fair"" to those members. Hmmm. Then when we asked if there was a local store we could go to, he said he didn't have any idea where we could go in the area.-When we called downstairs  for service regarding the cable, we were told to look around our room for the TV guide. I promptly told the woman that I already did that  (thats why I was calling). Then she put me on hold and transferred me to the hotel bar where another employee said to go to ""channel 300"" and if I was still having issues, he'd send up ""hotel engineers."" There are not 300 channels! It was clear they were taking a piss and had no interest in helping us. When we called back, they said they would come up. No one came up; no one called back to say they were delayed or anything. -When I gave the last two digits of our valet number to  the front desk to have our car brought around, she laughed and said. ""that doesn't help me"" then she mumbled under her breath ""well, maybe it does."" I just told her I'd call them myself. I gave them the same numbers and they brought the car around.-On our last morning, I called the extension for valet. No answer. So I called front desk (unfortunately same woman...double shift?) and said we'd there was no answer at the valet service and we'd like our car to head to airport. She said with a tone that they had just stepped away and I could call them back. Seems innocuous but the tone implied we were impatient even though she told us the night before to call the front desk if we couldn't get through to valet. -As we walked out of the hotel through the lobby, with bags in tow past the front desk, the same woman didn't say a thing. It was 5:30 am. No one around and silent in a relatively small lobby. She saw us. All hotel employees offer some sort of salutation as you enter/leave. Nothing from her! Not a peep! We had transferred to this hotel from a Red Rood + to ""live it up"" but it would've been better to stay put. They were clean, VERY friendly and accommodating. No attitude, no excuses. Just GREAT, PROMPT service. Stay there: 111 Nationwide Blvd. Columbus, Ohio 43215When we returned our rental car to Enterprise, it was quite the opposite as well. The attendant was cheerful and courteous. When I realized I hadn't gone to the gas station, without saying a word, he checked us out and when he tore off the receipt, he told us he only charged for 1/4 tank instead of half and if the service was good. I told him it was excellent. And then he asked us (before we could ask him) if we knew how to get to enter the airport. Then gave us directions.My two cents...RaeGinajust trust me this is 2 stars at mostI travel to Columbus weekly and stay at a variety of hotels downtown. This Sheraton is not bad and with a few basic improvements it could be solid.Good: comfy beds, big rooms, good A/C, Fat Tire on tapBad: Slow internet - not slow as in I can't stream HBO GO, but slow as in text web pages are slow to load. I did a speed test each night this week and the dowload speed is .25mb/second.Had a long drive and pulled into the Sheraton. We were greeted with a kind person at the front desk. We then went to the bar for a drink and John the bartender was so accommodating, very friendly, and really made our experience a positive one at the Sheraton in Columbus, Ohio. The rooms are very nice too!The hotel was average. It was sufficient, but not modern. The room service was extremely limited, but there's plenty of great eating places nearby. There's even a Starbucks inside the hotel. The wine list was very limited. Bad phone reception in my room; junior suite. My cellular phone calls constantly dropped calls. The bed was really comfy and the view in my room was spectacular. The furniture is dated and the colors were brown, white, brown and brown. New furniture definitely needed-- not upscale or modern. The hotel staff was exceptional. Every level of staff was friendly and helpful. If pressed, I would stay there again. The rates are very fair. I travel a lot so I have to give it two stars. But I am hopeful they will upgrade...eventually.The tenth floor doesn't have good signage for where your room is - signs are only located at the elevator (right above the buttons), but not the hallway. Room 1024's bathtub didn't drain. The shared door between rooms is VERY thin-can hear all of your neighbor's conversation (including morning alarms, tv, cell phone conversations, etc). I was not on the SPG floor (didn't have the SPG emblem), so maybe the rooms are better on the SPG floors.The reservations button on the phone directs you to the restaurant, not the hotel reservations desk. Valet parking will tell you they'll have your car ready in ten minutes, and they really do mean that. Valet parking was $23/day but the room rate was $99/night so can't complain too much. Valet parking was severely understaffed on Monday, 15Apr2013, at 9AM.In case you're unfamiliar with Sheratons, wifi and breakfast are not free. The bottled water was free, although there is no fridge to put the bottled water in (no microwave either). The only reason why I really stayed here was for the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) power up promotion (stay four times at a SPG property, get 2,000 bonus points).When you get your hotel bill under the door, the template by default states ""If you had a SPG account number on file, you would've earned X points."" I went to the front desk the next morning to clarify, and they assured my number was on file. They were correct, as the points showed in my account later in the week, but just know that this is an idiosyncrasy. I think the worst part (besides the non-draining bathtub) was that I talked to a lady named Heidi in person from reservations on Monday morning. I explained I have a room block at the Holiday Inn nearby in September and was wondering if the Sheraton would be willing to match. I gave her all the details - dates, number of rooms, purpose, etc. It's been nearly a week, and no one from the Sheraton has emailed. I guess they don't want the business!I just stayed here and had an excellent experience. The valet and desk staff were excellent - all smiles and very nice. My room was clean, modern in all respects, the bathroom was very nice, and the beds were amazing. Just about everywhere I stay, there always seems to be something that causes a headache of some sort - might be a small issue, might be a big issue - but my stay at this property was a wonderful experience with no issues or concerns at all. Thank you!it's ok.  I think the place is dusty.  I have to travel there for work a few times a month.  Gym is great.  New machines and water available.I work as a Women's competitive gymnastics coach in Ann Arbor. This year and last they held the USAG Region 5 Congress at the Hilton down the street. Usually we book a hotel room at the hilton since it is more convenient for the long days, where you just want to go up to your room...take a nap in-between sessions or change. This year we booked a little late so there weren't rooms available. So we booked at the Sheraton. Our boss forgot to book a room for Thursday night, luckily they had rooms available and the front desk was very accommodating. The valee parking is $23 per day with in and our privileges...which seems a little high. I understand you're a city but Chicago hotels sometimes don't charge a parking fee or it's less than $23...since I understand you have to rent the space. The hotel was very clean and had a good layout. The view was nice. The bathrooms were very spacious and clean. Only thing I disliked were the bed sizes...tiny. The free wifi is a plus, although you tend to get kicked on and off a lot. But I won't argue since you don't have to pay.Would definitely recommend to anyone if it is listed cheaper than the surrounding hotels.8/15 update.  I have screwed around on 4 calls with the hotel &amp; SPG because they shorted me several thousand points.  Calls to the hotel... Oh we'll fix that right now.  Calls to SPG... Oh we'll fix that right now.  3 months later no cooperation.  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  The hotel staff are nice.  Unfortunately, the food is terrible, the restaurant screws up most orders or its cold or dry &amp; generally ignores you.  I have only left one other restaurant l in my life.  I travel constantly, generally stay several weeks, eat at least a meal a day in a hotel's restaurants &amp; get room service 2-3 times per week. I suffered through 4 meals and never ate there again.  You ""reserve"" a microwave for your room, don't get it, then promised for 2 days they'll get you one &amp; then get told they don't have them.  I got a mini fridge that looked like it fell off a truck.  The rooms are terribly lit. I couldn't do work without having another lamp brought up.  The furniture is poorly thought out.  And, I came back to find they left the garbage 3 times.  You may be basically ok for an overnight.  But, there are 3 excellent hotels within 2 blocks.  I will never stay there by choice again.  I recommend you stay away from this hotel.Awesome location located a few miles from the Convention Center and Shore North.  Also, just behind the Columbus Commons so super convenient if there's an event or festival there.  I stayed here the week of the Food Truck Festival and loved it.  Beds are super comfortable and the room was clean.  Like most Sheraton properties, you won't find a microwave or a fridge.  Internet was $10 every 24 hours and parking is $23 per day.  I ended up parking on the street and feeding the meters as much as I could.  The city does ticket between 10pm and 8am and parking is free on Sundays.  Parking is a little inconvenient, but at least I didn't pay $46 bucks for parking for two days.If you also don't want to pay for internet, the Lobby floor has a few computers just outside Starbucks that provide free internet.Decent hotel in Columbus, probably the best you are going to find if you are SPG Platinum....Check in/check out - Very friendly, seem overstaffed which is great!!Rooms - can get pretty big, generally very clean, not much noiseGym - Gym is ok, not too much space but not too many users either. Weight equipment isn't the best but make up for it with cardio equipmentFree shuttle - Dave the free shuttle driver is great. Tip him and he will offer to come and pick you up as well as drop you offFood - Standard hotel food, nothing extravagant or awful. Just averageLocation - Not the best location but only a short cab ride from south high street where there are plenty of restaurants/nightlifeOther - Starbucks in the building is handyLounge - OK free food and sodasIt was okay. The room was larger than most hotels, semi updated, but not many amenities. There's no pool, small lobby, and subpar restaurant. The staff were very nice, and very friendly.Very good location many things to do within walking distance. very nice clean rooms and friendly staff.  One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.Newly renovated rooms, great beds. A truly 4 star hotel right in the center of downtown Columbus.Great experience so far... I'm here for five nights (possibly longer) and everyone has been extremely friendly. I have a standard king size bedroom &amp; it's large with a great view. The room service and valet are quick, prompt and polite. The walls are THIN though, there are a group of girls next door and I can hear them all night.","Decent room though no mini-fridge.  Lovely view of Columbus Commons.  Meters directly across the street from the front entrance are free on Sunday, which makes a Saturday night stay very convenient.If you need to find yourself or occupy a room without high incidentals, this is the place for you.Where to start... I'm not sure how long ago the hotel was under renovation, but there was about an inch of construction dust filth along the corners of the floor. That didn't just happen in one room, but two. The last room we were given actually had mascara on the sheets. And then there's the valet. not only did the attendant refuse to bring our car around, he managed to leave the valet station unattended long enough for us to retrieve our own keys - anyone cold have stolen any set of keys hanging there! When we came back the next day to discuss our experience the night before, the day attendant gave us the keys to someone else's car! The only shining star of this hotel was the staff, who did everything in their power to make the situation right. At the end of the night, we ended up at the Hyatt, where we usually go. (I guess you get what you pay for.)Friendly staff, helpful, tends to my needs when needed.Great location and very open ambiance. High ceiling, lots of choices to do work when you don't want to stay in your room. Either the bar, the restaurant, Starbucks on-site and their working area in the lobby. I love it when I stay here, feels like home away from home.Great lobby, superb location, nice staff. Room refurbishment not bad, but not hard to tell which hotel this used to be. The hotel star quality seems closer to a 3-1/2 than a 4 on many levels. Housekeeping had trouble seeing ""do not disturb"" sign on door. Must have been new to them. Especially the third time they knocked. Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed as comfy as ever. :)Stayed at the Sheraton during the weekend of the Ohio State - Iowa football game. Great location for a hotel- about a 15 minute walk to the hip area of town, the short north. The rooms are ok and the hotel itself is a little tired.  The gym has fantastic views on the top floor and the staff is very helpful. We had a little bit of a problem with an adjoining room and some drunk fans getting in at 2 AM in the morning. It didn't affect me much but the next morning was the Columbus Marathon and if I was running that race I would be extremely upset by these loud, drunk people arriving in late and making all that noise in the middle of the night.  But that's a one-off situation and it didn't affect how I rated the hotel. The solid three stars is spot on.Nice rooms, great location in the middle of it all!Awful for business travelers as the Internet does not work. They've been ""fixing"" the Internet for months now but nothing has changed. Everyone from my project has switched hotels.Stayed here just one night on business.  Check in was a little slow and disorganized, but the staff was helpful.  Room service and restaurant options were terrible, but luckily there are plenty of restaurants nearby.  Bottom line is that this is a serviceable hotel for business travelers.  I would consider staying here if I take another trip to Columbus.perhaps this is a bootleg sheraton.as a frequent business traveller, i can say with vast hotel experience that this place is terrible!!!i am writing this review from a down stairs computer at 9:42pm waiting for my room to be cleaned. you see, house keeping closes ealy in the day and they missed my room. gettng them to clean it was like pulling teeth.here are things to consider: - room not very clean - additional charge for any use of internet for each device (ipad, computer, iphone, etc.)  - restaurant is horrific  - room service dismal and limitted - staff is scarce and housekeeping is very rude - television reception quite poor - do not rent movie! i rented a movie and it was broken, pixelated, unwatchable. hotel argued that they could not refund)  - laundry service excessively pricey - coffee shop closes at 2pm - ghastly snacks available in room with a shocking alarm sounding any time you attemp to enter. (explained to prevent shoplifting) - no breakfast  - no airport shuttle serviceall this for $250.00 a night!with nothing additional included.luckily there is a hyatt two block away.too bad they wont help carry your bags over there.They have really done amazing things with this hotel since the last time I stayed there!  The remodeled lobby, rooms and addition of a Starbucks is really convenient.  I stayed here for almost a week and never had any problems with anything.  The people really treated us well and accommodated all of our needs!  Thank you!Nice hotel. Great fitness center. No pool or hottub. And we were woken up by this horrendous jackhammer sound. Probably explains why we got such a good deal.Home away from Home!  Does not get any better than this.  Great location and only $8 cab ride to Short North.  Very worth it!Plus:  renovated room.  And it stops there.  Walls were paper thin so we heard every word of the people next door.  And we heard the people upstairs flush the toilet and take a shower.  Skip the valet parking for $23 per night and self park around the corner for a flat fee of $5 per night for a weekend night.Nice facility in a great location. Friendly staff, but a couple of areas of concern. 1) light switch came apart. Looks like it had happened before, but hasn't been properly repaired. Possible fire hazard.  2) Ordered Room Service that came promptly around 4 pm. Put finished plate in halfway by 4:45 pm. Still there at 9 am the next day. Expected better. 3) Daughter called the basket to request a cab. 30 minutes later, no cab. Apparently they forgot to call the cab company. Did the big things well, inconsistent with the little things.We hosted a New Year's Eve 2011/2012 wedding for our daughter &amp; son-in-law, here at the Sheraton Columbus at Capitol Square! it was simply fantastic! The staff was friendly, the service and food was tremedous. Executive Chef Jonathan Olson is from the Ritz Carlton in Boston and he and Chef Jason Baehr prepared a spectacular meal for our 320 guests. The meals were delivered on time, the food was delicious and served hot! The service led by Vernon Hill &amp; staff was tremendous. Our guests raved about the venue, the food, the rooms, the staff, the lighting, the food, bar &amp; restaurant service....all great. Our biggest treat was working with Chris Katsares, Director of Catering, David Houle II, Banquet Manager and the entire Sheraton 'A' Team!Sheraton: You made this Father of the Bride very happy &amp; proud...Welcome to Columbus, Sheraton...and Happy New Year!....Rocky F.Hotel has serious maintenance issues and housekeeping flaws - mold, peeling wallpaper, mouse-sized dust bunnies in vents, rotten food left in fridge from previous occupant. I had to change rooms twice just to deal with the major disgusting issues. Still no reply phone call from hotel's GM after 7 days, and multiple conversations with the manager on duty. I have canceled all business reservations previously booked there through end of year and have cautioned business colleagues to find other options. I would recommend selecting other hotels in the area.Decent prices to be had via Priceline (paid $108 for a Saturday night, taxes and fees included). Not sure this place lives up to being a 4 star hotel, as designated by Priceline. Check in was a breeze and they fulfilled our request for a King sized bed instead of the 2 doubles we were assigned. Had a sorta decent view on the 11th floor overlooking the Commons. Room was big and pretty nice. Bed was super comfy. Not sure what was up with the RED stains on the lamp shade. Would it kill them to spend $5 for a new one? Tons and tons of windows -  the entire wall in the room and bathroom were windows. That was kinda cool except it being 15-20 degrees outside that weekend and jippy insulation. While our room was able to stay warm, the bathroom was absolutely frigid. The heat never had a chance to make it back there. In the bathroom there was an old heater switch but obviously didn't work because it was in the ON position but continued to stay under 50 degrees  in the bathroom. I never showered because that's how cold it was. Coupled with chilly tile floors, you better make a quick pee trip. Decent counter space, good sized mirror but it wasn't cleaned from the previous visitor (face wash/toothpaste splatter residue). Also the iron and ironing board were not safe - the iron kept falling on the floor?? No problem getting a cab - just call Blue Cab. They're very reliable and prompt (as long as you can get through on the line). Parking is $23 which is kinda an insane price for Columbus. Valet took forever to bring out car the next morning but that might of had to do with everyone checking out at roughly the same time. I can't say I've stayed in many 4 star hotels, but this doesn't seem to live up to 4 star expectations. OH did I mention housekeeping opening our door at 9am well before the 11am checkout? Yeah. Thankfully we had the interior locked so the door only opened it an inch or so. Don't they check to verify who has checked out before entering to clean?If you need to just stay somewhere quick for the night or are a business traveler not looking to have much of a social life, then this property is for you. I guess you could have a decent time if you never leave the hotel, but my husband and I are all about getting local and there was absolutely nothing to do around the hotel because all of downtown pretty much shuts down at 5pm. Definitly not the fault of the hotel, but you would think they'd try to make a relationship with the downtown businesses and convention center to keep their guests happy. I never saw a single taxi and we walked about 4 blocks away for dinner. We wanted to find a liquor store within walking distance, but CVS was closed. The front desk person said nothing was within walking distance. The next morning when we left, we drove right past one that was in perfect walking distance and was open long hours. Ridiculous! Comfy beds, good lounge bar, and nice shower, just a let down as far as local culture and things to do nearby. I recommend looking for an advanced purchase price to get you a good deal. If you crash here after a concert at Nationwide arena, then that's a good set up.This could be the worst Sheraton I have ever stayed in, but it was not my choice.  My work put me there.   I don't know if it was the lack of a recent vacuum job, the dirty bathroom counter, or the empty beer cans and water bottles in and under the cabinets.   Perhaps the thermostat being unable to find a temperature to stick with that did me in, or maybe the lack of attention to the sign hung on the door to skip the housekeeping that should have gotten me a free coffee or 500 SPG points toward a free stay.  The 10th floor room felt like it was older than me, and had a strange smell I could not identify.  Being that downtown Columbus basically closes for the evening, I took a chance on room service for dinner.  That was a little better, but I felt the need to wash the desktop before I ate.  I cannot recall a stay at a Sheraton or SPG hotel that made me feel like I was ready to check out before the first night finished.  Can't recommend this place.  A half marathon was going on in Columbus the day after I arrived, and the place was apparently sold out.  At least the hotel is located within 20 minutes from the airport.My boyfriend and I were in town from San Francisco in January visiting his family. Our room was very clean and nice, however, the best part about our stay was Glenda at the front desk! She was very helpful and treated us very nicely. She was wonderful and it was a pleasure to have her as the representative and front woman of the hotel. Thank you Glenda for being so pleasant! We were so tired and stressed from our trip and you were such a breath of fresh air!","Overrated.., nice staff but rooms that don't work and the hotel doesn't care. No mini fridges. We rented one and were told they were ""out""...power was out to phone and tv and now toilet doesn't work...third world...at best.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-columbus-columbus,Hyatt Regency Columbus,3.5,$$$,94,"Quick notes for the Hyatt Regency Columbus:1st stay was for an IT business competition back in vocay school. I fell in love with my current husband here and it was great. One thing the elevators were slow. The rest was nice. :)2nd stay was for Ohayocon and the elevator speed has improved, still slow, but way better. The rooms are nicer now as well has having pretty good wifi. They use Ruckus and Cisco. One thing though on the free tier remote desktops weren't working well. The rooms are very nice though and the beds were comfy. Great place to crash after the con :)  No real complaints about the rooms other than the lack of a fan/vent in the bathroom for BG noise and to let the smells out. The lobby was nice, and the staff were great. Too bad they had a leak though :( hope the place is ok!. The guy at the front desk was very nice and even covered our valet charge which was super cool and nice! They also ran the con stuff quite well and it was an awesome fluffy, fun time we had at Ohayocon and I miss it allready!Visited hotel to watch my Portland Timbers beat the Columbus Crew in the MLS CUP. Good: Great location with easy check in and great diamond breakfast. Bad: Older hotel and very stuffy. Ordered room service and never showed up. Hotel comped us lunch the next day to make up for it.Stayed December 2015Beautiful hotel. Rooms are clean and updated.Staff very friendly and helpful.Very close to all kinds of entertainment in the area. From restaurants to sporting events.Great place for a getaway.Stayed here with my mom for the Hot Chocolate 15K last weekend. Nice place to stay, but difficult to park in.We arrived about 2:30 pm and you pull into the turn around from the street, but it gets backed up easily since there's not a whole lot of space. There's a parking garage off chestnut street that does validated parking, $18 for self park, $20 something for valet parking. You can have your bags taken in and park or park and take them in yourself. Check in was fairly quick and painless and we headed up to our room. You could choose higher or lower floor, whichever your preference was. Restaurants on one the second floor or connected to the hotel. Easy access to the convention center. Close to the arena district (walking distance)Rooms were a good size, plenty of space. They have fridges in them for any left over food. Bathrooms were decent sizes as well. Clean and well kept.Check out was a breeze, you could do it on the internet or your phone if you didn't want to wait downstairsNo complaints.  I was here for work, where we held our small annual conference (~600 people).  It rained heavily for a few days while we were there, and the windowed ceiling near the convention center, by the small coffee shop would leak when it was very strong.  That wasn't a big issue, but many of our attendees complained about the dampness and mildewy smells in some of the meeting rooms and I noticed it in that area by the coffee shop.  I realize it's not something that can be easily or quickly corrected, but I hope management plans to redo that area soon.The room and amenities are nice. You just can't sleep in this hotel. The walls must be made of paper mache. You can hear EVERYTHING in the room next to you. Wonderful when the idiots next to you are making noise late at night. And then again in the morning.The Hyatt is a great place to host events. I have been to so many happy events here from weddings to organizational events. The only thing that throws me off each time is why the bathrooms are located on different levels and not the level you have the event at. I always have had events on the third floor because of the convenience of that space. For instance, today's event the Purple Teen Party was on the third floor but you would have not known that if the hotel did not put signs out directing you there. Actually I didn't get a sign I had a person directing me to that floor. Parking can be rather pricey but if you are staying here it's well worth it. I got a discounted rate today for my event to park at the East lot from the Hyatt for only $4, which is a killer rate if you ask me. Normally the price is around $10 or more. I'm not sure if the staff at the hotel made the treats we ate today at the hotel but they were phenomenal! We had mini key lime pies, lemon bars, cookies, bagels, cream cheese, coffee and juice. We had an incident here today where somebody accidentally pulled the fire alarm at the hotel so we weren't sure if we have to evacuate the hotel. Thankfully the Columbus Police were also there so they said it's okay that we just stay inside until the alarm turns off. Usually you would have to evacuate the building until there is an all clear to go back in. Since I live in Columbus I have no need to ever stay here but I would imagine it to be a very nice hotel room if you were booking a room. I would think you would also get a great view of the city if you slept here. Also you have 89 Fish and Grill across the street which I heard is awesome and can't wait to try someday! My only suggestion for the hotel in the future is to please utilize that first floor to instruct people who are lost where to go. As in maybe putting signs for events occurring there for the day, it would be very helpful so that I don't have to wait half an hour and be late to my event. Thanks and I hope everyone else enjoys their stay at this hotel as well.I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for several nights over Columbus Pride Weekend and really enjoyed it (despite the lobby's poor selection of late-night delivery menu options). I really liked staying here and my room was pretty swank. It was actually, literally, no-joke, bigger than my entire apartment back home, so that was nice. The showers got super hot, the sink had plenty of room to spread out my massive amounts of shiz, and there's even a vanity area outside the bathroom in case you do have someone else there who also needs to get ready. It was just me on this stay but I still used both areas, just because I could. The sleeping/living/work area was really nice too. There was a nice big desk, a chaise lounge, stylish lamps, a great big bed with super comfy pillows, a big dresser with a huge flat screen (They had HBO, but otherwise it was just super lame channels. Like 10 sports channels - no joke.), and the one wall was a huge panoramic window looking out to Columbus' skyline, which was super nice, and if you're not a fan of the skyline you could just close the blackout curtains and the room was no less comfy. The negs here (below) are few and far between, and really very minor in the long run. - The hallway smelled like smoking despite being on a supposedly non-smoking. My room, however, smelled fine, so you don't have to smell the stink for too long.-  The 4 elevators they have for the whole hotel are kind of a joke. On a busy weekend like the one I'd stayed here on, the elevator situation will leave you waiting for what seems like an eternity... and walking up and down from the 7th floor just wasn't in the cards for this lazy lass. - TV channels, as mentioned earlier, were kind of lame.- They had complimentary wifi on my visit for the special weekend, but otherwise I think they make you pay, which is total BS, IMO, when you're paying $200 a night for a hotel. Major props to Wil at the front desk who helped me check in and direct me to various exits and entrances since this hotel is connected to the convention center and not quite intuitive with several escape routs on various levels. He was mega friendly and helpful and really stood out as far as his dedication to customer service. He honestly made me feel like I was staying at the Ritz.This hotel has nice beds and a wonderful view of the city, but don't lose your receipt if you are on business the hotel will not give you another one. After talking to several people I found this to be disheartening that there was ""Nothing they can do to email me another receipt"".I also found there to be mold in the bathroom, carpets not vacuumed well and my TV blacked out and I had to keep shutting it off, neither did the IHOME/IPOD/Clockradio work. The room was too hot for my liking even when the ""air-conditioned"" room temp was set on 60 degrees, you can only put the fan on, No actual air.  Overall, if you can overlook these minor details. It is a convenient location to the arena district and the North Market all within walking distance. parking seems to be far away but with the skywalk, its just a few minute walk.Rooms are really nice and comfortable! I stayed here for a conference and it was nice that the hotel is attached to the conference center. The pool was the saddest I've ever seen, but I would guess that most people staying here don't really have time to visit the pool. As I said though, the rooms were really comfortable, especially the beds! I didn't have any issues checking in and out, and would certainly love to come back here be it for a conference or otherwise.Check in was super efficient and my room was an extra-large city view king, which I loved. Great home base for my stay in CMH which was for a wedding.For some reason, they didn't deliver a New York Times, as promised, but the WSJ, which I like quite a lot less. No big deal on a short stay, of course. The rooms were well-appointed, although they forgot to stock soap, shampoo, and a bathmat, which I discovered the first night when I stepped into the shower. That was fixed posthaste, and the evening turndown service was excellent, with chocolates and bottles of water. The in-room coffee was delicious Starbucks dark roast and I enjoyed two cups every morning. For diamonds, they give up upgraded wifi, which was lovely. All Hyatts should do this as I definitely noticed the difference in speed. No Regency club, but great breakfasts at the restaurant.The pool area needs a lot of help; I would definitely NOT get in the water as it is disgusting. And the workout area is quite small, but well stocked. It'd be good for the hotel to spend a little money on upgrades there, frankly.Very well located in the heart of the downtown area.All in all, a good city-center Hyatt Regency, but there are better ones, too. That said, I'd stay there again when in CMH.I've stayed here twice now (For Origins 2014 and 2015) and both times have been a fan. The staff is incredibly helpful, and the hotel is clean and shiny. The rooms are very good - however I will say that the double-room beds are not *nearly* as comfortable as the King size beds. They are just ""okay"" and not amazing.Great central location. Within half mile of most of Columbus' downtown attractions including Nationwide Arena, North Market and Short North district. I had no safety concerns walking around during the evening. I booked through Hotwire for a rate of about $90 per night. I was mostly satisfied with my stay.The room was well maintained and furnishings were up to date. The lady at the desk was nice enough to ask us if we had a floor preference. She put us on the 17th floor which had a nice view of the downtown skyline.Overall, not a bad option if you want to explore downtown Columbus and the Short North district. Despite having a dated appearance on the outside and in the lobby, the rooms are actually pretty nice. I had no issues with noise. If anything it was almost too quiet!Parking is a bit of a nuisance. If you choose to valet your car, it's $25 for unlimited in and out access. If you want to park yourself, there are multiple lots available within 5-10 minutes walk that cost up to $20 per day. Valet may be the easier choice. Another downer is that you have to pay for internet access.Great customer service,  beautiful and clean room.  Front desk person made an honest mistake and wrote the wrong room number on my access card.  I had to go back down to the lobby to get it fixed.  I wasn't upset,  told her it was no problem.  Found 6 chocolate 'buckeyes' (dessert) and a hand written apology note in my room an hour later.  Wow.  So nice!Great location just a half block from all the Arena venues.  Spacious lobby.  Quick check in.Rooms are furnished well.  I like the chaise lounge instead of the typical chair or sofa.  Big windows in the room let please type of light in.  Big King bed that was  very comfortable. Only 'complaint' was my rooms heating &amp; cooling. Waaay too loud and even the slightest variation on temp was overkill. Either too hot of too cold.  Probably just the room I was in, so not a big deal.Nice place and will be back.This is a review only for the bar and restaurant. At the Hyatt I want a bar area that doesn't remind me of a high school cafeteria. The dining area also didn't seem very inviting.My colleagues and I explored the in-hotel beer drinking and dining options, decided we could do better, and on both days we were there headed to Wolf's Ridge Brewing (about a 5 minute walk away and a very nice place to hang out).I really enjoyed my three night stay here.  Room 833 has to be one of the coolest rooms I have ever stayed in.  Loved the layout and all the windows.  Check in was easy, staff was friendly.  Was brought up free razor and q-tips very quickly when requested.The room service was hit or miss.  First night I ordered a steak very late - almost midnight and it was terrible.  The worst steak or potatoes I have ever had.  Second night I just ordered water and beer and got food from the convention center food court.  Third night I tried room service again - a burger with blue cheese and avocado and it was delicious.  This was more at 6 pm so perhaps the time made a difference?Only bad parts about hotel was the elevators were sosososososo slow!  I had to wait 10 minutes each time I wanted to go up or down - which was often with the conference I was attending.  Also, $10 per day for internet.  Not sure I was actually ever charged though even though I had to approve the charge on my laptop when I signed in...This hotel is clean, rooms are big and the starbucks coffee in your room in the morning is a huge plus. However, they don't have a 24-hr accessible front desk extension or mini mart for basics - water, snacks, etc. this is a huge fail in my book. The general store in the lobby isn't open late to grab things after you return from dinner. When I checked into my room a garbage can hadn't been emptied and there were some other signs that the room wasn't cleaned up and down, but I can live with that. I was more frustrated when I drank my in room tea night one and it wasn't replaced, even though I left the wrappers out to show it was used. The real kicker for me was that the bed uncomfy. This usually isn't an issue at hotels with this kind of ""nicer"" business feel. I just can't get comfortable and it's too bad.I have stayed here every time I have visited Columbus. It's location is ideal. Connected to the Convention Center and close to the Arena District and the Short North. I have always found the staff incredibly professional and accommodating. This weekend in particular there was a rock concert, breast cancer walk, 3 conventions and 8 weddings all going on at once and the level of service we received was unchanged. The room was clean and set up very nicely. And we really enjoyed our stay.Tremendously disappointed with this hotel.  Room was not worth the price. Wall paper was peeling. The breakfast bar was an equal let down. Definitely not worth the price.","Great look and the room is nice. Very close to everything. Nice customer service. Doormen weren't very friendly or professional looking. Would stay again.We stayed here for a conference at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.  The location was extremely convenient, especially to the convention center.  It is a 2 minutes walk, all indoors! The room was very clean, the workout facilities was nice (and included free-weights), and the hotel bar was very cool.The staff and service was great!The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't come with free Wifi.  It seems like a hotel in this price range should include complementary internet service.The overall hotel was modern and elegant. Great location, easy access to most of the Columbus hot spots. The rooms were big, with large picture windows providing wonderful views of the area.We had brunch with the family at the in-hotel restaurant, Marketplace Cafe. The buffet had plenty of choices - standard cereals, fruits, but also had a made-to-order omelet bar. I would go with the buffet every time, the service is too slow otherwise.I do have to discount the review for paid Wifi - for the overall cost of the room you would think such small incidentals would be included.My boss sent me here during the week of December 15-19 for business and found the place to be very comfortable.  I've looked at pictures at the room on their website and my room didn't look anything like those.  My room was dark, meaning dark grey wallpaper on the walls, with a dark deco in the entire room.  I didn't have a great view (room #617) but I really didn't care about the view.  I'm guessing this was a room that hasn't been upgraded but it's still the ""Hyatt Regency.""The very first day, I had a salad on the 2nd level restaurant which was really good and drinks at the bar later on that evening.  Some of the  things  I didn't like about this stay is they charge you for parking your vehicle at the hotel.  $16 a day at the Chestnut parking garage or you can valet park for $25 a day. Plus they charge you for using the internet, which I refused to do.  There wasn't much to do in the area after hours and the place was practically a ghost town.  I was told it was because of the time I was visiting Columbus.  Every time I got on the elevator, I was alone,....a true ghost town during that week.Other than that, it's a nice place to stay.My dad is a gamer (war games, role playing games, etc.) It's not my cup of tea, but the bright side is that when he travels for conventions I travel along and get my own mini vacation. Every year we stay at the Hyatt for the Origins convention. For the longest time the Hyatt has been the quintessential hotel for conventions, being conveniently connected the Columbus Convention Center. Our room was on the 17th floor this year, and it didn't face the Arena District. Not a big deal for us, considering my father spends the majority of his time at the convention and I at Easton and North High. However, if you're hankering for a view to wake up to, request an Arena District room. I believe if you're into that sort of thing it's worth the extra $10-15. The room was comfy as always; this year, the shower had an issue draining and it made funny noises. It didn't bother me enough to tell someone, and that's my fault. It's a plumbing issue I'm sure they'll get right on. The amenities seem fantastic; there's a pool, fitness center, bar and sun deck. I say seem because it doesn't live up to the hype of a Hyatt Regency. The pool had absolutely nowhere to put your belongings, and it seemed poorly kept. (I'm not one to go to Columbus to swim anyway, but I travel a lot and it wasn't very comforting.) The fitness center sufficed for regular business travelers, but if you have the time I recommend running around downtown Columbus. It's a lot safer than other downtown areas and the weather while I was there was PERFECT for running. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHyattathome.com&amp;s=a8ce8fe8daa669c5e390ee5b4a09143aacedc54322b29c69a1431b572fd65183"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hyattathome.com</a> offers reasonably priced workout wear if for some reason you forgot your compression shorts or shirts. The sun deck was blah. It's on the bottom floor, which defeats the purpose of a sun deck, and was a drag. It was decently well kept, but the sun didn't hit it very well and people walking in and out of the hotel can see you attempting to enjoy the sun. It's an awkwardly placed ""sun deck"".The food and beverage is nothing to write home about. The coffee shop advertises fresh baked goods but let's be honest...no. The bar was overran by gamers (which scares me), but if I were to enjoy the bar, 3.75 Pabst Blue Ribbon isn't how I would do it. With the plethora of bars and restaurants down the street, there's no reason you should prefer to stay within the hotels for drinks or food.Which brings me to why this hotel is awesome: location. It's one block from Nationwide Arena (for when I come for Blue Jackets games), two blocks from the North Market (where I eat lunch EVERYDAY YAAAS!) and considering it's right in the middle of the hubbub on N High, you can go either direction and find many activities. Also, with it being connected to the convention center, you can explore for daaaaayyyysss. I like exploring, sue me. The food court is connected to the Hyatt and it's open late. My nights consisted of getting velvet ice cream and sitting in lobby watching World Cup soccer on the projection they had on for the first and second floors. Yes.The convenience of getting to your room has never been a selling point here. It's gotten so bad that they've opened up the freight elevators at night. Also, the escalator connecting the first and second floor is down for 6+ months. Not a big deal to me because I enjoy walking and the construction created the most adorable area in the lobby for me to do work, but for convenience, it's horrific. The convenience of checking and out is where I am totally different from my other Yelpers. Hyatt has made it very easy to check in and out; you can do it with the kiosks in lobby, on your TV, or through your email! If you take the time to look, you can check in and out in 5 minutes flat.Parking is okay. It's 16 a night if you want in/out privileges, 12 if you just don't care. I can't walk to Polaris, Easton or the nearest Canes, so 16 a night it is. The walk to the hotel from the garage is a long one, but it's only excruciatingly long if you're lazy. If I'd have any advice for the Hyatt, it'd be to be careful. Obviously you're going to have competition. You're smack in the middle of downtown. We almost stayed at the Crowne Plaza until I convinced otherwise, but upon exploration I found the Crowne to have activities and amenities I'd much prefer (bonfire at night in their patio? YES!). I've also stayed at the Hampton for business and I was ridiculously happy there. I typically stay at Hilton owned hotels for business but staying at the Hyatt is a tradition for my dad and me. I love the Hyatt, don't get me wrong. It's comfortable and the staff is friendly (and attractive. Can I say that? Too late I did. They have good looking bell hops and valet people.) However, with the expectations constantly rising, I want to be wowed. I'll be up again for leisure in October, and I don't know if I'll stay here or at another hotel across the street. I can't whole heartedledly recommend the Hyatt until they change their formula.Good location near downtown, Arena District and Short North. Speedy check in and check out electronically. Valet parking was solid. Room was nice but the bathroom in our room was a little cramped. But it was a good stay.This review is for the conference rooms. I've been to a few conferences and receptions here at the Hyatt and I think the facilities are good. White table cloth rooms, good service, etc. My really only complaint is that the catering food is not that great.We stayed here after visiting Columbus winter beerfest. This turned out to be a great decision. When we checked in the desk clerk gave us a ""great room on a high floor"". And he did. We were on the 15th floor and faced west so we had this amazing view of the Arena district and downtown. Overall, the room was very comfortable. The bathroom is well-appointed and nicely decorated. The bed was pretty comfy, although, ours had a dip in the middle. I did not like the pillows, I probably would have slept better without any pillow. We also ate dinner at the Cafe on the 2nd floor. It was pretty good, a bit pricey but it was good. After beerfest, we had a post-game pint at the Big Bar on 2. The bartenders were fabulous; super friendly and they knew their stuff... we spent much of the night talking beer and drunk watching. It was a hoot. We'll definitely stay here again for the next beerfest.I stayed at a Hyatt for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how great both the location and the hotel itself was. The room and view from the room was quite nice. we were in room 746 overlooking the arena district. The one thing I didn't like about the room were the pillows, they weren't quite fluffy and it seemed like every pillow had a different feel then the other, which actually turned out to be a good thing because I was able to find one pillow I liked. The beds were comfortable and we were very rested afterwards. I would definitely try to book a Hyatt on my other trips, and this location in particular is a treat!Stayed here in February for a conference.  Love that it is connected to the convention center.  The room was good size and clean, a little on the dark side.  The omelette in the hotel restaurant were fabulous.  The staff was kind and accommodating.  I would strongly recommend the online check in/out as the line to do so was a long one.  The only down side were the elevators.  They were very slow and often too full by the time they reached you and you had to wait for another one.  I walked the stairs a few times but that was exhausting when you are farther than the 6th floor!Nice hotel. Quick check-in...did online check-in so getting my key was fast since I already knew my room number.  Lobby was clean. Elevators were relatively quick each time I used them. Room was updated and clean. Bathroom was small compared to rest of room, but not terrible. Low ceilings.Signage to get from parking garage (Chestnut Garage) wasn't clear at first but I figured it out. Sky way must not have air conditioning or ventilation is poor cause it was hot, muggy, and air smelled ""stale"". Cost for daily parking is a bit expensive, but not awful.In not sure what the regular room rate is as I'm here for work with a conference rate. But my rate is very reasonable. Can walk to many different restaurants. Very convenient that the hotel is contacted to conference center.This was our second vacation here and it's now safe to say I will never stay at another hotel in Columbus!!! The rooms are clean with beautiful views, all of the employees are extremely friendly,there is sit down restaurant, Starbucks, Einstein's, and a food court. They also have a gift shop that has anything you might need and even an Ohio state buckeyes team shop!!! I would really like to focus on the bar on level 2 some of the best times we've had on both our visits have been at this bar! The bartenders are all friendly, funny, and fast! Do yourself a favor and stay at this hotel and do not skip the bar!!!I was here for a conference and expo for work. I had a Panoramic King Room on the 19th floor and the view was wonderful. All of the staff was very helpful and nice. The hotel was very clean. Conveniently located within walking distance to the Arena District and Short North. I will definitely stay here again.Overall, the best qualities of the hotel are the staff (Wil at the front desk is fantastic.) and the ease of getting to and from the conference center... those two things brought it up from a 2 star review. My room was sad... contemporary and gorgeous in style but the cleanliness was shoddy at best.  Dusty vents, leaking window, peeling and discolored wallpaper, and chewed gum on the table edge (got to find that while fumbling around for the lightswitch). But the view? Amazing.  Also, parking not being included, and charging for wifi let's me know how much they value their customers... I stayed two nights and paid nearly $50 in parking (and never even left.) That said... would I stay there again? Probably, because it's so darn convenient... and truly that and the staff are the only reason they are successful. I wanted to love it, and it appeals to my laziness during the hecticness of conferences, but I ended up leaving a day early. Price just couldn't justify the mediocre experience.Great hotel - friendly staff.  Very conveniently located near the convention center.  We were able to upgrade to a Jr. Suite, which I highly recommend.  The added space (which is generous) really makes a difference, especially since we were there 10 days!Love the Hyatt Regency Hotels - would definitely stay there again.I love the city of Columbus and we generally gave to stay at the Hyatt when we are in town. The hotel staff is above average. At check in we were treated very well. They offer front door Valet parking for a daily fee. The rate isn't too bad.The hotel could use a makeover. It's a little outdated. They keep it fairly clean but it's in need of renovations. The rooms are fairly decent in size but again they could be updated.Overall, I liked this location for a conference I attended. The food service was good, especially the breakfast. Some of the older wait servers were....interesting. At times not paying attention to what they were doing or the tables needs. The conference rooms were what you would expect. Staff was helpful in moving tables or assisting with technology.  The internet/WiFi was ok, just not the most reliable.  Rooms and furniture appeared to be new or recently purchased so they invested in keeping the conference services up to date. My issues was parking...maybe they offer this and my conference just did not buy in, but it would have been AWESOME if they would have a deal for conference participants to have discount parking. $16-$18 a day was rough when you are at a conference for 4 days.  Find parking for $10 a day means I would have had to walk a far distance after the conference (at night, maybe alone) to get to my car.New Years was the con of all cons. Thanks for the premium tickets that you didn't serve except at two bars.This is a pretty standard hotel, not bad rooms but the beds are a little too firm and just enough light and noise enter the room to ensure a not completely restful sleep. There is a pool and fitness area, the fitness area seems well appointed but the pool... the brick wall, exposed pipes which skirt the ceiling and stark fluorescent lighting give the pool something of a municipal quality- as if you are using the world's nicest prison pool. One area of excellence is the staff of the hotel; they are very friendly, accommodating and quick with a kind word or smile. Grace at reception was a particularly excellent brand ambassador.This review is for my check in experience.  I reserved a room with a king sized bed 3 months ago for a conference in November.  When I got to check in, the associate said that they do not have a king but a double twin room.  Grudgingly I accept and half way through the check in process another more veteran looking associate comes over and says ""oh you can't give her that room, I need it for the customer I was working on"".  Biting my urge to snare at the veteran associate for her rude interruption, I calmly ask the associate what rooms are left.  LONG STORY SHORT I ended up in a room with a pull out couch bed.  They kept on reiterating that it has a 5 in mattress foam pad, which by the way makes no difference.  I slept in a room with no comforters and couch cushions piled on one end of the bed.  To top it off, they wont even cover breakfast for my entire stay, I got one day comped out of the 4 night stay and they made a big deal out of this.  Still waiting on seeing if they have another room available.Talk about horrible customer service and crappy hotel stay!","We stayed here for a conference and overall I really enjoyed our stay. - Dog friendly - our corgi kinda goes with us everywhere, so a truly dog friendly hotel is always important to me. Their pet fee is paid once for your entire stay and it's very reasonable, which is nice (rather than a daily rate). Everyone from the front desk to the bellhops were so friendly to my dog. - Clean, Spacious rooms - we were on the top floor, 20, but the elevator rides were quick. The hallways aren't too long so no matter what you shouldn't need to walk a long way to your room. Rooms are quiet, and there are alot of amenities like a small fridge (no freezer), coffee &amp; tea maker, ipod dock/clock. - Prompt room service - we ordered breakfast; it arrived when they said it would and the quality of the food was good. - Dog walking areas - there's some grassy areas directly in front of the hotel and then across the street going towards the college campus. Everything is very clean - so be a good dog owner and clean up after your doggie too :). - Convenient walking distance to the convention center (connected within the hotel) and to restaurants nearby. It's college town though FYI, but there's a good mix of adults too. Would definitely stay here again.This hotel is located/connected to the Columbus Convention center.  Fleet Fleet Columbus held a MIT day before the marathon warm up run here.  We all met in the north lobby area to gather before we ran 3 miles that day.  The hotel has a small shop inside where you can pick up a bite to eat.great staff with wonderful service., clean rooms, i had a beautiful view with huge windows.i was suprised how small the pool was, no hot tub either . most come here for the other ammenities because its a conference center but the pool and fitness area are lacking when you consider a Hyatt.no continental breakfast ifvthats important to youseriously $10.00 a night for internet, what the heck is that about????The hotel was nice and the view was pretty. Definitely opt for the valet since it's a decent trek from the parking garage to the hotel (especially with suitcases). Overall, the experience was great and I will definitely be returning to the hotel if I ever come back to Columbus.Stayed there last night. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was nice. It was located in a nice area of downtown and though I didn't get a chance to really explore, it seemed like a pretty cool area to walk around.Room was clean. Bed is a little too firm for my taste. Bathroom clean. What really pisses me off is they charge for the Internet. $10 per day!  Who charges for Internet anymore?  You pay an ass load for a room, then the want to slam extras down your neck.I also tried eating breakfast at the resturant the next morning. The sign said wait to be seated. I waited for 10 minutes before giving up and going without. It's looking to me like customer service is not #1 here.Hyatt always comes through for me. This is a nice one like the others. The people are super nice and friendly. I went to my room and it smelled like a smoker was in there and they switched my room no problem. The wi if is awful slow and the tv is not High Def so lame the tv can do it but they send an analog signal to it super doh!!!  Other than wi fi and tv it's great. Step up Hyatt Columbus it's 2014 not 1999 give me fast wi if and HD.This Hyatt is pretty great.Work placed me in this hotel for a few days as I attended a conference on behalf of a client. Although I arrived late at night, the front desk staff was prompt and helpful at check in, and I was in my room in under 5 minutes. Truth be told, I am a germophobe and as soon as I check into a hotel my eyes dart around the room looking for any sign(s) of grubbiness. Fortunately, my room was clean, so I was able to relax.Throughout the rest of my stay, the staff remained friendly and my room was cleaned very well each day. The front desk has complimentary toiletries available - which worked out well for me as I forgot to bring deodorant. The front desk also has a free flight check in kiosk where you can check into your flight and print your boarding passes - and if the printer is acting up, the staff will print your boarding passes from one of the printers behind the desk. What's also great is that the hotel is connected to the convention center, so you don't need to step out into the elements if you're participating in any convention center activities.The only thing that bothered me about this hotel is that the walls seemed pretty thin. I could hear random conversations from other rooms at several points during my stay, but it wasn't that big of a deal as the noise was pretty muted.I'd definitely stay here again.Friendly service impeccable service awesome shower clean rooms I didn't like the faucets in the bathroom,  the spray get you all wet when you wash your hands. Green team for your recycling. Valet took exceptionally long and it's hard to put your makeup on any of the mirrors,  1 is too dark and the other you have to lean over the counter, too far for someone who is short.I would stay here again!Rating this hotel was difficult. I wanted to give it five stars, but there were just a few annoyances and one consistently subpar item I could not ignore.First, the room. By all means, request a corner king room!!! And make sure it's a *34, that's room 934, for example. There is a similar room on the other side of the hotel, but I am not sure of the room number. I saw into the adjacent corner king and I was reminded of a review I read on Yelp by someone that said their corner king was WAY too small. My guess is he was in a *33 room. Those rooms have four windows total. Mine, a *34, had six (this includes the bathroom). The room was huge, comfortable and top notch in every way... almost.Okay, now for the not so good stuff. I'll start with the towels. They didn't smell good. I mean, I know hotel towels are usually rough and I don't expect them to smell like flowers, but these towels (all of them) smelled slightly rank, like maybe they were washed without detergent. I'm certain that's not the case, but the bottom line was, ""Ewwwwww"". Towels should not smell nasty at a Hyatt.My second complaint is a result of the $9.95 a day charge for access to the internet. I have stayed in downtown San Francisco and received complimentary access to the internet. Here at the Hyatt, not only was it $9.95 per day, it appeared to be $9.95 per device. I can't verify because I stopped the connection process on my iPhone (after already connecting on my iPad) because it appeared the $9.95 charge would also come through for the second device. Driving in and leaving using valet parking was not exactly a challenge, but it did require a bit of patience. I imagine this is pretty status quo for downtown hotels. though I do recall staying in downtown Chicago where self parking was quite simple and convenient. I only interacted with the front desk and room service personnel. They were all very hospitable; I have no complaints.I'd love to come back and stay in a *34 room, but I don't want stinky towels, so I will probably find another place to stay.Big fan.Super nice place for the price ($60 Priceline Express Deal - it's almost always listed as the 4 Star Express Deal, or you can snag it that much in the name your own price most nights (or they may give you the Hilton across the street instead). Why pay full price?Very modern room, great view of downtown CMH as well. Some noise from the guests down the hall, but it is only hallway noise... Things are quiet from room to room.The three downfalls to this place are:1) Having to pay for internet.2) Parking. I get that it is downtown and limited parking, and that valet is nice (my opinion a hassle)... But I really am not a fan of the $18-$25 parking fee... But hey, it comes with the territory, and I get that. It's a 4 star hotel and they should offer this.3) The boarding pass computer/printer is terribly slow (at least on the Delta website). Seriously. Like took me 10-15 minutes to get my boarding pass slow.I would definitely stay here again.+Rooms were nice and clean. Pretty good view. Connected to Convention Center- Parking was a debacle, valet was a joke. Also, 4 elevators for 20 floors and 600 rooms? be ready to wait. Connected to Convention CenterThe location of the Hotel is prime. With in walking distance of the nationwide arena, among other hot spots. For the price I wasn't overly impressed however the view was nice, staff was friendly, and the room was too my liking for the most part. Biggest issue I had was that wifi cost $20 to use!This is based on their conference areas and their foodI came here for a conference over the weekend.  They work out good deals for parking which make it nice to have a conference here.  They have a lot of rooms to use which is nice and most of them can handle good amount of people.The food is Ehhh! at least their lunch food was so-so.  The Chicken was dry and lacked flavor.  I enjoyed the dessert and their breakfast.  They had oatmeal and yogurt options at Breakfast with plenty of fruit.  The coffee is decent and taste like a medium roast and brew.  They do have plenty of servers around but then they seem to disappear when you need them or take two waters off your table for another table even though more people are coming.They also don't have a bathroom close to the upstairs area.  I would like to see bathrooms in more convenient places.  Also this place is busy so your conference can get overrun by a lot of teenagers from other conferences.  It is in a nice location downtown.  Internet should be free because it cost over $10 a day.  Come on and let have some free wi-fi.I have stayed at this Hyatt several times.The location is good as it is located close to the arena district and the short north which I loveand connected to the convention center as well.I have stayed at this Hyatt several times for work and it is great. I will say if you don't like large hotels this isn't the place for you! It is attached to the convention center so the place is always packed and busy. It can get a little annoying  waiting awhile for an elevator but the corner rooms have a fantastic view and are incredibly spacious and everyone is so friendly. The ricotta pancakes for breakfast (room service) are pretty fantastic and if you are traveling by yourself eating at the bar is a great option. The bartenders are super friendly and the food is actually pretty good. They have a decent wine selection and I highly recommend the beer cheese soup.The valet system is not dialed in. Get judgmental looks when you don't call ahead for your car, but when you try to they don't answer if they are mildly busy.A nice Hyatt.  Hyatt's have the best soap, shampoo and conditioner, hands down.  I had a corner room on the 15th floor, and it was a bit like living in a fish bowl (wall to wall windows, even in the bathroom) but the room was clean and well laid-out.  I had cool views, and while the room struck me as odd at first, I actually quickly came to really like it.  Bed was comfy.  Staff were friendly and efficient at check-in and check-out.  The bar inside is crap if you like beer that isn't in the Coors to Budweiser range, so I never utilized it.  I would stay here again, and would stay at a Hyatt over a Hilton any day.This hotel is nice and clean they just need to work on their customer service skills and their vallet department is terrible, according to the hotel they sub this service out and claim no responsibility however they collect payment for this third party and refuse to explain this to guests unless there is a problem at which time they put there hands in the air and claim zero responsibility. Shame on you Hyatt regency. There are better hotels in downtown Columbus and I would recommend them over the Hyatt.I booked a night at this hotel for the annual Origins Gaming Convention this year. They gave us the convention rate which was under $200 for a king-sized bed room.Even before I stepped foot into the hotel, I was impressed by their communication. I had requested an early check-in and they had the room ready for me, letting me know via text message and email.Their staff was terribly friendly and efficient and I was up in my room on the 17th floor in no time. The view was good and the room was clean. A couple of small complaints though : their wi-fi was terribly slow and the room was a little small. In spite of that, I did have a very good experience staying at this hotel.","I thought I got an excellent value for a conference at a package rate of $132 a night.  The hotel is attached to the convention center.The good: the staff are friendly and helpful, the wireless was free for me by joining the Hyatt ""club"" loyalty program which is free (you don't have to get a credit card or anything).  There's a fitness center, bar, restaurant, and there are a lot of rooms with nice city views.On the bad side:The pool is terrible, unpleasant atmosphere and unless you have small children, it's so small and shallow I think it may be dangerous for most adults to swim in it. Also the rooms have a kind of limited selection of television stations.long over due remodel :)I stay here every year for a weekend conference.  They do an awesome job of turning over the hotel in a timely manner and the service desk is always friendly.The rooms have a great view of the arena district, flat screen TVs, and the most comfortable bed and pillow I have ever had in a hotel.They do have 40 minutes of free wi-fi in the lobby area, but charge for it in your room.There are a lot of restaurants in the surrounding area, a food court in the convention center, a coffee shop, and a bar. Things to improve on:elevator speedfree wi-fi in the roomsOk. Would expect more for the price. Much prefer Drury Inn across the street which is cheaper, offers identical rooms, free internet and free hot breakfast. They just happened to be booked this time around so I'm at the Hyatt. They are only riding on their name.Stayed here twice, first for a wedding and then for a business convention.  Overall I was pleased.  The rooms are comfortable and it's convenient to nearby attractions (the wedding was at the art museum which is a short cab ride away.)  The second time I stayed, the desk area wasn't entirely cleaned which was gross (hair and a bobby pin on the chair.)  I would consider staying here again depnding on where in the city I need to be.Not impressed for a Hyatt Regency. What has happened to this chain? The hotel seems to have gone through a recent renovation, but my room was dusty and the window covering was not sufficient. Seems like they stopped just short of finishing. It was a bit noisy as well, I could hear all the doors closing on my floor. Staff was friendly, but I think that they need a few more months of experience before this works out.I stayed here for two nights while in Columbus for work.Pros:-clean room-free wifi with Hyatt Gold-convenient valet for $23/night or parking garage across street for $12/night-noon checkoutCons:-new gym running equipment-gym towels not clean-small poolThe elevators are too few for the amount of floors. Otherwise, nice rooms and good location.I stayed here with a couple of friends for an event that was being held close by. Valet was $24/night, unlimited in and out privileges or you could park in the garage and pay each time to get in and out. We opted for valet because we had a lot of stuff to carry in. Check in was a breeze and we went on to wait for the slowest elevators ever. They were definitely busy so I'm not sure if that was the cause or not. Our rooms were nice as they have recently remodeled the hotel. We had two double beds and I love when the rooms are updated enough to have an Ipod dock. I wish more hotels would get with that program! So, we are getting ready and listening to music and a knock on our door at 4pm with our neighbor asking us to turn our music down because he is trying to sleep. Ok, it is 4pm, and our music isn't that loud, but I did the courteous thing and turned it down. At 2:30/3am, we have to call security because of the domestic going on in the same room the guy came from earlier. Awesome. The walls must be pretty thin, folks, that is all I can say. We checked out the little breakfast cafe and the bagels and fruit were fresh and they brewed starbucks coffee as well.My first room was moldy. I guess I am more sensitive than others, but if the shower curtain has been left to rot for a month, it's not a good sign anyway. I went down and spoke to Nicky, who was amongst the very helpful staff there. She moved me to another room that was clean and in good shape. She was very apologetic and was eager to keep me a satisfied customer, which I now am.Nice rooms but pricey and distant from the night action,Last year when I stayed here I probably would have given this place a 2 for some issues with cleanliness and bar service. But this year I was better pleased. My room was clean and comfortable. Valet guys were very polite and helpful with things like the location of the nearest Starbucks. The restaurant had some issues with breakfast, but given the size of the convention I was attending, this isn't surprising. They've installed a computer at the end of the front desk where you can print out boarding passes for free. This is a HUGE improvement over paying $10 for computer access for three minutes to do the same.The good stuff- you get a nice, clean, safe, almost upscale hotel, right on High Street downtown for between 100 and 170 a night, depending on when you go and if you're there with a group. The staff tries to be friendly, most of the time. And there is a wonderful food court, convenience store, pool, refrigerators, microwaves, and everything else you'd want extra thrown into a hotel.Now here's the less fortunate part- the basics. Internet and parking. Internet is 10 dollars per day, and if you have 2 people who both brought laptops, forget it. That's 10 dollars per connected computer.Parking is sometimes comped if you're there with a group or convention that negotiated for it. If you're not so lucky, or happen to not be the only person who arrived by car staying in your room, be prepared to spend a rather ugly amount of money on parking. Or simply park on the street in nearby Italian Village and hoof it- though it's hardly what I'd call convenient.These are only two complaints- so why only 2 stars? Because this is downtown COLUMBUS. It's a small downtown, accessible from the outerbelt in 10 minutes or less on a good day. Within said outerbelt, are dozens of hotels that cost $40 per night, offer free wifi in their rooms, free and plentiful parking, and a free continental breakfast.Which leaves me asking: Knowing that, why do people stay here?Long story short, the Hyatt could still charge what they do and earn themselves 5 stars. They're much cleaner and more finely appointed than most hotels, and are perfect if you simply must be walking distance from the convention center or arena district. But even though they could offer those little things for free, they simply won't. They're just not willing to put in the extra effort where most other hotels are.A score on hotwire for $77 to stay in September 2011. 3.5* Downtown Columbus - Arena District - German Village area hotel, Amenities: Fitness Center, Pool, Restaurant, Business Center, High-Speed Internet Access, Golf Nearby.Meh. Not a fan of charging for internet access, parking, and no breakfast. Maybe I ask too much from a downtown hotel?Great experience at the Hyatt! Walking distance to the arena district which has tons of upscale restaurants and night life. Staff has been very accommodating and the room is modern and clean.Love the room sizes, spacious and luxurious. They even offer free HBO. Good food offering in the hotel and is very close to a ton of restuarants.I was here for 3 days.  They host conventions so its better to ask before booking.  My entire say was filled with church youth group kids running rampant all over the hotel.  The kids stole my do not disturb sign, so I had a housekeeper who did not speak english at my door early in the am knocking on my door.   All hotel security did was stand around downstairs.The hotel itself was clean and recently renovated.  I hope to never stay here again.It was clean and the staff was friendly. But, I was staying in a Holiday Inn last night costing about half as much, and that was clean and the staff was friendly too. In fact, the Holiday Inn had a (much) better shower.Then there's wifi. I get that this is an amenity and everything, but McDonalds offers WiFi as a given. There was a time where it made sense to charge extra for WiFi--when no one understood what on earth it was. But now everything is wireless and there's just no excuse for charge $14/night to use it. I did. And I found out that the $14/night charge is only good for the one  device you signed up on, not for the whole room.Anyway; I'd stay here for $100/night, too much at $150/night.****UPDATE**** Mike Keisel, Director of Rooms for the Hyatt Regency got in touch with me about these issues. He was very sweet, and apologized for the original error and the poor service I received from the accounting department. He says he has contacted the managers of all parties involved, to be sure that they are corrected for future reference. The have also offered me compensation I feel is appropriate and even generous for the issues I had to endure. I view this matter as closed, and I will re-consider my decision not to stay with the Hyatt at next years con.Modern and luxurious.  The room was done in a grey/blue motif with granite topped tables and furniture.  The bed was very comfortable.  My room view was looking over convention center roofs and the expressway, but still, being on the upper floors is amazing and I loved looking out at night on the city.  In the remodel apparently every room was equipped with a spacious refrigerator, and there is plenty of in-room storage.  I really relaxed deeply and enjoyed this stay.  I would recommend the Hyatt to others. Other positives:- Very friendly staff; were bright and guest-centered.- If you need food, many in-hotel options.- Great to sit in the Big Bar on 2 and people-watch.  Also ran into interesting people on the elevator and had good conversations.  This is the host hotel for many conventions and also for some sports events at Nationwide Arena (also just down the block.)- Large-screen television.- Awesome bathroom.  Their interior designer should be proud of what they accomplished.- Easy connection to the convention center.  Very easy to navigate compared with similar cities like Indianapolis.- You are right on High Street so it is easy to get to OSU, the Short North, Clintonville, German Village, or other destinations.- Price was on the mark for a major downtown hotel.- Good Verizon 3G connection; I relied on my iPhone tether instead of paying for hotel WiFi.- Awesome windows and view as mentioned, and the window coverings also block out light well so you can sleep in if you would like. Some points for improvement:- Expensive parking - $12 to $25 per day depending on the option you choose.- Parking on Chestnut for $18 with in/out privileges means you will have to take two elevator rides and one escalator ride, as well as walk a good 4 blocks of ramps to get to your car.  The ramps are unheated.  If leaving after 10pm, you must stop at the hotel desk to get a paycard.- If self-parking, you're not allowed to unload in front of the hotel; you have to unload from the parking garage.  The turning circle in front of the hotel is congested and small.- Food at the Big Bar was a little bland and pricey.- You have to walk through the pool area to get to the workout room; no one was using either one because it wasn't very nice.  The machines were new, but someone had gotten the floor wet (making it unsafe to jump on a treadmill), and the cardio equipment seemed to be built for very tall people.- You do get an in-room fridge, but you have to bother the restaurant staff on the 2nd floor to use a microwave.  I was directed to talk to the Big Bar staff or the Market breakfast staff for this, and that made it awkward.Rooms are ok, though in my 2 personal stays here, I have never received the room type I'd requested.I think the high point was the valet driver stealing my keys and then lying about it (when I had just identified my keys with ALL keys/keychains present prior to him grabbing my car).  No apology from him, the valet mgr or the hotel itself. I had to pay to get my apartment rekeyed, for a new mail key, etc.  Nice pool, but no hot-tub.","Stayed Feb 2013.  I've stayed at many high-end hotels in almost every big city in the US and was surprised that this Hyatt in Columbus was one of the best service experiences I've ever had.  Hats off to the staff that just made my stay feel fantastic.  I will certainly return.Did not stay here but ate at the breakfast buffet for a business function.  Many food options to choose from.  Connected to the convention center, so conveniently locatedWhen my husband and I were in Columbus over MLK weekend, we decided to stay in a hotel for two nights rather than impose on some friends. I used Priceline and ended up with the Hyatt Regency for $43/night for a Saturday and Sunday night stay. Sweet!The reservation was under my name, but I was running a bit late to meet my husband at the hotel to check-in and he got restless. They nicely allowed him to check-in and we got a room on the 17th floor. The room had a nice view of downtown and Nationwide Arena. Bed was comfy which is always a plus. All and all, a nice, simple room. We were barely in it but to sleep or change clothes, so simple was fine with us.Parking is available in either a nearby garage ($12 per day at the Chestnut Street garage behind the Crowne Plaza) or a meter (only really an option if you are staying over a weekend). There is also valet, but I am not sure on the cost. The valets are also very helpful in hailing a cab which is easy as there are many lined up on Nationwide Boulevard near the hotel. Easy access to 670 and 315 make this hotel in a great location if you need to get around Columbus. Plus there are tons of bars, restaurants, and shops around the Arena and in the Short North that a car isn't even required.I would definitely stay at the Hyatt on a future trip to Columbus. Nice hotel in a good central Columbus location.No free internet access, really expensive parking depending on the day and freezing conference rooms. Really disappointing in 2011 to not be able to access wi-fi and have to pay $9.95 a day.So I normally don't stay at Hyatt hotels because I am a staunch Marriott fan.  However, had to stay here due to a company event and they booked the rooms.  Wasn't happy at all about my room.  Right away, the moment I walked into the ""clean bathroom"" my shoes were sticking to the floor.  You could see the marks from my shoes in whatever they are using on this floor (or not using) and it was annoying to have a sticky floor.  When I opened the closet I found three (yes three!) hangers, and I'm here for a week.  Had to call for a few more hangers.  Then, when I took out the iron and the ironing board I found that the iron didn't work well, leaked water all over my clothes, and would not steam.  Had to call again, this time for a replacement iron.  Once I got the new iron going I noticed that they were too cheap to put a proper ironing pad under the ironing board cover.  So I would iron my black shirt and see a waffle pattern from the ironing board!  Unbelievable.  I had to use those stupid little strip blankets they put at the base of the bed to put underneath the ironing board cover to properly iron my clothes.  The lamp on the desk is a solid arch lamp, so you can't adjust it out of the way if you are using a laptop, so basically had to shove it to the side and get it out of the way.  Do they ever actually use the rooms before they do this stuff?  One good things is that they finally have enough plugs for all the electronic devices we have now days.  I also had dinner in the one restaurant in the lobby and it was hugely overpriced for what you get.  It's my first night here, so I will post updates as it goes.Some places are saved by service.  The hotel is, as the French would say, ""OK"", but the people that work there are really nice which made my stay go from bummer to OK.  I don't understand why they bothered to put big LCD TVs in the room then have a non-HD signal though?  That seems really dumb.I was torn between 2 and 3 stars for this hotel. For the annual event I was attending, it was by far the best location I'd stayed at, and despite warnings about the crush at the elevators near mealtimes, I never had much trouble getting up to my eighth-floor room. We were next to the elevators but the noise wasn't bothersome. I was surprised they couldn't switch us from a two-doubles room to a king at a gaming convention, but c'est la vie.Huge downsides: ridiculous charges for internet. The event we were in town for did have free wireless codes, but we arrived a day early and had already wasted $20 on a hotspot card because the advertised internet price was $10 per DAY. The business center, where I briefly considered doing some last-minute printing, was riDICulously priced. I realize many of the bread-and-butter clientele of this place are probably corporate types who are expensing everything, but for the casual traveler this is absurd, especially when there's a fantastic FedEx Office with free wireless within three blocks, and a UPS store in the basement.Also, the pool, which is in the basement, is the saddest thing I have ever seen. The transition between the posh lobby and the dingy, dated Days Inn-level pool/fitness area is jarring, and I hope they will update it eventually. Seriously, a $150/night hotel without a hot tub? The heck?There was also reduced-cost parking available with in-out privileges about a block away, which was convenient and allowed me to run some errands for friends; there are cheaper if slightly less convenient lots in the immediate area, but hey, it's a downtown area, I can stomach paying for parking.While I appreciated the convenience of this hotel, I am much more likely to stay at the Crowne Plaza or the Hampton next year. Free breakfast, comparable parking, better pool (in the latter), and cheaper wireless are worth the slightly longer walk to me.Ooooh boy, is this a nice hotel or what? I've been to better Hyatts but even living up the street from this hotel, there's usually a weekend each year (normally during Ohayocon) where I just stay at this Hyatt. Yeah, it's close. Yeah, it's kinda expensive. Yeah, it's an awesome experience.Sure, it's comfortable and clean and the check-in is a breeze. The real deal here is the breakfast buffet. Get in on that jam if you can. Dee. Lish. Us. Go for the sausage gravy and biscuits- the best I've ever had. Done.Roomy, beautiful, right downtown- this is the only hotel in Columbus I've stayed and and truly loved.Not much on the room service menu. Nothing to eat in hotel or surrounding area late at night.  Rooms are great though.Note to any business travelers thinking of staying with the Hyatt Regency Columbus- There are many other hotels (Hilton, Renaissance, Sheraton) in the immediate vicinity- stay there!  Upon check in, I was told that my king room was not available, but I would be upgraded to a female business class room with a robe and make up mirror :(  I have also found hotel security to be slim, at 4 am, I had to listen to a belligerent man yelling in the hall and bouncing from wall to wall.  This morning, while walking to the convention center via the hotel, I found a man sleeping in the hotel 2nd floor, not far from the restaurant and bar.  This evening, I ordered room service and as I began to eat, a man began knocking at my door.  He was from engineering and wanted to fix something with the HVAC that was impacting other floors.  I felt uncomfortable with the situation and thought that the hotel should have notified me in advance.  Upon calling the manager, he seemed to want to rush me off of the phone and thanked me for my concern and wanted to make sure that I felt better now.  This was handled in a completely dismissive manner and I am extremely dissatisfied with feeling patronized.  In summary, stay at the Hilton or Renaissance if you need to be in Columbus!Stayed here last year and it was the worst experience of my life with a hotel. Came down for a girls volleyball tournament and wound up in the bells city tattoo and piercing convention . I don't expect the staff to wave me off during my phone conversation booking a room but a little hint like "" are you coming for the tattoo and piercing convention at our hotel or the volleyball tournament at the convention center"" I think I could have figured it out from there or at lease it begs for a question or 2. Check in was long and the desks were understaffed, the elevators are small and full the entire weekend. Oh and the crack valet staff made up of foreign students that probably don't hold a drivers license wrecked my car 10 minutes after I gave them the keys but didn't bother to tell me until I checked out 2 days later. That was a 3 week $5500 event ordeal after i only wanted a weekend experience. Parking is off site and a friend attending an event the next weekend had a similar situation with the valet staff.  This year we stayed at the New Hilton across the street. What a difference from the ancient, run down, overpriced, dump called the Hyatt on the corner. I had a chance to walk over from the convention center and spend some time looking around, its still the same issues. Restraunt still looks like a 1950's Manners, misspelled menu's, ect.  Friends stayed there but came over to the Hilton next door to have some drinks and were upset they didn't stay.  Do yourself a favor and get to the shining spot of hotels in downtime Columbus the New Hilton will impress you at every turn.Who's the bigger cheapskate:  The traveler who is unwilling to pay 9.95 for crappy internet serviceORThe hotel that talks about customer service and then decides to jam customers for internet service.Thank god for being able to get a connection from the Crowne Plaza across the street who understand what customer service is about.Very disappointing, and I would strongly recommend looking into the Westin (nearby) instead.  We paid $180 on Hotwire, and got a clean, neat but utterly average room.  The location is fine, but the rooms are really blah, as is the mundane lobby.  (Seriously: just go walk into the Westin lobby and compare--that's what we got on Hotwire last year.)  Plus, no free Wifi--they're living in the stone age.  The CLARION has free wifi!  The TV was perpendicular to the bed, there was no art on a blank wall, and they forgot the guest-services book in our room.  Won't be coming back.I was here recently for a hockey game with a big travel group.  The hotel was nice, staff was very friendly and accommodating, and is very close to the arena.  The biggest complaint I have about the rooms is that the sheets were a little scratchy.  The staff went out of their way to provide gluten free foods that I could eat when everyone else was eating their morning bagels.  They were SO helpful and gracious!","['quick', 'notes', 'regency', '1st', 'business', 'competition', 'back', 'school', 'fell', 'love', 'current', 'husband', 'great', 'thing', 'elevators', 'slow',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-columbus-columbus,The Westin Columbus,3.0,$$$,122,"Beautiful hotel. Quick valet. (Although we would prefer to have our own parking; but it's not a big deal.)The rooms were quaint but sparse. No mini fridge? That's being a little too selective on amenities. Being that the rooms are tiny, the voices from the hallway are basically right in your ear.The bathroom was fantastic though! Everyone was polite.We booked on Hotwire and were assigned this hotel and we ended up happy with it, but we probably wouldn't purposely choose it again.Beautiful historic building, the lobby is truly beautiful. The rooms suck. Tiny - and I mean can-barely-skootch-around-the-bed itty bitty - musty, bright at night (the blinds cover only the middle of the window), thin walls, old loud plumbing that runs constantly. The bathroom is the highlight of the room, it's been updated (other than bad internal plumbing) and the shower is heavenly. The front desk staff are trained to check you in and nothing else. They really can't help you in any other way. They took two days to find a fax that other hotels usually have waiting for me. They were slow to get me help when the events staff failed me. They couldn't find boxes that I knew very well were there. Then they brought me an outgoing box, clearly marked. Ugh!The events staff truly stink. That is, if there is an events staff, I'm not really sure,  since I had to keep tracking people down for silly things like water service, a projector screen, and electricity. It took two hours for them to finally remove the dozen or so extra chairs lining the walls. No one checked on us, ever. I had to go back to the front desk several times to ask for more water.I also would not recommend the conference room because of the giant pole right in the middle of it.Parking is valet only and $25+ per day. There is a lot down the road, use it. Valet guys aren't that friendly and aren't quick to figure things out like needing a luggage cart or letting you know, as you wait forever, that they have come back with your car and parked it (running) around the corner where you can't see it. Fridge in room, no microwave. No free breakfast, overpriced cafe. Food OK, not exceptional or anything worth the price. All in all, a really expensive Meh. By the way, when the ballet is going, you can't get anywhere near the place.The lobby really is pretty.Definitely a historic building in its day which was renovated to some degree. Actually I would say the building itself has remained the same except the furniture which itself was very cute and trendy like the Westin or W brand. Booked this deal on hotwire, so the price was not too outrageous. We paid $24 for overnight valet (with in and out privileges). Service was definitely on par with what I would expect form a 4 star hotel. So friendly, helpful, take their time with you to tell you what's happening in the city, how to get there etc. We had change our first room because the air conditioner was too loud. The bed and pillows were ultra plush, slept like a baby. Hotel is also walkable to bus stations, restaurants, bars and a cool outdoor concert area. Had some extra time and went for a quick work out in the 24 hour gym area. There were maybe 10 treadmills and six ellipticals, vast array of weight and some exercise machines. They also give you complimentary headphones so you can sing eye of the tiger on your 99th mile on the treadmill. Sad there was no pool/jaccuzi. But, free starbucks coffee in the morning made me quickly forget that.Cordial front desk. The room is tiny but that is typical when you use Priceline bid. A wonderful view of a wall but again my Priceline bid was $75. Not going to complain.  Very comfortable bed, clean but small shower. This review is about 5 months old.Walls in the rooms are thin you can hear lots, hard to sleep peaceful unless u have a fan or TV left on. Bartenders at bar were not very friendly and we felt like we were a burden when we ordered a drink. Room service is extreamly over priced. A $4 charge for bottle water, should be complementary when u pay over $200 for a room.I had a great experience staying at this hotel last month. The staff at the reception desk were very friendly, and check in was easy. My room was average size and had a comfy king bed. The bathroom was nice and seemed like it had been renovated. I was having problems with the hair dryer in my room, so I called the concierge, and they brought me a new one within 10 minutes. Now that's good service!They have a small gym with a few treadmills, ellipticals, and weights. Towels and water bottles are provided in the gym which is so nice.Parking is valet. It was easy for check in, but when I was checking out, there was an event at the hotel, so I had to wait ~10 min for my car which was a little annoying.The hotel is in a great location, and if you want to explore downtown, you can hop on the CBUS, which is a free shuttle that runs on High St. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area.My stay at this hotel was great.  The check in staff was genuinely warm and friendly providing great information to add to my stay and make me feel welcome on my first trip to Columbus. The lobby is amazing. I was told there was free breakfast, but due to other plans, I didn't get to check it out, but would definitely look forward to that on another stay. I was surprisingly upgraded to a suite, which had a full living room area with a separate door to the bedroom area which I liked as it helped block more of the hallway noise.  Aesthetically, I felt the rooms could use some touches to make it softer and cozier.  The rooms had very high ceilings with plain square decor that made it feel a bit cold with the hard square room. For me, the space was way more room than I needed for my stay, and I didn't spend any time in the living room area.  I did enjoy the free bottled water!That said, the bed was amazingly comfortable and the shower had a Westin Heavenly Shower faucet that has two shower heads which was AMAZING.  I could have stayed in the shower forever.  So outside of the appearance of the room, it was actually a very comfortable stay. The room was also immaculately clean and in great shape. I was greeted at the door by staff politely as I was in and out of the hotel, and when it was time to head back to the airport, there was a cab ready to go.  I would very much stay here again!Just came back from a B-E-A-UTIFUL wedding, in which the reception was hosted at The Westin! The location and environment of this hotel was so elegant and classy. Everything has a grandeur look about it, especially the architecture of the historical building. The second floor layout is a little wonky though - someone can easily just walk through your event in order to get to their rooms. The food served was well prepared, and tasty enough considering they were serving 150+ plates!Overall, very impressed!COLUMBUS, OH: This is a lovely historic hotel that boasts nice architecture in the lobby and exterior.  The hallways to the rooms are wide and spacious and it has been renovated.The rooms are a bit small, unfortunately, with very plain furnishings and small bathrooms, unfortunately.  Also, there is absolutely no self-park option, valet only, which can be slow during a busy time.I have stayed at lots of Starwood properties over the years and while this historic building maybe one of the prettiest properties that I have visited it is definitely not the best. On the night of our arrival the air conditioning was not working and our tiny room was extremely warm. Maintenance attempted to open our window, but the latch was broken and it was unable to stay up. They did provide us with a small fan, but it didn't do much. The room was small and claustrophobic especially for the high price and the bathroom was one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen. The staff was helpful and courteous, the location was okay, but I probably wouldn't choose this hotel again if I had other options in the area.Excellent hotel, location and staff.  They are a bit less Westin or W staff then I am used too.  Very Donald Trump. My Golden Retriever -Jake strutted through the lobby like a star politician.  Glam. And they upgraded us to a monster large presidential suits.  Woohoo.Lock your items up! My husband, mother and I upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite for the weekend.  We stayed here for a concert at LC Pavilion Friday February 6th and Saturday night Feb 7th.  After the show, we returned to a hotel room that had been robbed. My Cash, and jewelry were taken, my mothers cash was taken, and my husbands favorite watch was stolen. I will never stay at this hotel again. I would look very closely at your valet or housekeeping. Those individuals that knew what we had in our room, and when we would be gone! The front desk was very helpful and refunded our stay, but that doesn't put my hard earned money back in my purse, or my husbands special watch back on his wrist. I feel disgusted and violated. I will never stay at this Westin or any others again!Love the location. Easy drive to anywhere downtown Columbus. The hotel has a lovely flair to it. Great dining and a few nice small stores located inside.Hotel History: The place was built in 1896 very historic - so the style of that time period is women wearing Hula hoop dresses that were really wide.With that in mind the hallways for your arrival to your room are very wide. Yet we as humans were slightly smaller so the rooms were smaller.The Westin apparently bought it and tried to take it over and make it their own. NICE TRY Westin this is the worst attempt I have seen by this company in any cityThis hotel is not a 4 star as advertised by many online companies. More like 3I agree with Adam S  his review is spot on!This hotels lobby is cool and the staff very friendly.The furniture in the room is ok at best, the rooms are very small, the carpet needs upgrading in and out of the rooms and hallways, the bathrooms are fairly cool.Not too shabby.  Great service and accommodations, especially for the price.   The valet staff was very kind and helpful, especially when I just needed to grab things out of the car.  The Barista was my favorite.  I spent a lot of money there.  The hotel has a licensed starbucks stand.  The hotel breakfast is pretty decent.  $15 for the buffet.  Go hungry!  The shower stopped pumping hot water.  It was fixed in 5min.  It's like they actually wanted me to write a good yelp review.Beautiful lobby and friendly staff, and that's where the charm of this hotel ends. Yes, the rooms are small, but I accept that given the historic nature of the building. I'm more concerned with the paper thin walls and uncomfortable beds which was surprising given the ""Heavenly Bed"" thing. Maybe I just got unlucky with an Earthly Bed. I can clearly hear my neighbor's TV along with the fact that someone just took a shower. Last night it was conversation (not loud mind you, just two people talking.) This is probably the worst Westin I've ever stayed in outside of a bad one off the strip in Vegas. If you need the Starwood points, do your thang, but otherwise, you might think about going elsewhere.BTW, if you do stay here and are driving, there is ample parking within a block of the hotel that is less than half the price of the valet.I was assigned a preferred room with two beds. It was spacious for two people.Room was well equipped.Clean, comfortable beds, fridge,  gigantic shower head, bath robe, even mouth wash...lol..Starbucks Coffee and a plate of fruits???  Whoa i feel so special...first time i get a plate of fresh fruits in my hotel room, includes  raspberries and black berries. ..so fancy...:)My friend parked at a close by parking lot to save money on parking  (kinda inconvenient but save enough money to buy 2 margaritas...lol..;))Would've been perfect if free parking and wifi were included...My sister-in-law and I stayed at The Westin this past weekend to celebrate our birthdays. First we went to a Spa Day at Square One then we checked into our ""suite."" Overall the room was nice, included a treadmill and some workout equipment, but for $208 we expected to have at least a room with a view.. The beds slept well and the rooms were updated. We enjoyed room service at a reasonable cost in the morning and comfortable robes to lay around the room in. We valet parked overnight ($25) and took an Uber to the Short North. Uber was super cheap at $5 there and $5 back.Great room and hotel overall, probably wouldn't have spent the extra money for the ""suite,"" but I would stay here again!We had a wonderful experience at the Westin. The staff is very friendly, and gives the impression they are happy to be helping you. (Jacob greeted us at the front desk and was so nice and helpful!) We had the chance to grab a snack and cocktail in the restaurant, which was also great. The bartender was able to suggest dishes that were vegan, which is always very appreciated.Ordered room service in the morning; pleasantly delivered, warm and as-ordered. Oh-and free upgrade on our room at check-in! Yes, rooms are small, but it's a beautiful historic building. Just no complaints about The Westin. :)So it sounds like the Westin Columbus is a historic building! Overall the staff is friendly, neighborhood is cute - just walking distance from the river and feels like a college town, very quiet. I stayed in the Deluxe Room, it's adequate...but fairly tight. You can't even fit a suitcase through when the bathroom door is open! But it was good enough for me, just one person staying for business. They charged for wifi, per device which was annoying and it wasn't a very strong connection. Lastly, room service was good - had a yummy breakfast sandwich, burger and chicken wrap while I was there. And it comes quickly!!","When it comes to urban travel, it is relatively easy to find old-fashioned grandness, historic properties, and beaux-arts enclaves that capture and charm their guests' imaginations.  In such a category, however, it's hard to find hotels that manage to embrace their historic nature while also maintaining satisfaction of each of the necessary tropes of luxury travel (compare a Ritz Carlton in downtown San Francisco to one on Half Moon Bay and the difference is blatantly clear) Columbus' Westin tries to strike a balance, and it does so with varying level of success depending on the amenity.  Having stayed in numerous older hotels, there is necessarily a curve on which they should be graded.  And even then, so far as Downtown Columbus hotels go, this one is the best.  It's not perfect, but it has its qualities.Unable to procure a bed and breakfast with availability outside of town it was necessary to ""bite the bullet"" and stay in the urban area.  The Former Great Southern Hotel channels the essence of historic Columbus - a neighborhood of refined mansions and neo-gothic mid-nineteenth century architecture.  With the passing decades many of the small estates have been supplanted by modern office buildings, but the handsome red-brick 1890s building remains.  It's a handsome structure, and its neo-baroque lobby (in spite of a few head-scratching juxtapositions from various renovations over the years) is very Ritz Carlton in style.  It's white marble with gilded railings and soaring skylight lends an aire of sophistication.  Check-in was pleasant and friendly, and by virtue of being an SPG member was instantly upgraded from a Deluxe Queen room to an Executive King Suite... worth double what they were charging... with free internet.  And 4:00 PM check out.  Perfect.The rooms, however, are cookie-cutter Westin - though that isn't a bad thing.  Comfortable, muted colors with traditional furnishings, they are pleasant places to stay.  However, they are a tad disappointing after taking in the impressive lobby.  My particular room looked into the interior courtyard (not terribly scenic) and possessed a slightly awkward layout - a very skinny sitting room with desk, television, and sofa, and a larger bedroom with king, second television, HUGE closet, and a very tiny (though well-equipped) bathroom containing granite countertops and a very nice shower.  I understand that each of the rooms possesses a unique layout with rather wide variation.  In my case, the slightly awkward layout was not a problem (having the whole thing to myself, it was a TON of space), and everything about it was extremely comfortable.  The ""heavenly"" bed lives up to its name, and the bathrobes unbelievably comfortable.  The complimentary toiletry items possess wonderful scents and textures, and the in-room wet bar actually possessed a decent champagne.The stay itself was very quiet the first night.  The second night a slight murmur was apparent, but the thicker walls (older hotels have their benefits) rendered the nigh peaceful nonetheless.  The next morning, however, the hallways on my floor were a bit of a mess... apparently there was a wedding and the guests were a tad soused.As far as other amenities, being an urban hotel in a historic building there is no pool (though the fitness center is very nice), and a focus on convention space (which are all VERY opulent for a four-star resort.)  The attached historic Southern Theater space, with its line-up of classical concerts, settles in perfectlyThe hotel restaurants will possess reviews of their own, but on the whole this Westin was a pleasant surprise.  The service was top-of-the-line five star caliber, the architecture of the public spaces opulent and extravagant, the rooms comfortable, well-equipped and welcoming (if a bit beige and lacking in character), and the value for the expense more than commensurate (they under-promise, but over deliver).  They earn each and every one of their four stars.  Should I find myself back in Columbus, I wouldn't be upset if I ended up staying here again.The friendly staff, nice workout room, and the historic property are the only things that keep this review from being 2 stars. While the front desk shared there was going to be a reception until midnight, they did not share the entire room would be vibrating from the music. Fortunately, we did not have our kids with us as that would have been miserable. My wife and I were out till 10:30, so we only had to deal with the intense noise for 90 minutes. I would expect a Westin property to convey at the time of booking that the noise level would be extremely high until midnight. We would have selected a different property. I would not stay here on the weekend unless you are part of the reception taking place. The staff did comp our breakfast which was nice, but we would have preferred peace and quiet in our room. Other reviews on the parking were helpful as we parked across the street for half the price of the hotel valet. If you are in Columbus for the weekend ask whether they are hosting a wedding reception and if they are stay elsewhere.I was so excited when we were able to book The Westin for our trip to Columbus for the Ohio State Michigan game.  Every Westin I have stayed at has been excellent and I love the heavenly beds.  So to the review.The good:Hotel lobby was stunning.  The intricate details along with the Christmas decor was beautiful.The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful.The bar had great bartenders and fabulous drinks.The location was great.  It was close to the highways, restaurants, nightlife and the stadium (3 miles approx)The OK:The elevators were old and rickety.The rooms were extremely small and the bathrooms were completely outdated.Once you reached the hotel room floors, the floors were plain and dark.With all that said.  I am a huge fan of Westin hotels and I am really big on NICE rooms.  However, for spending 150+ per night, it was definitely not somewhere I would want to stay again unless I could get a larger room.  If you don't care about rooms, this is an excellent place to stay.I'm okay with the small rooms...its a historical hotel. The fixtures are nice...the rainfall shower head is a plus. Room service was fine. Meal was passable. What has earned two stars from me was that happened at the beginning of my stay and what happened at the end of my stay. As I was checking in to the hotel, I was assisted by a very sweet young man who just couldn't have been more polite. However, there was another person working at the reception desk who lacked all of the skill this young man had. In fact, her rudeness and lack of customer service skills were so obvious that I was distracted from my pleasant experience to witness her being sarcastic and nasty to a customer whose key card wasn't working. She told the woman the card wasn't working because she must have had it next to her phone. The customer told her the card was not next to the phone, it was in her handbag...to which the young lady replied it must have been a magnetic clip on the customer's purse. The customer said there was no magnetic closure. The young lady continued to challenge her. WHY would she argue about how the problem came to be? Just fix the problem, take care of the customer and get her a new card. After she made a new key card and the customer left the front desk, she made sarcastic and rude comments about the customer. It was shocking. This is clearly a person who does not belong in a position of serving customers. Ever. Her behavior was distracting and inappropriate.At the end of my stay, I was awakened by the fire alarm at 6:00am...it sounded for about 35 seconds then ceased. Just enough to ensure I wouldn't be getting back to sleep any time soon...as is was leaving, it took 10 minutes to get a hold of the valet. The car was brought around quickly, but there was nobody at the phone. I understand mornings are busy, but staff the shift adequately. The housekeeping staff does a good job in the rooms, so kudos to them.Sad to say, but I won't be back.Room was very small, as in the bathroom was the size of a closet. However, it was in good repair and served its purpose. Fairly quiet through the night even though we were close to the elevator. Rick at the front desk was extremely professional and kind. The architecture of this downtown hotel is gorgeous and it's close to the Cbus line that basically allows you access to all the major districts in the city (Arena, Brewery, Short North, etc)Not impressed. I bought a ""traditional queen""/standard room for one night for my wife and I's 5yr wedding anniversary and it cost me $200 plus another $24 for overnight parking. The outside of the hotel looked old and historic so I thought it would be a neat stay, but the interior was all modern and updated which lost its historic charm. The room was one of the smallest ive stayed in and same here, no old world charm. Nice fixtures in the bathroom and a comfy bed but that's the only perk it had. The walls are super thin and we heard a party going on all night down the hall. After checking out we decided to get our complimentary breakfast. They had a decent buffet set up so we helped our selves. After finishing the meal they handed us a $35 bill for breakfast and pointed out that the free breakfast was the counter with the Cheerios and yogurt on it. For a place that charges so much, I wasn't expecting to be nickeled and dimed. Not a good experience for us and we won't be wasting our money here again.Attended a beautiful wedding here last weekend.  It was held in the ballroom.  Parking was nearby in lots.  Could have parked in the open Westin lot for $6.  Parked in covered parking across the street for $3.  The lobby is beautiful.  Nice architectural details.  The wedding was on the second floor.  As we waited outside the ballroom, there was chilled cucumber and lemon water available.  The ballroom was set up half for the ceremony and half for the sit-down reception.  It was a small wedding with maybe 120 guests.  One note:  during the wedding the a/c was quite noisy at times.  Once the ceremony was over, we were instructed to leave the ballroom while they set up for the reception.  There was a nice bar they had set up in the area outside the ballroom.  We then returned to the ballroom (it had beautiful stain-glassed windows) where we had a sit-down reception.  Service was excellent (though one of the servers seemed a bit impatient when a guest had removed her name card to save.  The name card indicated her protein preference.)  I had the salmon which can be iffy of a banquet, but it was moist and delicious.  Hubby had the steak which was a large portion - he thought it was okay.  Bottom-line:  Venue was beautiful but beware of the noisy a/c in the ballroom.  Food was delicious.  Park across the street in the covered lot.Spent the weekend here. Friday n Saturday night. Had the best customer service I've ever had. The hotel was clean. Food was awesome. The staff treated us like royalty. I didn't wanna leave. My husband n daughter n I enjoyed our stay so much!!! Can't wait to stay here again!! The hotel is beautiful and the history makes it more of an experience. Thanks to all the staff for making our spring weekend get away so wonderful. Every single one of the staff from the valet to the front desk to the room service. We had not one complaint!! Best stay I've ever had in a hotel.Stayed here for two consecutive nights, one by choice and the other due to a cancelled flight.  The staff are quite lovely and helpful.  They extended a special rate for a wedding to the unexpected stay.  They ""de feathered"" a room to accommodate a feather allergy.  The property itself is very historic and beautiful.  The rooms have been updated as best as they could given the age of the building, but do show some signs of wear and tear.  Room service has Jeni's ice cream!  The location is pretty good if you don't mind walking. You are 15mins by foot to german village and 25mins to the short north and arena district.  Ubers aplenty are minutes away for those in heals or the non walking crowd.  I think the room rates are pretty reasonable too.We enjoyed our stay at The Westin Columbus. I read reviews that said the rooms were small. We stayed in a guest room that looked twice as large as shown in some reviewers pictures. The bathroom was small but I liked the rain-style shower head and we had plenty of towels and a nice sized closet. I loved the classic minimalist design. I would describe it as a 1960's kind of ""Mad Men"" style. I thought the hotel was beautiful, including the rooms.Buyer Beware!  Booked this hotel for a corporate meeting and discovered that their cancellation policy is not industry standard!  Looks like they are trying to make money anyway they can.  Be very very careful when dealing with this hotelI stay at a lot of Marriott and Starwood properties for work and pleasure.  The hotel itself is rather nice with the lobby being quite picturesque but the check in experience could be improved.  The person checking really only checked me in.  She did not talk about breakfast, wifi, parking etc.  The room itself is nothing to write home about.  There are very few outlets beside the one by one of the night stands which has a two outlet chargeport and a few by the business desk.  Against the wall there really are not outlets for ironing and the lights switch in the bathroom is hidden behind the towels.  The walls are paper thin and you can hear others talking.  The air conditioning unit is quite loud and will wake you up in the night.If I had a choice I would probably stay at the Hilton where my colleagues are staying at as it is a much newer hotel and closer to the nightlife.I stayed 1 night at this hotel for a wedding. The facilities were beautiful and I really enjoyed my stay (ballroom was very classy as was the hotel bar). One thing that really set them apart... I accidentally left my suit and dress shirt in my room closet and flew back to Chicago! I immediately contacted the hotel and got a very prompt response from Housekeeping/Lost &amp; Found. Shiran Wijayaratyn, the Executive Housekeeper, took ownership, found my belongings and called me back immediately to get my address to send it back. He was very on top of it and never bothered to ask for payment to ship it back (which would have been reasonable). I was extremely impressed because I have not had this same experience at other hotels!!! (I had the exact opposite experience actually when my wife left something at a hotel last month) I really felt like Shiran went above and beyond... even little things like including several ""white tea towelettes"" in the package. Great service and I would highly recommend.Thank you very much!!!Staff is very friendly and the hotel is clean. The workout room is awesome for a hotel minus the fact that it's in the basement. The king room is pretty nice, pretty much a 4-star room. Got stuck one night in a ""Queen Cozy"", that is NOT a 4-star room. It was cramped and not well appointed, the shower leaked onto the floor, the TV didn't have a picture and the fridge wouldn't turn on. Valet is very prompt and once again, staff and management do their very best to accommodate your needs working with a very dated property. Honestly, despite the staff and excellent service, I would not stay here again. There are other hotels in Columbus that are 3-4 stars that are nicer, newer and closer to bars and restaurants. Kind of surprised Westin puts their name on this. Only giving 3 stars because of the staff. The property itself deserves about 1.5 stars. I like to visit historical landmarks, not stay in them.As far as fanciness goes, the Westin is certainly fancy. Walking in, looking at the marble tile and the high ceilings, you are overcome with a sense of grandeur.And that's about the only decent thing about the Westin.The rooms are small and cramped. There are noises in the creaky old walls. Visible pipes mar a complete look in some of the older rooms. The breakfast is expensive and overcooked.I was sorely disappointed in the Westin, partly because it seemed so nice when I first walked in. it's as if they put all of their effort into getting you to check in, and then didn't care what happened after that.Rooms are so dark and furniture so old. Anything other than lobby is bad quality. Especially shower...I had my wedding at the Westin in August 2013. My husband and I fell in love with the ballroom and knew it was the place.Overall, the experience was to be expected. Planning was stressful, but the Westin did what they could to help. Planning our menu was simple enough, and the staff (Lindsey Bruce, in particular) took care of all of the day-of coordination needed at the Westin, which was a huge relief. My only complaints surround small details that I would've liked done better, which I won't get into detail here. If you're thinking of the Westin for a wedding location feel free to message me and I'm happy to share. My two major complaints that I'll share here regarding their wedding planning services:1.) Our wedding coordinator was supposed to be there throughout the duration of the reception. She did ask me at 10 pm if she could leave, and I did say it was fine. I wasn't in the mood to get into a contractual argument with anyone on the day of my wedding, but I found that request entirely unprofessional. She had a contractual obligation, and should have known better than to ask for an out on the day of.2.) The Westin's wedding planning services do not provide much support with regard to giving you ideas on how to use the space. If you ask for photos of prior weddings they're happy to provide them. This resulted in several things being done on the day of our wedding that I (unfortunately) assumed would be done. For example, the lighting was not turned down when my husband and I had our first dance, which resulted in a less romantic dance.With regard to accommodations, I was happy with the Bridal Suite. I mean...it was the Bridal Suite, I can't really complain. I was disappointed that the day of my wedding we didn't have a turn down service so that the room looked clean and ready for some photographs we had taken (then again, I'm guessing they wanted to stay out of our way). Another complaint regarding rooms, my mom who really wanted to be on the same floor as me, was put into a closet of a hotel room. She was okay with it, I wasn't. With regard to booking, Lindsey and the Westin were very generous in their willingness to keep our blocked rooms open to our guests for an extended period of time; we did have to make this request, however Lindsey absolutely kept up with us to let us know our deadline was approaching. In addition, they were very accommodating with making reservations, and none of our guests had any complaints with regard to how they were treated during booking or checkout. The hotel did lose one or two reservations for some of our wedding guests, but promptly fixed the issue without complaint or fanfare, so no issues there truly.I will say this, given the fact that I had this massive idea of how lovely my wedding day was going to be, the Westin DID live up to that expectation. I have had nothing but raving reviews regarding how stunning and lovely our reception was.Front desk unable (or unwilling) to make a reservation in person and had us call the reservations line. We called and it didn't go through. Eventually someone checked us in. It took so long to check-in that the kitchen closed at the restaurant. Very unhelpful and disappointed after seeing such a pretty lobby. Subpar rooms and currently listening to really loud music from a wedding. Disappointed, hungry and hoping we don't get charged twice.This is lengthy but I promise you it is worth reading through.My husband and I booked a one night stay at this hotel on our way back to Canada from Arizona. We booked the King Corner suite at a rate of $339.00 Upon arrival, we pulled into the valet area at the front of the hotel. Three valets were standing on the sidewalk together. When we stopped, one came over to speak with my husband who was driving. I remained in the front passenger seat with the two remaining valets on the sidewalk to my right, about two feet from me.The valet told my husband he would have to park the truck and our trailer himself due to liability about the trailer. That wasn't a problem for us and the hotel parking lot was right next to the hotel. I waited for the valets on the sidewalk to come open my door and offer assistance. One had disappeared, and the third stood pecking on his cellphone, ignoring me.I gave up waiting, and got out myself, after swinging open a heavy door, struggling with a squirming dog and a huge loaded bag, and managing  to shove the door shut with my body and step up onto the sidewalk. Only then did the 'valet' look up from his cell phone, and mumble a half-hearted ""Welcome to the Westin"". I asked him why he didn't do anything and he mumbled something about ""not being sure I was staying"".Really??? He was two feet from me and the second I clicked the door handle, it was obvious I was getting out. I have never experienced such insolence and disrespect from any hotel employee, and it was a very disappointing and negative first impression of this hotel. He then made some lame offer of helping, so I said not to bother, I didn't want to interrupt any of his cell phone use. I turned and walked in the hotel.Before I tell you what happened next, I will say we were driving our 2012 Dodge Ram which we keep excellently maintained. These vehicle are equipped with technology that constantly monitors  tire pressure,  and lets you know immediately if there are any issues. We had just driven over 2000 miles with no vehicle issues of any kind, and it remained so right until my husband parked it in the Westin lot for the night.The next morning, we went to the truck and surprise, surprise....someone had let the air out of both our front tires. We filled the tires and drove back to Canada with no more tire issues.No, we did not see the valet deflate our tires. But given the facts I have outlined above, what are the odds the air oozed out of our front tires for any other reason than a deliberate act?We had just stayed overnight at four other hotels, and nothing happened. But after a confrontation with the Westin valet, this happens. Nice.If you are brave enough to consider staying at this hotel after reading this, I suggest you prepare to 'bow and scrape' to the staff member, no matter how poorly you are treated. Your vehicle might be attacked, or worse.Our total bill for this experience cost us $585.53 including the restaurant tab. You decide if you want to take a chance. Plus, when my husband checked out, he made a point of telling the concierge that we will never be back to any Westin, and as of this writing, no one from the Westin has contacted us.The lobby was beautiful and the staff nice, but for the price, not worth it.  Small room, plus - and this is why the one star - $10 a day for wifi?!? As my friend put it, ""what kind of guest-respecting hotel doesn't have free wifi in 2014!?""  Agree.  I have traveled to dozens of cities and over fifty countries, and I just feel this place is over-priced and trying on nickel and diming the customer. Plus, even in some of  poorest places in the world at least offer free wifi.","Westin Columbus touts itself as the top,shelf hotel in C-Bus but in reality they have a long way to go to reach 4 or 5 star status.  First. I have been staying at the Westin for several years in premium rooms and suites and there are no mini bars.  What?????Second, the bar at the hotel closes at 12 pm.   Huh?Third, the rooms have plastic cups in the bathrooms EVEN IN THE SUITES! And the rest of the amenities are nonexistent.   Really, the ""Suite"" is just a really big corner room. I won't talk about the restaurant because that isI got to say I stay at A lot of Hotels.  The Weston in Columbus is a horrible rip off.Free breakfast....nope. $15.99  Small rooms Yes!  Free wifi nope...$7.99 per night.  Free valet nope.  $24 a night! If you plan on coming to Columbus ohio please look around there are a lot of good hotels at much better rates.This hotel was listed as a 4-star establishment when we booked it online, but I don't think it fits the bill. Lets start out with the positives. The bed was comfy, the little leaf shaped soaps made me smile, and the water was complimentary, along with coffee and tea from starbucks, which you could brew in your room. On the other hand, the room was a bit small and the decor was minimal and shabby. I expected more from a Westin in that department. Oh, and the pillows were awful and uncomfortable. I tossed and turned all night because of them. The parking situation was also not very likable - $20 to park overnight in a lot adjacent to the property. The spots are VERY small and hard to get in and out of, and you are almost certain to leave with an extra scratch or dent on your car, because the spaces are so tight.With the $99 per night deal from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> it is really hard to go wrong with the Westin. The check-in/check-out was fast and pleasant. The room was very clean and up to date. They also have a very lovely green tea soap/shampoo/lotion in each and every room.The only bad thing about this hotel is that the rooms are very small. However, I do not let the size of a hotel room detract from the good things because I dont really plan on spending a lot of time in my hotel room. However, if I was staying somewhere for a week or two I might want a larger room.We arrived at the hotel around 2pm and had no trouble with an early check-in. In fact we were given a room upgrade for no apparent reason, even after I requested to have 2 beds instead of the king bed that was originally assigned. The check-in staff couldn't have been more accommodating.The only overnight parking option through the hotel is $20 valet. I found a spot in a small lot across the Main and High Streets intersection for only $5 per day. I think this is just a weekend deal though, as the price was on a temporary sign.The public spaces of the hotel are very historic and well maintained. Our room on the 6th floor was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was the one place that could use a little work. The bathtub wasn't draining well and it left a puddle of water at your feet when showering. Plus there was no venting fan, so the steam would quickly build up in the bathroom.The workout room is in the basement. It is well stocked with equipment, water, and towels. The only problem I had was the temperature was set to 70 degrees, which is warmer than I keep my own house. This is a little too warm for a workout without a fan. There is no pool at this hotel.The location of the hotel is in the business district of Columbus, near the Courthouse. During our Saturday stay there seemed to be very little going on around the hotel. There was very little that we could have walked to.Overall we had a nice stay, but I think I'd consider other options on a return visit.Nice little hotel.  This hotel is in a historic building (built circa 1890's) and has everything that you want in a hotel: nice bar, friendly staff, and high-quality rooms.We stayed here for a wedding in Columbus which, conveniently, was also held at the hotel ballroom.  Upon arrival, we found the hotel staff to be incredibly friendly and welcoming to Columbus.  With room service, the staff was just as friendly and polite.The hotel bar is solid too.  They have a great selection of draft beers (Goose Island) and ample space (at the bar; high top tables; dining tables) for large numbers of people.The rooms are somewhat small, and the shower heads (yes, two!) were fantastic.  The gym (in the basement) is nice enough with 4 treadmills, free weights, machine weights, and a few bikes/elliptical machines.  The wedding venue in the ballroom (3rd floor) had high ceilings and made for a great party.The only downside, however, is the $20/day parking (even self-parking) but that is almost to be expected at any downtown city hotel.Reservations with the wedding planner not favorable. The hotel staff are not able to plan  for you to enjoy the stay on the same floor even though it was planned months in advance, not to mention the detailed discussions from the mother of the bride.  Valet was horrible upon arrival and continues to be rude and not welcoming (I only hope they do not park my vehicle in the less than reputable places in the area. Check in with staff was almost longer than the trip. They were clearly not equipped with knowledge of how to work the front desk and people skills. The bar/restaurant lacks at the minimum to provide good olives for a lack luster martini. Room size... Thin walls... Annoying in room AC... Poor lighting everywhere in the establishment... And in addition they cram in a desk with a visible power strip leaves the establishment far less from appealing.Just arrived today as the complimentary Happy Hour was ending. Checked in, and went to grab a workout. When I got back to the room, the hotel had left a complimentary welcome gift of fruit. Very unexpected, and much appreciated. Thank you Brian Crooks for getting my stay off to a good start!I love this hotel. As a resident/native of Columbus, I'm not well versed on its hotels, though I do my share of traveling outside of the 'bus. I have had the occasion to stay here, though, when I was living in Akron and my parents' house was undergoing massive renovation. It's always been relatively affordable in spite of the grandeur, and allows dogs! Anyway, if you're a local, don't discount the Westin. It has a lot going for it besides hotel rooms.Let's talk about events. I've attended a variety of events here (even one with Yelp!), including weddings, networking receptions, etc. I've never planned an event with them, but they must make it easy, because it pops up on my social calendar as a venue quite a bit. The lobby area is gorgeous. It feels grand, and historical. Back in the day, we knew this hotel as ""the Great Southern"" and the Westin has been respectful of its history. All the weddings I've attended here have imparted a similar elegance. One reception room I was in didn't even need any decorations, it was all mirrors and filigree. My most recent experience here was a networking event with the Columbus Young Professionals-- a little happy hour with snacks and cash bar in the lobby (not the hotel bar, Thurber's, but that is nice too). Afterwards, we all had tickets to the Columbus Symphony, performing in the attached Great Southern theater. This is probably my favorite theater in Columbus (though the Ohio is very, very close). It feels way more intimate than the Palace or the Ohio. It's a tall space, with at least three tiers of seating. There's really not a bad seat in the house. Careful, though, the seats at the top are on a very steep incline!Locals, I want you to think of the Westin as a non-contrived entertainment complex. Catch the symphony or a play, enjoy the grand lobby, grab cocktails at Thurber's (or, there's lots of great dining just steps away-- Sidebar 122, De Novo), and if the night is going REALLY well, grab a room.If you're looking for a dog friendly hotel in the Columbus area, this is defintely your place to stay. On a whim, my husband and I decided to take our dog on a road trip to go visit my brother at OSU. Never having stayed with our dog in a hotel, I was a bit nervous despite having spoke with the hotel manager to confirm that it was in fact okay to bring our dog. So, it was an awesome comfort to see that the Westin literally had a Welcome mat rolled out for the pooches in the form of a water bowl and treats right at the front door. The staff was incredibly nice, and even gave us a map of the dog parks in the area (note: there is a nice dog park about 15 mintues away, you just need to cross some kind of sketchy train tracks if you're going on foot). They even brought up an extra comforter and blankets to make a dog bed.The rooms could use a bit of a face lift, but I'm going to complain since the rooms were a pretty decent size. Our standard room had a sitting area/living room with a separate bedroom/bathroom area. The downtown area is pretty quiet but German Village is only a few minutes drive away, and the Brewery District is in walking distance. We'd defintely stay here again.Columbus to me is the city of new.  New buildings, new restaurants, clean streets, etc.  So walking into this place I expected the same, especially with the Westin name attached.  The lobby is nice, the concierge, doormen, cleaning staff, incredibly friendly.  But paying $199 on a weeknight I expect a little more.  Also, having the W Hotel as your counterpart I expect more.  Being in the lobby, I expected more.  Walking into my room I thought, well... This is it?  Now don't get me wrong, I am NOT below staying at a Holiday Inn or other comparable hotel, but when I pay more I expect more.  The room looked old and almost looked identical, if not a little worse than a Holiday Inn or 3 star hotel would look, compared to this ""4 star hotel.""  I was just really surprised, especially staying at a W where the rooms are SO nice and maybe the same price or a tad more.  Plus, I've actually stayed at the Westin in Pittsburgh and the rooms are nicer than this one and I bet you the Pgh one is older!I did think it was cool that they will give you work out clothes, socks and shoes for a $5 rental fee.  How many times have you gone to a hotel and either forgot one work out item or all them (me, me!).  It's a little weird wearing work out gear others have worn, but I hope (and PRAY) they launder it with high quality chemicals.  Maybe that's where all the money is going!!!!I've stayed in small, space efficient hotel rooms and this one was *not* one of those. I've also stayed in other Westin and ""W"" hotels before and this place could have fooled me. The $199 rate during the week did not match the quality I was expecting from the Westin name. The lobby itself made me think of a lot of Cleveland's downtown hotels--rich historic charm, gorgeous detail. But as soon as I stepped into my room I was insta-disappointed. Not only was the room tiny, but the space was just not utilized well. On top of that, the decor could have used some upgrades. The bathroom, on the other hand, was small but had great amenities like a walk-in, double shower head and with a chic, upgraded look. Another plus was the super, fluffy, awesome bed! It felt clean, cozy and like I could stay in it forever. Not that I really had a lot of extra time on my hands but I was a little disappointed there was no steam room, pool, nothing. Although, on the plus side there was a 24/7 access gym with lots of weights, etc. Even one of the employees was complaining about this location in comparisons to Westins elsewhere. Sheesh!I was so excited to stay at the Westin for my wedding (September, 2013) and to reserve it for my guests. It's so beautiful and in a great location! However, the Westin dropped the ball in nearly every way.A month before the wedding I was told that only 4 rooms (7 nights total) had been booked in our block and that they were going to open up the other rooms (per our agreement that whatever rooms weren't filled by August 31st would be opened back to the public.) That number seemed low but I figured our out-of-town guests were making their own plans. It was disappointing because had we gotten to 10 nights, our suite would have been free.10 days before our event, I called in to check the reservations I had made. Friday for two adjoining rooms so that my bridesmaids could stay with me and we would have space to get ready the next morning. Saturday, the bridal suite and another room for our DJ. I was told that I only had one room for Friday night and that the hotel was full. He kept telling me there was nothing he could do. I had to pressure the young man on the phone to put me in contact with Daniel Nelson who had booked our room block to figure it out. Thankfully, Daniel was very helpful and switched things around to rectify the situation (Only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1!)When we arrived on Friday there was not a iPod dock in the room as we had been promised. When I called down to the front desk they again said there was nothing they could do. Finally, I asked them to provide the Wifi for free so that we could stream the wedding day playlist through my computer instead.Saturday morning was spent getting ready and having a blast with my sisters and my mom and my bridesmaids. We put together all of our food and trash into a bag by the door and got all the towels into a pile. My maid-of-honor stopped by the front desk and let them know we had left so that they could go clean the room before my husband and I came back that night. Later that night, as the reception was winding down, my oldest sister called the Westin to insure the room would be ready.My husband and I showed up to our hotel room on our wedding night, SO excited to celebrate. We walked into our room and my jaw dropped. Bag of trash still by the door, bed unmade with the dirty sheets on, damp towels still in a pile in the bathroom, no clean glassware, and no bottle of champagne as we ordered.My husband went down to the front desk, where it took 20 minutes to get someone free to come upstairs and rectify the situation. But, because housekeeping was gone, our room wasn't cleaned at all, just new sheets put on. It didn't ruin our wedding, because well we got married! But it definitely ended the night on a bad note.To top it off, I was complaining to my siblings/laughing about the room and they shared with me that when they tried to book a room in JULY they were told our room block was full. (Remember, we apparently only booked 4 rooms by August 1st, plus we were promised that if our room block filled they would add more rooms.) We talked to a number of out-of-town guests who were also told the block was full before the required book-by-date. In all, we would have had 16 total nights booked and received the wedding suite free on Friday and Saturday.So, I e-mailed the Westin and explained the situation. They apologized and said that they had uncovered some housekeepers submitting false information and they were dismissed. They also acknowledged that there was transition in their sales department that likely led to the miscommunication about my room block. They then asked what they could do to rectify the situation. I stated that in my opinion, I should be reimbursed the cost for the adjoined rooms on Friday and the bridal suite on Friday &amp; Saturday, my though process was this: Had my guests been able to book their rooms, I would have received the Bridal Suite for no cost per our contract anyway. And then to rectify the housekeeping issue on our wedding night, they should have reimbursed my cost for the adjoined room on Friday.After I made that request I never heard back from the Westin again. (Shocking. We'll give you whatever you want... except if you ask us for something we don't want to give you, then we'll just ignore you.)I was just talking to a friend about possibly having her rehearsal dinner and room block there and it made me upset all over again, that I decided I needed to write a Yelp! review to prevent anyone else from making the mistake of trusting details of their big day to the Westin!Its ok, just ok. Not the best, but ok.For being a Westin Hotel I was expecting better. It is an old building, but even the rooms are not as luxurious as other Westins.  I will say the staff was friendly and very accommodating.  For the price they charge, there are other hotels close by that you will probably get more for your buck. Its ok, just  ok, Not the best, but ok!!!!I've been here twice for family weddings and the venue/hotel was great. The staff were so friendly and showed us where we had to be be each time. We had more than enough space for both weddings and it was nice that the guests could leave the room when it got too hot or loud.We often stay at Westin hotels because we travel with our small miniature poodle and Westin accepts pets. This week I needed to be in Columbus and my husband and dog came with me and I booked this Westin in Columbus.  Such a disappointment!  The room is very small, not to mention the bathroom and the carpet is old and dirty.  Same for the carpet in the hallway.  The bathroom has a smell of old wet towels.  We always like to eat in the hotel so we are not far from our dog (another reason we like to stay at Westin Hotels, there is always a good restaurant in the building).  The food at this hotel, however, was far from acceptable.  My baked potato was cold and even the room temperature butter did not melt and my husband's steak salad was almost uneatable. The internet (they charged $9.95 per day) was terrible - slow and went in and out.  I am not sure how Westin can claim this hotel - it is so different from all the others we have stayed at.  The only good thing was that the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would not recommend this hotel for anyone who is used to the usual comfort of Westin hotels.   In fact, not sure about staying at other Westin's after this experience.Nice room and bran new everything. Even though it was an older hotel and the rooms are a little small they ere decorated nicely and made you feel comfortable. It was upscale and nice. You get Starbucks coffee to brew in your rooms and little to go cups.This hotel is really a mixed bag, depending on what you are looking for. I'll break it down:Check in/out experience - Overall check in experience wasn't great. Service rep didn;t really know what was or wasn;t included in either my rate, or Platinum level benefits.Rooms - rooms can be either a decent size or pretty small. All of them feel very dated and in need of a refurbishment. I generally have a socks on policy at most hotels but this felt more like socks and shoes would be the safer option. Lights were often not working and powerstrip plug sockets just give everything a tacky feeling.Gym - the gym is great as I have only every been in there with one other user. They have abunch of cardio equipment (treadmills, bikes, elipticals) and so good weights (free weights from 5lb to 50lb and a life fitness fit 3 machine which is great for unassisted benchpressing).New Balance gymwear - As per my gym comments, the New Balance gear that you can borrow seemed brand new (I think people just don't work out around here). I forgot my gymwear one week and had to borrow and for $5 for the week, its a great dealFood/bar - food was ok. I had the lamb shank one time which was definitely pre cooked. The bar had zero atmosphere but friendly bar staffLocation - Can feel a little sketchy as it is near the courts - mainly a bunch of derelict storefronts with the exception of bail bondsmen.Cab situation - generally good with a cab usually waitingIf you are SPG, I would recommend the Sheraton down the street insteadLoved room.  Parking is a fortune. $25.  Was ok for bar.  Prob wouldnt stay again with parking issue. I noted that after thr fact comment was added. However valet parker did not mention this and its still a sticker sdd on thats not able to be weighed n in advsnce when choosing a location.Nice, unique, highly historic property.  My stay was three nights on business. - Not really the greatest location -- not really walkable to any desirable locales- Parking is quite pricey (even self parking)- The property is ""historic"" and you will feel this in your rooms--very old-school, florally, non-modern- Good customer service- Manager left a really nice note, coupon and fruit basket in my room upon arrival -- a greatly appreciated special touch.- One thing (for me) almost worth a Yelp star off -- using flat sheets when fitted sheets should be used -- you roll over one time and the sheet comes off under you!","I was here on business a few months ago and the check-in staff seemed a bit off of their game.  However, the rooms were clean and our catered food was good.  The hotel is located right downtown, so it's a good location, but they only have outdoor parking from what I experienced and no parking garage.You don't want to stay here. If you have another option, go there. This hotel may be high class but the staff is rude and not helpful. The waiters are rude. They got basically everything wrong for my sisters bridal suite on her wedding. I do not recommend this hotel.Extremely nice facility but very rude night time workers. We encountered two awful people (the bartender and the front desk attendant) when we came to check in on a Friday night. The day staff was lovely but I won't be back after encountering their night time workers and I am a gold member with SPG so I've seen a lot of hotels.Great staff, AMAZING bed, and charming aesthetics. Starwood is the way to go. But as for those reviewers who are bashing this hotel, they clearly didn't do their homework and have no appreciation for the past.We were lucky enough to first get a Hotwire rate of $65 a night (plus tax)!Then lucky enough to ask if we could upgrade from a Queen to a king and got a suite ($300+ at least)! Very nice and helpful staff. So our suite was a living room with TV, couch, side chair, mini bar, and coat closet, bathroom, and bedroom with TV, desk, dresser, and closet. Bathroom was on the smaller size, but the rooms felt plenty big esp. for a historic building. Bed is amazing. Great shower head. Calm and comfortable. Love the white tea toiletries and scent in the lobby! Amazing lobby. Little street traffic noisy and heater noisy in the rooms. Wear and tear here and there. No oatmeal on the room service menu. And $20 for parking a night. Not so great.THIS is a Westin? Methinks not so super duper. I'm glad I at least earned some SPG points for this stay...otherwise, I'd be pretty disappointed. On my last trip to Columbus, I selected this Westin to be my one night ""home away from home."" Unfortunately, my home would be much preferable to this...even with one million cats, a needy dog, laundry piles and a buncha lousy neighbors. Yes, still preferable!The room was so...SMALL. Like very, very teensy small with a desk jammed in and an itty bitty bathroom. No room to breathe. The bed was lumpy, the air vents were loud and I left a grumpy camper. NEXT! I stay at the Hampton in Short North from now on. Better neighborhood, more room to wiggle.Yikes!  Not at all what I was looking for. Not what I expected from a Westin either. I guess I should have looked at the pictures and reviews better. Tired rooms, dark hallways; we checked in, walked in and out of the room and headed to another hotel. The staff was apologetic and informed me that this was a historical hotel; thus the older style.The staff and manager were really friendly at check in and gave us a great room upgrade.  Sadly however, the quality of the rooms has really declined these last few years.  Our room was not cleaned two days in a row, which was a real bummer and the furniture was banged up and stained.  We love Starwood Resorts, but I cannot see us returning to this location.First, the good: Comfortable beds as you would expect in a Westin. Room was clean and the staff friendly when we arrived. We only stayed one night. Now the bad and the ugly:The trouble started when I called for a bellman to help with our bags. This was the last stop of a 10 day road trip so we had a lot of stuff with us. I called for a bellman while my wife took the kids downstairs to get the car from the valet. And I waited. And waited. Finally I called again after 20 minutes and they said someone would be right up. And I waited some more. And my wife called and said she could bring a cart up for me. Finally the bellman came THIRTY MINUTES after my first call. This was on a Monday morning at 10AM, not exactly abustle time. Unacceptable level of service, really ruined what would have been a great stay. Went from 4 stars to 3. Very disappointing.A really great hotel in a convenient location in downtown Columbus.You walk into a grand lobby that has the detail grandiose buildings used to have.  Considering the building has been around since the late 1800s, it's in fantastic condition.  I've been told that every room is different - ours was okay - kind of small, but that was very normal during the time these types of hotels were built.  There's a bar, a restaurant, a business center (included with the hotel stay/no extra fees) and a small workout room.  The hotel is a great location in downtown within walking distance to all the downtown sights as well as German Village.Overall, I had a good experience here, but staying inside such a historic building is what really made it worthwhile.This place is an embarrassment to the Westin brand - Service and food were great, but other than that, the physical facility is a joke. Room I was in had a bathroom that smelled moldy, parts of it had motel like wear and tear, and internet was slow <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F826199020.png&amp;s=b9c85c4d92f5f79b4683f30f0c591be6c6a3e9e92bbd848503be35f984fb3e78"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/826...</a>. I've seen better gyms at Courtyard Marriotts And who at AAA was asleep at the wheel when this place got 4 stars... absurd. There's a difference between a cool, restored historic hotel (Blackstone/Palmer House in Chicago, Liberty/Omni Parker in Boston, etc...) and an old hotel that a little money was thrown into in. Insult to the Westin brandMade my wedding day sooooo special! So my wedding was not located at the Westin at all. However I have always loved the lobby of this gorgeous hotel. So I contacted the Westin to obtain photography rights in the lobby. All they required was a one night stay, which was perfect because we wanted to find a room at a hotel away from our family and friends!! Due to money constraints we went with the Queen standard room! Well when my wedding day arrived it was 90 degrees outside and it rained for about 3 solid hours. Now not a little rain, all of my guests referred to it as a monsoon. So thank goodness we had the Westin to take pictures in, because the park was not happening obviously! Four about an hour my wedding party (10 of us) plus three photographers ran around the lobby and the second floor area taking pictures! It was soo fun! The hotel was so sweet when we returned at the end of the night, upgrading our room to suite. I did not realize they had until we were up in our room! The room was gorgeous and super clean! There were strawberries, chocolates and a bottle of champagne on the dresser. I figured one of our friends had surprised us, but no it was from the Westin. Such a cute surprise!!! This visit made me a loyal Starwood guest !!! This was 08/14/2010 The pictures turned out gorgeously!Built in 1897 (Southern Theater was built in 1896), The Westin Great Southern Hotel is a true landmark of Columbus! It is the only grand hotel (aside from Hotel Hartman which is now condos) still standing in Columbus. With its lavish lobbies and ballroom, Columbus is very proud to still have this jewel of the Gilded Age. Great for overnight visitors, conferences and events as well as weddings.It has hosted presidents and celebrities such as President McKinley and President Teddy Roosevelt to as recent as Hillary Clinton and President Obama. This is Clinton and Obama's hotel of choice while staying the night in Columbus. The hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of the National Trust Historic Hotels of America. I take some issue with some other reviews about the size of the rooms. This is an historic hotel built in the 1890s. The size of most rooms of that time are smaller and typical of the Victorian era. If you want a vast McMansion room (like other Westin hotels) this is not the hotel for you. However, if you want a truly elegant, first class room that has much history and luxury, you are in for a treat! The rooms are not small, they are very comfortable. Dogs welcomed! They also have an excellent staff and great restaurant. Thurber Bar is also a great place to hang out and have a few drinks. Check out the video about the hotel's history I made for Columbus Landmarks Foundation: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DO8mRpvrWwiM&amp;s=d82dcf74e1174bb3c8ff48dbe253b16157c76d894eaf36bb3d1aa52d64b6488f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=O8mR...</a>The hotel was almost torn down many times during the 1960s through the 1980s. Fortunately, Marcus Hotel Group and Westin acquired the hotel and spent millions upon millions of dollars on historic restoration and modern amenities. Here's some more history:Columbus was abuzz on the hot summer night in 1897. The city's leaders had fulfilled their promise in building the ""showcase of the midwest"" and tonight, the 23rd of August, The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House was opened to the public.  It had been a tragic decade for hotels in this capitol city, with fires claiming the Seneca, the Deshler, and the Vendome Hotels. It was with great pride that the populace toured the majestic building, as it had been built on the dreams of 400 men investing $100 each towards its construction.They marveled at the spectacular lobby that had been designed with exquisite taste and admirable skill. The decorative work was treated in specially modeled plaster, the ceiling beams forming panels which housed spectacularly decorative stained glass, with the central panel forming a magnificent dome. Pink marble wainscoting was edged by appropriately designed woodwork of cherry, creating a color scheme between old gold and terra cotta.As visitors strolled through the peer of all lobbies, they roamed to the Cafe or supper room, lavatory, travelers' exchange (containing railroad, ticket, telegraph, transfer company and telephone offices), check rooms, bar, billiard, reading and writing rooms, barber shop, and in further wonder...five stores.Never before had some of the visitors seen such a fine example of French Renaissance architecture, and they marveled at the open aired feeling as they strolled the promenade on the second floor which was landed centrally either by the grand stairway or elevators.Directly connected with the promenade were spacious parlors with views of High Street, the main dining room, maids' dining room, ordinary (breakfast) room, private dining room and guest chamber corridor. The principal features of the second floor were the dining rooms and parlors with the balance devoted to the kitchen and guest chambers.The dining room itself was akin to a palace ballroom, and no expense had been spared in its construction. Local laborers stood by the city's elite as the general manager, J. M. Lee, welcomed them to the hotel. They marveled at the extreme size of the room, extending the height of the second and third floors at a total expanse of 46 x 90. The length, however, was masterly relieved by a decorative arch which screened and secluded the musician's gallery. With six fluted pilasters on each side and dome capitals surmounted by an ornate entendres, the dining room presented an appearance, second to none in the country.The parlors were finished in white enamel and gold with unique designs as more than a few ladies retired to the comfort of the seating arrangements away from the cigar smoke of the men.The Great Southern housed 222 guest rooms in its expanse, with two club rooms, 56 private bathrooms and 8 public baths. The guest chambers on the second, third, and fourth stories was finished in plain oak, while the balance was completed in yellow pine.Quite ahead of her time, the grand dame as she would soon be known housed the latest equipment for electric work, call bells, heating, ventilating and plumbing. Huge coal fired boilers were located in the basement which also housed the buildings own water supply.Normally, I wouldn't give a hotel the Westin's size and location a 5-Star rating, but their customer service was OUTSTANDING. Absolutely stellar!My husband and I live here in Columbus and have stayed at the Westin Columbus twice, both times for special occasions. They made us feel like royalty each time! We've decided that the Westin is now ""our place"" to go when we run away from home!Would give it zero stars.  I've stayed in many Westin in the US and abroad.  This is the worst and most disappointing.  The rooms are tiny, and dirty.  The bedding wAs course and the sheet barely fit over the bed.  I could see the mattress. The bathroom has rust stains and grudgy.  The room service was jus awful.  No matter what I tell them, I always get 9 grain bread- when I ask for white toast or French toast!  My coffee canister had curdled milk in it.  I went to show the people at reception and they were like la dee dah.  Never again.  Awful.  I'm so shocked Starwood would allow this Bc it's definitely not what I expect from a Starwood hotel.Beautiful lobby. Front desk had a bit of attitude which I didn't understand. Lobby bar was very nice and the bartender was friendly and knew the history of the place which was interesting. Now for the room. Our first room was the size of a cell. No design sense. No color. Drab and claustipobic. As we are preferred customers with Starwood we asked for an upgrade. Second room was twice the size but still nothing to make it welcoming. That being said, the bed was very comfortable. Also the air conditioning was not working correctly. Not what we expected from a Westin.I'm not a big hotel person bc I always feel like they're dirty...but this hotel was so nice! The beds are insane comfortable and the showers...awesome. Everyone has been super friendly, I would definitely stay here again!I checked in at the Westin Columbus for one night. I asked if there was a Starwood preferred floor. She said ""No."" In my experience, it's typical for Westin to have this. Then I asked about breakfast (last time I stayed here I was offered a complimentary breakfast) she said it wasn't in my room rate. (That's not what I asked, but ok). I asked another way and explained I got one before. She said that the person helping me was probably being nice. So naturally I asked her if she could be nice too. (Wouldn't you?!) She gave me the room key and was like ""have a great night"". I am a team leader at a large company and deal with clients all day. I felt she was not listening to me. So I said, ""I just wanted to offer some feedback, when someone asks you a direct question it's appreciated if you respond with a direct answer because I don't feel like you were really listening to me about breakfast or the Starwood room"" So, she says ""thanks for telling me how to do my job!!!"" and storms away. I was thinking...omg did that just really happen? Now I just can't walk away unless I get her name because that upset me so much. So I start saying ""excuse me, excuse me"" over and over with no response. Finally I asked a server who happened to be walking by to get the person behind the desk to come out to help me and I wanted to know her name.  Another girl comes out and apologizes on her behalf which is totally unfair to that girl. I asked again about the Starwood room and she said they don't have a specific floor but there are rooms mixed in. The room I got was NOT one, I don't get that at all, perfect example of the not listening thing. So the second girl switched my room. Turns out the original girl was actually the manager! Not sure how to spell it, but the managers name was Elana. No one wanted to tell me her name until I asked several times, wonder why. I'm a huge believer in the fact that people make mistakes but this was crossing the line and totally unacceptable. She either needs to keep her personal life issues at home, get proper training on client service from Westin, or not work with people at all because under no circumstance is it ok to tell a guest who is offering feedback ""thanks for telling me how to do my job."" and cowardly storm off.This is not a Westin. It has the name of the hotel but if you compare it to ANY other ones you will be shocked.CONS:When asked if I could be upgraded to a king I was replied with a ""sure for $20.00 more.' REALLY???? WOW. I passed.Hotel room was the SMALLEST to the point they have to put the tv on the wall...at an angle to fit in.DIRTY shower. There was residue ALL over the corners of the shower...I had to take one but stuck to the front portion. Didn't understand the whole dual shower head especially when there was a LARGE sign right above it stating not to use to ""conserve water"". Air conditoner did NOT work. We slept with it on at 66 no lie and still were hot- we were on the 6th floor and I get heat rises but really??The bar seemed overwhelmed- when I asked to order food he was like ""really?"" and then the amount you get for the price would make me hit the yellow pages if I was to stay there again.When I asked the concierge to bring up a personal item that I needed...they never came up. I had to go down to let them know I was leaving and just to leave it in the room. NOT IMPRESSED.Parking for $20 bucks in an open parking lot out back?????They are lucky my car was safely returned.PRO:Nice lobby but who stays in one? They don't even have couches/chairs so you can linger in it.PASS.PASS.PASS. Pay the extra $30 bucks and stay at the Renissance.The hotel is old and the rooms are small and dated. The door jamb and lock bar were literally falling off and the top of the bathroom door stuck so it was really loud when opening. We checked in around five in the afternoon and asked the front desk where a good place to eat would be and were told the hotel has a very nice restaurant but we never found out because when we went down to eat we were told the restaurant only opens for breakfast and lunch and is closed for dinner.  Very odd. Goofed and forgot to pack my tooth brush so I called the front dest for a complimentary one that every hotel has, they didn't. Had toothpaste, no brushes. For a hotel that charges $149 for a small dingy room, $22 for parking, $10 for Internet you'd sure think they could manage to keep those little 5 cent toothbrushes. Oh and one last negative- the hotel staff picking up dishes from the hallway from anyone having room service the night before, does not seem to care one bit that you might want to sleep past 7a.m. because they are extremely loud with their work and outdoor voice conversations.  The bed however was quite comfy. (Until about 7 a.m.)I've noticed in the negative reviews that Phil B. replies asking what he can do and telling reviewers to contact him and he will make sure the next visit is as it should be.  Why can't the service and quality be there the first time we pay? Fool me once...","I was in town for the Columbus Half Marathon. I wanted something quiet where I could rest and focus on the race so was only considering upscale hotels. Booked on Priceline using ""name your own price"", and got the Westin for $70/night.I got to the hotel, and found out that they also had a wedding planned on Saturday, the night before the race. I was a little afraid that it was going to be loud (it's an old hotel, after all), but they were advising all guests that they needed to be quiet in the rooms. Not only did they mention it at check-in, they also reminded all guests about it by slipping little reminder notes under their door. They also made run that the marathon participants were in one section of the hotel where they wouldn't be as disturbed. The room itself was ridiculously tiny. There was a bed, two night stands. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was excellent. But there was not even a desk. I understand that they are going to give me the smallest rooms when I get a deal on price line, but what kind of top rated hotel does not even offer a desk? I was planning to do some work after the race on Sunday, and had to go sit in a coffee shop. The service was ok. The bartender in the restaurant was quite unfriendly and rushed me, which was even more surprising given that I was the only customer at the time and it wasn't even near her closing time. The rest of the staff was nice, but not especially helpful. When I asked them about the closest Tim Horton's, one of them looked up directions for a Tim Horton half a mile away. The place had been close for 6 months... half-mile away, they should have known. The other employee kept on trying to convince me that I should try their in-house starbucks instead, and wasn't interested at all into helping me find a Tim Horton's. I also had to pay $25 for an in-room breakeast a 5:30 (only option available for me before the race), and the breakfast consisted of a bagel, coffee and a cup of not so fresh berries.With respect to the location, there was major construction (demolition) in the area, and other than that it was completely dead. The hotel is about 1mile from nationwide arena, and a 2-3 minute was to Broad and Third (where the race started). The location was perfect for what I wanted.Overall, I would say that I would not have been happy if I had paid $170 for the room that I got. Yet, at $70, I was pleased. I got a very comfortable bed, good location, and peace to rest for the race. But the service and the room wasn't exactly up to what you'd expect from a luxury hotel. Try to get a deal on priceline.Why this place has so many good reviews is beyond me. I have stayed in many many luxury hotels all over the world as well as more standard levels and I think my assessment here is more than fair. I had never been to Columbus before and checked all the reviews for the four star hotels in the area (they don't have any five stars) -- all the hotels had mixed reviews but the Westin seemed to have the more consistent positive reviews on TripAdvisor and Yelp so I took a gamble. Cons: -Everyone raves about the lobby...I've seen better, it's not that big a deal...I'm guessing if you've never stayed in a ""fancy"" hotel or you're from the mid-west this probably seems luxurious. Trust me, it's not. It's nice, but it's nothing stellar. -Low floors. Most buildings in Columbus seem to be short of stature and this was no exception topping out at the 6th floor. -Dark with no view. I had booked a King size suite which was small and cramped with three windows overlooking the parking lot. It also barely got any light. I was on the 3rd floor. -The bathroom was smaller than the one in my NYC apartment. -They don't have a press in their laundry so the bed linens (even the ""clean"" ones) were constantly wrinkled giving the appearance that they had not been laundered.-Housekeeping was not thorough...they barely cleaned the room, the bathroom was only 1/2 done (but they were more than happy to swipe the generous cash tip I left for them on the bed).-As it is a small hotel there doesn't seem to be a real dedicated ""room service"" kitchen but you can order from one of the on-site restaurant menus...the menu in the room was printed on plain copy paper and was dated two years ago -- I ordered scrambled eggs for breakfast one morning but didn't eat anything else from their food service because it didn't seem very appetizing. -Location: here is what is around your hotel....two court houses, a jail, and a bail bonds office. Really charming atmosphere. Also, you can't walk to anything good. The Easton shopping (which seems to be the most Columbus has to offer, aside from the Zoo and the Whistle factory) was a $40 cab ride away. Pros: -It's cheap. A king size suite for two nights only cost me around $500. -The valet was very good. -It was close to the airport. -When I complained to the front desk that my room hadn't been cleaned properly and that one of the window shades had fallen down they sent up a manager who had the shade fixed immediately, and agreed that the cleaning was sloppy and had the bathroom cleaned again (though the maid did a substandard job the second time around too)Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone planning on staying in Columbus. If I go back again, I will look into other hotels in the area.Stayed at Westin Columbus last weekend while in Columbus for a date night. We were so surprised at what we got for the relatively small amount we paid! The hotel staff was very friendly. The room was great with really comfy beds. Also, the workout room was pretty awesome. Will stay again.This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel.  The only thing about it that is, is the name on the building and the lobby.  The rooms are old and dirty.  The service was poor.  I travel at least every month and always stay in 4 star hotels.  This location is a disappointment to the Westin name.  AVOID this hotel.I stayed at this property for four nights during a recent business trip. The hotel is located slightly on the outskirts of the downtown region, though it was still within (longer) walking distance to everything. The hotel has a grand, old feel to it upon entering the marble adorned foyer. The desk was staffed by three attractive women who promptly checked-in and out customers. Even though I had arrived a few minutes prior to 11pm, I was told that regular food service for the evening was over and I was limited to the overnight menu which consisted of a poor selection of food at exorbitant prices. I arrived at my room and was shocked at how incredibly small it was. I stay in hotels 100+ nights a year and have never experienced a room as tight as this one (~160 sq ft). It consisted of a large king bed (which took up most of the room, a nearby desk, tv and similarly tiny bathroom and miniscule closet. I was honestly shocked that as a Platinum guest, I would be placed in such a room. I initially decided to deal with it but quickly felt very cramped for space. I called the front desk and spoke with a manager about a possible room change. I was told the hotel was almost completely booked but he could place me in an accessible room which would be larger. I graciously accepted.  The manager appeared at my door promptly with a new set of keys and apologized for the inconvenience. He mentioned that the hotel was modeled after European boutique hotels, thus explaining why the rooms were so cramped. I told him I was appalled that I would not have been upgraded to an accessible room or similarly larger room prior to arrival and he again apologized. The new room was about the size of a typical room. It consisted of the same basic amenities but with breathing room between getting out of bed and walking to the bathroom. I was disappointed that the shower did not have the typical dual showerhead but I got over it quickly because I was thankful for the additional space. I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent meal options. I became rather addicted to their breakfast tacos with deli turkey, salsa, peppers, onions, avocado and fresh fruit. The service was attentive and I was lucky enough to receive the same people every day. My one major complaint, which isn't directly caused by the hotel, but more so with the city of Columbus is the horrible taxi service. Because the weather was hot and humid, and my office was several blocks away, I opted for cab service. Unfortunately, even though the cab advertised that it took credit cards, on almost every occasion, I was told credit cards were not accepted which continually put me in a bind because I rarely carry any cash. Overall every taxi driver I experienced in Columbus was rude, unprofessional and their vehicles were disgusting on the inside. From now on, I'll be renting a car.Overall I had a pleasant stay at the hotel but the distance to city life and tiny rooms, leave a lot to be desired. Unless the nearby Hyatt is sold out, I don't plan on returning.Friendly staff, very nice lobby (southern style). Good food in their Thurber's bar and a pretty well equipped gym. The staff remember you and are genuinely nice.Beautiful place to meet the top organizations in Columbus serving our great community! Very good meeting rooms and atmosphere, really enjoyed the event because of the good location and venue. Looking forward to a get-away night here in the future!I thought this hotel was fantastic overall. I stayed here for a couple of nights and attended a wedding reception held in one of their halls (errr.. might be their only hall?). First off our room was great. The pillows and sheets were sooo comfy. The robes were nice and huge (great since the towels never fit around me.. beh). The desk had 3 outlets on the front of it, which was awesome (usually you have to do some crawling or moving of furniture to find outlets). The flat screen TV was pretty cool, but a little moody (and $11 for movies? WHA?) so it'd go from quiet to loud with different commercials. Kind of lame that the internet was $10 a day considering I've stayed at cheaper hotels with free internet. Nice water pressure in the shower.. but what's up with the double shower heads? I never could figure them out. Two main peeves? The air conditioner beeps constantly when changing temperature and I had to do the jiggly thing with the toilet handle. Classy.Brunch was great and served in the mezzanine. I'll be honest and say I don't know if this is a regular thing or was special for the wedding party.  There were these cinnamony cake things that were heavenly and the cuts of meat for the sandwiches were very tasty. The reception hall was so lovely. I know the couple had a wedding planner sort things out, but the atmosphere with the windows and the general room were so elegant. One thing is this place is FREEZING.. so make sure to dance your tushy off on the dance floor! Great acoustics by the way.. I heard this place was once a theater? I could definitely tell. The Westin salad with the raspberry vinaigrette (I love goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes) and the crab cake &amp; chicken plate were very good. Much love to their mashed potatoes.. totally hit the spot. The bathroom that was by the reception hall was amazing. It was clean throughout the night and just generally schmancy. In the ladies room they had baskets of whatever you might need.. hairspray, gum, lotion, sanitary products, sprays, etc. No worries if you couldn't fit your 5 oz. of beauty product on your plane ride over or in that tiny clutch you decided to bring. The workers were generally nice, although the ones I passed in the hallway were mum. And the woman at the desk gave us the wrong time for mass. Oh well. The servers at the reception/brunch, however, were ridiculously on their game. They all seriously seemed like they really loved what they did. I would have tipped them all individually if I had the money. And the same servers that chatted with us during the cocktail hour, followed up with us during the reception. I would definitely come back and stay here if I were in the area or suggest it as an event hotel (the Live Strong conference was either coming or going when we were here as well).I was only going to Columbus for one night, so I kind of had to make the hotel count.I settled on the Westin based on the overall price and of course the general Yelp consensus...The hotel, as mentioned, has just gone through a major renovation and sports 7 floors of nicely appointed rooms in an older, stylish building.  The size of my room reminded me of the one I had at the Soho Grand in New York -- large by NYC standards, but certainly on the smaller side for Columbus, I imagine. Regardless, it was plenty big for just me, and the special touches in the room made up for it.I'm not a hotel loyalist, generally, but I could certainly get used to the Heavenly Bed they have -- I really love a good comforter and some nice sheets in addition to the mattress -- and their own line of soaps and other toiletries is really nice too.Check out the photo I have up of the double shower head. That thing was mind bending, and perhaps a bit unnecessary and over the top, but made you feel like they at least tried to do something special with the shower.Great, thick white cotton robe in the closet, flat screen LCD TV and comfortable, muted tones in the room plus a complete mini-bar.Suggested improvements? 1) get rid of that retarded old transistor clock radio and get something with a digital signal or something you could plug your iPod into and 2) how about a free bottle of water? $5? Yeah. No.Other than that, a great stay and super close to M -- see my review <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/m-restaurant-and-bar-columbus#hrid:CqfA5DJffTQlshlyjx4mFQ"">yelp.com/biz/m-restauran...</a>. I'd definitely stay here again.The Westin was an okay hotel - definitely not a luxury hotel by any means. My stay here was a Hotwire booking, which is probably why I found myself in a tiny room on the second floor with a commanding view of a brick wall. What bothered me more than anything about being on this floor was that the second floor was half-guest rooms and half banquet/meeting rooms. During my stay, there was a huge wedding going on, and the party lasted well into the night. Surely there were rooms available on one of the numerous other floors?!The hotel's gym was impressive - large, with a variety of machines, free weights and cardio. It was 24 hour, and since I wasn't part of the wedding party going on on my floor, I got a late-night workout with the gym all to myself. Parking was pricey and valet - in my opinion, parking on the street in that part of Columbus would be taking a risk with your car. Not much more to the hotel than that. The hotel was definitely a big, historic one, but I didn't really feel its charm.Awesome historic hotel, SUPER comfortable beds, close to cool restaurants/bars on High St, and very tasty Angus burger available until 11pm in the lounge. (I had it twice!)The staff was exceptional during my visit.  The front desk staff was very courteous and extremely accommodating, and everyone that helped with the conference room was very professional, helpful and fun.  My company strives to create a professional atmosphere for our customers during our trainings, and the training that I did at The Westin Columbus was perfect.  The wait staff and all who helped set up our training room were very responsive to my requests for assistance.  I found them to be extremely friendly and totally cool.  I enjoyed working with everyone with whom I interacted at The Westin Columbus.I also wanted to say that I truly appreciated the program (I can't remember its name) that enabled me to forego room cleaning in favor of the $5 vouchers that can be used in the restaurant or lounge.  I'm very interested in conservation, ""going green"" or whatever you might call it, but the reward of the daily voucher is really a nice touch!Thanks for everything!Located in the heart of downtown Columbus, the Westin is an historic hotel with one of the most spectacular lobbies you'll ever see. The rooms are small, but the bathrooms are updated (and twin shower heads). Every room has a flat screen TV. The basement gym has all the equipment you'll need for a solid workout. A winner!Nice hotel, good location, nice staff - the door man and front desk staff were very kind.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  On the other hand, the rooms are small and there aren't many outlets/plugs in the rooms.  The bathroom sink was really small.   Plus, rooms are high priced for the accomodations...and internet is not included.The Westin Columbus is a beautiful old 100+ year old hotel.  The stately, high-ceilinged lobby, oozing with wood, leather, marble and stained glass is from another era; just walking in to it makes you feel good and special, to have somehow merited that kind of a welcome, in a way that all the world's W's, with their ambient trance music and subdued lounge lighting will never be able to match.Not to sell it short, but that lobby may be the best thing about the Westin --it is, after all, an older hotel, so the rooms are on the small side.  The walls are also paper thin:  I was able to hear the ex-frat boys next door, apparently in town for a fellow d-bag's wedding, talking about groping unsuspecting girls in bars, and wrestling with each other after their morning showers, all while I was trying to sleep off a Sunday morning hangover.  They weren't being overly loud, even for d-bags --it's just that the walls were that thin.  The bathroom had nice, modern fixtures and fluffy towels, but was lit as dimly as one of the W Hotel lobbies contrasted above. Also, there was no place to set your toiletries down, and I'm just a guy with a shaving kit --someone traveling with more product would probably end up having to just lay them out on the floor.I've stayed here a number of times, and sometimes you'll get a bigger room than the one I described above, but bottom line is, you're getting the old school charm of an old school hotel, along with the old school accommodations.  Still, I'll stay here again because I love just walking into the place, and the rates are usually pretty decent.  Would've given it 4 stars based on all that, but I'm knocking one off because they charge for in-room wi-fi, which in this day and age is like charging for tap water.Historic hotel is extremely clean and charming - with granite/marble throughout.  Hotel staff - from valet to front desk to the corporate office - is friendly, helpful, and professional.  Having stayed here for three consecutive weeks, I enjoy the varying room layouts of an historic building - which is atypical from the standard cookie cutter rooms of many other hotels.  Highly recommend.So as mentioned in other reviews, I'm a Starwood addict and I generally find Westins more consistent than Sheratons. And I like their beds better. So this one is no exception in that regard. Had a nice lobby.I checked in here shortly after becoming a gold member and I got upgraded to a suite which was only the second time I'd been upgraded to a suite, BUT the suite had a window that looked out on a wall. So it was really dark and sort of depressing, but it looks like most of the rooms don't have this problem.I've never actually stayed here, but I've been here for a few events and it always makes you feel classy. It has that charm from a time when materials and labor were cheap enough to do everything on a grand scale. Not that it's ridiculously huge or anything, just nice and classy. Not sure what the rooms are like, but the staff is always nice and helpful. If I was an out of towner, I would love to stay here.Wow, I'm on a four-star roll. This wasn't the best Westin I've ever stayed at. Sometimes the soap or the robe was missing, and the key stopped working if you placed it anywhere near your wallet. There were sometimes various little issues with the room. Not big enough to matter, but big enough to annoy me and knock it down to a 4-star rating.BUT, what they lacked in 5-star luxury they made up for in personality. The staff are phenomenal - quick to correct a mistake and they always remember your name if you're a regular. I had people saying ""Hi Archita, how are you today"" that I didn't even recognize. Insane. When you're forced to travel to Columbus, staying at this Westin makes all the difference. Plus, I started getting ridiculous upgrades, apology letters and free drinks when an upgrade wasn't available, and personalized gift baskets based on things I liked. Not all Starwoods are anywhere as meticulous as that. (Sometimes the level of gifting was inconsistent though, which made me sad :( but dude...am I really even complaining about this?) Also, who doesn't love a Westin - any Westin? Their ""heavenly"" bed and double-showerhead is enough to convince me to fork over an extra $40 (expensed to the company, of course, haha) for the stay. If you get a chance to eat at their restaurant, ORDER THE CRAB CAKES! Amazing. Yalumba is a great white wine to pair with that.I've stayed at a lot of very nice hotels before (trump, banff fairfield - gold level), so I may be biased. Although this isn't the worst, I do feel that there are some things they can improve upon. They don't give you enough coffee packs for even two people. 1 pack is not enough for 2 people to drink. Heck, even 2 packs aren't enough for hardcore french press drinkers. Every day, I have consistently not had hot water when I have wanted to either wash my face or take a shower. They did give us a nice suite upgrade which I appreciate, but I still want a hot shower when I'd like to take one! Seriously, morning and night, I've had to wait a considerable amount of time before I could even get enough hot water to wash my face. I've been going around smelly, after the gym, until the afternoon when the hot water has regenerated. Luckily no one else has to be around me right now. There is no room service menu. In the folder where they try to sell you the linens, there's an empty spot but no one has even noticed the lack of a food menu. Others are ordering room service around me yet I am doomed to take my lazy butt downstairs. haha. Their gym is shoved downstairs in the basement. Although it is small, they have a nice collection of work out equipment from several treadmills, circuit machines, dumbbells, benches, pilates balls, resistance bands, etc. Whoever cleans the gym has not realized that they are out of water. It's so frustrating to go to the water cooler after a hard workout, and it's empty. Housekeeping barely does enough. They don't even empty out the ice bucket from the water left over from the previous night's ice. When they replace towels, they don't hang them nicely like the first night, they just stack them up on top. They don't always wipe off the lacquered coffee table in the suite room. They throw the used robe on top of a chair instead of nicely hung up in the closet or bathroom. I asked for extra coffee for the room, and I was handed one extra pack for this morning's coffee. After they cleaned our room, we still had only 1 pack replenished and the one that I had to ask for. Good customer service would be where they automatically give us more than 1 pack (and not just once) after being asked. Again, these are all small things. Not deal breakers, but if we were paying, I'd be getting a refund.The most comfortable bed that I have ever slept on, beautiful bathrooms (dual-headed shower!), and a really classy looking building.  This place was everything you could expect from a hotel in Columbus.Would have given it 4 stars but I was handed a glass of champagne when I checked in.  That deserves a gold star sticker!  Oh, and at $80 a night for two people on a weekend (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank""
