http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-meridien-indianapolis-indianapolis-2,Le Meridien Indianapolis,4.5,$$,33,"I love this hotel!The location of the hotel is great--located right in the city next to St. Elmo's, which is very convenient. It's also walking distance from several other restaurants. In addition, the rooms are spotless and beautiful. They have a nice modern touch but are very warm and comfortable at the same time. Lastly, their staff is wonderful--they are extremely nice and make you feel welcome, which is something I look for when staying at a hotel. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at the Le Meridien,I will preface this by saying that downtown Indy is an odd hotel market. While Indy is a rather large downtown, it really isn't at the same time. It's a secondary hotel market, so ones expectations might not be met when comparing it to other the other Le Meridiens in major markets.Pro's:+ Location- You are smack down in the middle of downtown and steps from Circle City Mall and many restaurants. Depending on the weather, you about a 15 minute walk or short Uber ride to Mass Ave+ Decor- Updated Modern decor. Very clean and functioning.+ Bed - Comfortable+Shower head - nice and tall + Outlets - Plentiful and modernized to include USB cables+ Wifi- It works and the signal strength is good+ Staff- Front of the house staff is very friendly and helpfulCon's:  - Valet- Depending upon the time you arrive/depart and scheduled events downtown, this can take some time and a bit of a line- bed - the king beds are a bit on the shorter side, especially if you are on the taller side- Elevators - this is an older hotel. They are smaller and can only fit 1-2 people, especially with luggage. It can fell a bit claustrophobic.- Rooms - this is an older hotel, so the walls are a bit thin and room sizes varyTips: If you don't wish to valet, there are many parking lots associated with Circle City Mall that are close, if not right across from the hotel. Just remember, there are no in/out privileges when using these lots.This was my first stay at the newly branded and newly renovated Le Meridien Hotel in Indianapolis.  It was a fine experience and the staff was fantastic, but I feel the need to provide some advice as a seasoned traveler.  While the staff was warm and accommodating, there aren't enough of them.  We pulled up to the front of the hotel and waited about ten minutes before the one bellman was able to accommodate our luggage, which I unloaded and was sitting on the sidewalk in front of the hotel.  It appeared very unprofessional. The hotel itself is designed beautifully and the firm that completed the decor should be applauded.  Modern and tasteful, the Le Meridien Indianapolis interior eschews minimalism for a warm contemporary aesthetic.  The small elevators, reminiscent of boutique hotels in Europe, brought us to our small, but well appointed room.  It too was designed well, with enough room for everything so we did not have to live out of our suitcases. The hotel has rooms of different sizes, with lots of different names, so try to get one of their larger rooms.  The bathroom was a nice size and comfortable, but sliding doors on bathrooms do not shut out light or sound, diminishing any sense of privacy.  I realize it is a space issue, but still.............The bed must be new, but at least my side was rather concave.  In addition, the AC is turned off at night, and even though we were only on the 6th floor, it was hot and stuffy and I did not sleep well.  Noise carries and I heard every door on our floor close.  Afternoon naps were impossible.  Also, it would be great to have a coffee machine in the room.The restaurant and bar at the hotel, Spoke and Steele, is wonderfully trendy with innovative food and a hopping scene at the bar.  It was great fun. With a fantastic staff, great design, and a fab location, the Meridien Indianapolis has a great foundation and can emerge with five star status with just a few tweaks.  I will happily stay here again on my return to Indianapolis, an underrated travel destination.Awesome hotel! From the moment we walked in, the front desk clerk Jarrod greeted us with a smile and was very friendly and accommodating. We'd had a long, delayed flight and he made sure to get us a room even though it was still a few hours till check in time. The staff at this hotel goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. The room was spacious and clean. The bed, pillows and comforter were the most comfortable I have ever slept on! Perfect for sleeping in! Walls are thin so if you are a light sleeper ask for a room away from the elevators.Because of it's great location, gorgeous, modern decor, and friendly staff, I'm happy to dole out 4 stars for Le Meriden Indy. That being said, I think there's some room for improvement overall.Decor: Is really lovely. Super modern but warm and inviting at the same time. Lots of whites and grays. Comfort factor: My bed was super comfy, the room spotless, and the bathroom was spacious and inviting. The rooms themselves lean on the smaller side, but when I travel for work it's typically just me, so I don't require a ton of room. In Room Dining: Major fail here. The food was actually decent, but the prices were already high and tack on a 23% service charge *and* $5 delivery and your lunch is exorbitant. Staff: Everyone I encountered was friendly but I didn't experience the overwhelming helpfulness &amp; accommodation that I've read it other reviews. WiFi: Free and stable, just like it should be! Location: Great and walkable to plenty of downtown points of interest.Indy hotels are a big of an enigma to me, mostly because the cost can get extremely high if there's even a chance of a convention downtown. So, while Le Meridien is a nice hotel, I'm still up for exploring other options when I travel to town.I loved Le Meridien during my stay in Indianapolis! The staff made my experience the best due to their superior customer service. Merriam provided the best recommendations on locations to visit and places to eat with warmest smile. The hotel's location was phenomenal as it is close to Georgia St. I would highly recommend this hotel for your next visit!This hotel seems brand new from all the interiors and upgrades. My room was upgraded to a suite and I have not seen anything more modern than this hotel.Parking - you can park overnight or long term in the parking garage across the road for $22 a night.There are multiple places to eat around so no worry there. This place went out of their way for service by getting me razors from nearby CVS as they had run out of emergency stock.This hotel is located in a great location within walking distance to all of downtown Indianapolis. The remodel took this historic hotel to a modern feel with absolutely none of the old charm left. It is now ultra-modern if that is your thing, you will enjoy staying here. If you stayed here prior to the remodel and loved the historic feel, you will hate it.I have stayed in Le Meridien hotel brands and as always the service is impeccable.Summary: Fantastic hotel in the heart of Indianapolis. This is one of the nicer hotels in the area. I'd even stay here over the Westin because everything seems new.  Very clean property. Very quiet rooms. Pros: Very clean. You can tell the rooms are new. The decor is awesome. If you can get an upgrade to an executive room, the bathroom will be HUGE.  Comfortable beds and pillows. EASY access to the city. Restaurant downstairs is nice. Lots of lobby space on 2 different floors for meeting with clients/coworkers.Cons: Small property means rooms fill up fast. You can't rely on good rates at this hotel because they can fluctuate within the same week from $130 - $400+ a night.  That means I only stay here occasionally and I'd love to stay here more.  The parking is also limited, you can park under circle center for $23-$25 a night, which is much less than valet. The fitness facility could also be larger, limited space for weights means you have to wait your turn.My favorite hotel in Indianapolis! I love this small boutique hotel for several reasons. Location, location, location, it's in walking distance to Lucas Stadium, mall(connected by a skywalk), convention center, movie theatre, etc.. The rooms are modern, clean, and quiet. The restaurant, Spoke &amp; Steele has a very hip and trendy vibe, great food and drinks. The staff is very attentive, friendly. You won't be disappointed!My stay at Le Meridian was amongst the best I have ever had. The remodel was wonderfully done. We had a two king bed room, which was an unexpected surprise. Everything was clean, spacious, and pristine. The wait staff, desk clerks, and curb staff were all wonderful. Any request I made of them was exceeded, and with a smile.The bar staff was a little less attentive but that was easily overlooked when the rest of the stay was taken into account.Hoping to be lucky enough with the 2016 GenCon housing lottery system to stay here again in the future.Super attentive staff, great location, comfy bed, good room service, Illy coffee. Hotel is very small only about 10 rooms per floor. The rooms are pretty small too - like the luggage valet cart doesn't fit in closet and the king bed takes most of the room. The business traveller desk is tiny and your feet dangle as they use a bar stool style chair. The hotel is connected to a mall that has walkways to other hotels. Location is awesome, walkable to lots of restaurants and shops. All and all a decent place to rest your head on business travel. Thumbs up!Wish I could give this hotel a great review but we had to check out just 30 min after arriving.  The Hotel is small, nicely done and well located but upon arriving in our room, we were hit with strong, noxious chlorine bleach fumes.  The 2 staff members on duty were really pleasant but they seemed to be young and experienced.   After telling them about this issue, they offered us 2 other rooms but they both had similar fumes. We checked out because I have very mild asthma and was feeling quite sick.  I had a full on asthma attack the next evening which my Dr. believes is related to this experience.   No one from the hotel checked the room after we reported this and after calling to speak to the manager the next day, I  was transferred to his administrative assistants voice mail.  We checked into the Alexander which is always a great experience.I want to say 3.5 stars, but I'll round up. Hotel has a small entrance on Illinois street. Drive too fast and you'll miss it. Highly recommend that you park in the circle center garage across the street, as it is under $25 a night to park there, unless you're willing to pay $40 for valet. Upon entry, you'll notice it is an upscale hotel, and also a tiny one. Hallway is tiny, only two tiny elevators...you get it. Check in was easy, and I found out there is no club lounge, unlike other SPG properties like Sheraton around the corner. It has a fitness center, a restaurant, and direct mall access. Coffee is complimentary, and the green choice sign is a thin sheet of paper under the Sony alarm clock. Modern decor throughout inside the room. They're obsessed with maps and coordinates here. Beautiful wood on the cabinets, and awesome Samsung smart TV on the wall. Soft towels and tissue paper in the bathroom. USB wall outlets. Overall cosmetically beautiful property, just missing the amenities I would normally get from the Westin and Sheraton.Walk-around: <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhaYwiA4a13Q&amp;s=2bad912d5001a79e8b0ecce6048ea9ed83b0227d4e7aa7a42fa0514b93f73559"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=haYw...</a>Beautiful place and great location. The rooms are very nice and modern. Large bathroom with big mirrors. Bar in the lobby as well.Disappointing. While I had never heard of this hotel chain, I assumed that as it took over the Canterbury Hotel, it would compete as one of the best in the downtown area. Not so....While the Canterbury was stuffy, I had stayed in their remodeled rooms and they were awesome. Le Meridien came in and dropped the hotel by 2 stars with cheap redesigns of lobby and room. Would not recommend. Poor service in restaurant and poor quality of room service.Rooms had an excellent design. I should have taken photos for home design ideas.  Staff were helpful and always there when needed. Didn't try the bath products. Quality of the hairdryer could be upgraded. Food and beverage were excellent. Had a lunch, breakfast and snack there (all-day meeting).Wow! Very impressed by this little gem in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. We stopped here on our way north just for the evening. Tim at the front desk greeted us and checked us in quickly. We had a corner room on the 7th floor with a king bed. So so clean, modern finishes and couldn't be more inviting. TV mounted on the wall, plenty of lighting options, we could've stayed in the room all evening. The next morning I worked in the lobby a bit. Amazing space down there. Just the right amount of people, but not too distracting. Love love love this place, I will be back!Hail to Le Meridian! We went to see Casablanca at the Indianapolis Symphony and decided to eat dinner at Spoke &amp; Steel. I made the reservation and thought I would check rates for Le Meridian for the night. The rates were very reasonable and the rooms are very nice. However,what stands out the most is the staff. I truly have nothing but exceptional things to say for ALL of them - from the valet to the front desk. Just a note, Tim, who checked us in and checked us out was so great. It's easy to walk into a hotel as nice and expertly decorated as Le Meridian and feel a pretentious air but Tim made us feel right at home.Complimentary coffee in the lobby when we checked out - what a nice treat!!Stayed at this hotel for a weekend while my buddy was proposing to his girlfriend at the omni hotel.  When I left I was thinking about how perfect the hotel was and there's a lot of reasons to back that up. 1. I needed a car wash and didn't know where to go because my phone was dead and I couldn't use the gps, soooo the staff at the front desk printed directions for me. Nice. 2. This hotel is pet friendly, and I have a large english bulldog. 3. Every time I entered the building there was someone there to open the doors for me. 4. I needed to go to the grocery store in a hurry, one of the guys in the front called a cab that he knew by name for me and sent me to the nearest grocery store. 5. Everyone there was very friendly. They all had smiles on their faces and made the best of the day. I remember one person trying to make me laugh. (It worked).6. The rooms were neat, clean and organized. All of these things would definitely make this hotel my default when I'm in Indianapolis. But as my girlfriend pointed out, when she flipped her pillow to the other side overnight she noticed a cloudy black stain on the other side. She checked my pillow in the morning and it was the same. We had a friend staying a couple of rooms down the hall and the same was for their pillows. All I'm saying is every thing about this place is perfect except for those pillows.","Friendly staff! Very modern style. The bar does barrel aged cocktails. Didn't get a chance to try any but will on next visit. We parked in the mall lot for $22 for 24 hours. The mall connects to hotel. Everything you could want to do is in walking distance. We walked to slippery noodle and heard 2 great blues bands! Had take out sushi from place across the street. It was gross. The bed was very comfortable for husband who likes a firm mattress and myself who likes a soft fluffy one. That was some kind of magic!What great service from the front desk staff on in.Great location great bar.I love Hotel Tonight.The highlight was the person who checked me in was amazing - great job ZenobiaThis is a four star hotel?Is that why I called for room service three times to no avail so I had to come downstairs and order take out?Or is it because I called valet and got no answer when I wanted to take out my car?Or is it because they mis charged our acct and no one is available to talk to us about it?Are hotels a part of the hospitality industry?I have had better service at a holiday inn.My wife and I will check into the Alexander next time.On a recent weekend getaway, I booked a room at Le Meridien. The price was extremely reasonable for a last minute reservation and it's great location downtown Indy. I booked a deluxe room after being told it would include a better view of the city. Once in the room, the view included the top of a parking garage with a small glimpse of a church steeple. I expected the room to be a little more spacious but the bathroom was amazing and somewhat made up for the small feel.From the beginning to the end of our stay, the guys at the curb were the highlight to the stay. They were very friendly and attentive...especially Keith. I appreciated being walked to the curb under an umbrella while getting into our cab for dinner (unfortunately it was raining). We were also disappointed when we chose to order morning coffee via room service instead of making the coffee in the room. When it was delivered, it came on a tray with the coffee being in a stainless pot, creamer provided in stainless creamer pitchers but the provided cups were paper. I understand if the intention was to provide us a way to take our coffee to-go but if we invested the time &amp; money into room service, it would have been nice to have actual coffee cups. While it seems like a trival complaint, we felt that with the hotel setting a ""high-end"" tone, it was a missed service opportunity/presentation.Should I have the need to stay in downtown Indy again, I would stay here again but would not seek it out as a destination stay.Couldn't have been better, beautiful renovation, super comfortable beds, great showers.  Breakfast and room service were perfectThis hotel was beautiful on the inside and extremely well located. The bellhop Chaz made it even more worth the trip to this hotel and absolutely worth coming back for sure. He was extremely friendly, a wealth of information and he made our trip over the top enjoyable with his total orientation to service. The management at the hotel are obviously totally on top of it as further demonstrated by the beautiful artwork in the rooms and the overall feel of the hotel. Thanks for the great stay.The staff has been awesome. Tonight I was dying for some chocolate and everything around the hotel was closed. After asking if they had anything made of or covered in chocolate they offered to make us a batch of chocolate chip cookies. At 11pm they went out of their way to fulfill a somewhat unreasonable request. This was typical of the service. The bar staff is also a great group. Good drinks and a upbeat attitude. Had dinner here as well and the food and service did not disappoint. On top of all of it the rooms are clean, modern, and a pleasure to come back to after a long work day.Clean bathroom, attentive and friendly staff and good climate control. Very quiet on the 10th floor and a wonderful shower. No in room coffee maker but they bring you up complimentary tea and coffee if you ask. Updated and elegant but my room was tiny, but it felt cozy. Very nice stay and close to my location if business.Great hotel! Best shower of any hotel I've stayed at in Indy. Trendy but classic decor, comfortable beds, and very quiet. A bit more expensive (+$50/night) but well worth it. I'll be staying here on my monthly trips.In town for one night. When they found out it was my wife's birthday they upgraded us to a suite. The room was fantastic. The remodel was spot on. Can't think of one thing that was not up to par. Highly recommend.Rooms are very nice and brand new.  Windows have two blackout blinds with dark curtains too.  Virtually no light comes in the room in the morning.  The bathrooms are huge and well accompanied. The employees are still working out the kinks since it just opened (this week), but all the staff was very nice and positive even if they were still a bit rusty on how things should operate at the hotel.  The specialty drinks in the bar are made with care and top shelf.  I'd definitely stay here again especially if attending an event at Lucas Oil Field.Nice hotel, great location, and superb service!  We're big fans of Starwood and Le Meridien Indy didn't disappoint!  Front desk staff was very pleasant and one employee even went as far as running to his apartment to get collar stays for my husband in a pinch.  Great experience!Room service breakfast menu portions are small and in room coffee maker was not adequate. Staff was absolutely wonderful. Room is modern and very cosy. We got the standard room and were very happy. Valet parking is a bit costly BUT it included in&amp;out which the self parking did not include.",,,,"['love', 'hotel', 'location', 'hotel', 'great', 'located', 'right', 'city', 'next', 'convenient',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-nestle-inn-indianapolis,The Nestle Inn,4.5,$$,25,"This review is for a cooking class I attended; I didn't stay overnight, but will definitely be keeping The Nestle Inn in mind the next time someone asks about lodging options downtown!  The theme of the class was the Foods of New Orleans; the menu included crawfish etouffee, shrimp po boys, and beignets.  The experience was very much like hanging out in a friend's kitchen (a friend who is a great cook mind you...), chatting with them while they cook, and pitching in as needed; in other words, very relaxed and informal!   Leesa, the owner was a great host, and had the fun task of keeping up with the dishes!  Chef Anna was a great instructor, and selected recipes that I really feel like are realistic for all of us to make at home!  We learned a lot about cooking techniques, and came away with some new skills and great recipes!   The class ends with eating of course!  We were able to enjoy the creations in the dining room of the Inn; the tables were decorated for Mardi Gras which was a nice touch!   All of the dishes were delicious!  I can't wait to try the recipes out at home!First things first. This place is a bundle of cozy, home-away-from-home, cuteness. The bed! The pillows! The microfiber comforter! This place is well equipped to deliver a comfy-night's beauty rest. Bonus perks that made me sleep like a baby in my own bed? My room was stocked with a fan and space heater. As a picky sleeper who likes to have white noise when I sleep, the small fan was perfect. A beautiful and well cared for victorian home, complete with cast iron stained glass windows - incredibly beautiful, especially in the morning light. I was in room number one, which can be a little noisy when other guests are returning at night and a again in the morning when guests are going up and down the stairs. If you plan to sleep in I recommend opting for one of the bedrooms on the upper floor.A hidden gem on Mass Ave. Intimate, inviting, and comfortable. Took part in a cooking class during our stay. Highly recommend it. Love the self check in process.Welcome to planet cute. Where the rooms are modern rustic but cozy. Where the WiFi is stable. Where butter bars and biscotti lie for your snacking. Where dreams are made - because the beds are so comfortable. I only enjoyed The Nestle Inn for 10-12 hours, but those hours were well spent enjoying the spoils of this adorable bed and breakfast. Because I was super busy flying into Indy, working and hanging with my colleagues, I didn't get a chance to check in until almost midnight, but with an advance head's up to Leesa I was able to walk right in and plop into my bed within minutes. I didn't get a chance to redeem my breakfast voucher at Henry's, but I've been there many a time and can say it's a great place. Next time I'm in Indy and looking for a heavy dose of cute, I'd definitely stay at Nestle Inn again!This was my fourth visit to the inn. Leesa is wonderful and very welcoming. The inn is very clean, comfortable and quiet. I will be returning again next year!We had a great stay here last night! We loved the perfect location and Leesa was super welcoming. She showed us around the house, gave great recommendations for local spots, and her butter bars are awesome. Our room was comfy and clean. The only thing we'd change was the lack of water pressure in the shower.... That was a major downer. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and recommend it!Very surprise by so many good reviews when. I've always though stone soup inn is way better. One bed and breakfast usually have food in the mourning for u not this place u have to go somewhere else to get food wow that's why I gave it a one star and no tubs in the room boring.This is my ""go to place"" when I need time to think, create and rest. Love the amenities, location and aesthetics.I have to thank yelp for helping me discover this lil gem! I was planning my cross country road trip and my first stop was Indianapolis. I am SO happy I booked with Nestle Inn... first reason being I was traveling cross country alone and I wanted a comfortable, safe spot my first night. This place lived up to every thing that is written about it. I chose the self check in, as I was unsure of what time I would arrive, but I winded up arriving around 5pm. As I pulled up one of the inn keepers was gardening, which I loved. Check in was smoothe and easy. My room was on the first floor (the only room on the first floor, which I loved) I was able to see my car parked right outside my room. Everything was comfy, cozy, chic', rustic, and a true homey feel. The following morning for breakfast, we got yogurt cups, and fresh fruit, baked oatmeal, and scrambled eggs....I had to leave to get on the road, so not sure if more was served...but everything was yummy and so well worth it...for my first stay at a  bed and breakfast, this was quite a a delight! I would totally recommend staying here to anyone passing through Indy!I just got back from a quick overnight trip to Indianapolis, my first time there. The Nestle Inn was exactly what I wanted and for a price that was more reasonable than the downtown hotels. Located in the hear of the Mass Ave theater &amp; arts district, it is just one short block to theaters, shopping, bars, restaurants and only a few feet to the coffee shop next door. I went with a girlfriend so we stayed in the suite which had a king bed plus a daybed in the sitting room. I've only stayed at a couple of B&amp;Bs before, but I've tried to find them with 2 beds in a room before and it is rare...and the few times I did the prices were way too high. The Nestle in has great prices, lots of space in the suite and in the several public sitting areas. With 5 rooms (and a 6th on the way) and the owners living in the carriage house behind the Inn, it really did feel like we were coming home after an evening on Mass Ave. We barely saw anyone else during our short stay (Sunday afternoon to Monday morning) but everyone we met was very friendly. The owner, Leesa, was friendly and warm, but also quietly disappeared to give you privacy when you weren't needing her for something. We didn't get the chance to try out the weekend breakfast...what a shame. It sounded really good. That said, we liked having a $10 voucher for breakfast...or anything we wanted...at the coffee shop next door. I ate a full breakfast, but my friend wasn't hungry and grabbed a sandwich to go for lunch. As a relative novice at B&amp;Bs (this was my 3rd one), this was my very best experience to date. I would highly recommend Nestle Inn for business travelers (free wifi everywhere, easy weekday breakfast on your schedule), group things (retreats, girls weekend, family vacations), couples or friends. If you've never stayed at a B&amp;B and are a tad uncomfortable about the idea...the Nestle Inn will win you over!I've written a full post with pictures, more details and a video interview of Leesa on my website, Future Expat. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffutureexpat.com%2F2013%2F02%2Findianapolis-road-trip-mass-ave-and-nestle-inn%2F&amp;s=1b6be23fc4c9cbb3ae3a064814bf00ce757102e402496db20336e1deca9b241f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">futureexpat.com/2013/02/...</a>I just left Nestle Inn and I miss it already!Admittedly I LOVE the idea of bed and breakfasts but in practice I've rarely found ones that I love. I guess despite the fact that I love things low key, quaint and cozy when it comes to my lodging I love a pimped out hotel. Nestle Inn, however, never once had me longing for a hot tub, crazy mood lighting, or a rooftop bar. And here's why:+ Free wifi that WORKS! I had no trouble working or surfing.+ Comfy beds. I slept like a dream both nights.+ Complimentary soft drinks and water in the common area, plus hot tea, coffee and a variety of sweet treats left out (biscotti and the amaaaazing butter bars that I know I'll be jonesing for soon).+ Spacious rooms with a good sized bathroom attached. + A wonderful proprietor. Lisa was unbelievably nice! + Lovely decor. Very cozy, very rustic, but not over the top. I've been to B&amp;Bs where it looks like Laura Ashley had a dozen babies and they all threw up all over the room. This is tasteful, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. It's holiday time and the decor was really lovely. Lots of fresh greenery and pretty things.+ Walking distance to awesome things downtown. It was terribly cold while I was there so I didn't do that (uber was my friend) but it's a great location.+ The room comes stocked with extra blankets and mine had a small heater. If you like to get extra snuggly.A few things worth noting so you'e prepared: Check in is 4-6pm. That's the time you can meet with Leesa in person. However, if you need to make other arrangements she is more than happy to work it out. Breakfast during the week is presented via a voucher next door to Henry's a cafe with breakfast sandwiches and the like. No in-room thermostats. My room was a little drafty but with all the extra blankets and the heater I felt roasty toasty. Not a problem at all. Not sure when I'll be back to Indy but the prospect of another stay at Nestle has me very excited!What a sweet find! Located in the heart of trendy Mass Ave, this little gem provides everything of home and then some! The Nestle Inn is so unusual in that it blends antiques and modern decor to create a one-of-a-kind getaway.  We enjoyed #6, the King Suite- this would be a fantastic room for a wedding couple or those celebrating an anniversary.  Breakfast is right next door at Henry's- schlurp, schlurp and yum!Plan a surprise getaway- your honey will LOVE it..... Mine did!:)My wife and I stayed here July 22, 2012.  Perfect for a Lyle Lovett concert at the Murat Theater.This place is gorgeous, very friendly greeting, beautiful woodwork in a nicely furnished old home.  The Air conditioning was working well on a 96 degree night, the cable TV and wireless internet were flawless, the parking is easy, the neighborhood is nice.  We will always recommend this place for Murat Theater events and anything else in Indianapolis.Coffee, biscotti, soft drinks, all available and complimentary.(By the way, we had an excellent meal at the Bosphorus (Turkish) Restaurant 1.7 miles south of the Nestle Inn.)My husband surprised me with a honeymoon in Chicago with a stop at The Nestle Inn in Indy on our way. Leesa greeted us with a warm welcome and recommended fun stops along Mass Ave. The rooms were incredibly clean and had wonderful details included like robes and makeup remover. We loved it and hope to be back one day! Thanks, Leesa!Leesa immediately greeted us warmly and gave us a tour of the house. She is friendly and inviting. We wanted an alternative to the chain hotels while we visited Indy for the 500 and Nestle Inn was perfect! Beautiful accommodations and one block from Mass Ave. No driving required to have a wonderful evening out in Indy. Nestle is only 6 miles from the speedway too. See you next May for the next race!!Just had a very pleasant stay.  Was on the road and wanted a nice place to stop and found good reviews for the Nestle Inn.  I was able to get a room and they accommodated a slightly late arrival and there were baked goods waiting to welcome us.  It was in a pleasant urban neighborhood in walking distance of fun restaurants. The free breakfast was for the coffee shop next door and the $10 per person voucher gets a very nice breakfast.  The room was charming but not cutesy and very clean.  There was free parking in the lot next door (though we had to ask because it wasn't clear from the signs if we could park there.). The only critique besides the parking ambiguity was the fact that they didn't provide conditioner, just shampoo.  I would still come back again.We had the joy of staying here during the best 4 days of the year! Well.. For gaming at least. We got the newly remodeled top room. And what a wonderful resting spot to rejuvenate between sessions. The full kitchen is a huge added bonus as well.We won a raffle and got a free overnight at Nestle Inn. It was so relaxing, not having our toddler with us, and the location is absolutely wonderful-close to all the greatness of Mass Ave &amp; the circle. We need to book a room for 4th of July, as it gives a prime view of fireworks from the porch. Leesa was absolutely friendly &amp; warm, and there were always little bites of deliciousness laying out for guests, along with beverages. We were treated to 2 $10 vouchers for Henry's next door the following morning, which made our send off even better. Little bits of oddity that may be handy to know: While there were soap &amp; shampoo, there's no sample toothpaste or mouthwash. I assumed there would be and left some at home. Also, the house is old; floors creak. NBD to me, but some people may not be used to older wood floors. The owner was very accommodating with our food storage and my breastmilk storage, which is awesome. Also, there are hdmi ports on the tv, so yes, you can hook your video game consoles up to it. There was no DVD player in the room, so we ran home to check on the dog &amp; grabbed the ps3 and a netflix we hadn't watched yet &amp; had a grand ol' time when we settled in for the evening. Thanks for a great night, Leesa, &amp; we hope to return soon!Spent our anniversary here - close to dining, shopping, biking on the Cultural Trail, and everything is within walking distance.  Inn and room were perfect, and Sunday morning breakfast was delicious.  The additional ""anniversary package"" of champagne and chocolates made the stay even more special.My husband and I stayed at the Nestle Inn for one night, while celebrating our wedding anniversary. It's described as an 'Urban B &amp; B' which simply means it is located in the heart of downtown Indy's dining/shopping district. So the location is prime. It was a 2 minute walk to dinner.The B&amp;B itself is completely charming...the home is well preserved, clean and nicely furnished. Our room was quite big, with a nice TV and very comfy bed. Everything was in perfect working condition. Sometimes I worry about old homes like that, but you could tell they keep everything updated and well maintained. The owners are just good people, and cover every last detail. You're never without a nice cup of coffee/tea/water or a little treat. And breakfast was awesome...Leesa is an amazing chef. Homemade scones, fresh fruit, waffles, iced coffee, and more. I didn't want to leave haha.We really enjoyed our stay here and would go back. Great alternative to a hotel.","This place is a gem and I wanna kiss its face!  The building has great historic attitude and the rooms are comfortably and tastefully furnished.  I love the refreshment bar: coffee, tea, sodas, bottled water.  Our room (3) on the second floor has big windows with a great view of the street, high ceilings, and a spacious bath.  Our stay was a weeknight, so we had complementary breakfast at the coffee shop next door, some light fare and delicious coffee while enjoying the scene from patio/sidewalk seating.  We didn't meet Rob, but Leesa proved welcoming and accommodating, helpful but not too helpful.  They also make informed restaurant recommendations.  Parking is provided.  You really can't beat this place!  We will definitely be back.This place is great! Rated #1 Bed &amp; Breakfast in Indianapolis, and it certainly has earned it. Beautiful, large and comfortable rooms, extremely friendly hostess, an amazing breakfast, and low price. The only downside was trying to find street parking on the busy Saturday night we stayed there, but a couple times circling the block wasn't too bad. I'll definitely stay here again!My husband and I, who run two guesthouses/B&amp;B's in Dayton, had come to Indy for a night away in October and stayed at a B&amp;B in the old north neighborhood, but had taken a taxi to the Mass Ave. Arts and Entertainment district to got to a jazz club called the Chatterbox. We had such fun at the club, and wished we had more time to explore Mass Ave., so when we were seeking lodging for the Indy Mini, we looked for lodging in the Mass Ave. area and found Nestle Inn, and we're so glad we did.  Nights that we can pull away from our own properties are few and far between, so this was a special treat. Clean, hospitible, and inviting. Loved the fact that there was a little fan as well as a little heater for our use--it was an unseasonably cold 45 degrees that day, and after standing out in the cold (or running in the cold, in my husband's case) it was nice to have the little heater to help take the chill off--the Inn was kept warm enough, it was just the nature of our day downtown that made us cold.Though we love going to B&amp;B's when we aren't operating our own, we aren't early risers, so anytime we don't have to be at a breakfast table by 8:30am on a Sunday/vacation day, it's a good thing. Loved the way Nestle Inn handles breakfast. They have a chalkboard with each room number on it, and you choose a breakfast time from 8 to 9:30am (I was ready to put 9:30am, but my husband wanted to be a little more moderate in our time selection, so we compromised with 9:15am ;-) The set-up of the breakfast room was great--individual tables, but close enough to be able to chat with other guests. Also liked the way breakfast was served. A dish of tropical fruit was brought to each of us at the start. Then a serving plate of almond streudel and a serving plate of stuffed french toast, with a cup of fresh strawberries on the side was brought for us to enjoy. Sure wish the weather would have been warmer so we could have enjoyed the darling little front porch, but we'll save that for next time--and we are confident there will be a next time at Nestle Inn. Steve, Barb and Ty--you've got a great thing going. Congrats on 10 years in the biz!Nicely located for business or pleasure. An interesting building with beautifully appointed rooms. The owner was very nice and helpful. A must stay!My sister and I stayed at the Nestle Inn during a quick trip to Indy for a girls weekend.  The inn is adorable, very homey feeling.  It's located right off Mass Ave, which has a lot of local shopping, restaurants and galleries.  It's also not a far walk from Circle Center if you want to do more shopping (which we did).The owners were very knowledgeable of the area and had recommendations for what do, where to eat, etc.  Breakfast is served from 7-9:30 and you just sign up for a time that works for you.  The food was amazing - Kentucky Hot Brown strata with turkey bacon, cinnamon scones, fresh fruit, coffee and juice.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-indianapolis-airport-indianapolis,Radisson Hotel Indianapolis Airport,2.5,$$,35,"The staff is fantastic. From the gentleman who picked us up and brought our luggage to our room, the friendly dining room staff, and housekeeper who tracked me down and hand delivered the things my kid hid around the room. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is falling apart. Like literally, the handle of the bath faucet fell off and the water ran all night. The tub had mildew and grime and was missing the drain plug. The sink faucet is set to the opposite temperature. The wifi was painfully slow. But the front desk clerk was very willing to get everything fixed asap. In conclusion, the property has seen better days, but the hard working crew is doing their very best to make your stay as pleasant as possible.My star rating would change if it was a 1 star hotel. Since they claim this is a 3 and was charged 130 a night, I will treat the review how I would expect it to be. Paint chipping, dirty carpet, old mushy beds, long hairs found in the sheets and on the desk, 1/2 a toilet paper roll, dirty and disgusting air vents, and AWFUL plumbing.The shower head was un-caulked off the wall and had the worst pressure.  The faucet handles weren't connected correctly and didn't have hot water.I would give the receptionists 3/5.  Some were nice, however some were very unprofessional looking and acting.Can you fix the HUGE potholes in your parking lot? there's about 5 of them that are 3 feet long and 1/2 ft deep.Only reason why I booked the hotel is because of convenience to the airport and not having to pay a downtown price.  You would be better off paying 60-90 dollars @ a motel 6 , red roof in, or hotel 8.Haven't stayed at a Radisson chain ever in my life. Now I know what to avoid.If half a star was an option, it would have been more accurate. Checked in at 3:00, and there were several desk clerks sitting around who saw me, but opted to ignore me anyway. Upon checking in, I was informed that since my room was non-smoking, if they smell smoke in the room, I will be charged $250. I don't smoke and I think it's subjective on weather it not ""they"" can smell smoke upon checking out. It's not even the message, but the delivery. It's just obvious that they don't care. I got to the room, and both the key cards were inactive. After getting new ones, I saw that the room has 2 double beds and not the king I asked for. I call the same clerk and I told her I asked for a king. She said, ""Come downstairs."" Went down to be told that since I booked it online, I get whatever room they have available. You couldn't have told me that over the phone? Pros: available shuttle to the airport which leaves every hour. Breakfast in the AM (didn't try it since I left at 3:00AM)Cons: Room had peeling paint, crispy blankets, sticky carpet and mold between the tiles in the bathroom.If you have other options, don't stay here!There is just not really anything nice to say about this hotel..... They obviously do not take pride in their property. We had stains on our comforters, heater was broken,  moved rooms and had stains on comforters. Next to no hot water in shower, old dirty carpet throughout hotel, ceilings were dirty, etc.... I could go on and on but this place needs to close and renovate, you really will be glad to pass this place up.... And the beds are the worst I have ever slept on in a hotel. I will suggest finding somewhere else to stay, but on a good note, the staff was nice and friendly at the bar and front desk, but the level of problems at this property is beyond their control.This place is an unmitigated disaster. I'm on the road just about every week of the year, so it takes a lot to qualify for my personal All-Time Worst list. The Radisson is truly a special-kind-of-awful worthy of this dubious distinction. Water is the Earth's most abundant resource, yet mastery of it seems to have baffled this decrepit hole. I was warned of plumbing issues upon check-in. Some work had apparently been done recently, and I was told to 'run the water for a bit' and possibly expect sediment from the faucet. While the water did run eventually after sputtering a bit, it was not until the following morning that I discovered a second issue - a complete lack of hot water. Upon complaining I was told that no other room had this problem (obviously impossible unless each one of the several hundred rooms has a dedicated self-contained hot water supply) but was invited to shower in another room. As thrilled as I was about the prospect of packing my things up and switching rooms while soaking wet with frigid water at 6 in the morning, I politely declined the gracious offer. Overall the place is tired and looks beat up. The tell tale signs abound - battered furniture, stained carpet, frayed drapes etc.The staff was just okay. The person who checked me in was friendly, but the person I spoke to the following morning about aforementioned plumbing issue was not particularly helpful. I also wasn't thrilled about getting a call at 6:20 expediting me because the 6:30 shuttle was leaving. Silly me for inferring the 6:30 shuttle left at 6:30 and not some earlier time. Maybe the driver is a mover and shaker that had other places to be.Avoid staying here at all costsAdvice to hotel manager responding to all negative reviews: Instead of spending time on Yelp responding to negative reviews, FIX THIS EYESORE and save us all the timeConvenient to the airport. But it needs some upgrades. The staff was all very friendly. The hotel is tired, needs paint and carpet. Beds were very worn and broken down mattress. The breakfast was ok but again they need some attention to details. The bread sitting next to the toaster is larger than the toaster would accommodate.Simple attention to details are important. Another example. The yogurt had spoons sitting right beside them, but the spoons were soup spoons and would not go into the yogurt container. The GM of this property is not looking at his domain.  Shows he/she doesn't care about the product.We stay at a lot of hotels soccer and this ranks as one of the worst! I called ahead of time to request a quiet area, like I do at every hotel(never with any problems). My room is right outside the elevator! The front desk lady was simply annoyed by me.Nothing starts your day then a nice shower... Not here! They must have found the worst possible shower heads ever made!Stayed here because we had an early flight the next day.  I want to start off by saying that the staff were incredible and quite frankly the only reason we didn't leave.  The room wasn't bad, only a little dated.  The reason this gets only 2 stars is the smell.  The hallway and room were permeated with a burnt-food smell that lasted the entire time we were there.  It was an awful smell that was not easy to get used to.  We will never stay here again.Updating based on Mgmt response.Management responded to my complaint.  They explained the issue and said they fixed it.  We will consider the Radisson the next time we're in Indy.  Thank you for your response.Stay here if you don't want to sleep at night because air keeps leaking and every few hours you have to fill the mattress again.Called the service desk and they said yeah these mattresses are getting old!Struggles all night and then next morning remote won't work either may be battery died!Went for a relatives wedding and the reception/brunch were wonderful. The lobby was also very attractive and there was ample parking.The rooms were dirty. The sleep number beds did not work. The vent in the shower didn't work. Despite having three people in the room for three days, each day we only had enough towels for two people. And finally, we had a very negative experience where despite numerous attempts and calls to the front desk, our room was not cleaned/serviced. The staff was less than helpful and it was terrible to feel like an inconvenience as a guest when asking for clean towels. I was also underwhelmed with the response from the GM, who gave me a half-hearted apology, blamed their Hispanic employees, and asked us to give them a second chance. No thanks.We booked two rooms . One with two double beds and another with one king sized bed. I booked this hotel quickly without reading reviews ..  I was busy , the price was satisfiable  . $69.00 for EACH rooms .  Eventually I did research this hotel.  Check -in date I was telling everyone not to expect too much , apologizing in advance. Upon arrival , everyone in the car was pleasantly surprised . The lobby , had a very ""royal"" feel . Upon booking the king bed wasn't promised as noted online . But the staff actually upgraded the room to suite status! In the lobby there is a visible lounge area and bar, which was strangely unappealing to me . (But the bartender was exceedingly attractive) I checked out both rooms  out of curiosity . The suite was impressive, wooden wardrobe , mini living room with a Nice flat screen and of course a huge bed . The double standard room did not have a microwave . Which actually didn't bother me . The bathrooms were also nice , granite countertops in both rooms . You could change the shower pressure . NO fan BUT the shower curtains had sheer overlay up top for airflow. I ended up eating at the bar and the portions were huge and delicious , I thought the prices for the food and alcohol was reasonable . A meal , 2 to 3 drinks 25.00 + tip . Many people complained about the noise ? I heard nothing from anyone or anything out there and I'm moderate sleeper . I WOULD DEFIANTLY stay here again !! Amazing value .I have been staying at this hotel for a year now. I get the crew rate which is the best out of all the hotels in the area. Rooms are ok and food is decent but the reason for 3 stars in the transportation service. I am not exaggerating when I say that everytime I call for the shuttle I wait at least 30 minutes. Either I ""just missed it"" or ""they can't wait 5 minutes for you because they'll be towed away."" While waiting, I will see every other hotel shuttle pass me by, some of these waiting 10+ minutes for passengers with absolutely no police intervention. Perhaps it makes sense to wait a little longer to make sure you don't leave people behind and waste time &amp; fuel running back for that one person?! This is the only hotel I have seen that doesn't have some type of communication between desk &amp; driver. My advice, call as soon as you get off the place and give them your number to ensure they don't leave you behind in case you're a little slow.I normally don't write reviews for hotels, but my experience here was so bad, I have to remind myself not to stay here in the future, and let others know.  It's old and run down- there's a good reason it's cheap.It was about 105 degrees outside that day, and the first room I checked into was piping warm, steaming, humid air into the very hot 80 degree room- I started sweating even more when I walked into the hotel room.  I went over to the heating/AC unit, and it was this really old, grey push button, non-functioning AC unit.  I asked to switch rooms and ended up in a room a few doors down, and it was a little better, but again, the AC unit was old (not as old as the other one) and I put the unit to 68 degrees, and it never cooled below 78.  I sweated throughout the night, and the unit was put on ""auto"" but the whole thing never shut off, instead it creaked, cranked, and was so loud I couldn't sleep well.Thank goodness my flight was at 7am in the morning as I left the room as quickly as I could.  Go elsewhere, it's worth it even to pay $20-$30 extra.Love this place. From the lobby to the room, it's obviously a nice hotel. Very close to the airport with a free shuttle, staff was wonderful, and they had some fruit and packaged breakfast items to go for free, even at 4:30 AM. My only regret is that this flight is so early!I travel for a living and stay in many hotels.  I've read the reviews on this hotel and agree with some of the complaints.  The rooms are slightly outdated but my room was clean and the carpet appeared to be new.  The bedding was clean and comfortable. I'd like to also add that the folks at the front desk were outstanding and very friendly.  Not the finest hotel I've stayed at but certainly not the worst.  For a short layover, probably a good choice.  Longer layovers; you need to get something downtown.  Indy is a great city and there are some very nice hotels downtown.Stayed here for 6 days on business during the beginning of May, and my observations were pretty much in sync with many reviewers here. The rooms are slightly outdated but my room was clean and the carpet appeared to be new. We were in a room that had been recently renovated. The paint job (burgundy color) was pretty sloppy, with paint drops on the air conditioner and other places.  The sleep number bed did not work properly...no display, but it was adjustable and provided good sleep. Bedding was clean and comfortable. Housekeeping was very inconsistent, one day while my wife was still in the room resting on the bed, she woke up to the door being wide open. Other days the room was serviced early, but one day it was still unmade at 5pm.  The elevators are old, creaky and scary.  One did not work the entire stay, and the other was an accident waiting to happen.I'd like to also add that the folks at the front desk were outstanding and very friendly. Nicer selection of tv channels than most hotels and free internet.This is a perfect hotel to stay in for the Indianapolis airport, especially if you can get a good price. They were very friendly, had great food (breakfast), were very accommodating with late checkout, and provided a free shuttle to the airport. The bathroom included separate conditioner and a nice blow dryer. The housekeepers even gave me body wash upon request. The only negative I experienced was the noise (I could hear my neighbors), but you probably wouldn't have a problem at all if you were really tired.This weekend was by far the worst hotel experience,  ever.  Beds were so old that I had to sleep in the middle of a sleep number bed, otherwise I would have rolled onto the floor.  Party of 10 for dinner.  Waitress copped the worst attitude with a mother of a small child.   We tried to continue placing our order, to no avail.  We walked out.  Party of two from our group went back for a second try.  The service was non-existent,  and left no tip.  Waitress added her own tip onto the credit card charge.  Illegal...  the air conditioning unit rattled on and off all night.  Management needs to know what type of losers they are hiring!  Get a clue, Radisson.   Will NEVER stay at one again.This rooms at this hotel are dirty and run down. The pipe that goes from the wall to the shower head moves freely in and out of the wall. The sleep number needs are hard to use or get comfortable in. Your must hold the inflate/deflate button and once you get it set it's still uncomfortable.  The vent in the bathroom had rust and mildew inside of it.  The only saving grace was that the front counter staff was nice.  I wouldn't go back to this hotel.I should have read the reviews. It is very cold outside and there is no insulation around the heating unit. Freezing air comes thru when the heating is off. I don't like sleeping with the heat on do I have two comforters and the extra blanket on. Maintenance helped me stiff pillows all around the heating unit.   Very funky place. The people are nice but this place should be razed and rebuilt.","The Good:-Close to the Airport (see also ""The Bad"")-Friendly Staff-Free Airport ShuttleThe Bad:-Run down: Yikes. This hotel is long over due for a remodel. The rooms are stark (plain white walls, no decoration) and the furniture is worn and dated (no HD TV here, just old CRT TVs that are at least 12 years old). The elevators are old, creaky and scary and the hallways had leaky ceilings.-Uncomfortable Beds: When I walked in and saw this hotel had ""Sleep Number Beds"" I thought that was pretty cool. However, this hotel doesn't seem to take maintenance seriously as my bed was broken. It was broken in the ""softest"" position which felt like sleeping on a deflated bed. I switched rooms for the second night, and the non-Sleep Number Bed was better.-Lousy Restaurant. I had breakfast here twice and both experiences were quite unimpressive. Food was usually served luke warm and prices somewhat spendy for what you receive. The service was laughable. My colleagues never got exactly what they ordered even after things being sent back multiple times.-Expensive. $177/night (with the 17% of taxes). I have stayed at Super 8 Motels nicer than this Radisson for $89/night.-Slow Internet. Good luck trying to watch a YouTube video.-Being close to the airport is noisy. Starting around 6 AM you will hear planes take off every few minutes. Not ideal.If looking for a place to stay near IND, avoid the Radisson.Don't do it.  As many other reviewers pointed out this hotel is in serious need of a renovation.  We came in for the Indy 500 and we expected it to be busy (which it was) but the service was mediocre the food in the restaurant was terrible (pricey and down right nasty) and the condition of the hotel was poor.  Only one elevator worked the entire time we were there and the bathroom in our room looked like it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned since the Nixon administration.Been staying here because of company moving my job to the Indy area..  I have had great service and terrible service. Room is always cleaned and I've never had a dirty room.  My only problem has been with one rude room service person. Only saw them once and havnt used room service sence.Stayed here for three nights during an event that took over the place.  The rooms are in dire need of remodeling as it's a little rough around the edges.  The lobby and common areas are quite nice though.  They have a very nice bar.  Elevators could use some modernization and kept breaking down unfortunately, but they probably got more use that weekend than the past several years put together.  Two stars for the facility but an extra star for a wonderful staff who were always helpful and attentive.Well this is not the greatest hotel , but it is cheap and they have a free van ride to the hotel and then back to the airport.    The rooms are clean but, a bit on the old side.We had dinner in the hotel restaurant, food was good and the server was sweet. It was a little on the busy side. No doubt because there is nothing close by.  All in all, it is good for what it is. A quick place to stay in Indy and get back to the airport.                             They have free internet as well and that is always good!This hotel was decent.  The staff was nice.  The breakfast buffet was great and decently priced.  The hotel is definitely dated, the beds were a little hard (great pillows though) and taking a shower was like using a water hose.  The shower head was awful.  But none of this ruined our visit.  Checkout was noon, which was great!  If we were flying out of Indy, this hotel would definitely work.  But if we were staying in Indy for a few days, would probably pick another hotel.Booked a room with two sleep number beds got a room with a broken sleep number bed a bed with a mattress so worn out you can feel the springs poking through. The room is very old and worn out the AC unit barely works. What a dump!If you have a fear of jets crashing into the building do not say here. Its on the flight-path for Fed-ex and the planes are landing every 15 mins. But if your dog tired then you will not hear a thing. This place is very dated and needs to be really remodeled. The bathrooms are really small and dated too so no joy there. It was a last min decision to get into this place as it was late and we had been driving all day long. I know there are better places around we could just not find them at 2 am.Broke down in ohio and had to stay in the shadiest motel ever. Had booked a night here on hotwire, which all sales are final. My gf wouldn't shower at the bates.motel we stayed at the night before so she called the radisson to see if we could just stop in for a half an hour and take shower. We're driving cross country so we're just passing thru but jessica the front desk agent was great and let us use a room to freshen up! 5 stars because SHE was awesome!I came to Indianapolis to meet a friend who I hadn't seen in 15 years.  I had a delayed flight out of Austin due to a massive thunderstorm the night before.  I checked in after midnight and because of the long day, I stayed and rested in my room the following day until about 5:30pm.  I called for housekeeping and the guy at the desk informed me that there was no way for anyone to bring me fresh sheets or towels.I explained my situation to him and he said he would send a driver up if I were in that much need of accommodation., to which I replied wouldn't be necessary if I could just come down and get fresh sheets and towels as I would be happy to clean my own room if the hotel didn't offer any such services to its guests.  I was seriously confused by his demeanor and told him so as I left for dinner.When I returned, he stopped me at the desk to let me know that he had left fresh sheets and towels at my door (on the floor in the hallway, mind you) and that there were coupons for breakfast comps under my door.  Though he had done his best to remedy the situation, I was still a little unhappy because I feel like customer service and especially in a hotel situation, should accommodate a guest's needs within reason without fail.  Maybe I'm old fashioned or too expectant of services offered at a chain hotel such as the Radisson, but being located directly at the airport, they should be used to such requests from their traveling guests and should keep an evening housekeeper on staff.  I can't say I'll be in a hurry to book a room here again, however, it wasn't the worst experience in my life and I do appreciate the desk staff's attempt to make me happy though it was too little too late...It was my birthday weekend &amp; my Dad chose to give me the best gift a girl could receive! OHIO STATE FOOTBALL TICKETS! Yes. That is what I said. The best gift a girl could receive. Okay--well to this girl it is the best gift. We wanted to stay at a hotel that was near the game, but not totally downtown Bloomington. The traffic would be so bad, so we thought staying in Indianapolis would be fun. And it was! This hotel was very accommodating. The front desk when I called to double check if our reservation went through from booking online [www.hotels.com] was very friendly &amp; gave me all the information I needed. The rooms were clean a large. The double beds even came with the ""Sleep by Numbers"" control! My Dad had wayyy too much fun going up and down with the settings. The best part is that when we got to the hotel, checked in &amp; while walking down the hallway the entire OSU football team came out of the conference room. Yes. I was in a total daze. I got to meet some of the players. It was truly a dream come true for me because I've been a fan since I was 10 years old. Hey if this hotel is good enough for the best college football team in the nation--then it is definitely good enough for you &amp; me!This place is disgusting!!!! Carpet is stained, smells like mold, there, do yourself a favor and don't stay here!!!The Indy Airport area is in transition now that the (fabulous) new terminal has been opened.This hotel is right next to the OLD terminal, and is about 5 miles from the new terminal. They provide a free shuttle service (it is of course a good idea to tip the driver a buck a bag). If you don't have a car it is hard to find a place to eat outside the hotel.  (Yelp ought to add Indianapolis Airport as a searchable neighborhood...). They took us downtown to our specific destination the next morning -- a big savings of time and money.This is a hotel which can hold large meetings.  On either end of the meeting space are residential towers.  On the far side, there is the old three story tower.  Near the front desk and restaurant is the newer six story tower. The far tower is where I stayed so I can't comment on the other. It is only a two or 2.5 star at best.  It is quite old, but in decent shape overall. The bedding was in good condition with washable-cover duvets.  They have sleep number beds, but you can't adjust the sleep number.The bathroom is quite aged and probably the room's worst feature.  It is small with a small tub. The tiles have been heavily painted and the paint is starting to let go.  Still, I got the room on Priceline and I'm happy with what I got. If I had paid rack rate, I'd be more upset about it.The bar is pretty good and has some happy hour specials like sliders. I'm not able to tell you what the specials are, because they have no menu. just a sign behind the bar. I think the kitchen closes at ten.  If you're flying in from the west coast late in the day, you might be better off to eat at one of the nice places in the new terminal.I ate in the restaurant and I can tell you with authority to order the burger! It is excellently prepared and delicious on a high quality bun. I had fruit cup instead of fries, expected a cup of thawed honeydew, but instead got a beautiful cup of high quality berries and fresh sliced fruit.I had a cream of vegetable soup also and it appeared to be home made.A  nice feature of the hotel is that down by the restaurant they have a vending machine with ice cream treats and frozen entrees of decent quality  in case you get there after hours.  More hotels should offer this!  I think they do this because a lot of pilots stay here.The staff at the hotel were exceedingly friendly and took good care of us.  I will probably stay here again, as the quality of the staff gains them a star -- I can put up with a rather crummy room for service like this.I wont be staying here again.The staff was very nice but the building and its furnishings were old and worn.Im assuming the place will be torn down soon. They have stopped doing repairs and cleaning.The food was excellent tho.",,,,"['staff', 'fantastic', 'gentleman', 'picked', 'brought', 'luggage', 'room', 'friendly', 'dining', 'room', 'staff',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-indianapolis-airport-indianapolis,Hyatt Place Indianapolis Airport,4.0,$$,24,"We stayed here for work for a week because there was a large conference in town that drove up downtown room prices. The staff were very courteous, the rooms big and clean. I found the desk and couch useful for having meetings with coworkers and working. The downstairs area is also arranged like a lounge of sorts, with tables in small nooks around the lobby. These double as eating areas for the free breakfast (see below) and evening bar/restaurant/cafe. I didn't hang out there in the evening much, but it appeared people did. The room has a refrigerator, coffee maker, large flat screen (in my room, somewhat poor quality - local channels didn't have great reception), and a desk. I wish it had come with a microwave. I was really comfortable in it.The free breakfast includes toast, bagels, rotating pastries (danishes, muffins, donuts), fruit (usually mixed fruit and grapefruit, plus whole wrapped oranges, apples, and sometimes bananas), yogurt (plain [which I thought was of poor quality] and fruit), cottage cheese, oatmeal, cold cereal assortment, breakfast sandwiches, rotating breakfast carb (pancakes, french toast), juices and milk, coffees and teas. It all looked nice, but I thought was strangely bland and cold. Perhaps the addition of a microwave to allow people to reheat/heat would help? The 6 AM start time also seemed a bit late - even a half hour earlier would have been better for us given we often left for downtown/work around 7. Most of the hot food was not out when I was there at 6 AM. I didn't ever order anything from the 24/7 restaurant/cafe menu but it seemed like a pretty good mix (salads, soups, sandwiches, hamburgers, flatbreads, pizzas) that I assume they reheat on site (I'm not sure). Dishes, as I recall, generally cost $6-11. My coworkers noted the entrees they ate were kind of bland, but the salads were good. Note: all the food appeared quite fresh and despite the criticisms here, I thought it was quite good for hotel food in a hotel without a real restaurant. Has a free shuttle to and from the airport. The van, if not occupied, also can take you to nearby restaurants as there really isn't anything nearby that's walkable (busy highway and road).Taxis into downtown reportedly cost $24/trip. At the suggestion of one of the staff, we took uber each morning and evening and those trips cost $10-13/trip - it worked really well.Very nice room. Great staff. Comfortable bed. Lots of outlets in the room (a personal pet peeve of mine). Full sized ironing board. Be aware that the property is about a 15 minute drive from the airport. Downsides... Bathroom fan was LOUD! Temperature control was iffy. Iron was broken.The breakfast was alright fancy looking but limited selection and the food was cold!  The restaurants food is overpriced for a small bowl of microwaved Chili it was $7The rest of the hotel was great!  Very nice rooms the employees for very friendly!Great place to stay, especially if you have an early morning or late night flight! This hotel is really nice, with an up-to-date design and interior, large rooms, hot 6am breakfast and shuttle service to and from the airport.The staff was wonderfully nice and helpful, and the shuttle service that runs every few minutes is super handy for traveling. The hotel is roughly 7 miles from the airport, so the drive takes only around 10 minutes. It is also located about 7 miles from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, or the downtown area. The rooms are very comfortable, large and contemporary. There's Free WiFi, pullout sofas, coffee makers, a minifrige, and even a wet bar. The breakfast is served at 6am but if you have to leave before 6, you can get many other items like coffee, juice, muffins &amp; other pastries or fruit. This hotel even offers a 24/7 menu and ""market.""The decor is attractive, modern and warm, and they have a nice outdoor pool with a 24 hour fitness center.We stayed here for the 2015 big ten championship game and unfortunately my Ohio state buckeyes were not playing in it. Our rooms were very clean and extremely spacious. The continental breakfast was exceptionally good. We noticed they had a nice bar where some people were getting a bite to eat and drink but we didn't take advantage of this due to the fact that we were downtown taking part in the festivities around Lucas oil stadium. The customer service was gracious and more than helpful. I also thought the price was right for such a nice hotel. We liked it so much that we decided to book a room a year in advance for next year's game.My husband and I stayed here for a weekend trip to Indianapolis. We chose this hotel because of our many excellent experiences with Hyatt. This hotel turned out to be mediocre at best from start to finish of our stay. Our flight into Indy was delayed an hour, putting us in at 11:30 pm. I called ahead to let the hotel know we would be checking late. When we arrived at the hotel we were very tired and eager to get to our room. The person behind the bar/check in area barely acknowledged our arrival. He said he would be right with us.  He then made drinks for a couple at the bar, answered a few phone calls then got to us. While it was only about a ten minute wait to check us in it did not set a good tone for the stay. The room had stained carpets that were dirty in corners and along the edges (I noticed because my suitcase got dustbunnies on it after only a short time in the room). The bed was clean  and comfortable (which is the most important thing to me). Our room was very noisy - freeway noise from outside at times and in the mornings loud noises from the cleaning staff. We ate the free breakfast both mornings and it also was adequate at best. Very few protein choices. Also during the  busy part of breakfast the serving area and dining tables were not kept clean. Though this hotel does not seem to be that old it does not seem to be well cared for. The staff was also OK, polite, helpful, but not really attentive. One thing I really liked  was that now you can control the TV with the Hyatt stayconnect app on your smarrphone - no more germy remotes. Overall I am satisfied with my stay, but if I were to visit Indy again would probably stay somewhere else.Small clean accommodating and awesome staff. I was exhausted when I drove in. No roomservice but I headed to the lobby bar and had a small bbq chicken pizza and wine. Both really good! Better than I've had at other bigger hotels. I like the personal care and approach the staff had. I ended up finishing my little to go pizza in the lobby, and got a cookie to go. Definitely order a cookie! The rooms are clean and spacious and really accommodating, with hassle-free free wifi (ahem every other hotel could learn something here). Next time I come through I'll be back!Hyatt Place has become my new favorite business travel hotel. This one is exactly like all of the others, which I like, because I know what I'm getting.Free breakfast is excellent, however, I'm not at all a fan of their coffee. Free wifi is decent...good enough to stream after a few minutes of buffering.This does have one of the better fitness centers of the several Hyatt Places I've stayed...it's much bigger than the usual ones. Now, it's nothing compared to a Hyatt Regency or Grand Hyatt Stay Fit, but it's nice enough.All in all, a solid hotel for frequent business travel or personal family travel.Great service, clean room, and comfy bed.  Close to the airport too, which is nice.  Not much else to say.loved our stay, breakfast buffett was fresh and with decent verity for different taste, the dinning area was a bit small but we easily found a spot. The room was clean and reasonable. Don't compare it with Hyatt hotel itself and you will feel good about it.Great room rates!!! Close enough to downtown without the downtown prices!!! Room extremely clean and guest services is a 10/10!!! I would stay here again!!!I stayed here when I came to Indy for the MotoGP. The location was perfect, only about 10-15 minutes from the track and very direct. Also fairly close to downtown via the expressway. The hotel room was very clean and comfy. There was a separate sitting area from the bed area and also a small fridge. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the free breakfast was pretty good. I will be looking to stay here again when I come back next year.I stay at Hyatt Place hotels frequently because I like the brand.  I found this particular location to be under par, though it did have some good points.  Our check in was fast, faster than most Hyatt Place hotels actually.  The person who checked us in, however, was disheveled -- had on a dirty shirt and it was untucked.  That seemed a bit odd.  The room size was much smaller than most Hyatt Place hotels.  I wonder if they converted another hotel to call this one a Hyatt Place -- it doesn't seem to be built as a Hyatt Place, but I could be mistaken.  One larger issue was the location of the hotel.  Although it was conveniently located off an interstate, the location seemed unsafe.  This made my wife uncomfortable and unwilling to stay here again, and I can't say that I blame her.  The breakfast was not as fresh as most similar Hyatt Place hotels either.  There were some staff at the front desk who seemed quite professional and hard working.  Unfortunately our stay here made us rethink the brand of hotels we will stay at for leisure travel, and we have decided to switch chains.Great staff. Van from airport has seat warmers to help stay warm during Indy's winter. Room is equipped with fridge and there is a microwave downstairs that's always available, along with plates and utensils. Full breakfast with a couple hot options that change depending on the day...all FREE. Not many things on the menu during the day I would go for and drinks are over priced but you can cross the street to the gas station and grab something there. Gym is nice. Good equipment. Not five stars because it is by absolutely nothing.I was there on a last minute business trip and felt bummed out that I couldn't get a hotel in downtown. Found this one. It was my first time staying there. Breakfast included in the hotel rate was really very good, with range of hot and cold items. Compared to other places that have similar options, it felt more convenient as it was relatively small and I didn't have to go to some restaurant somewhere to get the same. The hotel reservation counter flows into a small bar. The staff seemed to treat me as if I was a regular customer. The hallways seemed perfumed, well-lit and well-maintained. The room was furnished nicely. Complimentary internet is much appreciated. The bed was comfortable. Heater was not noisy. The place was quiet. I got the rest that I needed. I noticed right away upon first checking into my room that plastic seat on the toilet was quite loose. Called the front desk right away, and they sent maintenance within minutes with a replacement seat and within minutes he had done his job. After dinner outside, I returned only to have my key card not work. First they reprogrammed it and when it still didn't work, accompanied me to the door and said that she was convinced that the battery in the electronic lock in the door needed to be replaced. She apologized profusely, offered me a complimentary glass of wine while I waited in the lobby as maintenance fixed the problem. So, I had 2 issues needing maintenance on my first night at this hotel, but they were both handled very professionally. I would go there again.Hotel was fine but nothing special - lack of bathroom amenities, basic housekeeping Service - made the bed with remote in it. Coffee/breakfast was good and staff was friendly, but I wouldn't return. Heater very nosey and bathroom too dark and small with obnoxious fan!LOVED this place.  From the friendly staff to the beautifully designed rooms, this place will get my business whenever I have the opportunity in my travels.   Their self-serve breakfast area was spacious and clean, and the food was plentiful.  The lobby was large enough to accommodate a large number of patrons comfortably even when all the rooms have been sold out.  We were there over the Memorial Day weekend for the Indy 500 and we never felt ""crowded"".  Simply put, it really was a pleasure to stay here.My flight was delayed due to weather so I had a 16 hour wait overnight until the next flight. Airline would not pay for hotels, so I called around and Hyatt offered me a special ""Distressed Passenger"" rate. I confirmed over the phone and they had their shuttle driver wait for me as I made it outside with my bags. The hotel itself, is kind of in the middle of no-where but there is small gas station across the street in case you need amenities, ie. a bottle of wine. There is, however, a small bar (with Happy Hour!) in the lobby as well as free flowing free fruit and 2 computers with free WiFi (that no nobody was using except me). Breakfast is also free (continental stuff) but if you want an omlette it will cost you a little more. The staffs are pleasant and helpful. They asked me when my flight was and planned my shuttle ride back to the airport (free, of course).I stayed at the Hyatt Place overnight when in town to visit my boyfriend. Considering I'd never been to Indianapolis before, and figuring it was a relatively ""happening"" city (it's not, by the way), I counted on the hotel being in walking distance to...anything...at all. Instead it seemed in the middle of nowhere, plopped next to a gas station off the interstate. Parking was adequate and abundant. I also liked that the parking lot was well lit after dark.The check-in process was seamless. The Guest Service Agent was super sweet and had my room receipt and a glass of wine ready for me when I came back from getting my bags from the car. I am very familiar with Hyatt Place hotels and wasn't surprised at the large amount of room and the cozy feeling associated with this hotel. However, the only downside is the fact that the entire vanity area is nestled in the main bedroom space, so if someone is sleeping or lying in bed, you're stuck getting ready in front of whomever you're bunking with. The other bummer was the hairdryer which was old and didn't produce enough blowing power to properly dry my hair (which was a bummer since I was getting ready for a date). The next morning I headed down for breakfast and was pleased to see cottage cheese and hot breakfast sandwiches. The sandwich was ""eh"" at best, but I was glad for cold orange juice and yogurt. All-in-all, I had a nice time at this hotel, and had my boyfriend and I not broken up the next morning, I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again when in Indianapolis.I have written other reviews for other Hyatt Places. The reviews don't change. The service was good. The design is upscale with affordable prices. The free breakfast is very well done. They offer many choices and it is unbelievable that there is no charge. I can't forget that the hotel was clean and comfortable. I always walk in and say ""Honey, I'm home"". Hyatt Place is my home away from home.","I'm still unimpressed with this HP location! We checked in really late and found crickets in our room! They also didn't say what time breakfast was being served the next morning, so we missed it (thinking it was until 10am, but really it was until 9:30am).  Indianapolis is one of the cities we stop in during our frequent drive, but we might have to avoid this specific location from now on. Oh, I learned the bathroom counters are small in every room, not just the handicap rooms. Err!Hospitality here was great! We arrived to meet friendly and knowledgeable hotel staff. Then before we could get comfortable...fire alarms go off and we have to exit. No kidding. We were never notified of the cause or anything. But we were allowed back in probably under 30 minutes. Good business practice would've been to notify guests promptly of what had occurred. Nonetheless, we slept well in a cool room with fantastically soft beds. Morning was met with a warm breakfast of french toast, egg crossaints, fruits, etc. This is a highlight of the Hyatt Place chains. We used the gym for the treadmills around 10 or so, and there were no others in there, clean towels, and even headphones! Then we asked to extend our checkout time, and it was done, with no extra charge or anything. I'd stay here again because it was no fuss, easy off the highway, affordable nightly rate, and just a delightful experience.Clean, updated and comfortable. I met a friend who was staying in town and we went for dinner. The front desk clerk, Nicole, was incredibly helpful printing me directions to the nearest carwash and providing excellent customer service. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to or through Indy. Short distance to a couple of burbs with shopping centers, and a short distance to downtown Indy Zoo, museums, etc. I will stay here the next time I come to Indy for vacation.Update: October 19, 2010; was disappointed when the General Manager Bill Styck called me the day before we were to show up and inform me that the three rooms I reserved back in November 2009 (11 months prior!) were being moved 14 miles away to a Best Western. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND why/how/why hotels oversell! If you have 100 rooms - you should take 100 reservations.....not 101, not 105, not more....100! THis is incredibly poor business practice and is terribly inconvenient for customers who THINK they have a reservation. For this.....I'm going to take 2 stars away!What a wonderful hotel!  We stayed at the Hyatt for only a few short hours on the night of July 23rd.  We had to get up at 5am to catch an early flight back to California and celebrate our daughter's (who was with us) 18th Birthday.  Because of bad weather my family and I got re-routed and we were delayed for 7.5 hours.  We were completely exhausted and laying on the floor of the airport was not an option.  We called up the hotel and spoke to Sara.  She immediately sent a shuttle to get us and put us back in our room.  The driver (Elaina) called ahead to have our room keys waiting and schedule a late checkout.  She even stayed late to shuttle us back to the airport later in the day.  I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this service was.  They went out of their way for us!  You don't see that much anymore!  It meant everything to us that day!The rooms are great too.  SUPER spacious and modern.  Best part was the giant sectional couch in room and a mini fridge and bar area.  Oh, and the free breakfast far out-did any other hotel breakfast buffet I have seen.I give this hotel my personal recommendation!  You won't be disappointed!Christina O. :)",,,,"['work', 'week', 'large', 'conference', 'town', 'drove', 'downtown', 'room', 'prices', 'staff', 'courteous', 'rooms', 'big', 'clean', 'found', 'desk',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/caribbean-cove-hotel-and-conference-center-indianapolis-2,Caribbean Cove Hotel & Conference Center,1.5,$$,39,"I accompanied my boss for an over night mid-week business trip and was disappointed because it has such a high Trip Advisor rating. While the public areas are tastfully decorated and spacious, the room was quite small and you could hear conversations and tv from adjoining rooms. The bathroom floor was dirty and the floor safe was difficult to reach and impossible to read the instructions. We ate twice in the resturant...$6 for coffee and poor service at breakfast, better at lunch. All in all, I expect more from Marriott.Housekeeping staff were friendly, and the bed linens and bathroom were clean, but this hotel is otherwise in such poor repair, with so much needing deeper attention/maintenance, that the overall impression is unhygienic. Gouges in the wall, dents and marks on everything, old and stained hall carpets, and a coffeemaker with glass so cloudy that I wouldn't use it.Service from desk staff was terrible. We called ahead to secure a refrigerator for our room and were told twice that there were plenty, even extra, in advance of a busy weekend. We reminded them again on check-in, receiving the same assurance.. but total inaction. We finally called down and were told that they'd been ""out for hours"". We had a three-night reservation, but declined to spend the night. We booked a different hotel and left.Wow, just wow! Stayed two nights, two nights WAY to long! First off no hot water the entire time we were there. I complained on six separate occasions with absolutely no results. At 8:45 pm there is w knock on the door with the person stating they are housekeeping wanting to know if we needed service. That's right they had not gotten to my room yet! My response was Um no, im getting ready to go to bed.  Truly the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. I would've been better at the $19.99 a night Motel 6. Live and learn! The only reason they got a star is because I had to rate it something to post!The hotel looks like it used to be awesome and then they let it go. There was never anyone at the front desk counter when we needed stuff and we wound up having to wait to check in. The waterpark section was closed for repairs defeating the whole purpose of even staying here. The first room had stains on the bed. Called the next morning to see what time breakfast was; they told me it was usually 630-1030 but they havent set it up yet so i guess theyre not having it... It was 9:30a. They do still have a pool here and the whole hotel smells like it. The whole place smells like chlorine. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.Absolutely awful. Everything you could possibly imagine to be bad, was terrible. Do not waste your time or money. It was dirty, under staffed, and not up to date on anything. I would never go back, even if it were free! (Also the breakfast staff doesn't speak English and they will try to bully a gratuity charge out of you, which you do not have to pay.)The beds &amp; the breakfast here leave something to be desired. If I were 12 years old giving this review, it would be higher, but I feel like they could do a little better pleasing the folks who are paying for the kiddos experience.  If you don't have much more to do on a cold winter weekend, it is worth a trip for the kids....if you can get a groupon or not have to pay full price.This was awful, we did not go for the water park, we only went for a late sleepover.  The room was available and the price was lower than most.  That being said, we checked in very late, wanted a shower and realized there were NO towels in our room.  We tried to call down to the front desk, but the buttons on the phone didn't work, so we had to go down to get the towels ourselves.  Then the breakfast was free, and that was too much for the poor quality of food. Remember, a deal isn't a deal if so many things are not right.  The water park was probably ok, not sure though.Stayed here earlier this month. Absolutely terrible. My family had bug issues and service issues. Housekeeping needs more help. The employees try their best, but it just not up to par as an resort experience.I honestly don't a have anything positive to say. Within the first 8 hours of checking in, we had three different rooms. The next day, room service removed ALL of the towels from our room during routine cleaning, which was not discovered until we returned to clean up for dinner after a long day. When we asked for compensation from management, we were told that we could receive our money back as long as we checked out immediately, and that we were horrible customers. I'm writing this the next morning as I await for the day-shift manager to arrive to hopefully help, but from what I hear from other guests, there's very little hope. In short, I have better luck at Red Roof Inns when it comes to consistency in housekeeping and in attention of the front desk. Hands down. I will never return, and recommend that you don't stay here unless you must.I attended a seminar here so I can't attest to what the rooms or the pool is like. Hell, I didn't even eat here! All I know is that is was a little old, still decently maintained, had a weird chlorinated charm, and it wasn't a bad spot to get a meeting room. There are loads of restaurants near round so it's quite convenient.In some many words!!  This place SUCKS!!!Don't even bother, the worst part about the water slides, the life guards are useless!!!All water park hotels seem damp and chlorine-y to me.  This place is no exception.  When it comes to hotels my biggest fear is bed bugs so I always say; ""This room isn't the one with bed bugs is it?  We don't want to be on a floor with bed bugs.""  This time, it payed off and the clerk said, no those rooms are on the 4th floor, you're no where near there.  Okay then....   I still checked the mattresses and we were fine.  My then three year old son loved the water park and his dad and I enjoyed it, too.  We all had a good time and slept well.  Not amazing but gets the job done.Horrible nothing works! Water park is mediocre. Not worth $15 per person. Wall paper falling off the walls! No ice I any ice machine. None of the games in the ""arcade"" work. Even with the free stay they offered us to composite can I really say I will come back.My family of five stayed here. When we got to our room there was only one towel in the bathroom. When we turned the air on it was so loud that it sounded like a refrigerator about to blow up. The beds were extremely hard and the television channels were all staticky. The water park is only open a couple days a week so make sure you check what days they are before you decide to stay, of course it was closed on ours. The ""included"" breakfast was awful even my kids did not want to eat it. My advice is if you are planning on staying in the area drive a little farther down the road...After reading all the reviews I truly tried to keep an open mind. However this place is full of disappointments. Some big but most so small that it's like a nagging itch that just can't be scratched.- Toilet in the room won't flush. You have to lift the tank lid and jiggle.- terrible reception on the TV- room and halls saturated in the smell of chlorine.- two pool tables that have the use of 11 balls between both of them.- one soda machine that won't take bills. The other always out of the most popular product.- the AC wasn't working.....wife goes to front desk to notify. The canned response was do you want a technician, a new room or a box fan. Really a box fan was one solution? This must be a constant problem.- aryan nation tats on a large group of thugs in the water park........guess the kids won't be going there.....and that's why we came.- bars not open- pool bar/restaurant not open- hot tub bubbles won't come on- as I sit here writing this watching over my kids for gang activity my boys inform me the water slides are closed. It's 6:30 Pm.- a lot of just chillin' life guards- the place just isn't very clean. That's very broad I know but that's the general impression.- we booked 5 people in our party. We were given a room with 2 full size beds. When we asked about a roll away bed we were told it's against fire code to use them. So we decided to bully our youngest into sleeping on the ground (he really volunteered) but there were no extra blankets or pillows on the room. Had to beg for some.That's all I can write about as I'm worn out. The ONLY saving grace is that they have a stellar, finely tuned Ms PAC man/Galaga arcade game and since the place is totally empty it was all mine. My advice of drive east for 1.5 hours and go to the Great Wolf Lodge. It's very nice, huge, clean and full of family fun. It has an indoor water park, rooms and activities that puts this place to shame.How do I word this delicately.....The Place Sucks!!!@The hot breakfast bar was cold. The cold breakfasy bar was warm. The fruit had a funny ""not very fresh"" taste to it.I had to ask for silverware, to replace the white plastic ""picnic warBte"" they had on the tables.. I had to ask for a coffee re fill and they brought me a COLD cup of coffee.  BTW-It was Sunday morning.Save your tme, your dignity and your Money. Go anywhere else!!!This place was probably nice once upon a time. Now it's grimy, buggy and damp. We had a low rate on Hotwire, which was probably because their waterpark is closed for repair, but even without that, this place is just disgusting. Our first room was mouldy, the second one they gave us was torn apart for renovation and we finally settled into a third room, which was passable, but the hallway reeks. They need new ownership, I think.This place was terrible from start to finish; from water park to hotel. We arrived early to use the water park, which we have done at other indoor water park resorts. We were able to get our wrist bands (this is the reason I've given the one star that I did) and head to the park. When we arrived, we were told that they were out of additional wrist bands, but went ahead and let our daughter in.We headed to the large water slides with our sons, only to discover that they couldn't use the tube slide because the air compressor was out and the tubes couldn't be re-filled. This was incredibly disappointing. The water park staff was sullen and unhelpful. Same for the snack bar. The place was pretty dirty as well, and many of the toys in the (freezing!) baby pool did not work.We went to check in to the hotel to find that others that had booked through LivingSocial (which we had also done) had been turned away because the hotel was over booked. We stood in line for over a half hour to check on the room, and were given a single room instead of the suite that we booked.This was when we decided to leave and to go to another hotel. We got a refund from LivingSocial, and alerted the hotel that we were leaving. About a month later, we received a charge for the room - that we did not stay in. We had to have a long discussion with the hotel to get that unwarranted charge refunded.I would not recommend this hotel or indoor water park.TERRIBLE! We only stayed one night and I wish we were able to get our money back. When you first walk in, it actually looks very nice. But when you walk down the halls and into your room, it's a completely different story. The bathroom was grungy and dirty. The beds only had a sheet on it so you could see the bottom mattress (very odd and tacky). Thankful it wasn't cold! The pillows were hard and lumpy. When we arrived at the hotel (around 5) to check in, they told us the water park was only open until 7pm. And they also said it wasn't going to be open Monday? That's the whole reason we chose this place! We ran to our rooms to change but it didn't matter. We didn't stay long at the waterpark. It was filthy and the kids were bored. And the lifeguards were extremely unprofessional! I wouldn't trust them with anyone's life! They were goofing off, playing on their cell phones and wearing socks and sneakers.. Seriously? What happens if my child needs you? I highly doubt you wouldn't ruin those shoes of yours.. If you go to their website, don't believe he pictures because it's nothing like that now. Very run down. It's almost like it was a nice place.. Years ago. I'm blaming terrible management. Don't waste your money or time. And breakfast wasn't good either. Seriously-just go to the holiday inn.. And I guess they are adding Tilted Kilt to their building.. Just what they need to add next to a child's waterpark.. This place needs serious help.RATING the bar and the gal (Tabitha) with 5 Stars - excellent service - but the hotel looks dirty - lots of kids running around lobby, on stairs...not hotel's fault but tells a lot about the people staying there. Was NOT impressed and would NEVER stay there.But again, the bar was nice and Tabitha was personable, friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our drink.Bar is NOT located where the outside sign says it is - you have to walk around the building, go up the stairs to find it. Appears it has been upstairs for quite a long time but management isn't about to pay for signs directing someone there.","If I could give this place 0 stars, I would!! Easily one of the worst experiences for the family yet. I really can't mention anything else that hasn't been already. We waited over 45 minutes in the parking lot in our car because the couldn't figure out the room situation. Halls reek of chlorine, elevators were out of order, it was dirty and worst of all THE HEAT WAS OUT. They moved my family two different times because the rooms didn't have heat, and because the doors didn't lock. Anyone could just walk in. We went for my niece's birthday party and pretty much the entire night was ruined for the kids. The heat in the water park didn't work either, and despite the pool being ""heated"", you could see your breath in there. Entirely too cold for me, much less our toddlers. Their lips were turning blue and they shivered the whole (maybe) hour we were in there before we decided enough was enough. I heard the same thing about the box fans in summer. Apparently they just give them away. The place was full of thugs and their out of control, rude kids. I would NEVER visit this place again, not even if someone paid me!!!The staff is pleasant enough, and they let us check in early.  We appreciated that after spending several hours in the water park - the kids were all ready for a nap.  Now for the negatives:  there are no towels in the entire hotel.  Luckily, I anticipated this and brought towels.  But how do you not have a lot of towels at a water park?  Note to the owners - call Great Wolf and ask them how they do it.  Take lots of notes. We asked the front desk staff in person for towels and we were given a couple of excuses as to why they didn't have them.  One staff member finally went and got some for us.  It wasn't until I got to my room that I realized she gave me floor mats.  So, I never got my hands on an actual towel (that I didn't bring from home) during my entire visit.  Our room was clean enough, but worn down.  At one point, a staff member just walked right into our room.  She said that she was checking for empty rooms.  I guess they don't have a computer system?  The fitness room is a joke - two treadmills and a tv shoved into a corner room.  The waterpark is ok.  It's fairly clean and the lifeguards seemed to be paying attention.  However, there's some sort of weird sediment on the bottom of the hot tub.  Gross!  The water is also incredibly cold.  The lazy river is just uncomfortable to be in, and the kids play area isn't too much better.  The pool in the hotel is pretty cold as well.  The kids in our group wanted to sit in the hot tub, as it was more comfortable.  The hotel is incredibly noisy.  You can hear everything - like our neighbor loudly announcing ""I'm popping!""  I heard that through the bathroom wall.  The lobby ad pool area noise is so loud that you can hear a conversation on the balcony. My four year old is having a great time though, which is why we are here.  Next time, however, we will spend the extra and drive to Great Wolf.  It's worth it to have a much better experience.We didn't actually get to stay in our room, because when we arrived the front desk clerk informed me that the entire Indoor Water Park was closed for the whole weekend, due to a ""chemical imbalance.""  Sounds like they violated some hygiene codes to me.  Either way, our whole reason for booking a package through Living Social for this place was so the kids could play at the indoor water park.  The staff at the hotel explained to me that they knew about this problem probably around 10am that morning.  I was arriving at 9pm that night.  I asked why no one called or emailed me to tell me about this ahead of time.  They said they were under the impression that the day shift manager was taking care of this.  All they offered was a $40 courtesy credit -- not a discount off of our room, but $40 we could spend on in-room movies and room service.  No thanks.  Not what we had in mind at all, and now we have to go through Living Social to get our refund.  We will NEVER stay at this place.There are very few times in life where I feel negative stars are necessary. Here is one of those times. Worst mistake was buying a Living Social certificate for $269 for a two night stay.We booked our stay at this horrendous place back in July. Easy enough.  As a party of 8, half of us is drove in from Chicago, and the other half drove in from Columbus.  We were hoping to spend a weekend as a family taking the kids to the waterpark. Upon both halves driving 3.5 hours with children, we get to Caribbean Cove and attempt our check in.  This is when we were told the waterpark was closed. Closed closed closed. Not one pool was open and we were just stuck with each of us looking at each other like ""I'm being punked, right?""  We weren't. We were told that we would get extra comp cards for the arcade and credit for food. There was no way kids could just stare at an empty pool and empty waterpark. We honestly couldn't believe that we couldn't even get a heads up courtesy call from the hotel. So now we are stuck in the car looking for options (our final decision took us driving 2 more hours to Ohio to go to another waterpark which will be a whole other review). We were furious about the experience so far. When we finally returned home, we placed an immediate call to Living Social who refused to refund our $269 (times 2 since my brother purchased one too). They pretty much told us we were on our own since we passed the days needed for a refund. Lesson learned. Sticking to groupon.So now we ran into Labor Day weekend. We didn't have any set plans for the kids so we decided ""we are stuck with this damn $269 certificate, lets just try this out again."" We called about 5 times making sure the waterpark would be open- we were assured it was. Here goes another 3.5 hour drive for all of us again. Where do I start?1. Walked in. Great looking lobby. Front desk staff was very friendly.  So far so good.2.  Elevator not working (looks like this is a continuous issue since its mentioned several times on reviews). We were told to just walk until we find another elevator. Dragging kids and bags, not what I wanted to hear but there we went. Went to next elevator, door opens, we pile in, door closes, no movement. We reopen and try again. Elevator shakes horribly but we made it to the third floor.3.  Entered room. Very spacious. Paint is peeling, doors are warping. Phone doesn't work, volume on tv doesn't work and 3 small towels that are a little larger than hand towels are in bathroom. I call the front desk for extra towels. 20 min later, nothing. Call again, they say ""okay they are on their way"". 30 min later - nothing. 4. All restaurants are closed except for one little room with a bar. The bartender/waitress/table cleaner/ cook / manager is all one person.  A sweet person but there is just no way in hell one person can handle all of that. We all felt just so bad for her. There wasn't really a restaurant so I guess she placed the order with room service but then she had to leave to pick up out food so she leaves the small room for a good 10 minutes or so. Comes back with our food which is beyond mediocre but edible. We order drinks but there are no kids cups and no straws. We left it at that, ate, and went home.5. The waterpark and pool. You walk in to either and your eyes can barely stay open with the smell of chlorine. It's humid, and not in a good way. 2 pools are taped off and closed off. There are no towels. The hot tub actually allowed babies and children in it. Sadly, I could keep going. Stay far far away!!!!!You know what? Reviews can be deceiving.The BF and I decided at the last minute that a nerd quickie-cation was necessary. So we made plans to check out GenCon in Indy. (For those of you who don't know, GenCon is the biggest convention of gaming--board games, card games, dice games, role playing games, etc). Of course, when people from around the country take over a city, you'll be hard-pressed to find a hotel at a decent rate near the convention. So we went through Expedia. With the we-won't-tell-you-where-you're-staying-until-you've-given-us-your-money ""deal,"" we managed to get away with $65 for the night. Then I discovered the hotel that we'd be staying at: Caribbean Cove Hotel. SWEET. Water park. Wait. Not the plan. Games. Games are the plan. So I forced myself to not be lulled by the idea of water fun...We were leaving after work on Friday, so I called to inform the hotel that we'd be late. The woman was pretty snotty, and talked down to me like I was an idiot, but she said that it was no problem. I brushed her 'tude off.I thought that reading reviews on the way down would be a good way to pass the time. After reading reviews on Yelp, Google, and more...I got scared. Panicked even. Bed bugs? Reviews with bed bugs? Cockroaches? Yikes. I was expecting dingy rooms with dark lighting and lots of creepy crawlies. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Our options were slim, as our arrival was going to be late. So just before going in, I decided to remove the clothes I would need from my brand new fancy (but free) Victoria's Secret travel bag, put them in a grocery bag, and proceeded to the hotel.We arrived and entered the hotel, which had a beautiful lobby, with a really great looking facade. The staff at the front desk was mostly awesome. The snotty clerk was there, and appeared to be new (train her or boot her, but she was awful). She didn't have the faintest clue what she was doing. Luckily, the other two staffers at the desk made up for her rude behavior. The guy even joked around with me. It was all good.We walked through the ""Holidome,"" which was really nice looking, got to the room, stashed our bags, and went on a thorough search for signs of ickies. Nothing. Seemed pretty safe. The room was clean, and bright. The decor was friendly. Overall, it was a really great bargain for $65. We went to sleep shortly thereafter, but at 4 AM, I woke up in a panic, thinking to myself, ""this is when bed bugs are active!"" So I was up for about 2 hours freaking out internally, without the faintest hint of actual bed bugs. There were none in our room. But I thought you kids deserved a good laugh on my behalf.Let me start out by saying the only reason this hotel was even given a 1 star is because it wouldn't let me go any lower. This place is disgusting. I will say the water park was nice since it just finally opened after being shut down for a while, but the hotel is just gross. The beds are ridiculously hard and old, the rooms smell, the hallways smell, the AC doesn't work, I can go on and on. We stayed here for 1 night and that was 1 night too long. I almost got the kids up and drove him that night after the water park. We waited over 30 minutes to get towels in our room, the AC didn't work so they thought they would send someone up to look at it when it was already 11:00 at night. They finally ended up moving us and the AC at least worked better in that room, it wasn't 82 degrees like the previous room. Rude people work here is all I can say. The nicest person was the maintenance guy, and to be honest I kind of felt bad for him. You know it's bad when 3 kids tell you, maybe we should have come over to just play at the water park and stayed at the hotel across the street! Nasty nasty place, will not return again. Was here about 8 years ago and it needed some renovations then, nothing has been done to it since then, so imagine what it's like now. Oh and the damn lifeguard at the water slides we tipping people off their tubes after they came down the slides. Big douche bag for sure, who cares if the kids or adults knew how to swim. He had a lot of pissed off people at him. Bottom line, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE, go stay somewhere else!!!!This was one of the worst places I have ever stayed in the U.S. The only reason I went was because I purchased a coupon for it. We arrived, Friday and was supposed to stay until Sunday. I was so frustrated I left Saturday night. The hotel is old, with old decor. The water park is small but enough for small kids. Not much for adults. Friday night we asked for extra blankets. It took 45 minutes for us to receive those. I called the front desk twice and just went down there myself after 30 minutes. The next day we went downstairs for the complimentary breakfast. There was a line. A hostess was there but not giving any information as to how long the wait would be. I asked her and she seemed confused on what to say. When we finally got a seat after about 20 minutes (the people in front of me waited 20 minutes before I got there). Most people got the complimentary breakfast so all the server had to do was get drinks. WHY was the server slow as hell to get drinks?? I told her that I wanted the menu because I didn't want anything on the complimentary bar. It took 20 minutes she still never came back to take my order. I called the manager over to complain, he apologized and took my order. All I had was scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and 2 pancakes. Can you believe that took 20 minutes to make!! The pancakes were horrendous, I didn't even eat them. The manager came over and apologized for the wait, he had the head cook come out and apologize. No one offered me a discount or a comp on this lousy service!In the hallway to our room some of the wallpaper was ripped open with clear mold spores on it. No lie, about 10 of them. Right out in the open! How pathetic is that! We went to the pool Saturday afternoon, they were out of towels. I asked if new towels were coming, the guy said ""I think so"". New towels took 1.5 hours to come.So when I went to checkout, there were 3 people ahead of me. Took exactly 30 minutes, to get to me. In that space of time one woman was loudly complaining to a supervisor about an issue, another couple came by and asked to speak to the manager and the first woman who complained came back to speak to a different supervisor.Nothing about this place is efficient or effective.Horrible. From the cold dirty pool to the filthy bathtub and no hot water for a shower. We did not have toilet paper in our room. Someone vomited in the water park pool and the life guard just looked at the water and left. Gross and I believe it violated health rules. We brought our two little granddaughters and they were so cold.  Also most arcade games were out of order. We ended up just playing on our IPad in our room. Some great weekend. I am demanding my money back.Took an hour and 45 minutes to check in. The line was out the door, and though there were 5 staff members behind the desk, only 2 were checking in patrons. No ""sorry for your wait"" after completing check in, either.Toilet wouldn't flush. Rooms were difficult to sleep in since the noise level carried through the walls. Waterpark was okay, though there are not nearly enough tubes for people to enjoy both the water slide and the lazy river. The water fountain was out of order, and staff refused to give my 3 year old daughter a cup of water. (This, by the way, is against health code.) When my husband pointed this out, the staff member simply said, ""I can't help you.""Waste of money. Never going back.The water park was fine, my son really enjoyed himself. The hotel restaurant was pretty lack luster, think an Applebee's, but more sports themed and more microwaves; beer special was pretty decent though.  But the next morning as we were getting ready to head out for the day we found two roaches crawling on the wall.I calmly showed the manager what we had found and he calmly gave me a refund for our stay.  The manager handled it the best I think he possibly could have, gave me a full refund and let us keep our wrist bands.My advice, if you really want to do a water park then just do the water park and stay somewhere else.COCKROACH alert!!!  We will be checking out of this dump tomorrow.  First, the waterpark was closed due to a mechanical failure.  The hotel a/c doesn't seem to work---soooo warm and humid in the lobby and halls.  They gave us a free pizza due to the park closing but it took them over an hour to get it to us after ordering.  My kids were starving and unhappy.  Front desk=horrible customer service.  Forgot to give me my welcome bag with vital info for our group's stay and we missed an event. And the grand finale: killed a cockroach scurrying across the bathroom floor at 1:30 a.m.We saw bugs in our bathroom - twice.  Killed them.  Pretty sure that they were roaches.  Rooms are small.  Hallways noisy.  Purchased through Priceline, so we could not get the second night refunded.  Moved to a new hotel anyways - out $100 - but better than being in a roach motel!Waterpark was so-so.  I guess good for Indy, since there are no other ones.  But coming from Wisconsin, the land of water parks, it was a disappointment.  Only one slide for inner tubes - other 2 are body slides.  Worst of all - they have 2 hot tubs and both were closed!!!  I would not recommend this hotel.I'd rather stay at a Super 8 / Motel 6 / name-your-cheap motel than this place again.  And by the way, other options are available very near this location.  My 2 friends and I were staying there for a week.  We asked for a fold out bed, it never materialized.  We were in a room for the handicap so our bathroom consisted of a big open shower.  No fridge.  The coffee machine was broken and we found some disgusting remnants in it.  It had a HDTV, but none of the channels were HD ... so why bother having a HD TV?  The air quality of the place wasn't great.  Because there is a indoor pool and a water park, the air was rather humid.  We walked around a bit and the indoor jacuzzi was broken.  A day after we arrived, the vending machine was broken.  Then we found the guest laundry ... which were only 1 washer and 1 dryer.  I can't comment on the water park.  We took a look and didn't feel like paying $10 for entry.  On one day, my friend asked for an extra blanket because I was sleeping on the couch.  It never materialized until I asked for it again later that day.  My friend called for extra towels and a few hours later, they were never delivered.  Room cleaning service was a bit erratic.  There was no consistent pattern of when they will arrive.  A friend of mine was sick and stayed in the room for a few days and he said he didn't put a Do Not Disturb sign out, but no one knocked to service the room.  The BEST thing about the hotel?  The Wifi was very stable.I wish I had read reviews before purchasing the Living Social coupon. To sum it up, completely horrible experience all around. Had I not prepaid, we would have left after one night.  Next time, we will spend a bit more and go to Great Wolf Lodge.We were seriously surprised at how nice this Holiday Inn was.  I am not a fan of H.I. but this one held up pretty well.  The rack rate was $90 to $119 but we only paid $39 plus tax so I could afford to be surprised.The hotel is huge.  Parking was difficult despite having a very large lot.  Fortunatly our room was on the first floor not far from check in.  The  beds were very comfortable but the bathroom was a bit small.  The remote control did not work well - you could channel down but not up.  The H.I. toiletries have come up a step or two in the past few years.  I even hung on to the soap that had a nice citrius fragrance.There are several restaurants, an indoor pool and waterpark at the hotel.  I'm not into kids but they really don't seem to have taken over the public areas so the Caribbean Cove thing didn't bother me.If you can snag a bargin on the Holiday Inn, it is a decent choice in this neighborhood.  There are lots of  restaurants in the area and it is just off I465.Do not stay here. This is not a three star facility. The rooms are small and the facility is old and DIRTY. It is near a busy and noisy street (Michigan Road and I-465). The walls between rooms do not act as a sound barrier.  I had to call the desk twice about noise in the halls and the room next door. The police had to ask them to quiet down. It took repeated calls to get a roll-a-way. The roll-a-way was uncomfortable and we had to buy an air mattress. The bed sheets were torn and were not changed during our stay. The ice machine was broken. The towels are like sandpaper. The bathroom was not cleaned during our stay.Booked a suite, only to find upon opening the door that it was under construction. Really?! How could you not know that. They gave my sister and I adjoining rooms that were meh. No kitchen area which is why we originally wanted the suite. The manager was nice. Gave us free waterpark wristbands and had a refrigerator brought up. Bottom line- room: overpriced and meh. Restaurant: (breakfast buffet) wayyyy overpriced for the quality of food. Runny eggs and no toast or bread of any kind. It's a breakfast buffet!!! $9.99 per person NOT including drinks.  Waterpark: brr. Cold. My four yr old was shivering. No fun at all. Hot tub could not have been over 80 degrees.  Frustrating because there isn't an alternate indoor waterpark option in the Indy area.I came here because of the Caribbean Cove Waterpark. Which was fun but not as large as I thought it would be. My room on the other hand was a disapointment.  It was so tiny for 200 bucks I think I could have had way better. It was noisy people in the hall making noise in the middle of the night. Worst room in the place in my opinion. View of parking lot, curtains didn't close. Headlights shining on me while I'm trying to sleep. If I'm in this situation again I will ask to be moved to a different room. Seriously this was shitty and a waste of 200 plus dollars.The big draw at this Holiday Inn is the Caribbean Cove Water Park that is part of it. Rooms were adequate in general, but the beds were substandard, particularly the sleeper couch the kids were using. I know not to expect much from a sleeper couch, but this was pretty bad. The ""kids eat free"" slogan is, as expected, a scam. They charge the adults more than enough to make up for it. The rooms appeared to be refurbished not too long ago while the water park and lobby are additions.",,,,"['accompanied', 'boss', 'night', 'mid', 'week', 'business', 'trip', 'disappointed', 'high',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/indianapolis-marriott-east-indianapolis,Indianapolis Marriott East,3.0,$$,40,"I came to this hotel for a three-day conference. I got here early and was able to check in at 11:00 am the day it began. The staff was welcoming, very polite, and more than willing to help any way the could. I called the front desk a few times and they answered my questions, even the difficult ones! The rooms super clean and the beds are comfy! I know it's a little pricy, but you certainly get what you pay for.Wow, had not been to Marriott East in a few years.  Had to be there this afternoon/ evening for a board training.  Great transformation!   Very nice meeting room.   Good buffet dinner ( gluten free options).   Not that I was able to use it, but the lobby bar was totally happening at 8 pm when our training let out.   Lots of energy!I attended an event in one of the conference rooms this past weekend. Finding new event spaces is always interesting. The space was OK. Service was around thought the event and worked hard to serve the guests. There was an area to dance, hang up coats, have an open bar and areas to have appetizers. There is also a great space outside of the room to have a check-in area. If you are looking for a small-to-medium room to have an organizational event or wedding reception, etc, this may be the place for you.Checked in late on a Sunday night after a 9hr drive. We were for some reason booked for a king room and the gentleman Rob at the desk spent 5min staring at the screen trying to find a room for us. He was extremely nice and engaging and the hotel was relatively empty but despite being an Elite rewards member we were put on the 2nd floor in an old room that had not been renovated.   The room itself is very dated but was overall comfortable. The bathroom is tiny, with barely any room between the toilet and the bathtub. Even the shower in the bathtub is so low that I could not even get under it despite only being 5'8.   The Beds are very comfortable and the a/c works very well. There is a good selection on TV channels. Overall the hotel does have some nice are areas including the lobby and the courtyard area. I would have liked to see the updated rooms.The Marriott East is a great conference facility and hotel. I was there to attend a work-related leadership summit. The conference facilities are top notch and the food is good, but not great. My double room was smaller than I expected, even compared to mid-range hotels I've stayed at. The bathroom was also small. It really is only just enough space for two people - four people would be crowded. I wasn't able to spend a lot of time exploring the area, but I didn't see a lot of shopping or restaurants, but there are some. You would need to drive to get to anything nearby, and downtown Indy is not that far. The property itself is good enough to recommend for a conference, meeting, or even a personal stay. But you will have to travel a bit for any substantial shopping or dining.I recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend convention (Friday - Sunday).  The main complaints I have with this hotel is with the housekeeping staff and the Skylight Bistro and Wine Bar.Firstly, the housekeeping staff seems to be rushing through each of the rooms.  They neglected to clean the bathroom sink to acceptable hotel standards, leaving a lemon wedge in the sink.  Marriott asks its guests to ""tip"" the housekeeping staff.  If they would do their jobs correctly, the first time -- perhaps.  The Front Desk graciously comped the one night of the stay, and added 10,000 points to my account.  That was nice of them.The second complaint comes from the Skylight Bistro and Wine Bar's, mainly, for not knowing how to properly cook breakfast sausage links thoroughly.  Also the cook preparing the omelets appeared to not know how to make an omelet.  I most likely got a bad case of food poisoning from the sausage links I ate for breakfast on that Saturday morning.  The only bright spot was one of their waiters, Daniel, who waited on me and my companion for our dinners.  Daniel was very attentive to our needs.  He would do anything to make our experience one to remember.The bar is fun, recently renovated and a great area to catch up with friends. The beer selection on draft is local which was perfect to try brews unique to the region. Lunch has a limited menu but some good go-to items including their French onion soup and seasonal salads. Also try the ahi tuna entree!First time staying over night in Indianapolis &amp; if it was not a business trip I'm not sure I  would have picked the Marriott myself but I'm glad they did. The room is actually more than what I expected and I love their outdoor space.Was here for work - and (for whatever it's worth)  I think I'd have a better opinion if I was one of those ""drive in, park, stay inside &amp; order from room service until it's time to leave"" types.Dated and depressed is the best I can offer. In a shitty neighborhood. A shitty neighborhood for Indy, which is not exactly known for effective planning and zoning.I was here to attend a conference working with folks for whom concerns about basic personal safety are exceptional.  I have no earthly idea how the organizers could have knowingly selected this location. Terrible idea. Literally unfathomable.Staff tried to be helpful...but when the neighborhood amenities are what these are...not much mitigation is possible.I spent more time reassuring attendees than anything else; though since my room smelled funny, a fumigation and a dusting was needed and there were strobing lights coming in from the parking lot, my reassurances had limited efficacy.Everything was old, often smelly, and way more well-intentioned than received.Just hope I'm not expected to go back, work-wise, next year;The upgrades to this hotel are great. From the outside it just looks like your average Marriott which from my experiences can be a really good thing or a really disappointing experience.  The restaurant is nice and open in the front lobby. Nice long bar with 3 flat screen TVs to allow you to watch games or whatever your heart desires. All wait staff was extremely kind, attentive and friendly. Food was delicious (especially the Oysters on the half shell and I'm picky!) The front desk was nothing less. I was checked in promptly &amp; given directions twice to get to my room (it was a little bit of a walk through the conference center which as a solo female could be scary).  Arrived to room, clean and simple. Plenty of plugs to get electronics juiced up. Everything you need for an overnight stay on the road.FLEA infestedStayed here a few weeks ago, and woke up the next morning covered in flea bites. Still have some unsightly scars on my stomach from those parasites. I stay at a lot of Marriotts and this is the only property that I will never be staying at again.Staff very friendly and helpful they get a 5 star, rooms clean, nothing special. The restaurant is one to stay away from, nothing special or new, high priced and nothing to back it up. Drinks were expensive and not well made. I don't mind paying $10+ for a good martini.......but it has to be good.Exceptionally clean rooms!  Very impressed with this Marriott.  Friendly staff, secure rooms and floors, great complimentary breakfast and beautiful outdoor patio.  I will definite recommend to friends traveling to Indiana.I've never stayed here but have been here for the past 5 years for a conference.  The hotel is relatively clean, although the decor in the conference area is very dated.  The staff seem on top of serving, quickly removing items from attendees tables when empty.  I enjoy the breakfast of eggs, bacon, and hash browns.  I've never liked the pasta lunch that we usually have the first day of conference.  The pasta is usually over cooked and watery and the sauces are never good.   I usually tend to load up on salad and dessert which is usually excellent.  I was concerned about the look of the water dispensers in each conference room.  They were very dirty.If I could give it no stars, I would. To start, even though each day was charged on my fiance's card housekeeping would come around and tell me that we only paid for the previous night and had to check out now. My fiance was here for work so I was the only one in the room. After I explained that all nights were paid up front the woman stormed off and said ""I go check, I go check."" This happened each day that we stayed here, Thurs-Sun. The same can be said about the Internet. The ""high speed"" Internet was included in our rate but each day when I'd call the front desk, they'd send me over to Tech Support who would the connect me back to the front desk after saying ""well it must not be included in your rate then."" Each day my fiance had to call the front desk and complain about what's going on.Stay downtown if you can, avoid this hotel like the plague.My girlfriend and I came here for a conference. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room that the conference was held in accommodated everyone very well. I liked that coffee was offered with pastries and fruit. The meal served at lunch was heavy on gluten. When we requested a gluten free lunch they gave you the same thing (sandwich meat, vege, and cheese) and said to just avoid the bread on the table. Ummm it was totally weird eating sandwich stuff with no bread at a conference.I spent my time at the Marriott East in the convention area for the Starbase Indy con.  The convention center was nice, but seems to be in need of a spruce up.  Updates all around, furniture, fixtures, room layout could all be renovated.  Having said that, there was plenty of space and many different room sizes to choose from.  The Con was utilizing most to all of the spaces and the hotel was supporting the event nicely.  The hotel staff was friendly and many staff members came thru the various halls asking visitors how they were and checking on needs.  If I was having a convention in the Indy area, I would seriously look into this hotel.Great service! Clean spacious rooms. Free wifi. Easy access to expressway &amp; short ride to Colts Stadium.  Nice pool &amp; court yard. Great little bar in lobby. Starbucks across the street!!  All around great experience.Yea... Between a 3-4 review.. First, I think this location is way better than the Marriott Indy North. The outside is a bit dated at this hotel but the insides have been redone. The bar is great. The rooms and good and this place usually seems to have a lower rate because it's not in the greatest part of Indy. When I was here there was a billiards convention. Oh man... Talk about a freak show.. That was some pretty entertaining people watching while sucking down cold brews at the bar.I'll freely admit that I didn't want to like this place.  I avoid Marriott properties as much as possible...honestly, because I can't stand the family's politics (okay, not a reason to avoid their product....but....) and everything I heard about this hotel told me it was in a part of town you only spend time in if you've lost a bet.  With that as my background ""issues""....The hotel is indeed in a part of town that's lovely to avoid...lots of bad chain restaurants and hotels with that ""if we thought you'd be staying all night we would've changed the sheets sometime this week"" feel.  If, like me, you're spending 4 nights there for a work-related conference, be prepared to rent a car and spend as much time away from this neighborhood as possible.However, the hotel was quite lovely.  It's a bit of a rambling maze; there are old sections and new sections and meeting rooms and conference rooms and no real order to any of them, but the place was clean and well-appointed, the staff was helpful (for the third time since I've been going to Indy since mid-April, my laundry was lost by the hotel...the staff was incredibly helpful and easy-to-deal with and made the situation right), and, shockingly, they had a fitness center that didn't look like a prison weight room.In short, the hotel itself was quite nice...the neighborhood it's in ensured I did my morning run at a solid 30 seconds/mile faster than usual.","NopeRoom was clean, bed was comfortable.  I heard from a guest staying there that they just completed a big renovation, the lobby is very nice, there is a nice big glass fireplace, and a big bar area behind it with big screen tvs.  The breakfast was very expensive, I had a small glass of fresh orange juice and that alone was $6, for a very small glass, the rest of the breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular so $25 for myself for a regular breakfast seems like a lot to me.  The ambiance was nice, and the hotel has a nice contemporary feel.I am on the fence between a 3 and 4 here. I helped coordinate a conference here recently and have mixed feelings. Some of this may improve with the finishing of their renovations. This is going to be long. Here's the breakdown:Location: Not incredibly close to the airport, which was slightly inconvenient for out of town presenters. While it's not a long drive from downtown and areas to go out, there really isn't anywhere to go out nearby. Parking isn't really enough to host several events at once.Staff: The staff was by far the best part of the experience. Super helpful, always prompt (especially the tech staff for the conference rooms), very responsive, and very patient. Even the other staff I walked by greeted me every time they saw me.Conference Facilities: The good news is that there are bountiful conference spaces with rooms that can be divided or connected into one large room. The good news is also the bad news, because this means that your event might be competing with 1-2 other events, and the participants of the other event might be loud and always mingling outside your conference rooms and making it hard to hear. The kitchen was unfortunately quite loud and connected to the rooms we had, and was also distracting. We did notify the staff on the first day and they tried to correct it. There is also a lovely outdoor patio area where we had our reception- this was probably my favorite part.Food: The food was fine, nothing to knock my socks off, but then again, I wasn't in charge of ordering.Rooms: Nice, but oddly organized. Clearly they had one or two previous renovations where they added more rooms, resulting in a ""tower"" of newer rooms on one end that are not at all connected with the rest of the rooms on the other end of the building. TV channel selection was pretty bare. Other facilities: nice pool and hot tub area. Didn't make it to the gym this time.I was staying at this hotel for a convention recently. The rooms are a little over $100 each for a basic double, and the lobby area is VERY nice, so I expected it to be a classy place to stay. However, our first room was CRAWLING with insects; there were ants in the bathroom and on the carpet in the bedroom, and a centipede on the wall above the mirror. We called to the front desk and they switched us to another room--- this one had a HORRIBLE chemical smell and we had to blast the A/C the entire time to keep the air circulating. The rooms are not soundproofed very well so you hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing at all hours. My roommate and I were working at the convention, and both of our attempts to eat at the restaurant was a joke. The first time (dinner) they were busy but not slammed, and we were seated quickly. However, after almost 20 minutes no one came to even take our drink order despite tables around us receiving their service, so we left. The next day we tried it again for breakfast and ordered scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes. We told the waitress that we only had an hour before we had to be at work, so she promised to go put our food in right away. Forty-five minutes later she returned and told us that a bunch of room service orders had come in and they had been bumped ahead of our order, so our food hadn't even begun to get made yet. We were infuriated--- 45 minutes to scramble eggs and fry up some bacon and they couldn't even do that for paying customers? She offered us a shot at the buffet table ($17 a person), which HAD those items on it--- she could've just gone and scooped them onto a plate for us and charged us that way! We didn't want the overpriced buffet, we just wanted a quick breakfast before work. Again, we left without paying--- the food service here is a joke. Our room's smell only got worse as the convention went on, and there was some kind of chemical or allergen used because both of us got very sick with sore throats and coughing as well as dried-out sinuses from having to run the air conditioning all night. However, the hotel was completely booked so we were unable to move to any other room. We heard multiple convention goers complaining of spiders or ants in their rooms as well, and many of the staff complained of sticky, foul-smelling carpets in their room. No idea what's up with this hotel but I am glad that I'm not a local and likely won't have to stay here again anytime soon. VERY disappointed for the price we paid.I have mixed feelings about this Marriott. I only stayed one night so I didn't get to get to see everything the hotel had to offer. However, they are undergoing major renovations so a lot of things are closed off or moved to a different area. For instance, the hotel restaurant was open but rather than a typical dining area a conference room was used.The room was very nice and the staff incredibly helpful. One interesting thing of note was the shower. Rather than a tub with a shower head there was a very large shower stall. The entire bathroom itself was very well done and looked newer than the rest of the room, so I guess it was part of the renovations.Overall not the best place I've stayed but certainly not the worst. Better than most, but nothing incredibly stellar. Maybe it will be much better once the renovations are completed.This Mariott is very nice.  I've only attended conferences here, but have done so multiple times.  I have always found the place to be clean, and the staff is absolutely excellent.  Needless to say, they work very hard.  The food has always been good, but not excellent.  However, I would never expect an excellent banquet lunch.Where do I start?  I started my first day with a new company today.  I woke up this morning feeling so sick and had to drive 9 hours to get to the Marriott.  When I arrived at this hotel I was exhausted and felt miserable!!   I travel a lot for work, and if you are like me you know how miserable it can be to be sick and away from home.  My body ached and I had that headache with every fast movement.  I was checking in and the woman (I think Amanda) realized that I didn't feel well.  She said to me, ""If you need anything, orange juice or anything feel free to give us a call.""  I've been traveling full time for about 8 years and have never heard anything like that before.  So...I got my room keys and made my way out to my car.  The hotel was under construction so there was no ""main"" entrance for me to bring in my things.  I was at my car unloading my humidifier, suitcase, etc when a random worker came to my car with a luggage cart.  He loaded all of my things and showed me to my room then unloaded it all.  I'm telling you what, it was so nice to have this treatment after the way I felt today.  Ready for the kicker!?  So this evening I was chilled.  I turned on my heat but cold air was blowing out.  I called the desk - they are sending someone right up.  When I went to take the ""do not disturb"" sign off the handle, there was a bag hanging from my door.  It was from the hotel.  It contained orange juice, Tylenol, NyQuil, Bayer, and snacks!!!!!  After all of this treatment, it was worth my time to say a few nice things here on Yelp about this hotel.  Thank you to this Marriott for going out of their way to make me feel comfortable.Great food in the bar...far better than you would expect.  The salad with goat cheese and the asparagus (either preparation) were fantastic.Very comfortable, clean rooms with LARGE tvs. They made me want to get a bigger TV at home.  I wish the weather had been better so I could enjoy the patio.The hotel is currently under construction 11/3/11  The room i stayed in was very nice the bed was very comfortable with a nice 42"" flat screen.  They said that they charged for the wi fi but upon checkout I was not charged for it.  The staff was very friendly!  I pricelined this room for a great rateYes the restaurant sucks here but I will save that for a seperate review.The hotel itself is pretty darn awesome, the rooms are spotless and the beds OH MY THE BEDS are the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in!  I don't know what they put on those beds but I felt like I was sleeping in a cloud :).Big flat-screen TVs with limited cable are available for your entertainment.  However, there is no complimentary breakfast (what up with dat?) and internet isn't free either.  But there are free-to-use computers with internet on the first floor and you can always swipe wireless from another hotel (but SHHHHHH lol).We spent two nights at this hotel during a recent trip to Indy.  It wasn't terrible, but was far from a 'nice' hotel.  The walls were  so thin I heard and understood every conversation my neighbors had.The hotel did have a nice gym, but that was the only above average part of the stay.This is normally one of my favorite hotels, but I sure didn't feel like a Platinum Member this time around.  My room was so small I needed a shoe horn to get in.  You can't pull the desk chair out all the way because of the bed behind you. You can use the sink, toilet, and shower without ever moving from one spot. Oh, and the TV didn't work either, I had to call for service to get it going again (a cable line was unplugged).But the worst part of the room was the location. It faced the service drive to the convention center.  And apparently the best tme to set up the convention center is late at night/early morning. So the noise of fork lifts going back and forth went on til past midnight. And no need to worry about a wake-up call because the garbage truck emptying the dumpster will get you up at 2:45 am.My worst stay ever.The new JC Marriott in Indy is amazing. The staff goes above and beyond to help people and the room was always in excellent shape. Would have liked to have the ice machines on my floor, but the very upscale workout facility makes it all worthwhile.I didn't stay at this Marriott, but ate dreadful meals there.  The first meal I ordered was a cheeseburger with mushrooms.  I requested no bun, no onion strings, no condiments as I am allergic to wheat.  The first time it came with all three.  The second, without most of the onion strings, and with all of the condiments.  They had just put another piece of cheese on the burger and put it back on the grill so it still had pieces of bun and condiment under the cheese.  It was burned.  The third time, they redid the burger, put the condiments on the plate but on the side, and poured the wheat based gravy all over the burger.  The four time, the burger still had condiments on it, but everything else was on the side.  REALLY?  This was a $14 burger.......dreadful.  My other meals were not any better.  Avoid this place at all costs.  The diner, ""Four Seasons,"" is walking distance (around the corner), and much better quality.You'll love it here!  Stayed for 3 nights while on business in Indy recently - the friendly service, beautiful room, nice fitness center and deliciious food (try the shrimp appetizer!) were fantastic.  Try it next time you need a hotel in Indy.We stayed here for two nights in May to visit family. It just wasn't good. The breakfast buffet was terribly expensive. Our room was loud and over looked the highway. The airconditioning unit kicked in every 45 minutes or so and was terribly loud. The hotel was jam packed with a traveling soccer kids. I wouldn't stay again.This is an average hotel with a friendly front desk staff and an awesome concierge level staff. Hotel was being renovated but did not seem to be an inconvenience. The pool was nice and big and so was the jacuzzi but unfortunately the jets were not working when were there. The towels for the pool are small and thin. The courtyard area in the middle of the hotel is a nice with plenty of tables and chairs to relax in.The rooms are beautiful, comfortable etc. but my family and I pretty much only saw the inside of the toilets after eating in their restaurant. After having the chicken quesadilla, all three of us were violently ill all night, to the point where we had to go to Urgent Care for shots. I realize that food poisoning can happen anywhere, but the staff at the Marriott didn't seem to care about our 8+ hours of hell enough to even recommend an Urgent Care to us.We didn't get food poisining, but we were here for a three day convention. First day at the restaurant, wait staff was extremely dis oriented, kept running back and forth, but forgot simple things like a spoon for your soup!Second day was the worst, we made it through breakfast and lunch ok, but then we made the mistake of thinking about getting dinner. They would not even seat you, an they had alot of empty tables, and YOU HAD TO WAIT TO BE SEATED. They claimed the kitchen was behind due to being overwhelmed with the crowds. We finally got seated after going to front desk and speaking to a manager, because the restaurant staff said they would get a manager and that was another 20 minutes, with no manager in sight.We got served and were out of there in 20 minutes after finally being seated after a 45 minute wait. We spoke to other people, and there are one party seated before us, and 1 hour later they were still waiting for their wat staff to take their order in 5 minutes was what she told them. YIKES, we won't be going back. Rooms were great, newly remodeled, facilities were in good shape, but no way will I eat at this place again.A fabulous place to stay! Very comfortable rooms and pleasant grounds - pool, large patio with comfortable seating.  Very friendly staff. Restaurant server Travis is especially friendly and takes pride in his work. Great job! The hotel is undergoing a large renovation, but it is still definitely.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-indianapolis-downtown-on-the-canal-indianapolis,Residence Inn Indianapolis Downtown on the Canal,4.5,$$,22,"The residence Inn at Canal Street is a very nice hotel with direct access to the Kanau center located short walk to circle center nice amenities wonderful place to stayWhen searching Indy hotels for a two bedroom suite, you really don't have two many choices super close to downtown. Therefore, I was happy to find that this RI had both the layout and price we were looking for!It's a standard Residence Inn with clean rooms, solid (included in the price) breakfast, and nice location. Our two bed suite had a full kitchen, two bathrooms, two bedrooms and a decent sized living room. In my 2.5 year old's eyes, though, the best part was looking out her hotel room window and seeing the ducks and the fish swim in the canal below us! Parking was easy in, easy out and all the staff I encountered were pleasant and helpful. If I find another need for a 2 bedroom in Indy, I'd surely stay here again.I agree with the other reviewers that this hotel is a boon for the area. The canal is probably the best amenity. It is always busy with ""tourists"" and fitness minded coeds. The local kiddos seem to enjoy the ducks and the goldfishes which surface in droves when summoned with tender vittles. Similarly, the residents from across the canal also seem to surface when summoned by the Tinder coeds as they come jogging along the path in droves.I can honestly say the management go out of their way to accommodate while often adding a personal touch that even the category 6 hotels in town completely miss the paddle boat on. The accommodations are decent and fairly spacious especially given the price. The desk and is convenient to get some work done. However, on the negative side, the queen bed is to a bit small for a couple. As usual with the Residence Inn, you get all of the common amenities (fridge, dishwasher, microwave, cooktop, although no oven, so the local pizza delivery is your best option for baked goods, which is fine for me because burnt frozen pizza is my speciality).Update: Dinging one star for very bad internet. In this day and age there is no excuse for crappy Internet.We loved this hotel!  Fantastic location on the beautiful canal in downtown Indianapolis.  The service was excellent - Conner helped me (and several other guests) tremendously when I was trying to print some information.  He did this while at the same time helping several other people who were requesting his assistance, all without missing a beat and being extremely polite.The location is convenient to everything downtown - shopping, restaurants, Lucas Oil Stadium, and Victory Field to name a few.  The rooms were very comfortable and updated, and the hotel hosts a nice social with food and drinks Monday - Wednesday, and a decent breakfast every morning.  All is all a great place to stay in downtown!!Friendly,helpful staff ( especially Connor at the front desk). Loved the amenities as we had a fridge, kitchen, etc. great view of the canal- great location! Brought bikes to ride on the canal walk. Would stay again in a heartbeat!Very helpful, they switched my room for me and even remembered to bring my cell phone charger which I had left plugged in in the old room.They serve breakfast everyday. The rooms are big and the place is nice and quiet. Even when it is full of people I can't hear anyone in the adjacent rooms.Staff was friendly, and the location is great right on the canal. We sat outside on the patio off the lobby at sunset and it was beautiful. Breakfast was also good. Only downside was this hotel only offers queen size beds in all rooms, no king size beds.Kind employees, clean rooms, perfect location right off of the canal...I mean do you need more? Our room had a kitchen, bedroom with queen bed, and a pull out bed in the living room.  The pull out wasn't the comfiest, but when are they?  The breakfast was fine.  Scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, sausage, baked goods, fresh waffles, french toast...the usual.  Since the room was a bit costly, I wish parking had come along with it.  I mean it is right in the city, so parking will cost you a pretty penny.Super nice hotel. They are almost like little apartments! They have a whole kitchen including silverware, dishwasher,  and fridge. It also have a living area detached from the bedroom. This hotel is right on the canal. Many of the rooms have views. The hotel has activites. I think on certain nights they have cookouts, etc. Mostly during the week. There is a pool and pool table downstairs. Nice common patios to sit out on. I recommend this hotel for a stay in Indianapolis.This place was my home base for four days when I visited Indianapolis for business.My single queen bed room was actually a mini-suite, complete with a little kitchen and living room area. The bed was comfy, the pillows were plentiful, and I even had a view of the canal. The staff were exceptionally friendly and not at all stuffy. A solid experience through and through.I took advantage of both the fitness room and the pool area during my stay, and both were small but definitely sufficient for my needs.There was always coffee out (very appreciated) and cookies served in the afternoon. A complimentary breakfast was laid out every morning.What's lacking from this place are the fineries. The little touches. There were no mints on the pillows, no treats or minibar in the room, no room service. In the lobby there's a small ""market"" with refrigerated foods and basic toiletry items, but the room itself is utilitarian.My one real complaint is at least one hallway smelled quite musty. If I'd been assigned a room off that hallway, I would have requested a room change.Residence Inn Indianapolis Downtown on the Canal probably won't blow your mind, but it will cover all your needs and provide a comfortable stay at a great location.Stayed here for a work event.  Parking you have to pay for otherwise the rating would be 5 stars. A great hotel with a exceptional staff. Victoria and Jeannie are amazing, and work to accommodate  your every need.Nothing fancy but a nice place with great service and free breakfast. Overall friendliness of staff and service makes this place a 5 starWas able to stay here at a very affordable rate on New Years Eve. Conveniently located only a few minutes from the busy downtown, it was a great way to enjoy the city without having to pay the high hotel costs. Alyssa at the main desk was very friendly and welcoming. We originally booked a floor with a city view,  but were pleasantly surprised to find they upgraded us to a room with a canal view, which is great to look at out the window. They had the usually amenities, and a decent free breakfast in the morning. The room was very spacious and clean, bigger than the typical hotel room. **a big plus** maybe it was just because it was New Year's, but upon checking in Alyssa told us that they were waiving the $19 parking fee for our stay. This was a great surprise and much appreciated. We would definitely stay here if we ever visited the city again. **Stay here and park in the Mall parking garage if you visit downtown. The garage is about 4 minutes away, and takes only minutes to walk to places downtown. We only paid $2 for 3 hours during dinner rather than the expensive $15 + fees for valet or other lots.I have to agree with other folks and reviews.   Being a person who has stayed in hotels over 70% of my time the past several months - little things annoy me - rude staff, room double booked (yes this happened to me recently with another chain), lack of amenities (coffee, tea, etc..) .  The front desk was very kind and accomodating.     I have never stayed in a Residences Inn and liked the Apartment feel - coupled with have a canal view made my stay enjoyable.Service - GreatAtmosphere - Okay - they are doing soem construction but no dings here for them trying to improve their facilitiesCost - medium but worth itI will stay here again.I was just reading some of the other reviews about this property, and noted that the friendliness/helpfulness of the staff was called out. I'm glad to see that, because that was also what stood out most about this property.  Every single person at the front desk throughout our stay went out of her way to be friendly and helpful. They gave us directions and advice on places to eat. One woman went out of her way to find us milk for our 2 year old. Another gave our son, exhausted from a day of walking the canals in the hot sun, a bottle of gatorade free.  Note: as general advice to other hoteliers -- the friendly and helpful staff make an incredible difference. I will always stay here in the future when I travel to Indy, and will always recommend this place to friends and colleagues. The location is amazing -- right on the canals. The lower level opens right on the canals.  The whole time we were there, we never even needed to exit at the street level. The property itself is typical Residence Inn -- kitchenette, two-room suite, etc. The rooms are fairly small, and the furnishings not terribly exciting -- but they were all very clean and adequate for our family of four. The breakfast was excellent (better than usual extended-stay hotel-quality), and we particularly enjoyed eating our breakfast on the patio overlooking the canals. They also have free light suppers during the week, which we weren't able to partake in.All in all, an excellent place to stay in downtown Indianapolis -- and thanks to the staff and management for being so welcoming!!Front desk staff were helpful the the location was excellent.This 3 star hotel far exceeded my expectations and provided even better than the majority of 4 star hotels that I've been to.  We checked in late past midnight and the lady working the night-shift was amazing.  She was super friendly, checked us all in promptly and got all of our requests promptly.  All room service requests were answered immediately.  Free breakfast, free in-room internet, free newspaper, free snacks/dinner on many days of the week.  Amazing.  The coffee was amazing, everything!  I'm definitely remembering this brand.Five stars for an amazing helpful staff that went way beyond expectations during my recent visit.  I'll be back next time I come through Indianapolis.This was a great place to stay.  First off, it's right on the canal - we got a room on the canal level, so the water was about 10 feet from our window - nice and beautiful, seeing the ducks go by every now and then.They provide a nice continental breakfast, with eggs, sausage, cereal, belgium waffles, fruit, juice, etc.  But I also need to give kudos to the staff.  There was a problem with our room - there was an occasional leak from the room above us above the counter in the bathroom, which caused some dripping.  Because of it, the manager gave us free taxi rides to get to and from the theater on Saturday night, which I thought was a good response.  (I'm sure they would have transferred us to another room if we asked, but we didn't want to bother with moving all of our stuff).Also, the staff were great in helping us to find a place to eat.  It was new year's day, and half the places were closed and the other half were booked, but the guy at the desk spent about half an hour calling places for us so we could have a reservation at a good restaurant somewhere.  You are within walking distance of the zoo, downtown, and within a long walk of the Murat theatre, so the location is great.  Being right on the canal was great for us as we love to run, so it gave us a great place to run without having to worry about traffic lights.The staff were wonderful, the location was ideal, and the breakfast was good.  I would definitely stay here again.I stayed here 3 or 4 times while my farther in law was in IU Hospital.  This is a real nice hotel,  Our hotel rooms were always very clean. The staff are great.  Its also within walking distance to downtown which is awesome.  I look forward to going here again soon","I'm a long time Marriott guy. This staff was great! They even do 3 free dinners a week.This place will always have a special place in my  heart.  I essentially lived here for a year, and found the place always clean, the staff always pleasant, and generally a class act all around. I try to make a point of staying here whenever I'm in Indy.  Real close to downtown too, at a nice location with a canal in back of it.",,,,"['residence', 'inn', 'canal', 'street', 'nice', 'hotel', 'direct', 'access', 'center', 'located', 'short', 'walk',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/indianapolis-marriott-north-indianapolis-2,Indianapolis Marriott North,3.5,$$,36,"This hotel is located north-northeast of Indianapolis, about a 25-30 minute drive to downtown.Check in was easy, friendly front desk staff and extremely helpful and efficient.Rooms are not opulent, but they are clean, as are the bathrooms.Internet available, paid or free depending upon your room rate.There is a HUGE parking lot, and parking is free, always a very nice perk.There is a decent restaurant inside the hotel too (Bistro 33) if you get hungry and don't want to venture out. My food was actually pretty spectacular the evening I chose to dine.There are many, many, many, MANY restaurant choices available to you with just about every cuisine you could imagine within a 5-10 minute drive. Also there's lots of shopping available too.The good:Location is excellent, amid a slew of shopping and places to eat. Extremely courteous staff. Nice lobby and public spaces. Plentiful parking.Comfy bed.The mediocre:The rooms are in need of a makeover. I mean badly. Look, I'm not a snob, but the 90s decor hints that this hotel has not had an upgrade in a while. But the real tell was in the room itself. Wallpaper was coming off the walls at the seams. The place had a weird funk about it. And the bathroom sink and tile was cracked, and obviously so for some time. Hey, I'm not saying the room looked like the aftermath of a stay by The Who, but a property of this caliber should be more up to date in its interiors. One more thing. The typical price gouging on WiFi. Once you ponied up for it, it works well. But $9 a day is just obscene, especially when the Hampton Inns of the world give it to you for free. So the more you spend for a hotel room, the more likely they're going to charge you for WiFi. Will the hotel management gurus of the world explain to this weird approach to pricing? I'd really like to know. You'd think the business travelers of the world would rise up as one and demand better treatment, rather than shrug their shoulders and expense it.Really OLD, not like a typical Marriott.  Guest rooms are right out of 1988.  I arrived and my tv wasn't working in the room.  Had to move rooms.  Old beds hurt my back which no bed has ever done before. Cracks all over the popcorn ceilings. Overall just a bad stay in a very outdated hotel.  Don't let the lobby fool you.  I love Marriott but will never stay here again.Very average experience overall during my recent stay.  My company has a negotiated rate with this hotel, typical procedure is to mention the rate at check-in, provide proof that you work for my company and you receive the negotiated rate.I mentioned the rate during check-in and was told it was not available since there were conventions and events in town.  Wait...what?  I was then told that they had rooms available for $269.00 per night, so the rate I had booked at ($179.00) was actually a very good deal since there were very few hotel rooms open in Indianapolis.Okay....but what about the negotiated rate I am supposed to get?  I spoke with the manager and he informed me that no, I would not be receiving a locally negotiated rate.  Whenever the hotel is experiencing high occupancy, they don't honor negotiated rates.  So it sounds like they charge inflated rates whenever there are events in town and that's that.  I know that sort of thing goes on all of the time, but it seems ridiculous.Once I got online, I checked Marriott's web site and it showed rooms available at the JW downtown for $237.00 per night...so I guess the $269.00 rate at the Marriott North wasn't actually a very good rate at all.The door knob on my room was broken. The door still closed properly, but you had to adjust the knob to get the door to unlock.  The towels and toiletries provided are on par with a Marriott Courtyard property, not a higher end Marriott property.My room was clean, the bed was comfortable and it was pretty much a typical one night hotel stay.  But the issue about the room rate was a bit irritating.Located near Keystone at the Crossing. Popular location for conferences. Food served at event is some of the better food I've had through hotel catering. The decor could not use a little updating. Conveniently located to shopping and entertainment venues. If you're an independent movie fan very close to Keystone Arts Cinema.Excellent staff but the facilities are very outdated.  I requested a room change because the tile in my bathroom was broken and rather gross.  Also, the exercise facility is terrible - a small room with a handful of treadmills and some free weights.  I've stayed at much nicer marriott's in the past.  But, again, excellent staff.I made reservation days ago for 2 queen beds, late check in etc. we arrive late and get our room only to walk in and find one queen bed for a family of 5. Back down to lobby and they offer a rollaway bed!?! Seriously look at the reservation! Just because you overbooked I get screwed!?!? Nice business Marriott! It will be my last visit - just stayed in Times Sq and booked a night in Chicago that I will now cancel.We stay at the Marriott @ Keystone @ the Crossing every month when we travel to Indy for business. You stay at this hotel for the incredible staff #1 and the location #2. From the hotel manager to the concierge, housekeeping crew to the hostess, manager and chef at the restaurant - they all stand out (every stay) as friendly, caring, responsive &amp; professional. The facility itself, is tired, but the caliber of staff and level of service more than compensate. Thank you Keystone Marriott staff for always taking great care of us! PS rooms are quiet and very clean, beds are super comfortable, and the coffee, omelette bar &amp; breakfast buffet are excellent.Great location near shopping and restaurants.  Staff is very accommodating and there are 2-4 smiles to greet you in the lobby at all times.  The lobby is staffed so that if you are entering the hotel, coming down from the rooms, or coming back from the conference rooms, someone is always there to say good morning, good afternoon, good night, or have a nice day!  So many pleasant staff members.  The food served at the many meetings I have attended has always been above and beyond what I expected.  The rooms are modern with current technology and very spacious.  The beds are super comfortable and will make you want to stay forever.Great hotel, great staff, I will be back!My husband and I, along with our two small children, stayed at this hotel over the Labor Day weekend. In town for a family wedding, we extended our stay to enjoy the long weekend. Our experience at the hotel itself was pleasant and comfortable.Unfortunately, BED BUGS came home with us. Nightmare. Our lives have been turned upside down trying to rid our stuff and home of these nasty little bugs. Kids covered in bites, furniture ruined... it is awful. We believe that we got them from this hotel. There are more than two bed bug registries that make claims of bed bugs at this hotel.The concerning thing is that after multiple conversations with staff members, managers and their claims department, Marriott argues that since there haven't been other reports of bed bugs in the hotel, we can't prove anything and they are unable to help with the replacement of our stuff or the reimbursement of our stay. Heads up... this was our experience and continues to be an issue in our home. We are frustrated.Having stayed in many a Marriott, this one is par for the course. Clean rooms, exceedingly friendly staff, and nice view.The problem is that you pay for the nice view with it being isolated from a lot of things. You do have a 10 minute walk to the mall nearby and outside of that, the other side of the hotel faces the highway which is not much to look at.The property is also a bit old - it's not the JW Marriott downtown, but you're also having to consider that you can find a good deal at this property and still be within 20 minutes of driving for most locations in Indy.This Marriott really surpassed my expectations.  The entrance with it's marble flooring was impressive, but the view of the lake in  background took it over the top.  The staff is dedicated to providing every guest with the finest personal services possible.  Everyone makes you feel at home. My room was extra large with a floor to ceiling widow with a view of the lake.  The bathroom was all marble and large as well, but what I loved the most was the bed or should I say mattress.  The  pillows were unbelievable comfortable and the mattress was the perfect feeling of soft with a hard feeling.  Actually, we did a lot of walking and bike riding and I found myself looking forward to getting a good night sleep.  I am looking into buying the mattress for my home.One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff here went above and beyond and were so helpful. I arrived here on a disaster business trip including lost luggage, botched hotel reservations at another hotel, you name it. In passing I told the front desk clerk how terrible my day had been. Later that evening, the front desk clerk called and said she knew I had a long day and offered me a complimentary glass of wine or dessert. I've never had a hotel do that!The beds were so comfortable, the bar and restaurant were great. Within a comfortable walking distance to the fashion mall. I would come back to Indy just to stay here!One of the best business hotels I've stayed at. The room is huge. They have a table you can use, they have fast internet connection and its just perfect for business travel. They provide a nice TV with almost all the channels you would usually want. This probably the biggest single bed room I've ever seen of all the Marriott's. They have a fitness center, swimming pool and a Jacuzzi. The property is at a very nice location right by the lake. The view out of the window is pretty good from the 5th floor. The service is amazing and everybody at the reception are very professional the way the handle things.My most recent visit was for a meeting, but I think I did stay here before. The property is located on a large pond, and some rooms have a nice view. I remember that my room had a view of the water, and I think I even had a small terrace. I do have good recollections of my stays and visits here. It's located in the Keystone Crossings area, near the Fashion Mall and not far from Castleton Square Mall. There is a TON of shopping and dining options nearby. This hotel is located in a hotel/office complex next to the mall, and the area is safe. Recommended.The room was very outdated--looked like it hadn't been remodeled since the early 1980s. Despite that, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. However, the HVAC was not working properly--I called maintenance and they sent someone who re-started the system, but I still could not get the temperature in the room to match the thermostat. Little tip on the in-room coffee maker: it looks like there is a part missing, but the tray for the coffee pod is actually disposable and comes in the coffee package. The hotel staff was very responsive and courteous throughout my stay, which makes this review 3 stars vs. 2 (the hotel itself only merits 2 stars for the condition for the relatively high price paid). When I checked out, I mentioned the problems I had with the heat in the room and the front desk person showed appropriate concern and said she would put some extra reward points in my account (which she did). Other notes: parking is free, internet is $9.99/day, and the proximity to shopping at Keystone Mall is great.Our rate wasn't too pricey compared to other hotels of this caliber: $129/per night, per room over Labor Day weekend.  We got a few perks which definitely made the stay a little nicer, starting with a high floor room with a balcony overlooking a large, pristine man-made lake.  The hotel's proximity to the nearby fashion mall, ""Keystone at the Crossing"" is a bonus.The hotel itself is attractive on the inside but won't win any style awards from architecture magazines.  Typical early 1990s style brass and granite interiors.My room (#813) was nice.  No noticeably worn furniture or wall coverings.  I could have used an additional power outlet near the desk, but I simply unplugged the coffee pot to add my laptop.  The bed linens were simple, clean and attractive.  AH, THE BED.  In a word: the best hotel bed I've ever had.  It was one of those iComfort foam beds.  Wonderful.  They even have a large brochure for purchasing the actual bed linens, pillows, bathroom accessories and mattresses.The bathroom was clean and efficient.  The designer shower head was a nice touch, as were the Aromatherapy brand toiletries and soaps.  Then again, for a hotel like this, anything less would be a letdown.The breakfast buffet was decent: waffles and omelets made to order, cereals, fresh fruit, hot tray items like eggs Benedict and bacon, etc.The pool and workout areas are very nice; the pool is much larger than you'd expect for a corporate hotel, though it's not a lap pool nor deep enough (3 ft-4 ft) to allow for any real swimming.  The hot tub was...well, HOT.  The workout room has a range of good equipment: LifeFitness brand machines--treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machine, etc.  There are also containers of water in the fridge and a fruit bowl available.The staff was fine.  Shoutouts to Margie Kay and Derrick for the humor and perks.Service was great; quick check in, very friendly bartender, etc. I've got to knock this place because it is so dated. Def not up to par with other Marriott hotels I stay at. First, let's start with the bathrooms. These seem as if they've never been updated since this place was built. From the floors, to the counters, to the wallpaper in there.. Ugh. They don't use those newer shower curtains that easily snap on and off so they can clean them. Mine had hairs and some other questionable ""stuff."" Gross... The rest of the room... The carpet must have been replaced and the beds are your typical Marriott beds. However, the TV's seem awfully small for a Marriott. Yes they're flat screens but really small. Oddly, my hallway smelled really bad. If I had to make a guess.. The owner of this property doesn't give Marriott much to work with in terms of capital for remodeling the rooms.Pluses: big rooms, friendly staff. Negatives: NOT kid friendly. Very noisey hallways, ice machine empty, horrible music blasting from ""a restaurant across the lake"". No free wifi or fridge in the room. Considering it's $$$ to stay this really surprised me.  Meh. I'll stick with Holiday Inn.I am a big fan of Marriott. You know you will be taken care of at any of their locations.  From the time you walk in until you leave, you will be welcome. The beds at this hotel are perfect and its very clean. The location is on the North side. For me it works out great. Lots of nice places to eat right around the corner. Its perfect.","I've stayed at this hotel a couple of times for my company Christmas party.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.I've also been to a couple of buisiness conferences here.  The catering is always good!One issue was with vehicle theft.  Several cars were broken in to at one of our Christmas parties.  Never leave anything in plane site and you shouldn't have a problem.I stayed at this hotel last week for a business conference.  When I woke up after the first night I had 5 bug bites on me and found one (alive) in my bed.  I packed and went down to the front desk for a different room.  they placed me on the same floor and that room also had a bug of some kind (small) so I did not unpack.  I promptly when down and checked out of the hotel.  My associate also check his room and his bed had several bugs also.  Hotel staff hurried and changed all the bed linens before they had a supposed exterminator inspect the room.  Hotel management said they found no bugs.  I was under the impression from staff that I would not be charged but I checked today and was charged for the room.  I called the hotel again and they stated that since they did not find the bugs that I would be charged.  After on the same evening the hotel attempted to put another conference attendee into the same room I was in.For the price, this was fantastic.  Great people, awesome service, comfy beds, quiet rooms.  Arrived late after room service was shut down - the desk clerk got me a snack to take up to my room.I'll be staying there every trip to Indy.One of my favorite business hotels. Very comfortable beds, exceptional service. Elevators are awesome. There is always at least one waiting on the lobby floor, with maw open in expectation.  Why don't all elevators work this way?Yeah, the hotel is a little tired stylistically and architecturally but it is very clean and well maintained. Wifi is slow.  But this is clearly a five star hotel when compared with others of like kind and quality.Great place for out of town wedding guests.  The lobby is gorgeous and seems more like something you'd find in Florida than suburban Indiana.  The proximity to the mall helps for anything you forgot at home, or just to kill sometime.The rooms are typical Marriott quality: nice, clean, comfortable but not necessarily memorable.We had a tuxedo get left in a room that caused some drama.  The staff picked it up, thankfully, but lost it inside the ""lost &amp; found"" closet (go figure) so it took an extra day and a little bit of nervousness before it was returned safely to Mens Wearhouse.The Marriott is a little pricey, so I would recommend offering another less expensive option for guests on a tight budget.  There are plenty nearby.My wife and I stayed here on or first anniversary. While checking in I happened to mention that fact when I asked about any special rooms they might have, with a jacuzzi or something like that. The friendly clerk at the desk said they didn't have anything like that, but he did put us in a room with a balcony.Later that night, at about seven, there was a knock on the door. The gentleman had a tray with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, "" compliments of the house"". Quite a nice surprise.Our stay was wonderful, and if we stay in Indianapolis again, we'll be staying here!I love this place!  I first stayed here for a conference, and was astonished by how smoothly the staff made the whole conference go.  During intermissions of conference sessions the staff were very accommodating in providing ringing soft bells when it was time for the next session to begin.  The staff also let us know when the lunch selections that we had chosen for the buffet luncheon would not ""hold"" for the last of the attendees, they upgraded the food choices at no cost.  The staff are truly wonderful!The rooms are quiet, clean, and spacious.  The beds are heavenly soft.  Great location!  Moments from great shops and dining.  Anytime I need to stay in Indy I stay here.I'm gold, so perhaps got special treatment. Very warm reception. Got upgraded. Room too cold. Lounge is very good.I stay in many Marriott's and this is rated in the top 3. Wow great place and the staff is secon to none. I would give an bonus 5 more stars if I could.This hotel should get 6 stars.  I was here in business.  I generally don't sleep well at hotels.  But the beds were out of this world comfortable.  But the best part is the awesome service.  I know they have won an award for best Marriott in 2009 and I can see why.I was down having breakfast and one of the managers asks me how my stay is... point number 1.  Then we just start talking and he asks me what room I am in.   I tell him everything is fine and please don't do anything special for me.  But... I come home from meetings and there on the bed is a tray with an ice bucket filled with 2 beers and a personal note from Brian the manager.  I am so touched that he remembered me and took this extra step.The entire stay was like this, I felt like I was staying in a 5-star resort.  I just can't say enough good things about this hotel and I believe your stay will be great too.My in-laws gave us a gift certificate for a free night at the Marriott.  We stayed there one night during our last trip.  We were upgraded to a slightly larger room.  We had a view of the lake and Saks.  The room itself was nice.  The bed was uber comfortable.  The bathroom was good too (great shower, spacious).  The work-out facilities had much to be desired.  It was pretty bad.We had an enjoyable breakfast.  It was a buffet of typical breakfast foods.  The service was outstanding.  We also had outstanding service the night prior at the bar.I loved staying here. Quiet, peaceful and just pretty. Great shopping nearby and good eateries. We stayed here for MOTOGP this past weekend! Great breakfast buffet and just great bed for a good nights sleep.Friendly accommodating staff, clean rooms and free parking. What else do you need?Nice place, great heated indoor pool, good food, fast room service and nice view of lake.Clean, nice location, affordable, good customer serviceI must say that I was very impressed with the Marriott North at Keystone Crossing.  The hotel is extremely nice and very well maintained.  The staff is so helpful and always had a smile on their face.  I was here for a wedding and it was gorgeous out on the terrace and I would definitely stay here again when I'm in Indianapolis.  And it's very close to Keystone Shopping Center which is a definite bonus in my book!",,,,"['hotel', 'located', 'north', 'northeast', 'minute', 'drive', 'downtown', 'check', 'easy', 'friendly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-indianapolis-keystone-indianapolis-2,Hyatt Place Indianapolis/Keystone,3.5,$$,26,"I travel a lot for work and spend over 100 nights a year in hotels. I switched this year from Marriott to Hyatt.  While a full-service hotel is always nice, and full service  Hyatts have great fitness centers.  However, I have fallen for Hyatt Places lately based on cost and amenities. This is my fourth time at the Keystone Crossing Hyatt Place.  It is the only one in the country that offers cookie crumbles at night!!!  Lots of great things here - near great shopping, good chain restaurants, one of the best free breakfasts a hotel has to offer, a clean work out room (no weights, but cardio), large comfortable rooms with refrigerators.  I have not noticed the freeway noise that others mention, but most hotels seem to have that problem because of convenient locations.Overall this is a nice hotel and the prices are affordable. Issues I had were specific to me. Ice maker on 4th floor didn't work, spent 3 nights here and not once was my room cleaned. In fact the last night there I went to front desk to ask for more bath towels, I told the staff at front desk that I needed new towels because my room wasn't cleaned again and the staff never apologized or asked why. Breakfast was OK, first day the scrambled eggs were burnt, to the point the color of them were yellow and brown, how do you not notice that?Just stayed there this weekend. Only One elevator worked. Hall carpets dirty. Have stayed there numerous times in last few years. Going down hill. Was going to have meeting there in October taking 40 rooms but now looking elsewhere.All of my hotel stays prior to my check in at this Hyatt Place have been non-work related, however this time, I have been sent to town for job training. I'm used to a certain comfort when returning home to my personal space, after work, but wasn't sure what to expect here. A proper greeting is always among the first ways to make a guest feel welcomed. I felt welcomed within seconds of walking through the doors. Trays stacked with chunks of cookies baked in-house, sat atop the front desk. Smiles and a bit of humor completed my prompt check-in. Yep, I had a feeling my stay here would be a good one. After taking my luggage to my room, I didn't waste any time making my way to the mall, just a short walk across from the hotel. Various restaurants and shops are in walking distance or just a short drive away. It's very easy to get familiar with the general area. From downtown Indianapolis, to the areas of Broad Ripple and the Carmel Arts and Design District, I enjoyed several breweries, sports bars, county parks and the popular Monon Greenway. The staff was very helpful at recommending places to go and things to do. I actually spent time, every evening at  the bar or lobby. The consistent acknowledgement day after day and willingness to engage in conversation made me feel like a welcomed friend, not someone just passing through. Yes. My room was clean and bed comfortable. Yes. Breakfast was good. Overall, I like the hotel. My experience was made above average, because some staff members were able to establish a rapport with me and remain professional. I want to especially acknowledge Brittany, James, Detra, and Jasmine for their excellence in customer service. They are the stars in this review:)My family and I stayed here on Butler University's family weekend. Five of us shared a suite with two queen beds and a pull out sofa for two nights. The room and bathroom was clean and modern. It was a bit crowded for the five of us, with limited bathroom sink space. With us all being girls, we had to resort to other mirrors on the desk and on the closet doors to do our make up. The living area with the pull out coach was nice, but there was a wall separating that from the bedroom area that seemed more of a nuisance than a benefit.The TV was placed right across from that wall, making it hard for everyone in the room to see it at one time. The pull out coach was surprisingly comfortable, as I got a wonderful nights sleep both nights. However, there was some sort of red spot on one of the bed spreads that was kind of concerning. I went down to the lobby around 9 o'clock at night to get some coffee for my mom and I and the service was extremely pleasant. The attendant even went searching for more of my favorite flavor of cream. I wasn't there for check in but my sisters told me that there were fresh baked goods served upon arrival that were delicious. The location was perfect! It was not a far drive from Butler, and conveniently located right behind the Keystone Fashion Mall. It would be the perfect hotel for a shopping getaway. My family and I did not take advantage of the continental breakfast, but considering the baked goods and quality service, I'm sure it was decent.Have had no internet all week. Called and mentioned this to the front desk. My computer notification said that the problem was on the router end. They tried to give some suggestions ...nothing worked. They never did check back with me to see if I was successful in connecting. I can connect everywhere else so I am very confident it is not my computer.Great experience here. Clean room, pleasant staff. Like the couch separate from the beds. Good breakfast. Convenient location.I have stayed here multiple times for business. The staff is always friendly and accommodating no matter what time I check in. The rooms are spacious and clean. You may even find a treat in your room if you're the lucky guest (cookies!) Yup! I'm talking about those cookies they put out at night.. Every morning you will find the newspaper waiting for you in front of your door and the hotel offers free breakfast. And it's not just bagels.I did stay for business purpose and I was very please with the room and the friendly staff. The room I took was huge and very clean. They also offer Starbucks brewed coffee, it doesn't get it better then that. The location is great with all the surrounding stores and top restaurants. I will stay there again.We recently stayed at the Hyatt Place and were blown away. Not only was it very clean and spacious room, the staff was amazing. I had plenty of room to work and relax in my room. I ordered a flatbread for a late dinner that was delicious and we loved the complimentary breakfast and capuchino.It's been a while since I've experienced superb hospitality. Steve Bart is a prime example of what hospitality  should be! He was friendly, informative and made us feel like a VIP guest. He went above and beyond our expectations!   Overall this was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had!Nice place, clean, convenient, cookies in the eveningStayed here for a business trip for 3 nights and definitely enjoyed my stay.  They have a 24/7 menu that is very convenient for late nights and long hours of work. The room has a separate living room/study room which kind of makes your room like a big suite. The bathroom is clean, the water pressure is fine and the bed is comfortable. The only thing I do not like is that it is close to the freeway so you can hear the freeway noise. Next time , I'm going to ask for a room not facing the freeway.  Also like the location because it is very close to keystone fashion mall. Will definitely stay here again.Nice, clean, spacious rooms. All the employees were super nice and helpful. They would even offer coloring books and crayons to occupy our kids. I'd definitely stay there again.Hey it's not bad. I like Hyatt Place hotels but this one... It's right off the freeway and there is nothing they can do about that. It's noisy if you're trying to get some solid sleep. Service great, breakfast good, cookie crumbles they put out at night... AMAZINGIt's just their location and the noise. Not much they can do about it aside from moving the entire hotel. Oh... and when I checked in all of the trash cans were on the table tops (desk, bathroom counter, etc)... That was odd..This is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. They've thought of everything here. Great breakfast great service great lobby bar you name it they got it stay here!!!!I stayed here for a couple of nights while I was in the area for work. It was a good stay. Clean, spacious room, comfy bed, nice free breakfast, good-quality free WiFi. The highlight for me was on the afternoon of my second day. I was walking down the hall to my room when a hotel employee pushing a cart came by in the opposite direction. The cart had a bunch of plates of cookies on it. She offered me some. Taken aback, I declined. When I came back out of the room a minute later she was still in the area and repeated the offer. ""You're just trying to get rid of these cookies?"" ""Yeah, pretty much."" Well, okay then! They were good, too.I'd stay here again if I were coming to the area.Off to a bad start with the extremely rude person at the front desk.  Plus, with their stupid wifi you have to re-login every single day.  This is a big pain as far as I'm concerned.   Why not make the login last throughout someone's stay instead of making it a pain for your guests?Hopefully, this will improve, as I'm here for 4 days...I've been to a couple hyatt place, and most of them were pretty good, yet i felt quite disappointed @ this one @ indianapolis.  the staff were okay, 1 of them were quite nice, the other one didn't look at us at all and she was the one serving us.  the room was neat as the other ones.  we stayed for 3 nites, they didn't come clean up our room at all on one of the day, didn't change the towel at all; and one of the day, they didn't have water for a few hours without notifying the guests ahead of time.  Their TV channels are fewer than other hyatt place hotels.  1 plus is they had pretty good cookies at night by the front desk for guests.Nice friendly staff and nice clean decent size rooms with a large flat screen (LCD or Plasma- I do not know). Most hotels offer the same for the price, so nothing unusual or stand out here. The one big negative is the lack of drawer storage. There is one deep drawer by the sink and one for toiletries and that's it. On a  3 day business trip there is no place to put underwear, t-shirts, shorts, socks or put electronics out of sight other than in your baggage. TV channels were not all operational and MNF on ESPN was blurry with horizontal/.vertical lines intermittently. Daily  WiFi log in is an inexcusable inconvenience. There is no need for this kind of stupidity in logging in for WiFi. Probably will not stay here again which is a shame because it is a nice location, close to the mall and some great local and chain dining.Can't complain. It's a great hotel for business travelers, with a nice breakfast in the a.m. A little too close to the highway.","Nice large modern room with a giant TV, free wifi, free breakfast. A little close to the highway but otherwise a great place to stay. Recommended.We stay in Hyatt Places whenever possible, and this one did not disappoint.  Although we were only there one night (and we skipped breakfast), the room was clean and quiet, the bed was comfortable, free wi-fi.  Front desk staff was very friendly.  Good location, as well.Always feel weird when I stay at a hotel in my city, but it was New Year's Eve and we thought we'd make a night of it.  Thing is, we ended up not going out at all!  How boring, right?Well, once we walked in and saw how big the bed, living room area+couch and tv were, we decided to order some pizza and treat ourselves to Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist on pay-per-view.  I agree that the bathroom is really tiny and could be a problem for a family, but it makes up for it with a vanity outside the bathroom and another mirrored area in the 'office' space so there is plenty of room to get ready...and who needs that much space to use a toilet anyway? I mean, if you're stretching out on the john, you might want to visit the local prompt care for a thorough exam. The tv is enormous, the bed was pretty sweet, but how often do you get a full living room in a hotel for $80/night?The room was clean and fairly modern.  But, the bathroom was miniscule!  Not to mention, the place is being remodeled and the lobby is in a complete mess.  Further, the construction began at 7 a.m. on a SATURDAY!!   I prefer the Marriott which is in the same area...and the price difference is not that great!Nice rooms with BIG flat screen television; The hotel was remodel nicely, but some older parts still show as the doors and wall switches and outlets. All and all I like the place and it cost to restaurants and coffee.Better than anything else at the price. The free internet was good, especially the upload. Your mileage may vary.This hotel is situated directly on a freeway. Unless you're in a room facing the main parking lot, you can expect to hear trucks pass through your room all night.  The breakfasts were very poor, and the service at the front desk not much better.",,,,"['travel', 'lot', 'work', 'spend', '100', 'nights', 'year', 'hotels', 'switched', 'year', 'full', 'service',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-indianapolis-downtown-indianapolis,Homewood Suites by Hilton Indianapolis-Downtown,4.0,$$,36,"Probably the best location among the city to stay. Staff was amazing, room was awesome, and the free beer before the game was ice cold. I was very overwhelmed by how great this hotel was. I will definitely be back this fall to catch a Colts game. Indy you rock!!This Homewood Suites by Hilton is conveniently located in downtown Indy and is within walking distance (in warm weather) to Lucas Oil Stadium, Circle Center Mall and BankersLife Fieldhouse. This hotel is also next door to several bars and Kilroy's - you have to go there for the breadsticks - YUM!We arrived mid afternoon to check in before heading over to Lucas Oil Stadium for a company party.  We were immediately greeted by the valet when we pulled up in front of the hotel.  The valet's were very friendly ans asked if we needed help with our bags. They opened the doors to the hotel and explained that the inside vestibule would be closed and locked after hours and we would need our key to re-enter. The lobby is large and welcoming. I loved the high ceilings all throughout the hotel. There is a business center, billiards lounge and restaurant all located right off lobby. The billiards lounge is a first come/first serve lounge, but it is only open until 11pm...which was a bummer (apparently there is a guest room that backs up to it). However, it would be great if this was open later just to get away from all the chaos on street and in the bars - just a quiet place to come back and chill and shoot some pool. We were quickly greeted by Tahsa at the front desk who checked us in and added my Hilton Honors # to the reservation.  We grabbed our keys then headed to our rooms. The rooms are spacious and designed very well.When you enter the room you walk into a full kitchen and living room/sitting area, then you have a hallway to the bathroom and bedroom.  The decor is very modern and clean. The sofa was a little hard, but other than that it was very nice - but let's face it who is there to sit on a sofa for that long anyway!  We had a 2 queen bed suite. The beds were comfy and had lots of pillows on each bed. The bathroom is pretty large as well. The only two things I noticed about the bathroom was that the shower head was extremely high on the wall - I'm like 5'7"" and could barely touch it to move it around and there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom, so when the door was shut it got all steamy from the shower.We had a inside facing room, so our room was very quiet. A co-worker of mine had a room that faced the street and she said it was loud and she could hear the activity from the street most of the night.They offer a free breakfast in the morning (right off the lobby) or there are plenty of local restaurants in the area you can take advantage of. The valet is $27 a day (in and out as many times as you need) but don't forget to tip when you get your car each time.Overall a great hotel and would stay here again in the future.Stayed here one night last weekend for a night away. Great location, close to lots of shopping and restaurants, and really cool interior, especially for the price! Only complaint is that the pool was closed for maintenance and I was looking forward to swimming, but no big deal, especially as it was a short trip anyway. Big rooms with full kitchens and cool exposed brick and wooden beams, tall ceilings. Would definitely stay here again!Great rooms, very nice.  Would be 5 stars but our hot water went out during showers on the 29th.  Hilton Honors made it right though.  Great location.  Go!My SO and I travelled from Nashville to see the Pacers game and booked a room here for the night. We chose the room because it was the perfect location being a 2 minute walk to the Fieldhouse for the game. And it seemed to be in the middle of everything--restaurants, bars, shops, etc. We pulled up in front and immediately the valet comes out and takes care of us. The entire staff was very accommodating and friendly. When we realized we had left our tickets in our car they hustled to run and bring them to us.The room was absolutely gorgeous. I've been in a lot of hotels before. Rooms generally look very generic. Always the same. This room was the exception. The exposed brick and wooden beams were stunning. It was also very roomy--king sized bed and seating area with large bathroom and kitchen areas. I joked that I wished my house looked like this. If we are ever back in Indy (probably will be since the man is such a huge Pacers' fan) we will definitely stay here. You can't beat the location or the price.Great staff!  Every single person I encountered staying there for the last 3 nights was great including front desk staff, valet, happy hour/breakfast folks.  They all went out of their way to give me directions, dropped off fresh towels without asking, refresh the coffee etc.Easy walk to the convention center 2ish blocks and you can take a long cut through the Omni if you want to stay inside for 1 of those blocks.  Otherwise, the room was comfy.  And since I always wonder: HDMI and VGA inputs to the TV (hope that helps the geek in you).One of the best hotels we have stayed at on Indianapolis.  Walking distance to just about everything.  The rooms are HUGE!!  So much character in each room as well - from the original buck walls to the wooden beams.  Each suite has a full refrigerator, stove top, microwave, and sink/garbage disposal.  The beds were quite comfortable and the pull out wasn't too bad, either.  Just a couple of downsides - there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom and the elevators are very slow.  There are actually 2 elevators - one off of the lobby and the other at the back (this one only goes to the 4th floor).    The breakfast was fantastic - scrambled eggs, muffins, yogurt, sausage/biscuits/gravy, juices, coffee, hot tea, waffles (chocolate chip AND plain- nice!!), oatmeal, toast, etc.  nice way to start the day.  All of the parking for the hotel is valet ($27/night).  You send a text when you need your car (there is in &amp; out privileges).  It takes about 5 minutes from the time you text.  This is definitely going to be our ""go to"" hotel when we visit Indy from now on.See picture for where you don't want a room. The patrons of the Revel make it sound like there's a frat party after 11Pm. Not cool if you are here on corporate travel. Fortunately there are three other members of my group that don't have to put up with the noise.....the bonus is you can hear people wretching in the alley if they imbibed on  too many libations from the Revel. Makes me want to drop a piano, safe, anvil, or other cartoon weapon on them.Beautiful hotel. Horrible customer service. Never received my wake up calls. Was told 5 different things about price of shuttle to airport. Was brushed off when I asked about the smell of gas in the hotel and then lied to about room ready for check in.The management is inconsiderate of life changes, and especially emergencies.  A refund would not be applied regardless of the situation (under 24 hrs).  I would recommend IHG for any future hotel use.  The folks running this place do not care.It was a little bit of a shock to find out that parking was valet only and almost $30 a night, but everyone was really friendly and they got the car very quickly so it was acceptable considering the downtown location. The room was very spacious and clean, albeit a little dark. The bed was very comfortable and it seemed much fancier than the price tag due to the high ceilings and apartment style layout. You cannot hear noises from other rooms, but can hear hallway noise quite clearly.However, I also experienced the mysterious sewage smell so I don't know what the deal is with that. Also received some stained towels but everything else was very clean.I would definitely stay here again because of how comfortable and convenient it is.Stayed here Sunday night January 4 2015 and it was crazy busy. We were four blocks from,Lucas oil stadium and the colts playoffs were today. We arrived early and as hilton diamond they were able to accommodate an early checkin. The room was two queens and had a nice full kitchen living room and two TVs. The view wasn't nice but heck they were able to get us in right away and the room itself was very nice, we were able to park the car with valet and they were swamped. Ricky smiled and we left the car,      We were able to walk to the game which was awesome and ordered kilroys after as we watched the second game in our room, enjoyed the visit, the breakfast was just ok. Used gym which was tiny but edifice to I liked this property overall.In town for a trade show at the convention center.  Good location, nice hotel, with the exception of the front elevator.  That being said, we had a large group with direct bill.  Upon check in, a credit card is used for incidentals as normal.  Instead of a pending charge for incidentals, my credit card was billed for 3 nights room and tax. Plus $40 per day for incidentals.  Then another charge! Thanks to an email from the cc company, I was immediately aware, and contacted the front desk.  Credits appeared to offset the charges.  All seems good.  About 2 hours later another email from the cc company, it was put back on!  I went to the desk and the young lady became very defensive, saying she didn't do it I should call the cc company.  I still don't know what I was supposed to tell them, as the hotel initiated the charges.Next morning(Saturday), the young man at the desk said no manager was in, but the guest services manager would be in later and he gave me her number.  He also told me he would speak to her about the problem.  I left her 3 voicemails, and never received a call.  Sunday am advised same fellow at the front desk, who apologized for the inaction on her part.  So as it stands, I have a nearly $1200 hold on a credit card for charges that are not to even be billed to it!  Our group has many rooms here this week, and usually stay here twice a year.  I am in contact with our planners about future stays in Indy.Beautiful hotel with an awesome location. The prices are fair as well. Booked a room for a night for a stay-cation and was super impressed by the friendliness of the staff and size of the room for the price. We had a full kitchen along with living area in addition to a decent sized bedroom. Everything was very clean and well-stocked. The only downside was the lack of windows/view. At night it seemed like we had absolutely no view because all light is blocked from the interior window and during daylight all you get is a weird view of some industrial courtyard. Pros outweigh the cons but be cautious when expecting a certain view!! Also keep in mind that you need to be 21 to check into this hotelThis was my first time at this hotel and it was fabulous!  When I first pulled up the valet parking staff were speedy and extremely courteous.  They explained the text-to-pick-up process, opened the door for me, and even offered me a bottle of water!  Once inside at the registration desk I immediately felt at home.  The attendant was very friendly and the furniture and ambiance of the hotel was just cozy!  I had a problem with my reservation when I tried to check in because of something on my employers part.  Kristin (at the desk) was so pleasant and patient.  She waited while I talked to my job and even let my husband go ahead and go up to the room since he had his hands full.  She offered me a cookie while we waited and even offered to call my booking agent directly.  It was resolved soon and Kristin never lost her cool demeanor.  When I got to the room I was so happy!  The ceilings were tall, the place was very clean, and the bed/couch was so comfortable.  The kitchenette even had dishes, pots/pans, silverware, and a working fridge :) I immediately wished I was staying more than one night.  I also was happy to find out M-Th they offer FREE buffet dinner!  Later I left to attend a work function and was wished well out the door and greeted BY NAME when I returned.  They also have a restaraunt next door that will deliver to your room! The only complaint I have about this hotel was the free breakfast and coffee.  The breakfast was disappointed and the coffee was cold.  I am giving them a break on it because I did come down at the end of the breakfast time. Although 2 different containers of coffee were very cold and even tasted like they were left over.  The ""oatmeal bar"" I was excited about consisted of oatmeal packets, water, and a microwave.  I don't eat meat and the eggs also had meat in them so my options were limited.  Because of this I gave them 4/5 stars.Regardless of the breakfast scenario I was very pleased with my stay and recommend it to anyone - especially if you are in need of a suite/kitchenette style room.Impressed! Nice rooms, comfy beds, pillows. Unlike other hotels the sheets and pillows didn't smell like bleach (or washed with strong chemicals). Quite location, close to a lot of businesses, restaurants and 10 mins from airport. Beautiful cafe area in lobby, nice breakfast, free drinks, good coffee and good service.I was in town for a convention and found this hotel a couple of blocks away from the convention center for a reasonable price.  It looks like it used to be an old warehouse as the room that I stayed in had an elevated ceiling as did the lobby.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  When I called to inquire about the distance to the convention center, the person on the phone gave me good descriptive details about the area.  He also helped arrange the booking so I didn't have to do it later online.  When I arrived, the room I was given faced an ally.  I called the front desk and they were able to give me another room facing the sun and the front of the hotel!  Big difference.  The daily free hot breakfast was great the first day, but not so great the next.  On the second day, they served some sort of chicken filet in a biscuit.  It would have been ok, except the biscuit was really hard.  I think it was just a question of it sitting in the heating tray for quite a while.  Not the fault of the staff, but maybe just a fault of the choice of meal items.  The beds are super comfy and rooms are extremely spacious.  I had a king suite.  It has a nice living room area adjacent to the kitchen.  A little hallway toward the back of the room and you'll find the closet and bathroom.  A few steps away and you get to the bedroom.  A nice location, great staff and comfortable room all for the same rate or less than the hotels right next to the convention center.  Worth the extra block walk in my mind.Beautiful hotel, rooms are huge and the bed was very comfortable. The free hot breakfast is great for being free, lots is different options. Well worth your money. The only annoyance was the bar next door. They were extremely loud way into the night, but that's nothing the hotel can control. I would definitely go back.We stay mostly at Hilton Family hotels and with our kids it is typically one of the suite-style hotels like this Homewood in Downtown Indianapolis. We choose these because they give us more space and give us kitchens for milk or small snacks for the kids. The free breakfast is also a nice bonus. Typically I would say that most Homewood locations tend to be four star stays, but this particular location on this particular stay fell short for a few reasons. The first reason was that on the Hilton Honors website it listed parking as free. I probably should have known that in Downtown Indianapolis that was too good to be true, but I did not expect that the only option would be valet parking. With small children and all the requisite junk that goes with kids everywhere, I really dislike valet. I like to be able to go to my car at any time and not have to wait with wiggly little ones for someone to show up with the car. Nor do I like loading and unloading along a very busy street. Because of this, after a long drive from South Bend and two very cranky kids we ended up losing one of our iPods. Every adult assumed another adult had grabbed it and we don't know if it fell out of the car or was stolen, regardless that put a huge damper on our trip, especially when we knew we had a long flight back with no entertainment for the kids. Another issue was the free breakfast was actually pretty disgusting on the one morning we tried it. Not even the make your own waffles were edible. We had had waffles at a Hilton Garden Inn the previous morning that were very good and the batter or something here was off because not even my kids would eat them. We did not even bother with the breakfast on the second morning. Worst of all, our room, while lovely and spacious, on the first night smelled like poop. Because I have two small children we kept sending the older one to the bathroom and checking the younger one's diaper thinking they were having issues, but finally we realized it was either in the carpet outside the bathroom or coming out of the vent. Either way it was very gross. The second night the smell was gone, thankfully.Otherwise, this location was very pretty and convienent to Downtown Indianapolis. On our first night we walked to dinner and the mall and my husband and his family were able to walk to Lucas Oil Stadium for a Colts game. It is also very close to the basketball arena. The location is really ideal, so if you don't think you will need your car you could park it in a nearby garage that does not have in and out privledges for cheaper than the $21 per day the hotel charges. Our room, while kind of dark, was nicely decorated and had two queen beds and a fold out couch in the living room with the bathroom between the two, but no door you could shut to the bedroom. It also had a full size fridge, microwave, sink and stovetop with a small dining table. The lobby and the staff were nice and I was able to use the business center to print out our airline boarding passes. We did not have a chance to use any of the other services at this hotel, however, as we had a pretty packed schedule. I may or may not return to this hotel depending on the rate I got. We have stayed at the Hilton nearby and they have suites that serve our purpose just as well, have self-park and a better breakfast. The only thing Homewood has is more up-to-date decor and a slightly better location.When recently I heard I was going back to Indianapolis for work, I knew exactly where I was staying.  I knew many people who picked properties closer to the convention center, but I figure a 5 minute walk is a) not that bad, b) probably good for me, and c) again not that bad.  A repeat visitor of this location, I have to say, it has changed the way I think about hotels.  When looking into places (say, the new JW Marriott) I had to concede that it followed the bed, tv, bathroom, dresser, maybe a desk model -- and charged heavily for it.  Sure it's new construction and it's awfully tall and closer to the convention center, but still a small basic room.  And I admit many suite hotels tend to lack any charm, worn, or tend to be located in some suburb.  But this Homewood is a old brick building, renovated to house large, comfortable rooms and very good prices.  Exposed brick walls, no real changes to the facade, all that. I don't even spend that much time in hotels, but the extra space (especially on a work trip) to set up a desk,  stretch out on the couch is much appreciated. When I told colleagues just of the square footage of my room, I probably got a few converts.  When I mentioned the free beer, wine and snacks they brought out each and every night, I had some doubters. On each visit to the hotel, I've enjoyed a full kitchen, living room with with a L-shaped couch (with pull out mattress, if that comes up), a dining table, several tvs, a large closet, and desk.  The room has to be the size of a decent sized apartment, well at least in most of the cities I've lived.  Hell, it's probably bigger than some of the apartments I've stayed in.  There is also an indoor pool, do-it-yourself laundry facilities and a fitness room.  The room is small, a treadmill, elliptical, and some weights, but it'll get the job done.  The staff in my experience has been very kind and helpful.  Now I understand that this is the hospitality industry -- if you are not these things you probably don't have a job for long, but the staff here has been genuinely helpful in a way I suspect has much to do with everyone simply being from the midwest.  Case in point, On my first work trip here, a group of us were sitting in the lobby chatting, having missed the happy hour spread (or whatever they refer to it as).  I did not even yet know that was a thing, but an employee of the hotel asked us if we needed anything, and suggested beer.  We said sure, why not and were quite happy when they brought us a six pack of something not terrible to share after work.  That said, as mentioned before, if you get in early enough they do this for free every night in the lobby anyway.  They'll put out wine, beer, cheese, a small salad bar and typically a few hot items -- a nice little something say you don't have time for dinner or more likely, as I did, a opportunity to wind down with a glass of something and a snack.  I found the spaces in lobby and the nearby business center accommodating -there's even a room with a pool table in it off the lobby.  I understand it's not as sexy as saying you stayed at the JW, but I suppose I'll take exposed brick over tacky new - vegas style construction any day and once you get used to the extra space, it's hard to give up.  Seriously, since staying here I have a hard time staying at properties that aren't giving me at least something on the one bedroom suite model, which is a lot harder to pull off in places that aren't Indianapolis.","I've stayed in this hotel every year for GenCon (so a total of 5 days) for the past three years. I've always stayed on the executive level in a suite. They were amazing at first. The year before last they started making life really difficult. Their have horrible room keys that never manage to stay active for more than a day. They kept not giving new me news ones.Last year is what really turned me off. My friends and I got to our suite and it reeked. We found a baggie of pot in the corner. I was livid. The cleaning must have been done very well. When we alerted the manager and he got furious with us. I think he thought we were trying to scam him. He never apologized and said he would handle the situation so we got ready to leave for the day. The absolute best thing about this hotel is the complimentary grocery service. We started writing up our list before we left. We got the basics, water, soda, and the makings for sandwiches. Then we realized we forgot our Jack Daniels at home so we put it down on the list. We've always been told that's ok as long as the person getting it was over 21 (and they were). I believe we have even done it in the past. Right before we left a friend realized he forgot condoms. So on the list it went. We dropped the list off at the front desk. It got approved. We left. The next afternoon we had no groceries. So we went and checked up on when we'd be getting them. Turns out the manger from before flagged the list and just threw it away. He never bothered to tell us. He claimed that we were trying to embarrass him and wrote up a formal compliant.I understand that buying condoms may be embarrassing for some, but it's a hotel. What do you expect? I'm sure that we were not the only ones requesting them. They even sell the over priced single packets in their mini store on the first floor. Why in the world would this get flagged?So later the manager threw a fit about the pot we found. He said it was obvious it was ours. We escalated. The owner of the hotel, I believe it was, came to our room on one of the last days we were there and talked to us. He was so incredibly nice. He apologized a bunch. Asked if there was anything he could do. We asked if there was any kind of comp for dealing with the manager. He said no. We said that was fine. He apologized a bunch more. We left it at that. The manager, on the other hand, gave us issues the whole time.Pretty sure the guy still works there. I will never be staying here again and I'm going to make sure to tell every last friend/GenCon attendee about the issues we had.My son and I took a one night ""man trip"" to Indianapolis that included staying at Homewood Suites in downtown Indy.  I have stayed here twice before which is why I targeted this hotel when searching.  I've traveled extensively and I have stayed in many, many different hotels.Love this place.  Classy but relaxing, new but retro, suites are perfect, free breakfast is really a breakfast, not just toast and donuts.  Great location and easy parking.  I'll be back.We came here the week after Christmas to do some shopping and attend a Pacers game.  I looked at several hotels downtown, and based on the reviews, chose this hotel for the second half of our trip.  The hotel was clean and very unique.  One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel is the dinner buffet everyone talked about.  Ha.  We planned on that being our dinner.  We ended up going across the street to the Spaghetti Factory.  The buffet was chicken nuggets and a spring mix salad with some carrot sticks.  That is what they consider a full dinner buffet?  I stay frequently at the Drury Inn &amp; Suites, and their happy hour munchies put this dinner to shame!  They have baked potatoes, nachos, hotdogs, salad, chips, chili and all the fixings to make them how you like.  FAR superior to this.  Also - we assumed (of course - I should not have assumed) that we could check out of the hotel and walk over to Bankers Life Fieldhouse for the Pacers game at noon and then walk back and pick up our car after the game.  They told us at check in that we had to have our car out of their parking by 11:00.  Another reason I chose this hotel is that it is the closest to BLF.  We had to leave the hotel and find a place to park far away.  There wasn't anything close - so we just drove around for awhile to kill time.  We had stayed at the Conrad for a few days prior to moving to this hotel, and they let us keep the car in their parking while we shopped at Circle Center after checkout.  For the money, I could have stayed at several other hotels downtown.  After taking away the dinner buffet we had planned on and walking to Bankers Life, there was no reason to pick this hotel out of all the rest.  It isn't connected to Circle Center, so there is nothing to do if you have to get out of the hotel earlier than planned.Beautiful! Very modern, spacious, makes you feel at home.I am a big fan of the Homewood chain, even though most Hiltons have gone to shit.  The Homewood Suites in KC is still one of my favorite hotels.I used to be a Hilton Diamond(highest level), but now all the nice perks are gone.  In the chain, the Garden Inn and Homewood seem to be the most consistent, but again it depends on a location by location basis.This location is perfect if you are planning to see the Colts or Pacers games; both within walking distance.The hotel appears to have been a remodel of a condo/apartment building?The rooms are very nice and the ceiling tall enough to accommodate the tallest NBA player; too bad the beds are not.The suite has a full kitchen setup with a flat screen, but the bedroom has an old tube tv on a dresser.Service both at the front desk and valet was excellent!While overall I would give this place a thumbs up, it did have some shortcomings: - Breakfast was weak, scrambled eggs and a pigs in a blanket on a stick?  Some frozen disgusting combo that they stuck in the oven for 20 min. - Elevator takes about 2 min to go from 4th FL to 1st, with no stops! - On Sat night, street noise was almost unbearable until about midnight. - Parking $24/dayUh oh!!  The updates I have are as follows: #1: Not much of an update but something I forgot to mention previously...The gym is TINY.  Two treadmills, a bike, and an elliptical.  It is also about a bazillion degrees in there and there's no water cooler or water fountain.  The indoor pool is gorgeous though.  #2: Their WiFi was HORRIBLE this time around.  When trying to work from my room, I got booted off every 10 seconds.  It was better in the lobby (it would boot me maybe every 5min) so note to self...Do not stay in room 403 again.  There must be an issue with the signal in there, though they told me at the front desk it was impossible.  #3:When the hotel is full, the wait for the elevator SUCKS.  Like, you could be standing there for 10min waiting for it to come.  #4: The young guy at the front desk during the day is AWESOME.  He not only printed 20 pages of color documents for me (would've cost me $40 a FedEx-Kinkos) but he gave me handfuls of free toothpaste and two razors when I went to buy them in the lobby store. All in all, still a solid option downtown Indy.  I'm starting to lean towards the regular Hilton now, though, because of their enhanced amenities and addition on wireless internet.Nice, clean hotel.  Stayed here during a conference and was in a very reasonably priced suite with a kitchen and living area.  The beds were inordinately comfortable! They have free beer and food from 5-8 on Monday - Thursday. When I was there it was italian fare and stella artois.  Not bad!Definitely one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. The room was really large and reasonably clean, with an extra pull out bed in the sofa. TBH, we didn't use the kitchen or the grocery service, but it was nice that they served both a breakfast and dinner. (There were pots/pans available if you go that route.) Every staff member I met was super nice, though not always completely knowledgable (they didn't know about the shuttle service to the airport, for example). I felt really bad for the staff who had to stand outside and open the doors though. If I had to point out any negatives, I suppose the view is not the best (facing an alley), but uh, if you're there for a convention, how many daylight hours are you going to spend in your room anyway? Not a lot of natural light, but the room was reasonably well lit anyway. It may potentially be a bit noisy though -- we could definitely hear the doors closing in the hallway. Conclusion: good price, good hotel.Most comfortable beds ever and really nice small hotel! They even have a pool and room service available from Kilroy's next door.We stayed Friday and Saturday nights. I've never stayed at a Homewood Suites but I really liked it. The room, which wasn't that expensive, was nice and clean and big. No complaints at all. Great experience. The hotel is on a busy street, but I was told (and asked for) a room in the back. We had no noise issues at all if definitely stay again.Nicely done renovation. Huge room and nicely appointed. No view on my side of the building. Quick walk over to the Conseco Fieldhouse. As with any downtown hotel, parking isn't cheap.  Will stay again when I return to Indy.Seriously one of the most beautiful hotels I've stayed in period... They have fantastic rooms with great structural reminants leftover from the warehouse that was the previous use of the building.  The architectural work is amazing and they have done an amazing job remodelling this building into a top hotel in Indy.  The homewood suites is a perfect homebase for a trip to Indy.There is a sitting room and then a bedroom with a mini kitchen to have snacks and food available without having to go out for every meal.  On the weekends they only serve breakfast but it is a good selection at a perfect price (free).  All of the staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean, and the facilities are new and in good shape.  We fit 5 people comfortably into our suite and no one was unhappy.You are litterally a block from circle center, 3 blocks from monument circle, 8 blocks from white river state park and a few minute drive to Mass Ave shopping and dining.This is a great central, inexpensive solution to a weekend in indy.Lovely. The rooms in this hotel are like a beautiful new apartment. The staff, especially those in the kitchen during breakfast, are friendly and efficient. The amenities are plentiful, and the location is fantastic. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is pricey, but that is due to the downtown location.Beautiful rooms with modern decor and above average room additions (full fridge, dishwasher etc) Comfortable beds with huge loft style rooms. Exceptional customer service...However if you are a light sleeper be weary of the fact that you are downtown and right next to a night club open until 3am in the morning. The bass resonates through the rooms if you are so unfortunate to be on the side next to the club. We were there during the Indy GP races and mistook the noise as part of nightly festivities...after three nights of little sleep and a complaint to the night manager we were moved to a better location, still some noise but tolerable.There is no room service but the central location as well as breakfast/light supper provided make up for that.Internet is available in rooms/ wireless only in the lobby.I would be happy to stay there again if I was guaranteed one of the interior rooms to eliminate any sleeping issues due to noise.Liked -- almost everythingDisliked -- noise issueBEAUTIFUL hotel!  Really modern rooms with the highest ceilings i have ever seen!  The room includes a mini kitchen with microwave, rangetop, full size fridge and dishwasher.  This brand of hotels in more designed for the at-length traveler although I only stayed one night.  There is no room service but a breakfast and dinner is served in the lobby.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance as well.  They have snacks (chips, drinks, sundries) at the front desk that you can charge to your room.  Great room for the price too!Brand new facility in a newly restored historic downtown building. This amazing new hotel even includes a pool. Very cool location right across from the Spaghetti Factory and very near the RCA Dome and Conseco Field House.",,,,"['probably', 'best', 'location', 'among', 'city', 'staff', 'amazing', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wingate-by-wyndham-indianapolis,Wingate By Wyndham,3.0,$$,19,"Staff is super friendly! The free breakfast in the morning is amazing!! Rooms were very clean and over all hotel is quite, safe and comfy!It was a nice, average hotel. We checked in here because of the 24 hour shuttle service to the airport and it worked perfectly. The beds were not comfortable for us. And the pillows had no body to them. Don't expect service if you forget something. I had a cold and they had no medicine. If you forget anything, you better hope the CVS down the road is open.Stayed here 1 night.  Plenty of parking.  There are several other hotels located within a stones throw.  A Sam's club is behind the hotel.  There are some restaurants and bars done the street.  I am not sure how close to the airport the hotel is but it is about a 15 minute drive to downtown.  Staff was ok.  Room was spacious.  Free WI-FI.  Clean bathroom.  Breakfast was pretty good.  Plenty of seats.  Pool and gym do not open till 830 and are accessed via room card.  A decent place to stay for 1 night.I had to change rooms at 2am due to the yelling and screaming on the floor I was on. I thought since this was a Wyndham hotel it would be a little classier but this must be the place they hand out Section 8 vouchers to people to come and stay while the projects are getting renovated. Horrible experience. I will not be back.Nice place. Room was pretty spacious and clean - but the bathroom could use some updating around the tile/tub area. Looking kind of dirty/worn/questionable.Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits (some were a bit hard), gravy, yogurt .... etc etc. Just watch the baked goods -- my bagel was moldy.Was only here for one night, so didn't get to take advantage of the pool or anything.Staff was polite &amp; friendly. Good location not far from downtown Indy &amp; the airport. Our room was spacious &amp; clean. Bed was REALLY comfy! Breakfast is complimentary with choices. Would come back!Really bummed out by my stay here. Not what I've expected at other Wingate Hotels. I was extremely let down with the bed. Super cheap pillows and the mattress didn't have much for support. The maid wouldn't change the towels I threw on the bathroom floor either...gross. They kept putting then back up on the rack, and I know this because the towel in question had a noticeable stain on it, and it would wind up back on the rack every day.The breakfast was mediocre as well: hard biscuits, watery eggs, the juice dispenser concentration was waaay off.Live and learn I guess. Wyndham hotels have consistently let me down. I won't return.Everything was great except the driver. They would've had five stars was it not for him. The was clean and very nice, everything you would need to be comfortable. The staff was friendly and very helpful (except the driver). If you don't have to take a shuttle from the airport this is a great place to stay!Now for Mr. Grumpy driver he can barley speak English which alone I would never pass judgement or even mention except that I could not understand one word he said. When he picked me up I noticed he was not happy weaving in and out of traffic. Dude if u don't like your job find another. This morning I get in the car with my little service dog he basically yell at me to make her sit as far away from him as possible. then he's getting angry at other peoples driving honking, waving his hands. I do not feel this is the way someone driving the public should act. Even the other riders we're surprised at his attitude. I would definitely come back to the hotel as long as I had my own carI really do wish I could've given them five stars because as far as the hotel goes they deserved it.I would give zero stars if I could I was in room 118 and slept the first night fine the first Monday after Valentine's Day, upon my waking I got up out of bed to find that a bed bug was sleeping with me, I had the week paid for and all the hotel offered was to switch rooms what a joke what a friggin jokeI only stayed here for one night, but the hotel was pretty nice and very affordable.  The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly enough, and the price was just right for a one night stay for business (around $45).  The only thing I wish the room had was a refrigerator because it would be nice to have cool drinks in the room without having to hunt for ice (and use the tiny coffee cups provided for my soda).  Overall, a pretty nice hotel though.  I would stay there again if it was just a one night trip, but for more than that I'd be willing to pay more for a few more amenities.First off, I would like to make note that the Manager was very nice. My main problem is with the Shuttle Driver and a minor issue with the sheets and pillows smelling like sweat. We were informed of the free speedway shuttle by management and decided to use the service. During the ride, the driver raised his voice and became very rude. He stated, "" I want $10 tip from each of you"" I felt this was uncalled for and he proceeded to make comments about us being cheap because we, ""only"" tipped him $7. Management was informed though it appeared to be brushed off as a miscommunication. This wasn't a miscommunication and was in fact a deliberate act of rudeness and an attempt of fraud.We stayed here after flying in to the airport and needing an overnight place to stay.  I liked this place much better than the more expensive Wyndham that we stayed on our way home.The room was pretty large and the beds were comfortable.  My only problem is that because it was a Saturday night the hotel seemed to have some sports teams (young) staying there.  Their idea of fun is to run up and down the halls screaming at the top of their lungs.  Where are the parents??!!  Their free breakfast was good.  Plenty of choices for everyone.  The free Wi-fi never did work. I would stay here again because of the proximity  to the airport.   And it was very clean.There is something shady going on with that airport shuttle. Lots of excuses were made. The hotel itself is averageOur experience was pretty decent at this hotel. Although I requested a king, the hotel was booked enough that we were given a room with 2 doubles - not a big deal, of course.We were on the first floor, and honestly, that kind of sucked. I had to turn the fan on just to not hear the people smoking outside. There was something going on that had probably 100 motorcycles in the parking lot, which REALLY sucked, but I don't blame the hotel.The TV was a flat screen, which I liked, but we wanted to stay in and watch a movie, and the ordering system didn't work. That would normally be fine because I have an iPad and video hookup, but unfortunately, the Wi-Fi was awful. Our room was on the first floor and I couldn't even get it to stay for a single minute to browse with. I realize it's free, but it's not that hard to have decent Wi-Fi. I've experienced slow Wi-Fi and not been upset, but the fact I couldn't even get on is not ok.The pool was okay, and the free breakfast was fine. Plus the beds were comfortable, so I couldn't complain that much, but it just didn't seem to be that well kept. The room wasn't that clean, with yellowing wallpaper in the bathroom, a food wrapper on the floor, and a dirty mirror, but it wasn't disgusting, just not anything beyond average.I did book through Hotwire's ""Hot Rates"", where you are not given the name of the hotel before you book, and I saved about $30 a night, which made it a decent deal instead of overpriced. I don't think I would have paid $100 a night happily.I'm not usually a posh traveler. I've slept in hostels all over the world, shared showers, etc. So I'm not writing this review to be whiny... but this hotel SUCKED.My bed was made daily, I got the paper daily, the front desk staff was kind, etc.Here is what I didn't like:Upon arriving from a long flight I needed to use the room's facilities. I sat at the commode and looked to my right and saw a brown smudge on the toilet paper dispenser. An OBVIOUS brown smudge...Now - if this smudge were on the microwave handle, the remote, or something at least 5 ft from the toilet, I could have thought ""fudge?"".. but NO. This was shit. I don't blame the shitter but the maid could have spotted this from a mile away, used a glove, and cleaned it up! I didn't pay for a hotel room that I had to clean myself! It was so gross. Then later I saw that they offered complimentary tea and coffee in the room. How jazzy! I was stoked for some tea so I poured water in their little hot water dispenser and after it heated up I poured myself a nice cup of boiling hot water. But as I looked into the water I noticed all of these brownish black flakes. I'm not too tall so I hadn't bothered to inspect the water dispenser beforehand.. but I pull it down from it's shelf and notice that there is a ton of muck and dirt in it. GROSS #2! No tea for me.Third - my room was on the second floor and because I was attending a work conference I had to get up early each day and cab downtown. One evening (about 6pm) my room suddenly started to shake. Some crazy loud bass from below was blaring through the ceiling and keeping me on edge. I let it slide for a while because I hate to be a complainer. (I know, I know.. this whole post is a complaint). Anyway - after an hour of this noise I call the front desk and I'm told that the room below me is actually a rental party room and a family was hosting a quinceanera for their daughter. The woman said ""they have the room rented until midnight"". NO EFFING WAY!! So the call ends when she promises to ask them to at least turn the bass down.Thirty minutes later it's the same loud reggaeton. BOO. So I call back and the woman explains to me that the people don't speak any English. Lucky for me - my job entails that  I speak fluent Spanish. So I go down there myself and ask them to lower the bass. They did. Sort of.Needless to say my nights at this place were quite restless. Between the poop on the fixtures, the dirty appliances, and loud neighbors.. I was glad to leave after just a few days.My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend visiting with his family. It's a nice hotel and the bed was really comfortable and with clean sheets. I really enjoyed watching television on the flat screen, but my only pet peeve was the fact that breakfast was rather mediocre in nature using powdered eggs and sausage(don't even bother indicating if it's pork or some other kind of meat especially to those with dietary restrictions). The dining area is situated to the rear of the lobby next to the pool and if it's wintertime you'll get a blast of cold air every few seconds someone comes into the door. Not to mention the excessive noise of some of the guests when they come into the dining area and parents don't seem to have it all together to tell their kids to put only what they're going to eat on their plates instead of them piling it up high and wasting it in the end. They need to have fresh scrambled eggs since they taste good and they should also offer egg whites for those who can't eat regular eggs. Another thing is the constant hiring of Mexican workers who don't speak good English which makes no sense because half of them spent the entire duration of the breakfast run yapping in Spanish and when guests asked for certain things they pretended like they didnt hear them. They need to change the breakfast menu to include things like sausage patties, pancakes, waffles(already made), grits, freshly baked biscuits with plain or sausage gravy instead of placing boxed biscuits inside of a crock pot to steam them. Most people know that buttermilk biscuits are best served straight out of the oven. I was also bothered by the lack of attention paid to the room since the Kleenex box had not been changed since the last party that stayed in the room I had with my boyfriend. The only real plus is that the hotel is situated in a fairly busy strip next to a Sam's Club and a host of other stores up and down Rockville Road. The hotel is only minutes from downtown Indianapolis. The stay was okay, but nothing really to write home about.This place might not be the highest class of hotel but I had a great experience staying here.  Check in was fast and the staff was very friendly.  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept in.  The TV was a flat screen but I had some bad reception on a lot of the channels.  Room was quiet and laundry was good.  This place is right next door to a Sam's Club so it's very convenient.  The fridge, microwave and coffee maker was great. I liked it here!Helpful staff , good stay. Will stay againWe had a pretty decent experience at this hotel.  The hotel staff was not as customer-service oriented as I would have liked, but we didn't need their help really.  The room was comfortable.  The breakfast was greeeeat!  It wasn't just continental like most hotels.  They had everything, except hash browns.    The only thing that was irritating was the fact that the exhaust fan came on evvvvery time you turned the light on in the bathroom.  Geeez.  My boys had a blast in the pool and the whirlpool.  The hotel was pretty centrally located to every place we went.  The price was very reasonable.",,,,,"['staff', 'super', 'friendly', 'free', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'amazing', 'rooms', 'clean', 'hotel', 'quite', 'safe', 'comfy', 'nice', 'average', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-indianapolis-dtn-conv-ctr-area-indianapolis,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Indianapolis Dtn-Conv Ctr Area,3.0,$$,19,"Holiday Inn Express is usually not on my radar as a hotel of choice.  But after a family gathering here last weekend, I must say I'm pleasantly surprised! The hotel itself appears very new and shiny.  The rooms are all very spacious and clean.  The mattress was great!  I even found a *good* pillow to lay my head!  That is a huge plus in my book.  Breakfast was of the usual ""hot"" breakfast items included with the stay...nothing to write or complain about.  What I will say is how the breakfast/lobby area is decorated.  They must have used a professional decorator for this.  The look is polished, cozy, yet not over stuffed.  I even liked the tastefully decorated Colts blue Christmas tree!  If you are here for a Colts game, you are in luck.  It is directly across the street from the stadium.  But if you are here for some of the downtown bars and restaurants...it is not so ideal.  The hotel is about 3 big blocks from Circle Center--a pretty painful walk in the cold or rain.  Parking is not convenient if you take your car.  Once the spots in the small hotel surface lot are taken, you get to park in a city garage behind the hotel.  We were faced with the same dilemma.   But we happily settled on going next door to Tavern on South so all is not lost.Oh My, I stayed here last week when I was in town for Thanksgiving........Two incidents happened that I believe are unacceptable.1. In the first few minutes of being in my room. The front desk called and said my phone was dialing 911. A gentlemen came up and ""fixed it"". This is not a good feeling. I ordered food and went to bed.2. When I woke up in the AM. I went to take a shower (this was my first time in the restroom). What I saw on the toilet seat is unacceptable. I have attached a picture.I have contacted both the hotel, and hotel chain about the incident. Here is what I received back.....Thank you for contacting Guest Relations regarding the Holiday Inn Express and Suites Indianapolis Dwtn City Centre.

We were there for the preseason game in August and had a great experience.The rooms were comparable to the JW Marriot down the street and the service was excellent.  I also like that you don't get nickel-and-dimed to death with fees for wifi and so on.  The staff was excellent and we were routinely greeted enthusiastically by lots of them - even in Saints jerseys :-).And it is right across the street from the stadium. Good thing because it rained that day as we were leaving.This is a great little full service hotel.It has a great central location to downtown and it's very easy to walk to many places. The staff is very helpful and very courteous. I've enjoyed my stay here for the last eight days.Hotel definitely  appeared nice. Day time front desk were very helpful  and nice. Around 1 am my fiance was woke up by bites and  lumps  all over we actually  saw bed bugs and told the overnight  staff. The problem. He stated ""I'm sure they're not bedbugs  we haven't had a problem with that in a long time and if it's any bugs I'm certain  it's something other than bedbugs"" he refused to come look at all the bugs in the sheets. I'm assuming in order to avoid  admitting  they were in fact bedbugs. Anyway  he offered  another room but by 2 am and dealing with a attitude  from him as if we were annoying him we decided  to leave. Not saying we won't stay at another hie just definitely  won't in downtown  indyExperience was excellent! Very accommodating and friendly staff at the front desk. Free breakfast was tasty and we were said hello to by almost every staff member we encountered! We visited another HIX in Greenfield, IN and encountered the same thing! Nice work, guys. We are very much appreciative!As Holiday Inn Express Hotel's go, this one is top-notch.  Good service, GREAT room, good location (right across from Lucas Oil Stadium - I mean right across the street) and decent parking.  The rates are very reasonable and the breakfast was piping hot.When travel takes me back to downtown Indianapolis, I'll be staying here.Stayed here for almost one week with a conference. The entire staff was extremely courteous, accommodating,and welcomed me regularly. Room was very clean, spacious, and the hotel's location was fantastic. Walking distance from everything in the downtown area. I highly recommend this place!Average at bestThe Hotel Clerk was not the friendliest person, nor did she bother to look for the key that was left for me by my room mate earlier that evening as I arrived later - at least not until I called my room mate who told me it has my NAME ON IT - then she found it.We had a suite and it was ok and it was clean, however, the bathroom smelled like piss. That was room 506 or 504  whatever the number around the corner from the elevator.The breakfast was not really something to get excited about - fake eggs, a pancake machine, juices, fake sausage, bascially stuff I do not eat.The worst part, aside from the heavy smell of piss in the bathroom, was the parking. Had the parking been better I would have given 3 stars. If you are lucky to get a spot in the lot outside, you are one of the few. They share the City parking garage that is behind the hotel, but the entrance is almost a block away - extremely inconveneient - especially if you forget something in your car. You literally walk through an alley (that is a pass through for vehicles) and around a corner as there is only ONE entrance - and of course it faces the Comfort Suites Hotel and not the Holiday Inn...If you to stay in Indy, I would suggest the Conrad! FAR better hotel than the Holiday Inn! My first time in Indy and I REALLY liked the nightlife and Restaurants! VERY good!5 stars for a Holiday Inn? Everyone was extremely friendly and courteous, from the staff checking us in, to the housekeeping crew, to the shuttle driver, to the people working the breakfast area in the morning. Location is south of the convention center, short walk to one of the entrances, right next door to Lucas Oil Stadium, the rest of the immediate surrounding area is questionable, but there is a great little bar next door also. The room was clean each time we came back, towels were fresh, A/C &amp; heater worked properly, room was spacious (we did get a suite). All in all, this place was pretty darn good. Oh and the internet worked perfectly for us, and we were on the 6th floor. I would definitely stay here again if I was going to the convention center or the Lucas Oil Stadium, if I were here just visiting, I might choose something a little closer to the center of downtown Indy, but even the walk back I made at 3:30 am felt safe.Thanks to hotwire for the amazing stay I had did this hotel. The room was very spacious and clean and everyone was very courteous. Definitely stay here again.We decided to stay at this hotel at the very last minute.  Upon arrival at around 1130pm we went to the front desk and no one was there.  After saying ""excuse me is anyone here"" a bunch of times we were finally greeted by a very rude host.  Ok,  you work in a service industry you should at least be nice.  This guy actor like he was doing us a favor by letting us stay at this place.  Obviously we thought we must of woken him up and didn't want to have to do his job but whatever, we are tired and just want to get to our room.So that night we wanted to get a bottle of water and we went the vending machine and put the money in, pressed for the water and a diet coke came out!  Wtf!!!  Again, whatever!Next night, lets try to go to a different vending machine on a different floor to get water, 5th floor.... no water.  4th floor.... no water.  3rd floor.... no water.... 2nd floor guess what? no water and not only that it ate the money!!So we go down to the front desk and of course, no one there.  We say "" excuse me "", ""hello"", over and over and finally Mr. Happy face shows up again and says he was on the phone with a total rude look on his face.  We tell him that all the vending machines are out of water and it ate our money.  He looks at us like we are Martians and says ""yeah we are out of water"" and tells us to grab something else from the cooler by his desk.  How is a hotel out of water?  The room was clean and the maid was nice and everything else was terrible.Oh I almost forgot, the complimentary breakfast was brutal!!  Fake eggs,  a machine that makes pancakes that taste like rubber, bacon with fat all over it!!! That's from 7am-10am, and right at 10am the girls come out of the kitchen and take anything left from breakfast.  I saw a girl getting coffee and she turned to get the sugar and BAM!!!! the kitchen girl grabbed the coffee pot!  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER will go back there!Clean and efficient.  However, the coffee was cold.The room was clean and comparable to others. Parking cost $14! The clerk said all Indy hotels charge...but why not be different? The shower sometimes lost a little pressure and made noise but it was still a nice shower. The pool area was clean. The pool was excessively filled with chemicals. They have a whirlpool too which is rare these days. The breakfast was decent.The room itself isn't bad - the king nonsmoking room comes with a Jacuzzi, the bed was comfortable, and the room was clean and satisfactory. The internet, however, was not. On the third floor (out of six total) the connection was so poor that my laptop could barely detect it, and could not connect to it whatsoever. From the lobby, however, the internet is fine. Also in the lobby is a microwave for anyone to use, and there is a small store that sells frozen dinners and other travelling needs. From the room you can hear doors slamming in the hallway. The parking lot is extremely small - what seems to be part of the parking lot on one side of the building is actually reserved parking for a restaurant. Those who can't fit in the lot must park in a small garage next to a neighboring hotel. However, what I feel that I must mention is the swimming pool/whirlpool area. The first floor smells strongly of chlorine, and the pool itself is disgusting. The water was green, and, as I discovered, salty. What I thought was rust or chipped paint at the bottom of the pool actually turned out to be loose dirt. The whirlpool was also green and salty, and when the actual bubbles were turned on, the pool made a loud grating noise over which no conversation could be held (I think it had to do with a low water level - the noise came from holes near the top of the pool that seemed to match the ones underwater that made the bubbles).We chose to stay hear because we were going to the Monster Jam show at Lucas Oil Stadium.  We were suprised at the low rates for a hotel right across the street from a venue.  The hotel and room were clean and well maintained.  The breakfast was more than I expected.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay her again. One tip: if you are driving to the hotel, there is more parking in the garage to the Southwest of the hotel. At first I thought it was just the lot next to the hotel and that filled up fast.Pros:-The room was clean-Our jacuzzi suite; the tub was awesome and worked properly unlike other suites I've had at other hotels.-Location was right near everything we wanted to see in Indianapolis-The shop with essentials, and some basic food was nice. Decently priced and not completely marked up.Cons:-Waiting 10 minutes to check in at 6:30 PM. Nobody was at the desk, and as other employees walked by, they said nothing to us, and didn't bother to try to find someone or offer to.-The walls were very thin. Everytime someone would turn the water on for the tub or shower on either side of us, it would keep me awake, and I'm not exactly a light sleeper.-14 bucks to park in a lot that had maybe 20 spots was a joke. What's with this new trend of charging for parking at hotels? I'm already overpaying you. It didn't even say anything about it on their website either.-They had a shuttle, which was 5 bucks each way. And on a Saturday night and you end at 9:45? Why bother?-Their breakfast was okay. The pancakes out of the pancake machine were weird in texture and rubbery. I just stuck to bagels, the cinnamon rolls were awesome, and some biscuits and gravyBeware the parking scam!!  They won't tell you when you make the reservation, but when you arrive to check-in they charge you $12 / night for parking.  I can understand why they charge during football games (because the hotel is literally next door to Lucas Oil Stadium) but when i checked in, it wasn't even football season!!! :)  To their credit, after some complaining they removed the parking charge.Not quite ""holiday inn express"" quality.  The pool had no chlorine, and both of the two treadmills were broken in the workout facility.  Rooms were nice and clean...no problems there, which is most important.  Free WiFi.The check in clerk was nice, but I was amazed how long her boss Patsy let the line get before she decided to help.  Then the maintenance man closed the pool for 5 minutes yet put a sign up at 8 am that it would be closed until 10 am.  After voicing my annoyance to check out clerk I left annoyed when her response pretty much ""sorry"" not understanding I dressed my two children for a morning of swimming only to find out upon check out the pool was only closed five minutes.  After filling out survey hotel sent and sending a complaint Patsy emailed me apologizing saying she gave me 3000 extra priority club points.  I wanted to respond telling her she was part of the problem but I'm not sure it's worth it.  It's ok but over all I was very unimpressed with management.",,,,,"['holiday', 'inn', 'express', 'usually', 'radar', 'hotel', 'choice', 'family', 'gathering', 'last', 'weekend', 'must', 'say',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-broad-ripple-indianapolis,Hotel Broad Ripple,5.0,$$,19,"We had an absolutely phenomenal stay here. The hotel itself is beautiful, with each room uniquely designed to fit into the footprint of the building. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a large bed and euro sofa, allowing for us to relax comfortably as if it was our own living room. The temperature was in the 60s even though we stayed in December, allowing us to truly appreciate the great Broad Ripple neighborhood; there were so many restaurants and bars in close walking proximity, and the trail directly behind the hotel was perfect for exploring. The continental breakfast was also awesome, with local yogurt, and delicious breakfast breads!Hotel Broad Ripple is a delightful mix between a B&amp;B, hotel and lodge. It takes the best of each of these and combines them into a welcoming overnight experience. You walk in and immediately smell a woodsy scent, like fresh-cut pine or oak -- I don't really know my woods. But it's that all-natural scent that immediately conjures up memories of nights spent in Gatlinburg or a forest or on a mountain.And then there's this great lobby area with wine at night. When I walked through it at different times I found guests chatting each other up, getting to know each other. So ... a lodge.But then again, this lodging option is in what looks like a former single-family home. The signage is minimal. You have to know where you're going to find it ... or have a good GPS.My room door was within 10 feet or so of the check-in desk, and there are no phones in the rooms because you could just peek your head out of your door and ask the front desk clerk.  From what I could tell each room is just a bit different, some with balconies and some bigger than others. My room had a large brick focal wall, a vintage green sofa and a beautifully tiled shower.And when I checked in, I got a hand written note, welcoming me to Hotel Broad Ripple. So ... a B&amp;B.But the amenities seemed to go above and beyond a B&amp;B. There's free continental breakfast available at the small restaurant across the train tracks from Hotel Broad Ripple. I didn't get to try it out, but the clerk pointed out that it was next to the train caboose behind the hotel. Each room has its own bathroom from what I could tell. And you have privacy from other guests. So ... a hotel. Some other things I liked about Hotel Broad Ripple:* My room had its own Keurig with a few complimentary K-cups, including two teas and a coffee.* Coffee was also available for free in the lobby.* There's a small private parking lot in back of the hotel.* It's within a short walk of some of the best places in Broad Ripple. * The wifi was fast, free and easy to connect to. My room did not have a small fridge, which I wish it had, but besides that, my experience with Hotel Broad Ripple is one that I would happily repeat. I must remember this for the next time I'm in Indy.Broad Ripple has some cute little hideaways, I'm learning. I have passed by Hotel Broad Ripple on a few of my long walks on the monon, but had no idea it was so cute inside!I really like the decor; the owner did a great job of finding things of great style while maintaining a good balance. There are great views of the heart of Broad Ripple.  My favorite room was the suite, which could fit about 4-5 people easily. It was very open, great decor and much space. The bathrooms in the suite were great and left me most impressed They had modern features with all the extras in the bathrooms. Another idea for Hotel Broad Ripple is that the owner is willing to have group rent out the lobby for gathering. She didnt make it sound like it would be too much on the wallet. This space is very spacious, has great sitting and offers a bar.If you are coming to Indy and want to focus on the Broad Ripple idea OR what a place for a cool staycation, I think Hotel Broad Ripple would get great!Such a lovely little oasis!Yes, it's a bit from the airport, about a $30 Uber ride, but totally worth it if you want a personal, relaxing, and gorgeous spot to spend your time in Indy. Expect a cozy, welcoming, charming, nine room boutique hotel when you arrive. Yes, if you drive by quickly, you will miss it. The entrance is in the back so it's not obvious from the road. This is a spot you would see on Airbnb and add to your wish list. It has a contemporary lodge-like feel and was decorated for Christmas and it was lovely. I could sit here for days and think of adjectives to describe this spot but you really have to see it to believe it. When I arrived they were not full for the evening so they showed me Room 1 and 8 so I could choose, how nice? I went with 8 as it was away from the road and had a gorgeous deck. It was very spacious. The bathroom was lovely, only thing I would have liked more was a bathtub; I personally love taking baths in hotels. The bed was so very comfortable. So comfy that I had to force myself out of it. This was a super quick trip for me so I was very bummed I didn't get to hang out around this lovely inn. Next time I am in the area, expect me back here! The hand written note upon check-in was a lovely touch. There is also a free continental breakfast available at a restaurant right out back, a super quick walk outside the back door. I was unable to check it out as my stay was so short. If you are looking for a very personable, welcoming spot, this is it. Take a break from the hustle and bustle and get your relax on. Thanks for the hospitality, Hotel Broad Ripple!I live in Broad Ripple but don't have enough space in my home to host guests from out of town. Hotel Broad Ripple is a life saver! It allows family and friends to stay close but still have their own bed and comfy surroundings. The furnishings and decor here are adorable. Feels like a bed and breakfast with all its charm, but has modern touches like a Keurig, flat screen, and keycard entry for all rooms. My mother is visiting this weekend, and this is her first stay. She loves the big bathroom and sitting area of room #2. We had breakfast this morning with some yummy local treats like Traders Point Creamery yogurt and butter, and all the stylish plates and glasses. The staff is friendly but not overly chatty if you prefer privacy. Plenty of parking, and a great location for walking access to lots of restaurants, bars, local shops, and the Monon Trail.wowee wow wow!   I attended the Yelp's Winter Whiskey Party at the Hotel Broadripple.  We were able to get a tour of the place including 3 of the rooms.  This place is so exquisite.  Each room is decorated to the nines, rustic, shabby chic, hoosier.  The hotel owner was present and she is just wonderful. You can see the passion that went into her design.  This would be a great place to stay for business travelers, for out of town family members, or even for a great staycation.  I can't wait to stay here sometime for a little R &amp; R!Hotel Broad Ripple is a beautiful ecletic hotel nestled on the Monon trail in Broad Ripple. On the outside it looks like a home with bridges to other houses...but once you enter you will be greeted by a cozy warm and well decorated hotel. Its a cute boutique hotel that offers the hominess of a hostel with the cleanliness and sleekness of any modern hotel. This is definitely a hidden gem of Broad Ripple...Awesome little hidden gem. We were just passing through town on a road trip and stayed here for just one night. Wish we had stayed longer! Room was beautiful (as was the lobby/bar). Great shower! Comfiest bed! Nice little hip neighborhood to explore right across the street. Free breakfast at the coffee shop. Would highly recommend.Many of the other reviews have already detailed what is so wonderful about the Hotel Broad Ripple, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus.  My husband and I loved every minute of our almost four-day stay there.  The service, amenities, decor, location...all top-notch.  We stayed in room number 1, the ""smallest"" (one queen bed), which was still a decent size, not cramped at all and perfect for a couple or a single.  It has a lovely sitting area and a large bathroom with a huge shower.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.This place is best for grown ups (carefully chosen word). Great location with easy foot access to many restaurants, pubs, shops, and town is right down the bike/foot path. Lovely host, decor and modern rooms with open yet cozy and nostalgic feel. Best of all worlds. Modern fully-accessible temp control and TV, French country feel with exposed brick accent wall and talk/vaulted ceiling and large modern bathroom (rm 2). For groups there is a lovely open room near the entrance to hang out or grab continental breakfast or last drink of the evening. Also recommend Public Greens restaurant within walking distance or for desert Monon Food Company. Looking forward to our next stay.I visited the Hotel Broadripple last night for Yelp's Winter Whiskey event and this place is definitely on my list of things to do. While a boutique style hotel, you can definitely tell that the owner put a lot of thought into the furniture and decor of the hotel. She is very personable and shared little tidbits of special pieces around the hotel. Plus the art work is for sale! We listened to a lady from Buffalo Trace give a small presentation about the bourbon brand and it was fascinating to see the other people's reaction to bourbon. The Wick's Pies were also amazing (especially since I normally do not like pies).Great unique hotel. Great staff and amenities. Perfect location right on the monon trail. You can walk wherever you need to go in broad ripple. We love to bring our bikes and ride the trail to downtown or to Carmel.I am a business traveler that visits Indianapolis once a month. I usually stay at a marriott courtyard. A business associate and friend recommended the Hotel Broadripple. What a refreshing difference! If you travel often, you know how seeing the same hotel decore begins to wear on you (i am looking at you green leaf picture in every marriott bathroom).  The Hotel Broadripple offers a unique blend of classic style with all the modern hotel amenities.  No expense was spared when they built this place.  Booking online was easy and the staff was great. Doug checked me in and was very down to earth and personable. The free breakfast offered at perk up across the street was great. A huge departure from the joe vs. The volcano intro assembly line vibe at the big box hotel bistros in the morning. Thanks Doug and Hotel Broadripple!Right on the Monon trail.  Stayed here for the Indy 500.  Great hotel.  Great staff.  Trendy hotel.  Beautiful balconies.  Features great local art on the walls of the hotel rooms.Hotel Broad Ripple is a beautiful, boutique-style hotel fashioned from two homes. The decorations are contemporary and spot-on for details, the rooms are tasteful, welcoming and very comfortable and easy to kick back and relax in. When not in-room, the common area/lounge offers wine and cheese plates in the afternoon/evening and a very simple, yet delicious and fresh breakfast in the morning. Within walking distance is all of Broad Ripple; from the lovely Monon walking/biking trail to scores of quant shops and eateries. A little further walk or an easy/short drive is the main street of the more commercial (and college life) area of Broad Ripple with more shops, pubs and restaurants. And an easy 15+ minute drive you can be in any of the great Indianapolis cultural/zoo/canal/art/and everything districts. HBR is well worth the stay...the first, second and third and beyond trip. Make a reservation today--I know I'm ready to go back!What a great place!  This place had just opened up a few months ago and we stayed here after going to a race in Indianapolis.  The hotel has  B &amp; B style suites with very friendly staff and just a short walk to the bustling downtown Broad Ripple main streets. There is a walk/bike path right to the back door and a nice assortment of restaurants, shops and bars.  Continental breakfast free, just across the bike path. Lots of style in this hotel with a small town feel.  We will stay here again!My husband and I stayed at Hotel Broad Ripple on NYE.  We used to live in Broad Ripple, so this area of Indianapolis holds a special place in our heart.  While we were living there we saw it being built, so that's how we found out about it.  We were beyond impressed!  For starters, the hotel is beautiful and has amazing curb appeal.  It is seated in the perfect, walkable location in Broad Ripple and boasts balconies for guests to enjoy the views.  We stayed in room 3 and LOVED it!  It is beautiful, sleek and elegant.  It was also on the top floor which we loved.  It really was as if we were staying at a home away  from home.  The staff member was very helpful, but we rarely saw him which also made it feel like we were right at home.  The hotel has a bar area in the lobby where you can hangout.  This is also open to the public, so my husband and I plan to enjoy this feature of the hotel in the future.  Overall, we cannot rave about this place enough!  We have suggested it to so many people and plan to return.  It is unlike any other spot in Indianapolis.  Thank you Hotel Broad Ripple for the most wonderful stay!I've stayed in 100s of hotels around the world, so I have high expectations and a broad perspective on what makes a good one. And HBR is it! Several of my family members and I stayed here in June for a family reunion and we were all pleased. Brett, who handled all of our reservations and checkins, went out of his way to make us comfortable. We had a chance to chat with the owner who was very sweet as well. The rooms are in spectacular shape and so well decorated you'd think you were in Paris. You cannot beat the location either. I grew up in Indianapolis and know all the neighborhoods well; for business travelers, tourists, or natives coming back to visit, Broad Ripple is a great place to be. While plenty of cafes/bars are a short walk away, the hotel itself is very quiet and feels tucked away. Bonus points for the large grass area where guests can hang out, socialize, read, or just enjoy the view.choose the hotel broad ripple for its off the beaten path charm, and this cozy and welcoming spot did not disappoint. Away from the keystone avenue chains of hotels and same-o, same-o eating establishments, this hotel feels like a good friend's cottage. The lobby is open and welcoming, the check-in friendly and efficient. The owner, manager comped me an upgrade as census was light on a Tuesday. My room featured a very homelike rich blue decor with a soft headboard and some funky art above. The bathroom is huge, marble and features kohler-like fixtures. Big fluffy towels abound. My room didnt quite get dark with all of the wonderful blinds closed and there was some road noise to contend with. The neighborhood feels comfortable, you dont feel like a tourist walking across the old railroad spaces now repurposed as a walking and running trail, to the 4 or 5 restaurants filled mostly with locals. I will make this my fixed base of operation on future Indy excursions!",,,,,"['absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'hotel', 'beautiful', 'room', 'uniquely', 'designed', 'fit', 'footprint', 'building', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/stone-soup-inn-indianapolis,Stone Soup Inn,4.5,$$,16,"My first experience at a B&amp;B and I loved it!  I would suggest the experience to everyone.  This one in particular has lots of room options, some with shared bathrooms and some with private (all the ones I saw had fantastic, giant tubs just calling out to me for a bubble bath).  The rooms were cozy and clean.  The house also had several other rooms to explore, full of board games, books, a piano, and photos with lots of history.  It was so neat to have those open areas to meet and chat with the other visitors.  The social aspect of a B&amp;B is the extra oomph I have been looking for while traveling.  Sharing breakfast with perfect strangers at the family dining room table was so fun! It was cool to read through visitors messeges in the guest book in each room too.The guy running the place was sweet as ever.  He served a simple but tasty breakfast on the weekday.  Bummed I missed out on the big meal on the weekend.   Everything went just as smooth as ever which made all the difference since we had a wedding to focus on.  My only complaint it the lack of parking.I admit that the price seemed too good to be true; however, when looking for a place to stay for 5 nights, it seemed quite reasonable. The ""lower level entrance"" should have been my first clue that it's actually in the basement of the inn, but I didn't pick up on that. The inn's website explains that the Garden Suite ""...offers a tranquil seclusion as well as a private bath. A heavenly queen bed, kitchen, desk and bistro table make this a serene escape for business or pleasure.""There is nothing tranquil about this room. It is directly beneath the kitchen/dining room, and it's like staying in your parents' basement during a family reunion during which no one sleeps in and they all stomp around in the kitchen above you while you are trying to sleep in. Additionally, the stairs to the room are treacherous, at best, and if it's snowy, you track in all of the rock salt and there's no door mat to wipe your feet on. In fairness, the rest of the inn looks lovely, I would definitely not recommend the Garden Suite, however. The location, however, is great!This was such a beautiful b&amp;b! Had such a great experience for my first time staying at a bed and breakfast. Definitely recommend this place to anyone! Only reason I won't give a five stars in water pressure went in and out and breakfast was just ok.This must be one of the best little gems in Indianapolis!The building is lovingly restored to the craftsman/revival style.  The downstairs common area is classy, elegant, yet homey at the same time.  I was attracted to this B&amp;B due to their lovely lofts.  I dont know why they do not post more pictures of these lofts on their website.  They are so cute and cozy!  Each is furnished with a full kitchen set up.  We stayed in the NE loft.  I loved sleeping in the loft ""in the sky"" (see my pics).  The two person Jacuzzi tub was a wonderful bonus.  We also loved the complimentary snacks and refreshments and breakfast.  Although the full breakfast is only served on weekends; we met a spread that is way more than the typical ""continental"" breakfast on Monday morning.  The inn is also on the bus line and only about a half mile from downtown.  For about the same price as a typical downtown hotel room, minus the daily parking rate of $15-25; plus the snacks and breakfast; there is definitely value in staying in a B&amp;B.  We would definitely come here again the next time we are in Indi!Oh my!  Here for a conference. I booked everything late and was struggling to get a place to put my head for around $100 a night. Then I came across Stone Soup InnI could not have been more happy. I was able to secure a loft and it wad truly delightful. Decent bed for two (I was on my own!) a fridge, oven, microwave, sink, cupboards, great subdued paint and lighting, writing desk, walk thru closet/passage to own bathroom with very clean toilet, shower, basin and room to spare. The atmosphere is very old world - charming and homely. Very tastefully decorated in proof correct fashion. Free snacks and tea/coffee was another bonus. The booking people were very thorough and because I was arriving around midnight, were careful to explain how to get my key and how to find my room. I would love to come back here and sit on the porch in summer!Been here twice and love love this place a lot. Its the only bb I've been to and both times me and my wife really enjoyed instead of that other place were they don't even cook breakfast for u there. I love the loft rooms there nice and comfortiblr . I have only like two complient s I have was that their is only small movie.choices. and the tubs are kind of small but who gives a crap about that. This is a wonderful getawayThis place was a total win for me.  I was in town for a small conference and the hotel was sold out.  This place came up on Trivago, and after a little review, I thought I'd give it a try.  The cost was less than the conference hotel, and the experience was so much more!One of the things I love about staying at local inns/B&amp;B's is that they can offer more flexibility than your typical hotel.  I was able to request my own check-in time and did so, requesting a time shortly after lunch, a time when most hotels ""can''t guarantee.""  I was also able to hang around and get some work done in the morning before my meeting with no firm checkout/the cleaning staff hovering.  The accommodations were great.  Warm and homey but not homely.  Classy, clean, and tasteful.  My room (NW Loft) had a living space, kitchenette stocked with non-food supplies (which I wasn't expecting), separate bathroom, and lofted bed.  I could have slept all morning as the loft was cozy, dark, and warm.  I peaked in some other rooms when I checked in, and they all shared these positive qualities.  There are also common areas inside and out, if you were with a group and looking for space to congregate, or read by yourself.  The building had rfid entry and rooms were deadbolted.  While there are hardwood floors, rugs keep things quiet and my general experience is people at these types of places are respectful.  Tom, the innkeeper, was friendly and conversational during breakfast and check in.  Breakfast was continental (during the week) which was great for me and included fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, muffins, granola/cereal bars, yogurt, and I think I saw boiled eggs.  It's a full breakfast on weekends.  There's an communal area to sit, or you can take it back to your room.  There's also a butler's pantry with snacks and beverages available.The location was easy to find, offered convenient parking, and was in a cute neighborhood.  I also was able to walk to Mass Ave in about 20 minutes.  Also walkable to the downtown area or a easy/affordable cab ride.  The only downside some might see is that there were quite a few stairs.If I'm back in Indy, I would first check to see if this place is available!It is in a bad part of town, it's old and weird.  I don't know how else to put it.  I am literally bewildered why other reviewers referred to the lofts as either cute or cozy.  The rooms are small, dark, and creepy.  The furniture is so uncomfortable, like patio furniture.Super relaxing spot &amp; about .5 miles away from Mass Ave. which has a ton restaurants, bars, shops, etc. I stayed in the Blue Room which was perfect for someone flying solo. This room has a steam shower. Nice addition but a lot of steam and so much so I had to crack the shower door open. This is really a minor quibble as the staff was super helpful about recommendations around town.This is a hidden gem located north of downtown. Walking distance to a wonderful treasure trove of restaurants and quaint shops on Mass Ave.The rooms are elegantly cozy and full of antiques. I loved hanging out on the huge wrap around porch sipping wine from a bottle that I ordered from their sister Inn.The Villa. I was thrilled to find a Lilly pond stocked with koi fish and surrounded by blooming tulips and a bench for sitting.My room was very cool as it featured a steam bath. I purchased some aromatherapy oils from their spa located at The Villa and loved using them in the steam shower as it was pretty rainy and chilly weather. This was a special treat for sure!The next morning my breakfast was pretty impressive considering that I was told that during the week it was continental. I was only expecting coffee, juice and cold cereal but there was yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels and some yummy muffins. Wow!I will definitely tell my friends about this place. I loved it!  WendyA strange location, but a great little addition to the Old Northside.I was here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend, and we had *the most amazing* time! Nate, the innkeeper, was so courteous, friendly, and warm. The house itself is charming and adorable. The NW Loft was more than we could have asked for -- honestly, I can't say enough good things! Honestly, we always hated leaving our room when we HAD to go out and meet friends and family!  Quiet, close to some great things in Indy, pristine, cosy -- we can't wait to go back! Nate, thanks so much!!After a very long, but joyous day, my wife and I came here for our wedding night. Located in the old historic district, this old mansion was perfect for us. We had eaten at St. Elmo right before we got there, and so it was about 8:00 by the time we arrived. The inn was hidden behind large trees, and had a small parking lot. We walked up to the door, but it was locked. We rang the doorbell. We heard a scurry throughout the house. Eventually the door opened and there stood a quirky woman, somewhat out of breath. ""Hello,"" she muttered. ""Welcome to the Stone Soup Inn."" She looked every which way and seemed somewhat nervous. ""Let me show you around.""So she showed us the inn and told us what we could expect. It was a great, rustic place. It had antiques all around, and the rooms were well decorated. The woman was super nice. We finally came to our room, the Lilly Room. It has a bay window with a bathroom that has a two person jacuzzi. We had a small refrigerator with complimentary drinks. The best thing is that we practically had the place to ourselves. That next morning we went down to the dining room. (A room with a small dining room table) and ate breakfast with a man from Canada and a man from France. One man was here for a conference, the other for a wedding. A delightful conversation occurred. In the bedroom, there is a book at the foot of the bed which allows everyone to write their story. It was great to read everyone's stories. The place had a baby grand piano if you would like to play it, and they also have a library with books and DVD's in it.It was a wonderful place and a wonderful experience. The perfect wedding night getaway.What a great experience we had at the Stone Soup Inn. Honestly I just picked this place to stay for a night in Indianapolis because it was the cheapest place that I could find that was close to downtown, what we got was a great experience. The house is beautiful and located in a quiet neighborhood. We got one of the lofts and had tons of space. The room included a full kitchen, a dining table and an area with a couch/tv. There was tons of common space with free drinks, snacks and things to do laying around everywhere (I probably had more than my fair share of M&amp;Ms). In the morning the breakfast wasn't anything extraordinary but there was plenty of food and the staff was beyond hospitable. There is nothing to complain about here. Everyone who works there is nice and is available 24/7 for anything you could need. They have a private driveway that you can park on and the price is more than reasonable. I'd recommend this place for everyone who wants to stay somewhere near downtown even if you aren't looking for a B&amp;B.I've stayed here twice, both during large conventions, and had phenomenal experiences both times.  The location is beautiful, the service impeccable, and the food delicious.  The cheaper rooms are a real deal ($85 when I booked), though I hope one day to be able to afford the more luxurious options.  The downstairs living room is fantastic for entertaining friends, more like a home than a hotel lobby.  The outdoor patio perfect for sitting and reading a book with your morning coffee.  I've recommended several family members to find an excuse to visit Indianapolis just to stay here.My boyfriend and I stayed in the SE loft. It was so cozy and quaint. There was free M&amp;M's , popcorn and pop. The breakfast was really good. I recommend getting the room with the jacuzzi.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-indianapolis-airport-indianapolis-3,Residence Inn Indianapolis Airport,3.5,$$,17,"Extremely friendly staff. Very clean. Pots and pans could use an update. It made cooking things difficult with warped pans. Housekeeping cleaned my dishes while I was gone. Unexpected, but I was grateful since I ran out of time in the morning prior to leaving. Gas grill on the patio for use. Not much in the local area though. Had to drive just about everywhere.Hotel stay 05/28/2015. Terrible experience. We picked a Residence Inn because we were traveling with pets, and my husband is a Marriott Gold Elite Rewards member. So, we booked the hotel using rewards points, but did pay the non-refundable $100 cleaning fee (no argument there, we've paid it before at other locations). Carpet in our room had multiple stains everywhere and once I went to get in the shower, it started to hold water and not drain properly. I literally took a shower in water that not only was from me, but judging by the lack of cleanliness, only God knows what other filth I was standing in. There was even a leftover hair on the bathroom wall. Lastly, left on the vanity was shampoo and a body wash. No lotion or conditioner either. Thankfully I had packed my own conditioner, but I must admit, I do enjoy the little things like their lotion they use in the rooms. On 06/03/2015 my husband reached out to Marriott Customer Service via phone. We were assured the concerns were forwarded to the hotel and that since this was a ""service issue"" this location would be the best to handle the complaints. I know, from my exchange with the Marriott group via Twitter that there was a delay and their CSR was still needing to work with the hotel as of 06/11/2015, which is also when I was assured ""We are aware of the issues and assure you that somebody from the hotel will be reaching out to you.""  Yep, still waiting. You'll never get our business again! Sad because Indy is such a great place to stop between Michigan and St. Louis and we do travel quite a bit. Additionally my husband does business in Indy at least once a month. Oh, and there are really only two reasons you got one star. # 1 ~ Yelp won't let me give less than one star. # 2 ~ Your waffle maker made the PERFECT hotel waffle, though since there was no attendant to be found to help with the broken batter dispenser, I'm complimenting the chef of said ""perfect"" waffle .... ME!First off this place is filthy see the pictures! The food is badly prepared, slow coming and will give you bubble guts. I've had hospital food at a state run nursing home better than this place. We paid in advance and had no choice in the stay as it was the closest to our destination. The first night we RAN to Kroger bought bleach, sponges, rags and air fresheners because this place reeked. I stayed up half the night making our room sanitary for our kids. I refused to sleep or allow them to enter the room until I bleached all surfaces and hand mopped the areas.The carpet hasn't been vacuumed since the place opened. They cleaning crew or whoever they were was using a swifter sweeper on the floors...REALLY?!!The staff there is plenty handy but they don't actually work there. Think ""Orange is the New Black,"" meets the old bathroom in ""Saw"" dirty. There was long brown, black and brown hairs everywhere in the refrigerator, sinks, shower, toilet, sheets, desk, even the ice machine. The dishes were put away DIRTY with food crusted on them. There was food crumbs in the cabinets. Spiders everywhere, one so big it crunched when killed. We bought sheets, asked for new towels and wore shower shoes. I was not taking any chances with my families health.The tub was so dark it looked like a football team had just ran a play on it. We have a long history staying with this brand of hotels as it has the small kitchen, usually clean, family friendly, great value and well run but this one is bottom of the barrel horrible. Also stay out of the pool and spa the water was dingy and oily. The water looked brownish blue. REALLY?!! So disappointed, upset and disgusted in this Marriott hotel. I expect quality like what I've received in the past. Where is the corporate office and who is the District Manager for this region? This is a travesty!It's easy to find, situated amongst other airport hotels. Check in was a breeze although it was 1am local time.  Rooms was clean &amp; adequate.  Furnishings were fine, modern &amp; contemporary.  I can't give it a four star because of these issues:  toilet paper was super thin, no lotion provided, &amp; remote control for tv needed new batteries...My wife and I spend spent two nights in this property, three days apart.  The first night was barely acceptable.  The second night was a disaster.General comments:  This property is dirty and dark.  The floor in the breakfast area (and in front of the registration desk) was sticky from spilled food from 7 a . m. until after 3 p. m.  There was spilled food throughout the breakfast area every time I checked.  There was very little variety and the food that was offered looked awful.  Waffle battered was splatter all over the place.  There were no serving pieces in any of the jars of raisins, sugar, or other items to be sprinkled on cereal. I could say more but I think you get the picture.There seemed to be a very large staff available in the morning but I saw no evidence of them working.  Instead, they were having a fine time talking with each other.The carpets in the   rooms look like they have never been cleaned.  The rooms smelled musty, there was a large red stain on the white comforter  in one of the rooms we were in. There was a scarcity of kitchen items  in all of the rooms we were in.The rooms offered the comfort and atmosphere of a 1960s college dorm or maybe a cheap music camp for teenagers...uncomfortable seating, a desk placed against a window that allowed the sun to glare into my face and tiny televisions.Those are the general comments that apply to both nights we stayed there. The specifics of our second night are considerably worse.We arrived for checkin around 3 p. m.  Monday July 6.  The floor in front of the check in desk was so sticky I kept doing a little dance so that I would not permanently stick to it.  We were sent to a room in a reasonable amount of time...and saw when I unlocked the door that the room had not been serviced.Not a good thing, but not a disaster.  And the desk clerk was up pretty quickly with a set of keys to another room.The disaster started around 10 p. m.  Our room was over the patio/entrance to the swimming pool. There was a large group on the patio, making a great deal of noise.  My wife called the desk and was told by Trey the pool and the patio closed at 11 a. m.  Not great since we had an early flight from IND to SFO the next day but reasonable.  I called again at 10:50 to confirm that the patio/pool would shut down at 11 p. m. and was assured by Trey that the people on the patio knew they had to close down at 11 p. m.  So when things did not shut down by 11:10 I went down to the desk to see Trey.  He explained the parents on the patio had asked him to keep the pool open and he had agreed.  He also informed me that the patio was a ""public area"" and that there was nothing he could do about the noisy party.I went back to the room, conferred with my wife and called down and got a new room.A whole lot of inconvenience and unhappiness could have been avoided if had Trey dealt with us honestly from the beginning.  We could have asked for a new room an hour earlier if we had been told the pool was going to be open late and the party on the patio did not have an end time.All of this is totally inconsistent with my experience with Residence Inns.  We have used these properties in multiple states for at least the last 10 years and this is the first negative experience ever.  In fact, we spent the night in between the stays at this property in the Residence Inn in Columbus, IN and had an outstanding experience.I was so close to making this a 4 star review but some things just don't make the cut - like taking a cold shower in the morning. The hotel itself is fine. There are 2 buildings and I stayed in the one opposite the main building where the pool and gym are located. Like another Yelper commented, the gym was a warm 76 degrees, despite the 68 degree setting. Good sweaty workout so I was forgiving. The room?  Nice digs. Good space. Then I went to shower at 6:45 am before I headed to the airport and shivered in cold water as I finished rinsing. I stay in hotels for 3 reasons: sleep, convenience and showers. 3 stars, no more.**This is an update to a previous review. Although I will stick to my comment about the quality of the coffee, I have to say this is hands down the best service I have ever received at a hotel. Our group was having a difficult week and ALL of the staff made us feel like we were at home. This is priceless when you are on the road for extended periods of time. The last few days a new employee named Rachel went out of her way time after time for us in the most extraordinary and thoughtful ways! John was also very helpful with checkout, giving me plenty of time when I had a million emails to send and still pack and was losing my mind.The one star off is for general out-datedness (remodel coming soon) and the coffee. Also I think some of the down pillows really need to be replaced. Didn't get a chance to try the gym unfortunately :/Overall a pleasant stay and would highly recommend this diamond in the rough!I am tempted to rate at 4 stars because of the sauna -- I mean gym. We asked to have the heat turned down from 79 to something more reasonable for our workout, but no one delivered. That aside, the rooms are clean and massive, beds are comfortable, staff is friendly, but the BEST is the breakfast. Waffles, coffee, cereal, hot plates with eggs, sausage, etc, fruit, pastries, hard boiled eggs, and more. You can take anything to go, and it's all fresh. Makes all the difference starting the day!I was skeptical upon arrival then pleasantly surprised. This is not a 4 Star hotel but I was tempted to give a 4 star Yelp review. I didn't because of the appearance and cleanliness of some of the common areas (lobby restroom, elevator, hallways and gross chair in my room-see pic). That stuff would cause me to give a 2 star rating. I gave 3 stars because the employees were all very helpful and nice plus very accommodating. Also, the breakfast was good for a free breakfast-and I'm picky about food. It was not bad! The location is nice for the airport but not for dinner options unless you like unhealthy food.Stayed here a few days ago on my way to Florida. Based my choice to stay here on reviews, and I was not disappointed. I stayed in a two bedroom suite.  It was clean and roomy. The pool was nice, clean and we had the place to ourselves! The hot tub was hot and clean. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I didn't give 5 stars because they need to update a few things. We left before breakfast, but I heard it was good. They also have an airport shuttle.Although this a typical Residence Inn, the service here was great. This review could have easily been a one star review if it wasn't for the fantastic service!It started out we had just arrived at the Indy airport, we called the hotel and they said the next shuttle would be at 8:30pm. As 8:30 approached we were still waiting on bags, a couple came out, so we sent my dad to the pick up area in hopes of catching the shuttle and we'd be a few minutes behind him. Unfortunately, when we got there the shuttle was already pulling away. So we planned on the 9:00pm shuttle.9:00 pm rolls around no shuttle.... 9:05.... no shuttle so I call and turns out the shuttle didn't leave for the 9:00 round... not sure why but we were all getting frustrated by this time. So JD(or JR... I'm bad with names) tell us to go ahead and get a cab and they would pay for it... the bad thing was there were 4 of us and 7 bags, so we were going to fit in one cab.The cab experience was a NIGHTMARE... the cab drivers were crazy. Fast forward to arrival at the hotel. The cab drivers are CRAZY they refuse to let us go into the lobby for the money and say that we have to pay and no third party. JD comes out to settle the crazies... but they get crazier... he appologizes profusely and pays the unprofessional cabbies. Says he sorry and even gave us a bucket of beer so we didn't have to leave the hotel. It could have been a really bad night and the staff at the Residence did everything they could to make it better. They even apeased my father after the whole ordeal, which is hard to manage! The only thing that could have made this any better is if they could have gotten the cabbies deported... they don't belong here... they were horrible... but that is for a different review.I recently stayed at this hotel, and to be completely honest, my experience was pretty awful.  That said, I don't really fault the hotel completely, as my issues were largely related to the abnormally cold weather and snow storm.  Despite that, the hotel offered a various generous amount of points to help make up for my poor experience.  Also, the real reason I'm even doing this review is the fantastic response from an email I sent to the hotel GM.  I'm in the process of planning a wedding, and have found it unbelievably common for businesses to be too busy to bother returning emails and phone calls.  In light of that, I was amazed and impressed at how quickly I got a response.  Thank you for showing there are still businesses that care about customer service!Huge thanks to the management.I had to wait for a co-worker to come out of her room.Two and a half hours I sat in the lobby watching TV and surfing the net.The staff was very friendly.I even hit up the breakfast bar and no one complained that I was not staying there.(Do note that I am GOLD with Marriott. So I feel that I have paid my dues to earn a free snack.)I will stay there next time I am in town longer.Location, Location, Location!Just off the interstate and well located if you are traveling through, or need to be at a variety of different places in the Indy area.  There is NOTHING close by, which is fine.The place at first glance is well taken care of, but second glance could use a little more care, not the freshest of the Marriott properties I have stayed in.   Hotel taxes seem to be high, but the cost of hotels in the Indy area for some reason are generally higher than elsewhere in the country.The pool and hot tub are nice, and the free breakfast is very good.  This property and the other Marriott next door (either a Fairfield or a Courtyard) share a parking lot. and are off a road, that is off a road that is off a road that is off the highway.  Not super easy to figure out how to get into if you arrive late at night.Stayed here one weekend.  Was very pleased.  The room is quite comfortable and well laid out for an extended stay.  You don't feel claustrophobic like in some hotel rooms.  The TV swivels so that you can enjoy it either from bed or from the sitting area.  Very very nice kitchenette that comes stocked with plates and utensils and such.  Top of the refrigerator was a bit dusty so housekeeping might want to keep an eye on that.Just your typical residence inn, exactly what I had expected from them!It's pretty decent price, two bedroom $189 right by airport, have a shuttle that actually runs early (5am) unlike all the other hotels we called in the area! They didn't start until 7am! The hotel itself is great but the shuttle driver needs to be taught what her job is!!   We had a 6:15 am flight. We went downstairs around 5, the shuttle was parked outside so we got into it. The shuttle driver was at the front desk talking to the clerk. We sat and sat and sat. Finally we got out and said something to her like umm we have a flight we need to get to. She acted like WE were being the rude ones disturbing her!!! She moseys out to the shuttle and we leave. She seems to be taking a while to get to the airport, like she's doing it on purpose to make us late. We look at our map on our phone and wonder what the hell is she doing?! When we finally get there it's too late, we get booked on a later flight. We call the hotel and ask if the shuttle can come back, they say yes its on the way. We wait for about 30 or so then call again. The clerk says well you have to call for the shuttle. WHAT?!! We did call you?! So we wait a tad longer and still no shuttle. We finally get a cab and ask the clerk at the hotel if the hotel will cover it because we've been sitting here for an hour waiting for the shuttle! She says yes. So we go back to the hotel and try to relax. The shuttle gets us to the airport in time later that day. It's a great hotel to stay at just don't rely on the crappy shuttle lady to get off her butt and do her job!Rooms and decor is a  bit outdated but comfortable.  There was only one trash can in the entire ""suite"" and it was in the kitchen. I, personally thought it was strange that there was not one in the bathroom. It was annoying to walk into the kitchen to throw away a tissue every time I blew my nose (which was often b/c I was getting sick).  There is a decent breakfast buffet (free).  The downer for me was that the coffee was terrible, TERRIBLE. So bad that I took 2 sips and did not finish it. I am not too picky when it comes to coffee (especially in the morning) but I just could not drink this.  We were told that there was a shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes. We came down to eat breakfast and catch the 9am shuttle (for our 10:35 flight).  At 9:10 still no shuttle. I go to the front counter and asked the lady when we could expect it. She said ""Oh, I shouted ""anyone for the shuttle"" a few minutes ago and nobody answered so I told them not to come""  Um...we'd been sitting right there for more than 30 minutes and never heard her ""shout"" anything. My bad.  She did call another shuttle that showed up within 10 minutes and we made our flight just fine. I suppose I might have been too focused on my terrible coffee to hear her ""shout.""Overall, an okay experience. The bed was comfy, so that is good.",,,,,"['extremely', 'friendly', 'staff', 'clean', 'pots', 'pans', 'use', 'update', 'made', 'cooking', 'things', 'difficult', 'warped', 'pans', 'housekeeping',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-hotel-indianapolis-2,Embassy Suites Hotel,2.5,$$,49,"We stayed here on a Friday night for a party that was in town. I have to say the location is excellent, very convenient to many restaurants and activities downtown (many within walking distance). The hotel is actually connected to Centre City Mall, The Artsgarden, a parking garage and multiple restaurants.The hotel staff were very friendly and our room was ready when we arrived to check in. The room was clean - the bathroom could have been a little cleaner for my taste, but it was okay.  The vents were very dirty in our room, and someone had put a towel over one of the vents in the bedroom for some reason and the housekeeping staff did not remove it before we arrived. So it really just needed a once over by the housekeeping staff. Again, its convenient and an excellent location to many things downtown.  We actually walked to several restaurants and a couple of bars after our party.Update: I've been contacted by the hotel and they more than made up for the rate disparity issue that I had when making online reservations.  I guess I should not have taken no for an answer from the sales department while there. He also said they are on an approved renovation plan, so hopefully future stays will eventually be better for visitors to downtown Indianapolis.The embassy suites were very nice hotel to spend the weekend at. The room was big and clean. The mattress on the pull out couch was a little rough/spring like feeling so I just slept on the actual couch. The managers reception was very nice to get soda and popcorn and other snacks. The elevators were very fast and parking was easy to do on site in the garage. The location is perfect for downtown the hotel is connected to circle centre mall, colts grill. Walking distance to the circle monument, canal, very close to the baseball stadium and the convention center was just a few blocks over. Great location to get to things downtown.Serious moisture problems coming from the windows the condensation would even drop down onto the bed and you could see where it had caused damage on the walls. Possibly mold. ** Update: Contacted Hilton Customer Care to notify them of the issue and they refunded me one nights stay including taxes to me mailed to my house. That's why I love Hilton. Hopefully they fix the mold issue now for everyone else!!Stayed here recently during a conference.  Staff were great.  Rooms were spacious but dated.  Scraped my leg on the 2x4 sticking out from underneath the bed. Looked like it was used to brace the frame.  Convenient to downtown venues and restaurants like other downtown hotels.  The entrance is a bit unconventional.  There is no entrance facing the street, and yo to go up an escalator to get to the front desk or take the elevator by the restaurants on the corner.Managers happy hour in the afternoon and breakfast were great.If negative stars were an option the embassy suites would get that rating from me.  Mold mold mold! Leaky windows and black mold growing everywhere.  I switched rooms and wasn't even given a refund or credit. It wasn't just my room either, we had 10 people check in and every room on the east side had mold issues.Mediocre hotel. The inside first impression was very nice but the rooms are outdated and small for suites. The bathrooms are so small that when you shut the door there isn't much room to move. From 5:30-7:30 they had a nice managers reception with free beer, wine, or well drinks and snacks such as chips and dip, vegetables and dip, salsa and popcorn. But If you're a smoker you are out of luck because you have no choice but to walk the long path out of the hotel down the car ramps/steps to the street to smoke. Over all it was okay. But I wouldn't book this hotel again.Television stations are terrible. With children this is an important amenity. All HD were freezing up. Windows were all fogged up and dripping condensation. Free food was okay but a mad house getting to it.I arrived a little after 5:00 PM. Apparently, there was some sort of special event going on as there were a lot of police officers downtown, and I could not use my Hilton Honors points to pay for the room. The attached parking garage was marked as being full except for hotel guests. I entered the garage and found it was under construction with lots of narrow passageways. I went up ten floors and back down ten floors. There were no available spaces, anywhere, even for hotel guests.  I exited the parking garage and the attendant told me there was no available valet service, I would have to pay $4 for the privilege of not parking in the garage, and could not leave until I paid the $4. The $4 fee is apparently for parking, which I was not successful in doing. I believe that charging money to someone for entering a parking garage when there are no spaces available borders on the criminal. I then called the hotel and asked where I should park. I was directed to the garage for the Circle Center Mall, about a block away. After finding my bearings and avoiding the homeless people downtown, I walked through the rain to the hotel and climbed the stairs to the entrance with my luggage (the entrance is hidden and not very pedestrian friendly). Upon checking in, the desk clerk asked whether I was parking a vehicle with the hotel. At this point, I told her I had paid $4 to not park my vehicle with the hotel because their garage is full, and I was disappointed that they let anyone (not just hotel guests) park in their garage. Her story completely changed and she told me the hotel does not own the parking garage and has no control over it. Very hypocritical to treat the parking deck as belonging to the hotel until there is a problem. The manager's reception was mediocre--yes, you get free booze, but they ran out of the mix for the featured cocktail. They also ran out of potato chips! The snacks provided were carrots, celery, broccoli, ranch dressing, crackers, salsa, potato chips, and popcorn. At other Embassy Suites locations, I have had things like hot queso and chips. The rooms are very noisy thanks to the open atrium design. I think they have added ceiling fans in the bedrooms to attempt to drown out the noise. This is like putting lipstick on a pig. If you are in the suite part of the room and close the door, you will probably be fine. If you are sleeping on the fold-out couch in the living room area, bring your earplugs, as the noise is deafening!  The desk and rolling chair in my room were extremely worn, and the toilet flush handle was loose. Someone's hair was on the temperature control for the shower, and the shower turned cold for no reason while I was using it. When I turned it up, it became warm for a few minutes, then became scalding hot. This hotel is probably due for a makeover, but given my experience, I don't think I'd stay there even if it were made over. One plus, the wifi does not appear to be capped to 1-2 megabits per user, as I have experienced in other hotels. When I checked out, nobody asked how my stay was, otherwise I would have brought up the parking issue again.I give them a four but most of that is based on a free upgrade to a penthouse suite. The regular suites are a little dated but they do have a lot of perks that are included with every stay at embassy suites. Free cooked to order omelette station which they will do with egg whites if you ask. The normal juices fruits bacon sausage etc... They also have a managers reception aka complimentary drinks and simple snacks. As a whole the staff is excellent they moved my packed up belongings while I was at work and upgraded me to the penthouse free of charge. With my permission of course. Sign up for hilton honors and even if you don't stay with hilton brand hotels often you still get little perks like bottled waters at check in and points per stay. Make sure you set up your preferences online because usually there are registrations double and triple point promotions.They will not back date the promotions so make sure you check and register before check in. Once you check in it's too late. Just a weird hilton thing that they don't bend on.THINGS WERE GREAT, until they weren't. Pretty hot and bothered by it still, as this is a fresh situation, but they are LIARS here. Said we'd get more pillows, no. Said there would be complimentary breakfast, nada. Validate parking? Nope. Overall, terrible experience.I went to this embassy Suites Hotel located in downtown Indianapolis where the parking garage sign said  full. But the parking attendant told me to go through because there were plenty of spaces available. It took me about seven minutes to go through the parking garage to determine that the only spots available we're near construction sites. I decided I didn't want to park my car where they were repairing the garage so I left immediately.  Within seven minutes is what it took me to get through the parking garage I was charged four dollars because I couldn't find a parking spot.  The parking attendant told me that the sign says full and then they only let you through at no charge for five minutes. She then called a supervisor because I said I wasn't going to pay. The bottom line is they charged me four dollars for seven minutes to determine there was no parking when the parking attendant told me there was.If this isn't unethical I don't know what it is.The location is great, but that's it. The check in line was extremely long, and no rooms were available when I arrived. Moreover, they had no process in place to contact guests when the rooms were ready, you just had to check back frequently. The room was spacious; however, there was a hole in the wall behind the suite door. We left for our event, and then ate at the restaurant downstairs before returning to the room. The waitress was a bit too homespun to be working at an Embassy Suites lobby restaurant. As she approached our table after we waited several minutes (so much so that my husband asked if we needed to go to the bar to order), I was looking at pictures I'd just taken at the event we'd just left on my phone. The waitress told me to get off my phone and talk to my husband. We uncomfortably laughed it off and ordered. The food took more than 25 minutes to arrive at our table. I ordered an extra meal to go for my daughter to take back to the room as it was late and she had to leave early in the morning. She was not there when we ordered but arrived to pick up her food and ended up waiting with us for some time. When the food arrived, the waitress brought hers as though it was not to-go because she was there. So then we had to wait for the to-go plate so she could leave! My family took turns going to the bar to get refills on our soft drinks.My teen daughter was to sleep on the sofa bed. When we opened it up, you could feel the springs with your hand without even pressing down. Also, there was no blanket or extra pillows in either of the closets. We called the front desk to have them bring them up, and just told her to join us in the bed until they came up. This was a good thing, because they never came.On a trip to Indianapolis, to attend a firefighter conference we chose the Embassy Suites, Downtown and we were not disappointed.  The hotel was quiet, clean, and met all of our needs. We will be sure to select this hotel again if we return.  Fiction, Faith &amp; Foodies BlogI always like Embassy Suites. This one is conveniently located close to the mall and also the convention center. After visiting the Westin and Marriott as well as the JW Marriott, I probably would need to rethink which hotel I would stay in next time. I was upgraded the first day to one of their top floor suites. Very nice 2 story suite with separate walk in shower bathrooms and a kitchen area. The bad part is they don't get hot water on the top floor so I ended up taking a cold shower. Moved to a lower floor and was much better. There is no lobby bar per se. The sports bar is attached, but not quite what I was looking for. Staff was friendly. The fitness center was quite small forcing me to do most of my exercising outside around the area.Location of this hotel is fantastic, but the property itself seems old and in need of renovation. Lighting in the main living area of the rooms is extremely dim and adds to the feeling that the place is ""old"". New furnishings and modern lighting would do a lot to help spruce it up.I was actually pleased with the location, price, and service.  Yes, the hotel needs an update, but as a hilton gold member they upgraded me to a suite on the 20th floor.  Wow, loft, patio, great view.  The staff were very nice and pilot.  I would stay here again.  Shout out to Cameron at the front desk for his guest service and knowledge.So not impressed.A friend and I stayed here the night before the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon. She sprung for a suite, which was quite large, but obviously needed work.  The carpet was peeling up in the main room thanks to water damage, and there was green mildew or mold growing in the bathroom. It was also freezing in our room, despite turning up the thermostat.The vents also might as well have been intercoms to the room above us.  We heard the rowdy bunch word for word, and eventually smelled their cigarettes, too.  I called down to the front desk and they took care of it, until the behavior picked back up at 3 a.m.  Perfect for a pre-marathon slumber party.It does get more than one star simply because the breakfast in the morning hit the spot for a solid meal before running for several hours. Also, the manager took pity on us and let us use the gym facilities to get ready before we left town after the marathon.Overall, this hotel needs some work, big time.I stayed here 5 nights during a work conference. My experience was excellent. The hotel treated me to free wifi my entire stay,  although the wifi did not work in my bedroom, only in the living room. My suite was very nice.  There were 2 tvs, a fridge, and a microwave. The bedroom had a sink in it,  as did the bathroom and kitchen.  The bed was comfortable.  The soap, hair products, and lotion smelled great.  Every morning there was free hot breakfast. It included scrambled eggs, bacon,  sausage,  potatoes,  french toast,  fruit, yogurt, bagels and cream cheese, toast, muffins, cereal, oatmeal, and an omelette station! There was also fruit juice, soda, coffee, tea, and milk. Additionally, every now and then there were special items, like breakfast burritos. The free breakfast helped me cut down on costs considerably and was extremely convenient.  Just as exciting was the nightly manager's reception from 530-730. There is free booze the entire 2 hours! The free booze included red wine, white wine, and white zinfandel. Well drinks,  including mixed drinks. And 3 types of beers on tap. There were also snacks, but nothing substantial. More like pretzels, popcorn, tortilla chips with salsa and cheese sauce, and vegetables with dipping sauce. The hotel has a business center with computers you can print from for free. There is also a pool and a decent sized fitness center with nice equipment. The design of the hotel does amplify sound, and from the 14th floor I could hear the loud drunk people in the lobby late at night. However, when I was in the bedroom with my door closed I could not hear them. The meeting facilities were ample and nice. Hotel staff was helpful and very friendly. I would stay here again should I return to Indy.A great place to stay!!clean, fun, beautiful. Large rooms with suites: living room and bedroom. The rooms have two sinks one in the bathroom and one outside for a vanity. The living room has lots of seating and a microwave, sink, and fridge. 5:30-7:30 free cocktails, drinks, and snacks!Hot continental breakfast in the morning! And there's a pool! Fairly inexpensive for a downtown stay!","This embassy suite was the least favorite of all the many Embassy Suites I have  visited. The entry from the garage is awkward. No elevator to the main lobby, it was challenging to venture up the small escalator with my bags. The managers reception is usually a big perk and I was embarrassed as I raved about it to my fellow guests. No refreshments were out just dip, no chips or veggies. The breakfast in the morning was lacking in quality. The Cincinnati Suites are wonderful. This location is in much need of a renovation. The other Indianapolis hotels in the downtown area might be a better choice.A step below other Embassy Suites I've stayed in. This hotel is in poor condition. Noisy and the entrance is a dirty alley. be warned that there is no way in without going through a smoky entrance. The best thing is the buffet breakfast.Out of all the hotels in the area, Embassy Suites was a solid $100 cheaper than the rest. It's located right smack in the middle of Downtown, so if that's your destination then I would recommend. The gym is nothing to write home about but it is clean and has the bare basics. Never crowded but there was always someone else in there. The staff was incredibly kind and welcoming. I felt like everyone was going out of their way to help make your stay enjoyable. Some things to note are that breakfast is free and every night from 4:30-7:30pm there is a free reception which includes a light snack and booze. Every night I was here it was packed but seemed like a fun environment. The rooms were huge and relatively clean. Walk in and there is a small living room with a TV then the bedroom is right off of it and had a very comfy king. Views were nothing too great but it was nice to have a lot of natural light.I called the front desk to ask how much wifi was and they told me $10/day. 10 seconds after I hung up they said they could give it to me for free if I used a pass code: embassy110WiFi coverage was spotty/slow in the room itself but faster in the hallways - making it less than ideal. If you want to do any major surfing, I'd suggest going to the lobby or Panera next door.Came here with my wife and a coworker.  We booked on Priceline because we were going to a conference and had to stay near the convention center.   So because it was priceline they gave us both handicap rooms, where the shower sucked in both rooms.  Old smelly furniture, dirty carpets.  Guess they figure handicap people don't care.  Both rooms (on different floors) were FREEZING!!, and you cannot adjust the temperature because its between seasons and they depend on outside air only.  When we complained they promised to send up a heater.  After 3 calls they still never sent one up.  Its now day 2 and its still freezing in here.  The ""free breakfast"" was equal to the price.  Their claim to fame is that they will cook to order an omelet..big deal!  Ive eaten at lots of Embassy Suites before, this was the worst.  The internet is $11.99/day and if you can stay connected for more than a few minutes youre lucky.  I wouldn't stay here again..for the money we paid, there are lots and lots of other places nearby.Honestly I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE! From the time I booked my room I asked the lady when the cocktail hour was the lady told me it was from 7-9. When I checked into my room around 7 I was told it was already over. The Asian lady behind the desk had a bad attitude. When I got back to my room later on in the night I seen that they over charged my room ( didn't take my $50.00 coupon off) had to go back down stairs to get it corrected. Breakfast in the morning was good but they ran out of plates and silverware had to resort to paper plates. After we checked out my boyfriend looked at his debit transactions the hotel had charged $231.00 to his card. He called the hotel and was on hold for 45 min. He kept getting put on hold and was told the manager was busy checking in guests. We came back to the hotel (we was just around the corner shopping) No guests was at the desk. We asked the manager why we was over charged he then told us it was a $100.00 hold fee for room charges. (So nobody that works at the front desk knows that but him? ) it wasn't stated on the receipt nor told to us when we checked in.He didn't have the best attitude either. The room was great but the hotel staff is horrible.  Next time I visit Indy I will not be staying here.A little tired and maybe needing a little tighter management.  I'm a big Hilton guy, so I've been in them all.  Prefer ES, since you get more room and often times a decent breakfast.  Skip the breakfast here.... or get there earlier.  First, the room showed a bit of wear and the public areas were a bit worn.  Bed was comfy though.  I made it to the FREE breakfast only to find egg pellets (aka scrambled eggs) that were super dry, cold sausage, cold potatoes.  9a and the buffet closed at 930.  The better solution would have been to direct us later folk to the omelette bar for made-to-order eggs and accompaniments.I did get a steal through a company rate, but it doesn't excuse the conditions for the other folks paying full price.Our room at the Embassy Suites was very nice. The plush comfortable bedding was great. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The living room area was nice. There were some rowdy people in the hotel, but it was New Year's Eve. So, I kind of expected that. My only two complaints would be that the jacuzzi by the pool was not warm and we were really looking forward to that and they were understaffed for the manager's reception - huge line.I will never stay in this hotel again. Service was poor. I asked for an extra blanket, after an hour &amp; a half and 2 phone calls I finally went to the front desk. I was told on the first to calls that I needed to wait to have it brought up and I couldn't come down to get one. The ""happy hour"" was a joke. A few tortilla chips with some salsa/cheese mixture &amp; carrots with Ranch not to mention the ridiculous line to get an adult beverage. The whole hotel needs redone. It is dated and has the most uncomfortable pull out sofa. I didn't expect it to be the most comfortable thing I ever slept on, but I did not expect to be laying on metal springs. I had to put the bed away &amp; just sleep on the sofa which was uncomfortable since the couch is a mini version of a real sofa. Breakfast was a unorganized mess. There was only one cook to order station for a sold out hotel. Finally, if you plan on getting any rest do not stay at this hotel. You hear everything thing from the lobby no matter what floor. It is the loudest hotel I've ever stayed at. Stay somewhere else it isn't worth your money.The staff is super sweet, the rooms are all suites &amp; you can't beat the nightly ""Complimentary Manager's Reception"" from 5:30pm-7:30pm. All drinks are on the house at that time, just make sure to tip your bartender! Are you a morning person? Then you'll enjoy the complimentary breakfast buffet available every morning starting at 6:30am. The location is absolutely perfect! Right in the heart of downtown Indianapolis within a short walking distance to anything, including an awesome mall with a great movie theater! Love this hotel :o)Great location, decent customer service... Place is old and needs renovation.I was expecting better customer service but it wasn't too bad. It is very dated and at night it's pretty dark and not well lit. We stayed in a suite and I did think it was nice that it had a fridge, microwave, and stove. I usually love embassy suites but this is the most outdated one I have stay at.None too impressed. I have stayed at several Embassy Suites in my day and this one is at the bottom of my list.The location is certainly ideal. Close to everything. That said - I knew space would be limited but the fact that I had to actually stand in the corner of the bathroom just to shut the door - come on!!!!! You had just enough room to turn around and that was it. I'm hardly tall at 5'3"" and my knees were pretty close to the bathroom door when I was sitting on the toilet. Unpleasant indeed.My biggest complaint - the temp in the room. Outside was about 35-40 degrees. Inside our hotel room was an easy 75 degrees. We fiddled with the room gauges but that didn't work. We then asked the front desk and their explanation was that the whole hotel was on neutral. (WHAT?!?!?) That meant - it is neither on no off and it was just room temp... They explained that since it was such a mild winter lately that they are just keeping their HVAC system at a stand still. I don't get it!!!!If we go to Indy again - we will most certainly try something else. Our two night stay was almost $500. I think we can find something nicer and probably for a bit cheaper.ps - NO free wi fi. Keep your stinkin' free breakfast and don't charge me $11.95 PER DEVICE for wi fi.I have had a long history of pleasant stays at Embassy Suites, perhaps even over the past 25 years. Unfortunately, this hotel fell short of their usual level of excellence. I was underwhelmed with the quality of the room; while it was spacious, the accommodations felt dated and comparable to hotels that cost half the price. Also, the complimentary breakfast was barely stocked. When I arrived about an hour after the breakfast hours began, nearly all of the hotel pans were scraped clear of food and perhaps only one was refilled within the next 10-20 minutes. I wasn't looking to engorge myself that morning, but scraping tablespoon-sized vestiges of food out of the corners of  hotel pans was not my idea of a good breakfast.I always stay here when I am in Indianapolis because A- Location B- Love The Suites  C- Staff is Always friendly D- I feel safe and secure     Embassy Suites in Indianapolis is the place to stay!The hotel is getting tired. The main entrance is due for an overhaul.Room was ok, lobby clean, but the big perk with Embassy Suites is the Manager's reception.  Makes it worth the extra money -- usually.  Unfortunately, the breakfast was horrible -- cold, tasteless, nasty.  And the lines were huge!  30 minutes!!  The evening reception was equally as bad..  The line was at least 30 minutes long.   Good location, but I'll stay elsewhere next time.I just stayed at this hotel and was not impressed when compared to other Embassy Suites. My room was very hot and even with the window open all night (only opened a few inches), was not able to cool below 76 degrees (temperature outside was in the 30's).The workout facility was very small and all but one treadmill was ""out of order"".The location was nice, as it is attached to a Mall which has a variety of restaurants, movie theater and stores.The rooms in this hotel are in need of serious updating and the HVAC needs to be changed or updated as well.Even as a diamond member don't expect much from this poorly run, run-down hotel. There's a reason why it's $100 less than other hotels. It is perfect for a college road trip, seriously lacking for the normal business travelerI can't even begin to describe my absolute HORROR of finding bed bugs in my bed at 3 am!  I had never seen one in real life, just recall seeing a special on tv about it.  Of course the staff dealt with it well and immediately upgraded my room. Yes, it was a horrifying experience, but I did not realize how much worse it could get when 7 days later, did all the bug bites show up!  I am talking hundreds of super itchy bites in clusters of 1- 6.  I counted how many there were on my hand alone, can you believe it 50!  All on the uncovered areas of my body by my pjs.  I was only in that room for 3.5 hours, I do not want to even being to imagine how many there actually were.  I saw 5 in the bed.  The management was very sorry about the incident and made some very nice gestures to try and make up for what had happened which accounts for the extra star for service.  Its 2 weeks later, I'm still super itchy, have insominia, paranoidness &amp; nightmares and extreme fear of having brought them home with me.  I could completely go on, but I think you get the picture.I still think the staff here are wonderful.  They go out of their way to help  you.  They are very pleasant and personable.  I do however have a problem with rip off hotels.  I paid $311.00 a night during the cheerleading super nationals.  Again, our group bought a block.  I will never stay here again.  What a rip off.  That does not include WiFi.  You have to pay an additional $14.99 for that.  Maybe I don't understand these mega events things just yet but I do know after talking to some of the other parents that there are cheaper hotels 3 blocks away who don't try to rip you off.  Location, location, location no thank you.  Not when there is a $235.00 difference between 3 blocks.","Service is great but been coming here 3 years and the elevators are always slow, this time they are redoing the service elevator so one of the regular elevators has blankets hanging on the inside to cover the glass and thats the temporary service elevator.Free breakfast is hit or miss, they can't handle crowds though, plates run out, juice machine gets low, food gets low, lines back up, can be a mess.Pool is good usually, this time, pool too cool, hot tub was a pot of boiling water and I felt like meat in the stew and the floor doesn't drain well, always puddles around.But its convienent to all the sites, just needs a little work.This hotel is conveniently located in the center of everything downtown and easy walk to everything.  There are plenty of restaurants in the area and the front office staff is friendly.  Cynthia and Sabrina in the Manager's Reception Happy Hour bar rock! They are so nice to folks and make it a really fun after a long work day.  Having omlette station and breakfast included in the suite price is nice.  Although the temperature of the foods on the self-serve line can be improved as the french toast is often cold.Used to stay in the Conrad across the street and often stay at Hampton Suites with my HHonors in other cities, but when in Indy the Embassy Suites is my preferred because of their staff -- they truly appreciate you for being there and especially Cynthia and Sabrina.  Rooms are well cleaned by housekeeping and you get a small work area and living room with pull out couch for extra guests or just to relax a bit when on the road.  I guess folks can use the outer parts as an interview room when on the road for business, I just feel a bit weird asking a recruit to come up to the room.  Would probably meet them in the lobby instead.  Friends in the area can come over and chill in the living area while you finish getting ready to go out.We stayed here for the Monumental Marathon. What a great location. Right downtown,lots of good restaurants,connected to the downtown mall, and easy in and out from the airport. Very good size room(suite)with the two areas. Clean room, king bed and all the extras you wanted,microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. The staff was very friendly and always asking if you need anything else. The happy hour each day was very nice. The breakfast was outstanding. Even though the hotel was sold out Saturday night, the staff keep replacing the snack for happy hour and did the same Sunday morning for breakfast. This was not just your plan bread and cereal, we a talking full breakfast. Eggs, omelets to order,bacon,sausage, potatoes, pancakes, danish. You name it, they had it. The staff did an unreal job trying to keep replacing the food and cleaning the tables as the people just keep coming. The pool,jacuzzi and workout room where clean and all worked well. Over all  for us, this hotel was a perfect spot for coming to Indianapolis.I thought that this hotel was ""A-OK"".  It was very convienently located.  Very close to a lot of restaurants &amp; the convention center.  They had a free, acceptable breakfast, and free happy hour everyday.  The rooms were spacious, but the bathroom was super small.  The cable on the TV in the sleeping area kept going in &amp; out and they didn't seem to know how to fix it.  I suppose my favorite part of the hotel was the Off Track Betting bar on the bottom floor.  I didn't win anything.  I never do.  But boy do I have fun trying!Not well designed. No air in winter and no heat in summer. Do not recommend. You have to wait 10+ minutes for an elevator. I love the location and the amenities, but the sheer designed will prevent me from coming back.The plus side, great staff and nice breakfast. I could not enjoy drinks because it was too busy.My husband and I stayed in one of the bi-level penthouse suites during the Indy 500.  We had a balcony with a pretty good view of the city.  I thought the staff was great, very friendly and helpful.  You are in the center of EVERYTHING downtown so its a great place to stay with plenty to do.  If you can't find it in walking distance they're more than happy to get you a cab or town car if needed.  The room was very clean.  The only issue we ran into was the water was kinda wacky. One time there would be no hot water, next time no cold... I don't know if this had something to do with the number of people in the hotel at the time since they were either at or near maximum capacity.  The breakfast was great with an omelet bar.  We didn't get a chance to go to the managers reception so I can't comment on that although other guest said it was good too.I stay here at last 2-3 times a year for work. I used to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn off the Circle, but for the same price, why not get a bigger room/suite? Check in and parking is easy,and the staff is friendly. Not sure what the deal is with other people having problems with elevators, but they seemed to work fine when I have been here. Since I have a Hilton Honor account, they know to put me away from the elevator and on a higher floor. You can't beat the free breakfast, and yes...being connected to the Circle Center Mall makes it really super kick @$$ as far as location.This hotel is in need of a complete over haul. The fact that there are no elevators taking you from the ground level to your room is ridiculous. When you walk in you have to go up a SINGLE stall escalator to then get an elevator up to your room. If you are traveling with kids like we were this creates a nightmare! They also do not have a complimentary parking option. You have to park your own car in the garage. Again, would be nice if you could pull up and let them park your car. Having a 6 mo old and 2 year old and needing to use a stroller, this hotel did NOT allow for that. I would have paid double for the convenience. We nearly had an accident on the escalator while juggling both kids by myself. My husband was parking the car, I had the 6 mo old in her infant car seat and my 2 yr old holding my hand. You can't anything in the single stall escalator. Who ever thought this layout was a good idea needs to reconsider! Don't waste your time if you are traveling with kids!First the good things.  The staff is very nice, and the place is clean, and the two room suite is really a wonderful feature.  But the hotel is noisy.  The interior facing atrium, that's at least 17 stories high is a huge echo chamber, with every door facing onto that atrium.  I could hear conversations from the lobby floor.  In addition, one of the elevators was broken and so it took forever to get a ride up or down.  And the whole building hums from the air conditioners.  Literally hums.  And one more thing - the walls are thin.    I think I'll skip this hotel from now on.",,,"['night', 'party', 'town', 'say', 'location', 'excellent', 'convenient', 'many', 'restaurants', 'activities', 'downtown', 'many', 'within', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-indianapolis-west-indianapolis,Wyndham Indianapolis West,2.5,$$,56,"Stayed at this hotel for a dart tournament i was playing in. I liked the fact that the hotel was attached to the event. Made it very convenient. The room I stayed in was pretty nice, a lot bigger than I expected. Not sure if I was upgraded or just because it was a room at the end of the hall. The room was clean and well kept. Could use a few upgrades but was still nice. Comfortable bed and a large shower. The water pressure in the shower was a little light, but that is common in a hotel. The staff at check in was great. I cant remember a faster check in. The restaurant in side the hotel was great also (will give them their own review).I would have no problem staying again.Very outdated hotel and their service left me wondering if the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. The remote for my TV wasn't working and someone showed up at 5:30am in the morning to knock on my door saying he was from maintenance. I never called for maintenance. Price was discounted on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> but you get what you pay for I guess.This was my first stay at a Wyndham and I have to say, it's truly a mixed review. Parts of my time was very good at this location, and parts were pretty disappointing. I attended a conference here in February (2015) and was able to see the convention spaces, as well as the guest rooms.The beds were very comfortable and clean, the hotel offered free wifi, and the staff was very attentive. The conference space was accommodating and open, and the food we were served was incredible... they had a fajita meal, barbecue, pork and mashed potatoes and all of our was simply outstanding. When I first got into my room I unpacked everything then got ready to take a quick shower. Unfortunately, the shower was broken (completely, only a bath ran) so I had to re-pack all of my things and move to a different space. The staff was helpful and responded quickly to this, but you would think that they would have a better idea of rooms which need to be offline or not, or at least check the basics.The next morning I was awoken at 8am to a super squeaky cart, and the squeakiness continued throughout the weekend. I am not a light sleeper but these carts are incredibly noisy and obnoxious, and should just be fixed. Again, another small thing with an easy remedy.Besides there being no mini-fridge in the room and the water glasses being absurdly dirty at one of the dinners, the rest of my stay was great. This wouldn't be a terrible place to stop in for a night at all, but spending three days here wasn't the greatest, to no fault of the staff. This hotel just needs an investment in basic repairs and updating and it could easily be world-class.We stayed at the Wyndham West for a dance convention this past weekend.  I absolutely will not return to this hotel.  The attitude of the staff was terrible from the moment I checked in. They acted as though they did not want us at the hotel.  We were not made to feel welcome. The restaurant had wonderful food but terrible service.  There was only one waitress for the entire place.  We waited two hours for orders that were incorrect and incomplete. The website insinuates that there are many things in close proximity, but as a convention attendee there was nothing nearby that I could get to quickly for lunches, and the restaurant was not open in the hotel.  I did not have hot water one of the three days we were there.  I was charged for a refrigerator that we did not request nor receive.  I was also charged for a crib, despite being told upon booking that cribs were complimentary.  Our room was at the end of the hallway and the noise at night and in the morning from people passing through was atrocious.  We will most definitely return to the convention, but I never again stay at the hotel.  This is definitely not a crown in the Wyndham jewels.My fiance and I stayed there for a Titans vs Colts game. We booked the room using Hotwire for a very reasonably price. AFTER booking, I read some of the most recent reviews and I was a bit nervous to stay. When we got there it was exactly opposite of what I expected. The staff was so kind and helpful. We got to our room and it smelled of smoke. I called the desk right away to avoid a fee after we left and they offered to change our room and made note so we didn't get charged. The room was clean and cozy. One of the outlets was a bit unreliable but nothing that deserves less than 5 stars.Oooh.. Yikes. I usually like the Wyndham.  This hotel, however is outdated and just not great.  Stains on flooring, switched rooms due to my tv not working, no soda machine near ice machine, the overall look of hallways and rooms are just kind of grimy.  The staff I encountered, from the van driver to the employees who checked us in, were very pleasant, so this review is not to reflect them.  They were great.   Unfortunately, a friendly staff isn't enough for a great stay. This hotel needs a makeover, to be a WYNDHAM hotel.Ok. Checked in for one night. We have a seizure alert dog. We informed them of this and they placed us at the far end of the hotel away from civilization. The parking lot was closed so we had to walk and walk and walk to get to our room. When we asked for a room change because of the distance and the fact that the room smelled like smoke and the TV did not work we were told because of our dog that was the designated room for us. Have these people not ever been informed that a service dog can not be discriminated against? He's not a pet he's my life line. They seemed ignorant and poorly trained. Rooms were ok. Nothing special or bad to say about the rooms for the price.  Better training and understanding of special needs would have made this a non-event stay. Sad this day and age to have to worry about this. Per the hotel response, yes we were moved only after I demanded it in a crowded lobby. We were moved just down the hallway closer to the exit that went to a parking lot which was blocked and not accessible. While the room was better smelling and the TV worked the location was still well removed from the entrance one had to use because of the closed parking lot. This distance was literally the length of the hotel. As for the staff, one can not help but take offense when told that due to our dog we had to be placed in the location we were placed. Also the young manager telling me it was due to allergies. If the hotel staff were properly trained that comment would not have been made and my service dog would not have been considered in the placement of our room.Overall it's ok. The rooms are ""clean-ish"". Not barefoot clean, but acceptable. Resturaunt is overpriced, but the lounge is a nice place to hang out, watch the game, and enjoy a beer or two. Even local things on tap. There's a 24 hr cafe so even those early morning departures can get a cup of coffee. And a free airport shuttle that runs every 30 mins and free wifi!Overall, not the best, but comfortable and reasonable.Still a great hotel. Large room and standard sized bathroom.Coffee maker with teas and coffee in room.Cordless phone.Back side had moderate airport noise.Slept well in a comfy bed.Adequate lighting and curtains kept the room very dark after the sun rose.Nice shower pressure, but had to report the water backing up in the tub.My girlfriend made a reservation through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> to stay here on a whim during a road trip from North Carolina to Minneapolis.  We wanted an inexpensive hotel to rest, take a shower, and get back on the road the next morning.My first impression was positive upon arriving, the hotel was conveniently on the freeway and the lobby looked updated, with a friendly desk person to greet us.We quickly had our room key, and headed that way.  Here is where the story turns...I quickly made mention to my partner that the carpet was old, and it looked much different from the lobby, as we headed toward our room.Entering the room, we noticed it looked like someone had slept in the bed, and there was a used soap in the sink.  We quickly backed out and went back to the front desk to report this.We were quickly ""upgraded"" to the 6th floor, and we were on our way.The room was much bigger, but with the same decor, so not much of an upgrade in most respects.  The room was clean this time.We ordered room service, which was the only positive part of this experience.   The food was typical bar fare, nothing fancy. Waking up, my girlfriend was unable to get any hot water.  I tried, with no luck out of both faucets....just semi cold water.  I called the front desk to ask what the trick was, and they stated the water was being fixed, and she would call me back in 10 minutes.  Apparently the repair person was already there.  More than 30 minutes passed, with no call and no hot water, and a road trip schedule to keep, so we stopped at the front desk to complain.  We were offered free coffee in the shop located in the lobby.  It had a line 20 deep outside of it.  Sad to say, we'll not be staying here again under any circumstance.I'm giving 1 star instead of 5, because I'm VERY angry about 1 thing. Here it is: I booked a stay here over July 4th weekend, and I used Hotwire. When I saw I got the Wyndham, I was really happy, because there are some really crappy hotels in Indy. We were booked from Thursday night to Saturday night, have breakfast on Sunday, and leave. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to leave Saturday afternoon, leaving Wyndham with an opportunity to re-book it immediately. We left about 3:30, and the line was SUPER long to check in, as the Rolling Stones were playing that night, and the hotel was filling up. I asked for my money back for the night I wasn't going to use (Saturday) and I was told I would receive an updated receipt through Hotwire, showing that I did not stay Saturday night, and that I would be refunded. Well, they lied. My receipt said I stayed my whole trip, and showed I was not refunded for the night I didn't stay. What Wyndham did was sell my room to someone, and kept the money, even though the room was paid for. So if anyone reading this stayed in 334 on Saturday, July 4th, you got taken advantage of, and so did I. I called Wyndham about it and they said they sent Hotwire the correct dates I stayed. This was a lie. It's a shame, and I'm sick to my stomach about it. I even took out the $15.00 insurance policy through Hotwire just in case there were any issues- because I've learned my lesson before... And basically the insurance company said that because I didn't leave due to a death, there was nothing I could do. I'm pissed off, and I'm telling all of you to stay at Wyndham at your own risk. I didn't see bedbugs or burn holes, but I saw shady business, and that is why there is 1 crappy star on this review. NOT COOL. Oh, also, their TV cable system is garbage. But whatever. I've seen managers contact other people about their reviews. If this happens to me, I'll let you all know if they tell me there's nothing they can do about it, which I fully expect... Next year, I'll be staying elsewhere. No matter WHAT CITY I GO TO.  (This is also being tweeted. People NEED to know.)Came here for a weekend to see a Colts game. We had to wait 10 mins in the lobby, just to check in, even though I'm pretty sure this place was empty. This might be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The room reeked of cigarettes, the bed sheets had stains on them and the TV was barely functional, at best. The worst part was the cafe downstairs, we were starving from our plane ride and didn't want to trek downtown just yet. We paid $10 for a turkey sandwich, with soggy bread, completely wilted lettuce and some fake looking cheese. I've never been more terrified to consume a meal in my life.Sheets were clean in a decent sized room with two double beds. Carpet chunks were replaced with new carpet due to some weird red stains throughout the room, shower facet was coming apart and the water was either Scalding hot or cold. The cleaning crew was annoying loud in the am. Probably better hotels for the same price nearby.We had prepaid for the room but the hotel overbooked its rooms and we got bumped to another hotel. When arriving late at night, moving to another hotel was the last thing I wanted to do. Desk clerk was friendly. Lobby looked nice.Stayed here on a random trip to Indy. Not the worse hotel. The beds were super comfortable and everything was clean. Why was room service knocking at my door at 8 am? What do you need at 8 am? Go away!I stayed Friday night through Sunday morning for a local gaming convention. All of the hotel and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful and made for a great stay. They provided lots of great space for games!Our room was clean and comfortable and had a nice bathroom. The beds were quite nice and I slept soundly. The only thing lacking there were chairs, as there was only one office chair in the room. However, we spent most of the weekend out of the room so no big deal.Was here for a business weekend, and I honestly don't get all the bummer reviews - I've stayed in a fair number of convention hotels near airports over the past few years and this was far and away one of the cleanest, friendliest and most efficient. We were a huge and boisterous bunch this past weekend, but the staff were up to the challenge, and went out of the way to get me everything from an extra ice bucket (they don't have fridges and I tend to bring my own food), to coffee in a pinch (the room service number got misdirected to the bar and this poor guy had RUN from the kitchen to get the phone; ""Not a problem"", he said as he caught his breath, and five minutes later that SAME GUY was at my door. VERY GREAT STAFF!). As I just mentioned, no refrigerators and it is true that the wifi is very touch and go. I also could have done with a premium channel or two (I don't do sports or reality TV, so it was pretty much 'Law and Order' marathons or news, which gets a little old). But then again, I wasn't in my room much - I may have felt differently had I been, but I can't for the life of me wonder why anyone would go to a place ten minutes from the airport for a getaway.Didn't get to the restaurant (as I said, I'm not big on hotel food outside of NYC), but I did spend time with friends in the bar and saw what they were eating, and everyone said the food was great. I did try a piece of their flatbread pizza margherita which, while tasty, was most definitely not flatbread (this is why I bring my own food). The 24-hour cafe, while I didn't partake of it, is a big plus.All in all, it was a comfortable and accommodating stay on a really hectic weekend. Provided you don't expect backflips when you get there (and access to your own wifi), I think you'll have a comfortable experience.I was going to Indy for a trade show.  I usually Hotwire my rooms, when I have to stay multiple nights and I was pleased to see my selection came up the Wyndham Indy by the airport.  I checked in past midnight and was beat, so I was ready to crash, knowing I had a very early day the next day.  I plugged in my phone and laptop next to the wall next to the bed and put my laptop and phone on the floor, as I didn't want to leave it on the bed and have it fall in the middle of the night.  When my alarm went off, I got up on the wall side of the bed (not the nightstand side) to grab my phone and unplug my laptop and noticed I stepped on something.  I turned on the light and it turns out that I stepped on a slightly moist condom and wrapper.  I am a seasoned traveler.  Typically when I travel for business, I won't stay below anything that is 3 1/2 stars, mostly due to experiences.  Not only was I completely furious, but I was on a strict schedule.  I quickly showered, the shower was slow to heat up, after 5 minutes I took a cool shower that eventually warmed up as I was turning off the water.  Before I left, I quickly checked my email only to find the ""free"" internet was so slow that I had to teether my phone to receive a wifi signal.  On my way out, I asked to speak to a manager and the only manager available at 7:12 AM in the morning was the housekeeping manager, Tammy.  I informed Tammy of the incident and she casually apologized and said she would make sure it was taken care of.  At this point I was running late, so I said to Tammy I would follow up with the hotel manager when I returned.  I was livid with disgust and their casual approach to the occurrence. On my way to the trade show, I called Hotwire to inform them of the incident and they canceled my reservation and booked another room in another hotel and informed me to gather my things after the trade show.  After my day, I checked in with the manager at the hotel and spoke to manager on duty and said I wanted to talk about the incident this morning.  After waiting 5 minutes at the front desk, the manager came to the lobby.  I asked her if she knew of an incident that happened this morning and she said she did not.  I informed her of the incident and I asked to have a incident report to be filled out and something in writing that Wyndham hotels would be responsible if I pursued any medical attention, such as doctor's visits or testing and refund my stay for the evening.  She said she could not authorize anything but would be happy to write up the incident report and have me talk with security.  I spent the next 20 minutes talking to security and explaining the incident and she said she would ask a member of management to phone me.  That was last Wednesday 11/5/14 and it's now Monday 11/10/14 and as of today I have not received a phone call or email.  I am horrified at this incident and completely dumbfounded at the lack of response from the staff at this hotel.  Do yourself a favor, do not stay here.  Posted a picture too.   Shame on you Wyndham Hotels.I stayed here for two nights this past weekend with my fiance and also got a second room for my parents.  On first impressions this hotel looked pretty nice and we were happy to see that it had a 24 hour cafe open inside of it.  However the first impressions would be slightly misleading as we quickly found out.  My mom is not one to ride elevators and seeing how we were located on the 4th floor, she had to go find the stairs.   To say that they were inconveniently located would be an understatement.  There was only one set that went from the first floor to the fourth floor (there were more sets of stairs but they were all to fire exits) and those stairs happened to be on the exact opposite end of the hotel.  The hotel was set up in a U shape and so we had to go from one end of the U to the complete other side.  So after a bit of walk we made it to the rooms and they looked to be pretty nice.  They had your normal large flat screen TV's, a desk, 2 beds and a decent amount of space.  The beds themselves were fairly comfortable but man were they small.  I think that calling them doubles could be misleading although they were certainly a bit bigger than twins.  Once again not a deal breaker for staying here but not ideal.  Then the first night that we were there neither my room nor my parents room had any cold water.  I don't know how or why that would happen as it doesn't seem logical but we both mentioned it to each other the next morning.  My mother also told me that whenever she called the front desk she was told that no one else had complained about that.  I don't really find that the correct answer whenever someone is staying at your hotel but I suppose it was ok for them?  Finally the last item to happen is that my dad ended up using the telephone to make 3 local calls, 2 of which didn't go through.  Cost of that was $1 per call.  Awesome right?  Personally I didn't look at the phones and I am sure that there was something on them saying as much but charging for local calls even if they didn't go through ended up being the cherry on top for this place.   I know that I sound like I am complaining a lot so honestly the place wasn't too bad to stay in.  Everything that we encountered seemed to be relatively minor but they all just added up for me.The bottom line for me is that I would probably not be back here again in the future.  While the rate I received was pretty good, there were a bit too many inconveniences for my liking and the next time I will find somewhere else.My husband and I were traveling together and this hotel experience was less than desirable. I booked this stay through the Southwest Airlines website since we would need travel/shuttle service to the airport in Indianapolis the next morning. We checked in and went to our room. The exterior and lobby of the hotel was nice however the rooms were very dated and the King room was extremely small. It felt warm in the room so we turned the air down to 70 (it was set at 77) after about an hour it did not feel any cooler so we moved the air down again to 67 and called the front desk. The lady said she would send someone right up. A little over an hour and a half later we still had not seen anyone but we had to be up for an early flight in about 4 1/2 hours so I called down again to the desk and explained that we would ""tough it out"" due to our early departure. There was no apology, just an ""okay, thanks for letting us know."" Throughout the night the room reached about 78 degrees. Once we left the room to check out and went to the lobby we realized the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel. It was about 85-90 degrees in the lobby. Upon check out I asked the man at the desk of I needed to do anything since I was leaving my car for a week. He said, ""yea, it's $6/day... You'll need to pay.""  I told him I booked through the Southwest site and was supposed to have had the ""park and fly"" rate. He said, ""well you don't so you need to pay."" He was extremely rude and again no apology for the extreme heat in our rooms. I asked him politely if there was anything he could do about the charge since i was under the impression I would not have to pay and our room being nearly 80 degrees and he responded with, ""well it's hot down here too!"" I about lost my shit! I told him he GETS paid to be there and I PAID to be there! He then went to ""get security."" I'm not sure why no one was yelling but the security ""guard"" came out and said it was fine to park ""this time"" for no charge. I quickly responded, ""no worries, due to your lack of decent customer service, I won't be staying here again."" Something as simple as an apology and a slight compensation would have prevented this review being so negative.","Old building &amp; carpet, definitely needs to remodel. Small rooms. Smelly hallways. No breakfast/coffee/cookies like any other hotel charging $140/night. Wi-fi is extremely slow. When my room was cleaned I didn't get any amenities re-stocked.Received 2 stars because they have a great gym and the staff is friendly.Had to write an update regarding my daughter's stay at the Wyndham, which I had purchased for her as part of a college graduation present. Though her stay was awful, after writing the initial review, Angela from Wyndham called and asked about the situation and seemed genuinely concerned. She spoke with me and my daughter, and after hearing all that happened, she apologized and offered to refund my money for the stay and then went above and beyond and sent a voucher for a free night's stay at the hotel for a future date of our choosing. We're looking forward to that stay, and I'm confident we won't be offered ""the warm suite"" this time around. :) I am impressed with Angela's follow-up, and we feel very satisfied with the outcome. Even though my daughter can't get that night back, I feel that Angela did her best to rectify the situation, and for that I'm very grateful. That's just good business, and I'm impressed.Fairly clean room, but older furnishings and hardware (rickety closet doors, lousy toilet) reveal this hotel's age. I reserved a 2-bed room thru <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWyndham.com&amp;s=d48333ef042fa4f4de4f592ab77e8b5c74b50ebbfdbf30fb06d03d02b2b242e5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Wyndham.com</a>. At check-in, the clerk insisted I had reserved a 1-king bed room. I showed her the confirmation email on my phone, but she said that doesn't mean anything. She stated that the only way to reserve a specific room type is to call the hotel directly.  REALLY??!!  She did change me to the correct room, so I let it drop.  But this could have gone really badly if they didn't have availability of the room I reserved. WiFi never did connect to the internet, even after numerous tries. Called the desk to make sure I was using the correct login. If you need WiFi for business, forget about it at this place. Room did not have a fridge or microwave. Mattress was mediocre at best, and I woke up with a sore back. On the positive side, everything worked in the room - TV, central thermostat, plumbing, etc. I would stay here again if I had to; but next time in Indy, I will look elsewhere.The location was very convenient for us which was a plus for us. They have a very nice lobby and snack bar that is open 24 hours. Those are the positives. The room is not a 3 1/2 star which is what their status is listed on Priceline. The rooms are outdated and the bed was uncomfortable. They were having a huge dog convention when we we went. Our room was fairly close to the lobby and we could hear dogs barking a lot the first night. The following night was a Friday and the dogs were gone but the noise level was a bit much. When they cleaned our room on they didn't leave any coffee, bag for ice, cups, or extra toiletries. Each day I had to go down to retrieve these items. It was an ok stay. Something more along the lines that I would expect from a Motel 6 as far as comfort and service goes.They charge for a refrigerator even if it's for medication. Not sure if that is legal. The internet is SLOW SLOW SLOW so don't expect to get much done work-wise. No jacuzzi and the pool is not enclosed and closed. Not really a 3 and 1/2 star hotel as advertised in my opinion. I feel like this place isn't a good value for the money.Suck!We spent the night here to catch a flight, so the location was worth a star.  Upon check in the desk clerk was barely civil to us.  We had interrupted something he was working on.  Whatever, just give me the room card.  This hotel is enormous.  There seemed to be very few people there so there wasn't much excitement in the air.  The room was okay.  The beds were comfortable and it was quiet.  I couldn't believe how small the bathrooms were!  No way two of us could get ready at the same time.  I almost fell over the toilet a few times because it was inches away from the sink and in the way.The free Wi-fi was a joke.  I never got it to work no matter how hard I tried. I went downstairs to try to get my boarding passes to print but the computers at the ""Business Center"" didn't seem to have internet.  I tried one last time before we checked out and it actually worked.  I was shocked it worked.  No free breakfast so we ate at the nearby Waffle House.  The two stars are for good location and for comfortable (but soft) beds.On edit:  as Grace D. mentioned below I was also surprised the bathroom didn't have a fan (mildew here we come) and the outlets were few and hard to find.I stayed here with my frat brothers during our Centennial Celebration. The check in staff were friendly. Check in is normally at 2:00pm, but they allowed us to check in nearly two hours earlier than normal.There is nothing extraordinary about this hotel. This is not a five star hotel. It was clean enough that you feel comfortable sleeping and bathing here. My biggest gripe was with the curtains. The decorative curtains do not close. On days when we partied hard and came in when the sun was rising, it was difficult to sleep through the day when the room is so bright. Having access to a 24 hour gym is always a plus for me. It comes in handy when you can't sleep and you feel the need to work out.The hotel is not too far from Downtown Indianapolis. If you have access to a car, it is literally 10 minutes away.When we checked in, we told the guy we had just booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, so it might take a second for his system to recognize us (Hotels price was $40 or so cheaper than the hotel's posted rate). He replied, ""I hate people like you""... we're off to a good start!The room was nice, though, and the beds unbelievably comfortable. If we could fit a bed in our car, I would have just bought it from them. But when M tried logging on to the free wi-fi, he was working with slower-than-dial-up speeds. He called the concierge and asked if he was doing something wrong, and they said they were aware of the problem and weren't planning on fixing it. At the speed the internet was going, they really shouldn't advertise having internet access at all. And considering we were both trying to work, this was a huge issue for us.The faux Starbucks in the lobby is open 24 hours, which was convenient around midnight when Mike started getting hungry... especially considering the only other things within walking distance are other hotels. But there is no free breakfast... one of the only hotels we have stayed in this trip that didn't. There is a card in the room to have breakfast delivered to your room from one of the hotel restaurants but it's $$$ so we just ate dry cereal.Find some hospitable employees, fix the wi-fi, and this will be a nice hotel. Until then....Didn't stay at the hotel, but I was attending an Expo here - so I was in most of the hotel, just not the rooms.   The bar / restaurant was fun but the reason I gave 3 stars is for the feel of the building.  It is very outdated.   I feel like the last time they gave this place a makeover was in the 1980's.   When trying to do business, I asked where the ""Business center"" was.    Low and behold it was the two computers at the front of the building - WITH NO PRINTER!!  I couldn't fax, I couldn't copy, I couldn't do anything but surf the internet.     Might as well call it an internet cafe instead.  NO, scratch that, because I can print at some cafe's!Nicolino's Italian Restaurant. DO NOT EAT HERE.Possibly the worst Italian food ever. It's like crap Stoffer's frozen food--and then they charge $30 for it. You'll get better food at a truck stop than at Nicolino's Italian Restaurant.I am writing this review on behalf of my dad because I have personally never stayed here but I did speak with the front desk a few times and service was great!! :) According to him, the rooms are really clean and their customer service is phenomenal. He forgot his reading glasses and I had to ship them to him, unfortunately they didn't get there over night (for saturday) so they got their until Monday after he has already checked out. The front desk was kind enough to call him and rushed to the airport in order to give him his seeing glasses. I have never heard of such great service before but this was just awesome. It was very nice of them to actually care about someone's belongings instead of just placing them in the ""lost and found"" bin. So yes, this place DOES have GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! :)Crappy room.  Airport shuttle service was not on it.  Waited 45 minutes to get back to me car.  Not a very caring staff.No movie channels the wifi does not work. If you don't have a car your very limited to food.I was excited about the Hotel as the reviews were good. Unfortunately, I have to say the walls were thin, you hear ever time the water is turned on up to 2 rooms away. Also, there was supposed to be a reception our first night, never was. We asked after the first night and they said there wouldn't be one the second night either. The free wifi was very iffy and pretty much worth just that.But most notable was our room service, we left our room at 10 am. to see the city, when we got back at 5 pm our room had still been not made up. Shame on Wyndham!A hotel airport, clean and nothing fancy or extraordinaryGreat hotel.....didn't mind that the structure is dated.....large clean rooms.....great staff...great west side location....lobby check-in was under remodeling but temporary check in was fast and efficient....price range was moderate because I received a 40% off regular rate through travelocity....I came here because my ghetto hotel didn't have food until 5pm. I tried the buffet, it was a little pricey and the pasta was good but not great. It was good enough to fill my starving tummy.I came back other times for the 24 hrs starbucks to get little snacks.I had dinner at the bar, it was expensive but so damn good.The people were very nice and friendly. Greeted at all timesInternet didn't work, over charged me on the hotel stay by 100$, van driver was yelling at me for holding him up when the problem was do to the front desk staff over charging me, one restaurant on site, over priced food and tastes like cafeteria food. I've had better service at the DMV.Very nice front desk staff!  Room was beautiful and soooo clean. Starbucks cafe' and restaurant located inside hotel.","This is a nice hotel except for the location near the freeway.  I had a room that was facing the road and had trouble sleeping with the cars racing down the road.  I was happy with my room, otherwise.  It was clean and spacious.  The bed was super comfortable and had a down comforter.  The in-room wifi is a little spotty.  I had no problems with the front desk service. The hotel has great amenities like a 24-hr gym, business center, restaurants, and even a computer screen of flight status.The Good:Nice, helpful people at the front deskThe room looked nice and was a good sizeFree internet (but extremely slow - hard to even check email)Good quality coffee and tea (organic) for the in room coffee makerThe Bad:My annoyance with this hotel started as soon as I booked my stay there.  I got a good deal through Priceline, so after I booked I called the hotel to see what my room came with (e.g. if there was a fridge, breakfast, etc.).  First I got through to the reservation line and was transferred to the front desk.  The front desk guy put me on hold and then another woman with a strong accent answered.  I didn't realize till later that I had been transferred to an off-site operator.The lady needed all my info - confirmation #, full name, dates of stay - and even with all of those details she asked, ""what location?""  It was then I knew that I had been transferred to someone outside the hotel.  She attempted to answer my questions, putting me on hold twice for long amounts of time.  Finally she told me a few things (no fridge, 2 double beds).  I had more questions but it was so frustrating that I told her I would just wait till I got to the hotel and ask.Then the hard sell began.  Do I want to join some kind of frequent stay club?  And possibly win all sorts of things?  Or sign up for a Wyndham credit card?  This was clearly the purpose of my being transferred to this lady, and it was obviously her job to sell this stuff, not to know about the actual hotels. The next day I arrived at the hotel.  It looked like a big, creepy, old cement box.  Inside was nicer, but it had clearly seen better days.  I think it was updated recently but not everything - old features and fixtures remained in the room.  The carpet had burned spots by the bed.  The shampoo and conditioner were so unappealing that I had no desire to take the extra home with me.  The soap left your skin feeling slimy.  The toilet was dirty when I got there.  The first night was interrupted at 6am by the alarm clock radio going off at high volume (set on talk radio with a man's voice.  I almost had a heart attack).  Then I was woken up in the morning by pounding on the door that sounded like the police.  It was only the maid, and it was 9:30am, but on Illinois time it was only 8:30am and I had been up for awhile after the alarm went off because I couldn't go back to sleep.  The first morning I ordered breakfast from room service (Nicolinos).  They were friendly and accommodating about substitutions.  The food itself was ok, nothing special.  However, the silverware had old egg baked onto it from the dishwasher - every piece of silverware that came with the meal.  That was really gross.  And the coffee was un-drinkable.The overall stay wasn't terrible, but they really sucked at taking care of the details.I've seen faster movement from an arthritic tortoise.  Yes, there was a sudden influx of passengers due to a delayed/diverted United flight.  But the speed - or lack thereof - from the desk staff when it came to getting people checked in was staggering.  You would think they'd take steps to streamline the check-in process for a large group of tired, frustrated passengers, especially considering United Airlines was footing the bill, but that wasn't to be.  I was in line for nearly an hour before I finally got checked in, rubbing salt into the wound already inflicted by United.     As for the room itself, I wasn't impressed; tiny bathroom, and uninspired, dated decor that paled in comparison to the Marriott Fairfield I stayed at for several nights prior.  And for one of Marriott's ""low end"" places to outshine them should say something.  For the hotel itself I'd have given three stars...basically adequate....but after the check-in debacle, I'd have to knock off a star.  Sorry guys, but you gotta show some sympathy to tired, frustrated passengers.Check-in was hectic. The elevators were very slow (and only one of three seemed to be functioning.) The bathroom seemed to have been recently renovated, but there was no vent fan or lighting above the tub/shower, and it was very cramped. There were no desktop electrical outlets, and the only outlets I could find were hidden behind furniture -- extremely inconvenient. The lounge had about as much atmosphere as a family restaurant populated with grandparents. The only upside was that it was much cheaper than staying in the city.As a hotel, this place is A-ok. The room was quite comfortable.  As for hosting a conference, the facilities was very sub-par.  The decor is outdated, the food was probably the worst I have ever had.  The light was too dark to promote lively meetings.  The distance of the hotel from the city is also a drawback.  The customer service is excellent.Stayed a night earlier this summer to attend an event hosted here. The building was worn and smelly in several public areas, and the bathrooms were tiny with extremely low flow showers. (Water temperature was fine, though.) At least the room itself was in good shape: clean carpeting, plush mattresses, and thick blankets.My stay was on a weekend when air traffic may have been lower than usual; nonetheless, I experienced no noise issues.Service was great. Front desk employees were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out. Housekeeping called our room phone shortly after check-in to make sure everything was all right. (Yes.)While this hotel was not horrible, it is definitely showing its age, and it seems like a poor value given the quality and price of surrounding hotels.I spent a weekend at the Wyndham back in July for an event, and after having a sub-par experience at a Wyndham in Orlando, I was a little wary.This was the best hotel experience I've ever had, hands down.The hotel itself is pretty standard. Nice and clean, nicely-sized restaurant inside, good food (and a really great breakfast buffet), and relaxing bar. Actually, I'd say that the bar was above average. Very nice. The hotel staffers were also total pros when it came to the event itself. Even when the attendees took over the halls during the Saturday night parties, you'd never know that the staff was there. Very cool.The rooms are very nice as well. One of my main issues with the other Wyndham was a pretty unclean bathroom. Not here. Everything was immaculate. There was a slight A/C problem in the room, but the hotel was very prompt to fix it.So, why was this such a great experience? When I arrived in Indianapolis (I drove from Toronto), I had just enough money on me to cover paying for my room. On the following morning, I discovered, to my horror, that my debit card wasn't working in the hotel ATM. When I reported it to the front desk (thinking the ATM wasn't working properly), they were very understanding of my predicament, as not being able to access my money meant that I had no money for the event, food, or being able to afford the gas for the drive home. They pointed me in the direction of a local bank to use their ATM, and off I went. When that didn't work either, it was clear that it was my card. When I arrived back at the hotel, I was freaked.One woman at the front desk went above and beyond to help with the situation. She started making calls to her supervisor to see if I can get back the incidental deposit, and even let me borrow her personal cell phone to make calls to my bank in Canada. Naturally, it took time for the bank to sort out the confusion, and the staffer even went as far as to offer me money out of her pocket for me to buy some lunch while the bank was doing their thing. I declined, but this is something I've never experienced before, not just in terms of customer service, but in generosity from a complete stranger. Anyway, the bank sorted out the mess, and I was able to access my money, and I made a special point to make repeated trips by the front desk to give them more thank you's and smiles. Two months have passed, and I still can't believe what a great stay that was, and it made me sad when I had to leave. I really hope I'll get a chance to return someday, and I really hope there is some sort of karmic reward being handed down to that amazing staffer. I did make a point of talking to her superiors via email when I got home, to inform them of her helpful nature and generosity, so there's that.I highly recommend this hotel if ever you find yourself in Indy.2 of the three elevators in main lobby malfunctioned, down most of the morning. wasn't informed of a major event of the living dead movement. Upon checking in, assured our room was in the different part of the building, away from the concentration of fans. Up until 242 am, noise foul language and commotion in halls. Staff believes that they were not responsible to advise or ask if you are staying for an event which is at their establishment.Awful. That's the only way to describe this hotel. Public areas stink, the bar area is especially rancid. Uncomfortable beds, noises coming from other rooms and a staff which either ignores you or is anyone to help you. Avoid at all costs.I was pretty impressed with this place. After reading the other reviews I was really questioning what we had gotten into. I thought the place was very clean! The decor was up to date and the staff was helpful and friendly. I was extremely sick while there so I was in bed the entire day and night and the bed was AWESOME! The only complaints we had were small like the bath tub didn't hold water well and the phone didn't work well it had a lot of static. But other than those two things I was impressed! I would def stay there again!My company pays for this hotel stay, so I have no choice when in town.The hotel and the staff are very nice and friendly.  The hotel provides you with 2-free bottles of water and a coffee maker in the room, offer free internet access in the rooms, computers in the lobby in case you need to print something, and the beds are very comfortable.  They also have an on-site fitness center.On the other hand...Internet service is slow in the rooms, there is no microwave or refrigerator in the rooms for those frequent travelers who like to bring their own meals.  Hotel restaurant is expensive.  If the weather permits, there are a couple of restaurants within about 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel, but if you want to go into town or to a mall to get out of the hotel, the taxi is about $22 each way.  The hotel shuttle will not drive you because of the distance and because they need to be available to shuttle people to and from the airport.  There is an expressway right outside of the hotel that can be quite noisy (bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper).Also, they offer Starbucks coffee in the lobby (that they brew themselves), but they hold the cups hostage behind the counter and charge $2.00 per cup.If they put you in a room on the other side of the hotel, it is a very long walk to your room.The food is genuine and well thought out. Great selections throughout the menu. My server was great. The manager Glenn came by and was very knowledgeable and friendly. He recommended things for me to take the kids out and do on the area. Renovations are everywhere. I think overall if you want true to character Italian food visit. Also, you pay for what you get. Truly quality.Easy to find! It gets the job done. A spot to stay for the night and a place to shower. The beds are heavenly. Not bad.. Suuuuper comfortable you feel like you're floating. Although it'd be nice to have a mini fridge. Free wifi is awesome too. Speedy network.Every room smells like smoke. The hallways smell like smoke. Honestly this place looks and smells like a 1970's Las Vegas casino hotel. Expected more from a Wyndham.  Way more!Brown water, a clogged sink, and no interest on the part of staff in helping us out of either of these issues.  Room walls are paper-thin so we got a lot of noise from the hall in the bargain.  Our stay was, in short, a nightmare.",,,"['hotel', 'dart', 'tournament', 'playing', 'liked', 'fact', 'hotel', 'attached', 'event', 'made', 'convenient', 'room', 'pretty', 'nice', 'lot', 'bigger',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-downtown-indianapolis-indianapolis,Hampton Inn Downtown Indianapolis,3.0,$$,43,"The location is great if you want to explore downtown Indy.  Unique layout, and the rooms were clean plus friendly staff.Summary: Of the four major chains (Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, and Starwood) this would likely be my LAST choice for a hotel in downtown Indy. It isn't significantly cheaper than the Westin,  Sheraton,  Marriott, or Hyatt -  but it is a lot less quiet, the rooms are a lot more dated, the facilities are smaller, and its location is worse. Only stay here if everything else is booked. Pros: it's location isn't horrible. You have easy access to city circle mall. Free Hampton breakfast. More availability than nearby hotels when everything else is booked. Rooms are clean, albeit dated. Cons: When you walk into a hotel and the front desk offers you free earplugs,  you know it's going to be a long night.  You can hear EVERYTHING in this hotel.  The walls are paper thin, as are the windows.  I swear a garbage bin was dropped at least 10 times outside my window. I heard what sounded like gun shots.  Several sirens. Large groups of drunk businessmen from 10 to midnight.  Loud arguments by homeless people from 12am -  2am. Toilets flushing,  bathtubs emptying. TV's.  Don't expect to sleep past 6:50 either. Once one person in the hotel is up, everyone is up. Internet is SLOW. I had free premium Internet as a diamond honors member and I couldn't even stream the republican debate in SD.Horrible layout. You have to walk through the breakfast area to get to any of the conference rooms or to the hotel gym. Although it's a central location,  it's not as good as most other downtown hotels. The larger hotels are just as cheap and have bridges and tunnels connecting them to everything downtown.  This one was excluded from that great city planning.The pipes are old so the water smells like sulfur. The shower was tiny and had visible mildew around the door. The mix of mildew and sulfur was a lost almost nauseating.I am a huge fan of Hilton, but this location was rough. I believe it was under construction, but there was nothing offered that made this stay comfortable. None of the windows int he rooms opened and there was no ventilation int he bathrooms so the whole place filled with hot steam. The wall paper was coming off of the walls int he hallways. The staff was friendly, but weren't able to offer any assistance.I've stayed at this hotel twice. The first time it was just fine - no real issues. The second time that I stayed here the thingie (no idea what it's called) that you use to switch from the tub to the shower head was almost impossible to pull up. I really had to give it my all... and then it was there, and there was no getting it back down. Plus, the shower head itself was SUPER crappy (nothing was the right stream that I could actually focus it in any one location). So stay away from room 722. Both times, the staff was nice and helpful and the valet parking is nice as well. I also enjoy the location as I can walk all around downtown from here. No need to get my car out and drive anywhere - which I love.Great location!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great City!!!! As with all cities getting a higher floor helps with city noise. Some of the rooms are smaller or odd shaped as this is a historic building that has been renovated. But we enjoyed stay a lot .. the staff was friendly and helpful and our bed was comfortable.  Easy walking distance from shopping and restaurants. The downtown was decorated for the holidays and there was carriage rides for a fee.  Typical free breakfast .. I always love the oatmeal.    Only compliant no fridge in the room.My husband book us a weekend away. Here to watch Wizard of Oz. Visiting from Ohio and I must say we will be back. Perfect location to everything. Service has been great and everyone is very friendly. We have never been to the city before and during check in we were given multiple coupons and suggestions on places to eat and visit. The rooms are very clean and neat. Most of all the beds are fabulous! Thank you Hampton for making our stay enjoyable.I love the staff, complimentary breakfast, location to everything, the historic features of the hotel, and the overall vibe of the city. Having breakfast on the second floor instead of the main lobby gives you a wonderful view of the town and a cozy feel.Stayed November 2014, traveled on businessMy boyfriend and I stayed here this weekend from Chicago for a wedding. They were so nice and helpful with all our questions, we were so impressed with their customer service and hospitality. The bed was so comfortable and the pillows were like little clouds! The only weird thing was that the room kind of smelled like sulfur and eggs and farts and it didn't go away the two nights we were there. Other than that the stay was great, I'd definitely stay there again (just not in a fart smelling room).We stayed for two nights.  The staff was fantastic.  As soon as I walked in the valet spoke to me and set to work helping us with our luggage.  The front desk staff was great.  I had checked in prior to arrival and the room I chose wasn't ready but he quickly found us another.  The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable.  The breakfast was good and had the usual hot items you are looking for.  One of the employees came out several times to greet the guests in the breakfast area and brought around muffins for us to take with.  The valet was always quick at retrieving the car.  There are no fridges in the room but we asked for one and they brought one up.  This was a good hotel that was close to everything in downtown Indy.As a frequent business traveler, I depend on the ability to unwind and watch my favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu. However, this hotel has Internet speeds that maybe matches the performance of dial-up.  One star.If you are a tourist, this is probably a decent hotel. The rooms are nice and clean and you get free breakfast.  That is why I give this hotel and additional star.  This hotel can cost over $200 a night though for a standard room.  I do expect a little bit more than basic expectations for the above average price.As a business traveler, I don't plan on staying here again.Fairly decent, low-end hotel in a great location. Unfortunately, the heating system was HORRIBLE. The heating on the ""auto"" setting reverts to 62 degrees periodically, even though I set it at 75. Additionally, the thermostat was probably off by 10 degrees, so I woke up twice in the middle of the night literally shivering I was so cold. I'd reset to 75, and then an hour or so later wake up cold again. After a night of little sleep, I checked out early and into a different hotel downtown. The Hampton Inn staff were wonderful when I checked out and gave me the room for free (they have a 100% guarantee). As I was telling them the problem, several other guests voiced the same issue, so this was not isolated to just one room. I would avoid this hotel unless the weather outside is nice and you don't need to rely on heating.Ideally situated in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, which made it perfect for me as a first time visitor.  It's within a 2 minute walk of the Bankers Life Fieldhouse (Pacers) &amp; the Lucas Oil Stadium (Colts).  The Hard Rock Cafe is within site &amp; also handles the hotel's room service, but why eat from the Hard Rock Cafe if you're not going to enjoy the scenery?  The staff was friendly, My room was clean, although the room I'd initially booked in advance online was not ready when I had arrived after check-in time.  I chose another one floor above, conscious of the complaints about lower floors &amp; the noise I could imagine would be an issue with it being St. Patrick's Day weekend &amp; with the Pacers playing the Celtics.  Like all Hampton Inns, there's a free breakfast, free WiFi &amp; other perks &amp; more for Hilton Honors members.  They afternoon I arrived, the parking valets were particularly slammed &amp; my car was still sitting where I'd left it in front of the hotel nearly 2 hours later, which seemed strange.  Not something I worried too much about, but they were busy &amp; as someone who has stayed in several Hampton Inns over the years, this was the first that I couldn't just pull into a lot &amp; park on my own for free, so I was curious how that would play out.  When I am back in Indianapolis, I'll be back at this Hampton Inn.  It's got it all - value, service &amp; location.This hotel is horrible. They have an issue with loud music and noise on the southeast side of the building. This has been brought to their attention several times but management has not addressed the issue nor do they forewarn customers. I am writing this at 12:15AM with a full work day ahead of me. This is completely unacceptable and I will be seeking a full refund for the night and a change of room.The hotel was so-so but made up for it in the end.  I stay in Indianapolis a lot and I am a Hilton Honors member so Hampton Inn is usually a go-to choice for me.  They usually have clean rooms, friendly staff, and decent contental breakfast.  This Indy location was definitely clean but that was about as far as it goes.  We arrived about an hour before the designated check-in time.  We waited 10 minutes for someone to talk to us at the valet stand about our car outside.  Once at the front-desk there was  problem with corporate card on file.  The desk assistant was not helpful and slightly rude.  After repeated requests to talk to the manager she finally let out a sigh and tried to call him.  I was just told he was busy and must provide a different form of payment (which I didn't have since it was direct bill to my company).  In addition - she made us feel like we were a huge inconvenience by being there early and told us we had to wait in the lobby for an hour until check-in time.  After some time - I was on the phone doing some work in the lobby.  She loudly yelled out to me that my room was finally ready and looked annoyed that I was on the phone.  I asked her to give me one minute to finish up my conversation and she just kept talking to me and finishing up the paperwork.  In the mean-time I had talked to my travel agency who had left a message for the hotel manager.  I asked the attendant to have the manager check and she just said the manager was a very busy person and may get to it later.  She kept telling me they just need to fax in a form but I was trying to tell her they didn't do that and had to just speak to the manager.  We finally got all check-in and got to the room.  The room as great as always - clean, comfortable, and spacious.  The next morning I expected to find an expected Hampton Inn breakfast but found cold eggs, old coffee, clumpy gravy, and tough biscuits.  Overall - this was NOT a great experience.  HOWEVER - less than 24 hours after I checked out the hotel corporate had emailed me offering some points and apologizing for the stay.  That is what will keep me coming back to the Hilton Brand family.Shower has low pressure and constantly changes temperature.  Gym treadmills don't work or they short out the wall sockets and shut down (true story, mine and another guy's treadmill shut down.  One didn't start up again).Internet is nice and fast though ....3.5 StarsI stayed here one night for an interview at Riley's Children's Hospital. Great central location in downtown Indianpolis within stumbling distance to many restaurants and bars. It's also a 7 minute drive to IU and the medical center. Sometimes chain restaurants/hotels are nice because they are consistent and predictablbe. This Hampton Inn is no exception. A clean room and a comfortable King-sized bed, I couldn't really ask for more. The going rate was $130/night which was covered by my interviewers. Valet parking is $17.00 a night, but there are cheaper alternative parking options available. There are plenty of covered lots and street parking as well. Breakfast is included, which was better than average. A wide vareity of fruits, cereal, sausage, omelettes and of course coffee. I had no issues with noise, but I stayed on a Sunday night.Overall a very comfortable stay in a nice central location. I would recommend staying here strictly based on the location.Horrible experience.  This building is not safe.  I had been on the road traveling for a week &amp; was about to take advantage of the on site laundry facility.  Since there is no laundry detergent for sale in the laundry room (which is stupid) I exited the laundry room (with all my stuff inside except my money &amp; room card) and was planning on running down the one flight of stairs to buy detergent from the lobby store and then running right back up. I entered the stairway from hell and was then locked in the stairway.  There are NO signs outside the stairway advising that the door locks behind you without access for reentry. The stair way is marked as an exit though there is no immediate exit.  After a full on freak-out panic attack I saw a dark, dirty, smelly unlit open room down on the first floor - that I was not about to enter - I finally started running upstairs...guess I thought I would make a rooftop escape.  I then saw a phone on the 4th floor &amp; was able to reach the front desk who advised me the 5th floor is unlocked.  Stupid, stupid, stupid and this absolutely HAS to be a fire hazard.  I was in a complete panic...imagine if there was a fire &amp; someone entered the stairway marked ""exit"" only to find there is no exit in sight.   I went to the front desk to tell them what happened and to report how unsafe it is &amp; they insisted the stairway is marked that there is no reentry.  This is when I advised them (and anyone else in hearing range) that I was going to report them to codes &amp; the fire dept for an unsafe condition. I went to the stairway again just to see what sort of signage there was - where I confirmed it was not marked.  I guess my tirade &amp; threat of reporting them to codes at the front desk got management wondering - because I saw three employees coming to the stairway to review my complaint. They finally confirmed with me that there is NO sign there marking that there is no reentry.  Right.. Pretty sure I already told you that.  The manager explained the doors were locked apparently to keep people from the bar next door (or off the streets)  from entering the building.  Why couldn't they simply have a card scanner at the door to allow access to the floor for guests. Is it that much of a money saver to them to keep the doors locked?At any rate.  Thoroughly disappointed, disgusted and still a little wigged out about the feeling of being trapped in a stairway.  Not a great feelingThis place was terrific!!! Perfect parking the bike which was just around the corner of the door to the elevator.  We enjoyed the city too.Hotel has updated their entrance, but hallway carpet is dirty and worn.  And if your room is in the southeast side of the building be prepared to hear loud music and people partying until 3:00am - will not be staying again!I've stayed here several times for work (Hilton diamond member ya'll), and everything went swimmingly as far as hampton inns go. Except for this one time when some unmentionables were stolen. And a general manager who kept telling me I was at fault. And promises that were made for compensation that were reneged on. Do yourself a favor and if you need to stay loyal to Hilton for points purposes, stay at the Hilton garden inn two blocks away. As a SWF traveling for work, I wouldn't recommend this location to any other woman.","Did an overnight stay with a friend. The location is great! Every place we wanted to go to was within walking distance. Check in was quick and painless. The room was clean, comfortable, and beautiful. The property itself has a nice vintage theme which I think is chic and classy! The only downside was there is no parking garage, just a lot and valet parking I believe. We had our bikes on our car so I was more worried about the fact our bikes would have gotten stolen. We ended up parking in the parking garage across the street since we felt was going to be safer for our bikes. It was hard to sleep at night because the noise from the outside was extra loud which was surprising to me. Overall, I like Hampton Inn. They met my general needs.We stayed downtown for a function for my wife's work. They paid for the hotel room so I wasn't complaining. It's a nice place to stay downtown. It's within walking distance of most things. The rooms were a nice size for an older building converted to a hotel. The breakfast area on the second floor looked out onto downtown and had plenty of room. The only complaint would be the rooms, like most hotels, were a bit noisy.I have stayed at this Hampton several times. It's the best option for low cost downtown visits and you still get your HHonors points. It's nice being able to walk to the shopping, bars, restaurants, etc. without necessarily having to pay the Conrad prices.The hotel is in a historic building but is otherwise renovated and nothing notable. It's a room that gets the job done.I spent three nights at the Downtown Circle Center Hampton Inn while traveling for business, and was completely satisfied with my stay. My room on the fourth floor was clean, quiet and comfortable, though there was some street noise late Friday night.The hotel is in the process of updating the common areas on the second floor, but the work was minimally disruptive, and the workers were pleasant when I walked through to the fitness center (clean and well-appointed, if small) and the breakfast area. The continental breakfast exceeded my expectations: in addition to the usual breakfast starches, they had oatmeal with toppings, yogurt, fresh fruit, waffles, and hot offerings that changed each day.While a skywalk to the convention center/mall would have been nice, I was pleased with my choice and with the value the Hampton Inn provided.Stayed the weekend for a volleyball tournament.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Comfortable rooms and great location near everything in downtown Indy.we try to stay here every year for the Moto Gp race unfortunately we was unable to get a reservation last year so we had to stay at the Columbia Club. This place has the best location we have never had any problems at all with our reservations the staff is friendly and helpful cant wait to spend this year at the Hampton Inn. Thank YouJust an ok location downtown. Staff is not very attentive in my opinion. I probably won't be back with so many other options in the city.Stayed here four days for work. First my reservation was wrong then my bill was made out to the wrong person. When i asked to change it i was told to call the 800 number!?  Called the 800 number and they referred me back to the hotel who then transferred me to the hotel accountant who one week later still never bothered to call me back. There are so many other hotels close by, don't stay here.What a great place to stay! Wonderful breakfast selections, and an even more amazing staff. The location is perfect as well. One of the best places I have stayed in a long while.Convenient location, friendly staff, good ""free"" breakfast, comfortable bed.  We were able to walk to mini marathon, dining, shopping with no problems.  The valet parking is the only option, which kind of stinks, but it's a downtown hotel, so that is expected.Great location, great staff, clean rooms. I come here every year during the Indy 500 weekend. They've just remodeled their 2nd floor restaurant area...it looks nice. Apparently they are updating their lobby as well. Sure, this isn't a 5 star luxury hotel, but its perfect for your downtown stay. The rooms have an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, coffee maker, and work desk. The serve complimentary breakfast (your typical continental breakfast - breads such as toast and bagels, cream cheese, peanut butter, eggs, biscuits, gravy, cereal, etc...If you need an in room safe, you can get one through the front desk. And if your a light sleeper, request to be away from the major streets. Definitely give it a try, the staff make you feel right at home.We booked several rooms for our Indy 500 group and were mostly satisfied.The good; Sharon Cosby the group rezee person was way beyond helpful, she is who all customer service people should train under.  Can't say enough about her love and care re; her customers. The gratis breakfasts each morning. Staffed so that everthing is constantly replenished, and clean.The friendly front desk staff, bellman, and valet guys.  The location is awesome, 2 blocks from Monument Circle, 3 blocks from the Slippery Noodle, 1/2 block from 14 West, and within easy walking distance from a ton of other drinkin and eatin spots.The bad; 3 night minimum for Indy 500 weekend (all local hotels do the same).  Jacked up rates; $300+ per night for a tiny room. Hot tip for fellow oldsters; AARP gave a great discount of over $200, AAA was only $100.Other than that it was a good stay, and rather quiet for a downtown location.Water temperature was a big pain in the butt...scorching or freezing.  Two days in a row, I put my do not disturb sign on my door, only to find my room cleaned one day and the cleaner still in my room the other!  If there is one thing you should expect at a hotel, it's having the do not disturb sign respected.  What part of do not disturb do you not get?  ...creepy.  Also, I had to keep reattaching the toilet flusher handle thingy.  Anyways...helpful front desk and valet.  Clean rooms.  Walking distance to shopping and restaurants.We have stayed here three times on previous trips to Indy, both because of a convenient location and the packages that they offer with booking a stay. Valet parking is moderately priced and convenient. Each time we have stayed on different floors and even though one was by the elevator they were all quiet and clean. We have never utilized the free breakfast, but the area looks nice. We have gone down at night for drinks and snacks though. Elevators are quick, staff is great. Will stay again.This hotel is in a vintage building - the elevator lobby on the first floor has an ornate plastered ceiling and vintage ""this car up"" lights for the elevators.  We had two rooms reserved.  On the north side of the hall, the room with two double beds had a view of Maryland Street and the Hard Rock Cafe.  On the south side of the hall, the room with a king bed had a view of the valet parking lot and the brick wall of the building next door.  The south side room was small, had an odd odor and we couldn't get consistently hot water to take a shower.  The north side room was bigger, had no odor and no problem with the water at all.  We used the free Wi-Fi for directions and information during our stay.  The breakfasts were very nice with a good selection of hot foods, DIY waffles, oatmeal, cold cereals, fruit and juices, breakfast breads and good hot coffee.  Thank you to the lady at the front desk who gave us a map of downtown Indianapolis- it was very helpful!  24/7 coffee in the lobby and the snack shop for when I needed something cold to drink in the late evening.  This is a great location within walking distance of Bankers Life Fieldhouse and Monument Circle, and several interesting restaurants within just a couple of blocks.  Ask for a room with a north view.Had a good stay at this budget-friendly hotel. Free hot breakfast in the morning (with variety - one day had biscuits w/ sausage gravy; another had scrambled eggs with sausage and potatoes) with plenty of service and a great selection of eats.The rooms are a bit on the small side but feature flat screen tvs, free wi-fi, and comfortable beds. The downtown location is close to food, bars, sight-seeing, shopping and the football stadium.Nice hotel, friendly staff and awesome location. However this is the hottest hotel in the summer. The air conditioning in this place is severely lacking - be it hot hallways or uncomfortable rooms.  I have stayed here two years running, and have had the same problem in three separate rooms.  The front desk people and valet staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and they made an effort to have a ""technician work on your air cooling problem"" alas to no avail.  I just think the rooms are too big for the tiny air unit.  The breakfast is large but not tasty, and the workout room is pretty nice.  All in all, you pay for the great location, but not for lavish comfort.Worst stay. Nothing was working. Air vents were making noises. Hot water was almost non existent. Was forced outside when the fire drill went off and was told to stay outside in the snow without shoes. No hotel member came to tell us what was happening. Finally went inside without being told because everyone else was. When i addressed the situation with the Manager they said we would not have to pay and now we have a bill. Called to get it cleared up and the Manager said he would look into it and get back to me and he never did. Still waiting for that follow up phone call 5 days later..I really wasn't planning on staying here, but my room at the Sheraton had no heat. I checked out of that icebox, and used my Hilton Honors points at the last minute and drove up to the Hampton Inn approximately 2 hours before the Colts game. My room wasn't ready, but the bellman was very polite and offered to hold my luggage. The Front Desk staff were also very courteous and allowed me to ""pre-check in"" and offered to call my cell when my room was ready.Within maybe 30 minutes, the Front Desk Agent called and informed me that I had the green light to check in. Ironically, I was at the bar down the street, so I tabbed out and rushed into my room only to throw a Colts jersey on, defecate, and chug a beer. In my hurry, I did notice that the room was extremely clean and tidy. It was actually much cleaner than the room at the Sheraton.Upon my drunken return, I was very pleased with the comfy bed. I slept very well. This hotel is not a palace, but it was extremely clean, and the entire staff were very nice.I have no clue what this hotel normally costs, but it's in a great location, and I definitely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.*Oh, and Valet parking was only $14.00. CHEAP!Just stayed here over the weekend for the MotoGP races. Good rates, clean, large rooms. Only negative thing I had is that the hallways are not airconditioned. Otherwise, their free breakfast was great, and their dining area was large with many tables. Plenty of hot water, cheap parking (for motorcycles anyhow) and friendly staff. When I asked for a rollout sleeper, they waived the $25 fee since I was a Hilton Honors member....I'll be back for sure next year! Free Wifi worked great too!","I travel to Indianapolis once a year for the Gen Con gaming convention.  This was my first time staying at the Hampton Inn.  I can't say that I was happy with the place.  I guess I shouldn't have had high expectations for the Hampton Inn, but it still did not meet my lowered expectations.  The front desk area could be due for a remodel.  The staff however was very nice and had a good attitude.  The hallways looked like I was back in my college dorm.  I'm pretty sure I got a non-smoking room but the room smelled like smoke.This wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in but it was far from one of the better ones.I did check out the fitness center which was pretty well equipped and was a descent size compared to other hotel fitness centers.The only other saving grace was the free, hot breakfast buffet they provided for all the guests every morning.  There was a lot of variety and the service was good.The service was amazing!!!  Can't say a bad thing about this  hotel.  Everything was in walking distance and the staff knew where to recommend!  Beds comfy.  Breakfast was varied and everyone smiled.  If in Indy, it's the must!  Inexpensive rates with a staff that has 5 star attitude!Your average Hampton.  Good location near shopping, Lucas oil Stadium, restaurants.  OK pricing with paid parking.  clean and friendly service.",,,"['location', 'great', 'explore', 'downtown', 'unique', 'layout', 'rooms', 'clean', 'plus', 'friendly', 'staff', 'summary', 'four',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-indianapolis-hotel-at-keystone-crossing-indianapolis,Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing,3.0,$$,60,"There are enough people from my project team staying here that we've got a decent negotiated rate, which definitely helps how I feel about this Sheraton. But I should also say that this is one of the nicer Starwood properties I've stayed at, when you factor in price, what you're getting, service, etc. Anyone reading my other angry Starwood reviews knows I think they're not worth the price, but this Sheraton seems to buck the trend (again, partially due to that negotiated rate). Key to my enjoyment is the presence of fitted sheets, which is an absolute delight after all those wrinkly sheets at other properties (or even sheets that don't fit - you hear me, Sheraton Seattle?). But in general, the rooms are good size, comfortable, beds are fine. The comforters/sheets in general are nice and heavy, which I like - turn down the temp and snuggle up under the blankets, and I sleep like a baby. On the downside, the bathrooms could use an update, but they work fine - and there is bathroom ventilation! Awesome! The entry and bathroom are pretty dark - the entry is where the closet is, and it's so dark that even with the ""entry light"" and the bathroom lights on, I can still barely see what I'm digging out of the closet. I don't know if this is just a function of energy saver bulbs or what, but it's happened in a couple rooms so far. WiFi is decently fast, but I'm getting the ""premium"" speed as a function of either my status or my credit card - the ""standard"" might not be so good. Not sure.Their club lounge is nice, with a small cold breakfast spread and a couple hot options like oatmeal, plus some hors d'oeuvres in the evenings. All I need for breakfast is some yogurt and a coffee, which this provides nicely, and if you just wanted a snack for dinner, that lounge would probably fit the bill. The downside is that the lounge smells very badly of a smoker's lounge...and it hits you as soon as you get off the elevator. We've mentioned this to the hotel, and I think they recently replace the carpet, but that smell is still there. I'm not really deducting points, just...something to mention.I think I have something like 18 future reservations here for this project. So obviously I was hoping when I started that this would be a ""good"" Starwood, and so far, it has been. Totally content.I've used the Sheraton for several local meetings and have a great rapport with the staff.  There are a number of options for meetings and a staff that goes above to ensure all needs are met.  Their catering provides creative menus, bartending staff and fun displays to meet your needs.  I most recently had the opportunity to taste a sampling of their menu; BBQ and chicken sliders, Caprese salads in a small Mason Jar, heavenly mac &amp; cheese, chinese noodles with salmon &amp; a springroll, cake pops and a mini dessert in a jar.  Everything surpassed my expectations!If you're looking for suggestions to add fun to your meeting, their event planner can assist you with everything from Team Building, Casino fun with Blackjack and Roulette, Wellness with Oxygen bars and massages - just ask for some help.  Above and Beyond transportation services is located on site and can assist with group outings around the city or out to a local restaurant.  Call Greg Tucker to schedule a tour of their meeting space and rooms for your next event!I really hate giving a 2 star review. Especially for a hotel that has good location and nice beds. The location you know before you booked so it doesn't really count. I prefer staying here over in downtown due to free parking. It's not like you can walk anywhere in Indy anyway. The good quality bed is also a given as its starwood chain and everyone has the heavenly bed. Putting all the good things aside, this hotel is just terrible. 1. Horrible sound proofing. On Saturday morning I was waken up by a family of 2 super young kids. I could hear the whole conversation between the family members starting from 6 am. I have then requested to move room, which they did. Unfortunately the sound didn't get much better. Every time if someone opens and closes their door, the floor shakes. Coming from LA I can easily think earthquake followed me here. 2. No restaurant - the restaurant is almost non existent. They have some tables and you order from the bar. No real server for the restaurant. The tables are dirty and no one cleaned it all night. Dinner is average 30 bucks per entree. The service and quality does not match. 3. Terrible service- they were supposed to switch the room for us. Not only did it not happen, they said we are too busy so why don't you go it yourself (after I gave them a 6 hour window). Super bummed cos I like the location. As an SPG preferred member and I got such service. I am staying elsewhere.I stayed for 5 nights while attending a work function. The hotel is nice in appearance and the hotel staff is nice however, the walls are paper thin. You can hear every word said by your neighbor. The breakfast bar was good and had a decent selection and the waitresses  in the am where awesome. The bar / restaurant  in the evening is a whole different story. The food is over priced and not very good and the service was HORRIBLE!!! The bar server is also the waitress, she is not friendly and did not seem to care that you where there. Both times we had dinner there we waited 2 hours and had to get up and ask for service, utensils, finish ordering and to be cashed out. I would recommend wasting your time or money at the bar / restaurant... Cheesecake Factory is in the same mall/ area as well as other places.   I did like that we received $5 rewards for each night we did not use the maid service. The stay overall was okay but not much more than that.Front desk is nice...when you can find a person.  The pods stand empty...and this was a reality upon check-in at 3:30 PM (when I arrived) and reservation ""casualy"" stepped out from behind the safety wall.  And they were consistently absent at 8:30 PM, when I returned to the hotel and again at 6:30 AM, when I tried (to no avail) to find someone to give my laundry.  I finally found a person at 7:20 AM.Room is nice...that is a plus.  Restaurant prices are beyond high (and I worked in hotels for 15 years).  And service is all-in-all suspect.  After several nights in this hotel, I was wondering where the value is here. excessively high, 5-star prices for a 3-star hotel, in all honesty. And the third star is earned for location, not product.Wonderful experience, most amazingly comfortable beds.Nice hotel with a modern look. Love that it's connected to a nice mall too. I stayed at the corner on the 9th floor and was happy with the cleanliness and appearance of the room. It even had posters of race cars on the wall, which was fitting. Parking is free at the parking garage, and it has a covered walkway to the hotel. Yes, there is free wifi only at the lobby. Most of the staff are friendly. For $160 a night, it's decent. I'm docking a star because of the visible construction in the lobby, the fact that the hot water doesn't last for more than a minute, and because I was sleeping and woke up abruptly to a loud knock from unannounced room service who came to the wrong room. Other than that, I plan to come back.Edit: I'm back and I really like it. I got a larger room facing the lake on the 9th floor close to my previous room, and it's nice to come back after a long day to see it. Hot water is not an issue in this room, which has a tub instead of just the stand up shower like the other one had. I found out the pool and fitness center are on level 3. Construction is gone, and everything else is just great. Mall access is one of the best things. Quick note though--I can hear my neighbors conversations.

We come every other month to get away from our small college town, to shop and to eat. The club lounge has a simple free breakfast, all day coffee/snacks, and eveningHors d'oeuvres (if you're an SPG member or booking a club floor room).  There is direct access from inside to the mall and a Starbucks downstairs. Your basic needs are pretty much met. A spa or kids club would be a great addition. But again, it's the staff and location that keep me coming back. My kids got really sick from a PF Chang's nearby and the staff brought towels and kept checking in with me to see if I needed anything. Now THAT'S serviceIn town for one night for business and while I usually stay downtown,  this location isn't bad.  Great choices nearby for dinner.  Did not eat at the hotel,  but did grab a ginger ale at the bar. service was ""okay"" but not impressive.  Would I return?  I'd consider it.This hotel is actually quite nice, if you can get past the location (on the outskirts of Indy next to a mall.)  That said, there are lots of things to like about this hotel including free parking, indoor pool, spacious lobby with lots of seating and power for charging.The mall next door can be seen as a plus since it's got food options and a nice landmark cinema, of course you're no where near any of Indy's attractions, those requiring a drive to get to.Our room was billed as a king ""corner"" room, though the corner was one window on an angled wall, so the room as more trapezoidal, but it was plenty big with a comfy king bed, desk, flat-screen TV and coffee maker as well as ample drawers and closet space.  The bathroom was huge, with a big expanse of counter space, and a huge shower.  The best part of the room by far was the shower which had incredibly good water pressure, and an actually functional shower massage (when have you ever seen these work?) as well as a spray wand.The downsides of the room were:- AC just couldn't cool the room down, so it was hot the first night (we think this is a fault with the  HVAC system - as the first night it couldn't keep up, but the 2nd night when the hotel was not full, it was fine.)- The fan in the bathroom sounded like a jet engine. Not relaxing!- No fridge in the room.- no free wifi- the hallway and rooms smelled strongly of chlorine (from the pool?)But all in all, the place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the amenities were all there, which is as much as you can as for in a hotel.Mediocre hotel, bathrooms are dated and lighting is bad. Staff is nice, beds are comfy and overall room is good. However this hotel is located near a Champs bar and often has issues with the noise from the bands at Champs bar. For example, right now it's 11:15pm on a Sunday night and the drums/music from the bar nearby are so loud I can't sleep. I'm on the 10th floor and the staff at the front said that hopefully the band stops soon.  They said people complain often and they are sorry, I understand it's not their fault and there's nothing they can do but I have a full work day tomorrow and need sleep. I will find a new hotel for my business trips to Indy. This one was great due to its convenience to upscale shipping and restaurants but there's others nearby that are farther from Champs and hopefully quiet at this time of night.As a long term platinum of Starwoods, I have to say this hotel is Not worthy of the brand. From the time I registered where I was greeted by a grumpy registration hostess, to a room that had flying bugs (yes!) there was really little that is worthy of the Starwoods brand. Sorry folks, but this is not a hotel I would ever stay at again.This is a nice large hotel with parking in the back or in a deck for free. It's located near a mall ( with a walkway) which is nice. My room was clean and check in was okay (just took a while). There was a lot of events going on when I arrived- sports team game, wedding, graduations, some conference, etc. the hotel was quiet where I stayed despite the amount of people in and out. The fitness center was nice with towels, water, and cool towels. My only concerns about that area is ventilation and cleanliness. They have no wipes to wipe down the machines before and/or after use. I'm not sure how often people come to clean it but there were towels left on machines..... I was surprised. That's so unsanitary! The key cards for the elevator are unique. I see the safety of them only allowing you to go to the main floor and the floor where your room is, but people loose their cards and people have guests. You can't go down on the elevator without a card.Even if you are a gold member your not going to get anything special.  Otherwise expect your bare basic!!Better than your normal Sheraton location, in fact, it is more comparable to the Westin class of hotels in the Starwood family than the typical Sheraton. Large spacious lobby with 2 story ceiling, small shops adjoining, and escalators to the 2nd floor meeting rooms and walkway to the adjoining upscale mall are what you see when you first enter from the door off the u shaped driveway. Parking garage across the street also has walkway to 2nd floor, making it super nice in bad weather. Rooms were clean, but not overly large. Standard heavenly beds were standardly great. We enjoyed the preferred members evening hors d' oeuvres and drinks as well as the early morning breakfast at same location. If you are a member, it is worth popping in for.Do not sleep on them. If you are looking for a hotel in the Keystone area, this is your place. GREAT service, nice amenties (fitness, free garage self parking, a restaurant and bar, indoor pool and hot tub, conference rooms, large lobby area, room service and computers for guests to use). It is connected to the Keystone office building and the shopping mall. I was working in the building next door so it was a short walk using the corridor on the third floor without going outside. The room was well insulated, the bed was comfy, the sofa was a nice touch and the toiletries were of good quality.Here's another reason this place is great. I booked my reservation through a third party and for some reason, the reservation was not showing in their system. The manager Courtney went out of her way to see that I was checked in as soon as possible. The desk agent (whose name I do not remember) was also a rare find. He seemed to take great pride in his work and I witnessed his interactions with several guests while I waited for my matter to be resolved and I was very impressed. Gold star for Sheraton Keystone.Miserable Experience - Terrible customer service.Brought a team for a soccer showcase because the location is great.Too bad management &amp; front desk staff are appallingly awful.Don't spend your money here unless you enjoy paying forRude &amp; Condescending. Do yourself a favor and stay at JW Marriott.More like 2.5 but it was comfortable.  I can't testify to a lot of things about this hotel, cause I spent most of my stay here, in bed with an upset stomach.  No free wifi is really quite ridiculous and unforgivable in today's society, hubby had to work (I was sick so he may as well work, right?) so not only do I begrudge PAYING for internet, I get p*ssed when it's painfully slow.My beef, is with the room service, high price already +++ = a $23 turkey club sandwich.  Are you freakin kidding me? $23 for a SANDWICH?!?!?!?! omg.  I asked for no mayo, so they gave me a bone dry sandwich to boot, not even some butter, I had to guzzle water to make the stupid sandwich go down and my fries were cold.  Having to use a card to use the elevator, is a total nightmare, esp when you have guests there who aren't staying in-house and who don't have a key-card.  PAIN.Our room was also really loud, like we were staying half a mile away from an airport, was it the elevators making noise? a parking garage? I have no idea, we couldn't figure it out, as such, sleep quality was poor.  I'm sure there's better places for the same money in the area, I was so disappointed with the Sheraton, it's got a reputation that it really didn't live up to!BRIDES, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL! Very unorganized and unprofessional people working there. The event coordinating team there will tell you things in person just to change it right before your event. I'm left with out a hotel, a location for my rehearsal dinner and now have to scramble to make things work 6 weeks before the wedding. This is due to Sheraton firer the girl I had been working with and NOT HONORING WHAT she had told US...... At first I had another plan for the Sheraton  I was going to do an after party and breakfast there. But then 6 months later from signing the argument, (a year before the wedding) we changed it to a rehearsal dinner..they had no record of the changes! but assured me they would fix this.........The next morning after they said they would ""probably just throw in our suit due to the mix up""  we got an EMAIL from them, they didn't even have the decency to call! The head of the coordinating team says we are basically  OUT OF LUCK! They wouldn't work with us!! And said we could do what our contract stated (which should have been changed 6months prior) or we could redue it but not get what we had asked from months ago. I had 5 meetings with them and this girl promised that everything would be fine and to get back with her a couple months before the wedding to decide our food. SHE LIED! EVERYTHING ISN'T FINE!  Huge let down! Please SAVE yourself the tears, and TIME! DONT EVEN CONSIDER THE SHERATON. It looks great BUT has HORRIBLE people working there! Just go downtown! Or use a Marriott! I will NEVER stay in a Sheraton again, they don't VALUE YOU. Absolutely NO customer service!This isn't worth the chance!!! The Sheraton's looks are very deceiving. On the outside it looks great. But on the inside,......a bunch of monkeys could run the place better!I attended a convention here two weeks ago. The facility is beautiful, convenient, and has free garage parking. My friends who stayed there had compliments on their rooms, especially the twelfth floor with free drinks and food.Located in a fantastic shopping mall, there was plenty to do without a car, and plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.","I am so so so disappointed in this hotel. I can't believe this is a four star hotel. I feel like I'm in a motel 6. The hotels don't have working air conditioner. I have the thermostat set at 66 and its 76 degrees in there. Can't sleep at all. The night desk manager is so so so so mean and grumpy. The doors in the are all marked up. We found dirty old pretzels under the bed. I feel gross and dirty and tired in there. I do not recommend this hotel at all. Kind of ruining my vacation because every one is tired and grumpy around me and I'm only sleeping like 2-4 hours a night.I don't really leave too many reviews for hotels. They are a place to close my eyes and wake up several hours later. I don't do conferences,  and when on vacation my type of vacation includes spending as little time in my hotel as possible. So in short: I don't value hotels that much beside the obvious; cleanliness,  class and comfort. The reason I figured I'd leave one for this Sheraton is because I genuinely enjoyed my short stay (7/27/13) and I will rebook next time we are in town. The hotel is nicely (re) decorated, and has an overall very updated, modern look. I don't know how long ago the run-down pictures were taken here in the photo section, but they do not represent this hotel well at all.The beds (per usual with this chain) are plush and amazing. Soft, thick bedding and a mattress that manages to be firm and impossibly soft made me not want to get up.The shower has good pressure and we never experienced hot water issues. All was fine. The only thing I thought was odd was the lack of places to put shampoo, etc. I guess you can place these on the small raised ledge off of the floor, but eh - I'd rather not. Whiners gonna whine, though (trust me, I will always find something to complain about).This is our ""go-to"" hotel in Indy.I have been both for business and pleasure and had great experiences each time.  We usually stay on the Club Level and the rooms are comfortable, spacious and quiet. The Club Lounge here is A+ for service and offerings.  A lot of Club Lounges charge for beer and wine in the evenings but here it is complimentary which we, of course, love.  I have to give a shout out to Tamera who works in the Club Lounge in the evening- she is an AMAZING addition to their staff. She goes above and beyond to make sure you feel at home. The front desk staff is helpful and does their best to resolve any issues quickly.  The workout room is top-notch, clean as a whistle and even has refrigerated cold towels... fancy!  The pool was filled with kids the whole weekend we were there recently so that wasn't ideal, but around 2 on Sunday they had left and we were able to use the pool and hot tub (which fits about 15 people- it's HUGE) kid-free. You really can't beat the location.  We traipsed all around the city this past weekend and never felt like we were too far from the hotel.  Not to mention that the hotel is located within a 5 minute drive of several great places to eat, as well as a mall to wander around in if you get bored. As for parking, you can park in the garage behind the building for free so no need to worry about daily parking fees!I do agree that they need a little more signage as we had a hard time finding our way to the mall the last time I was there, but overall this is a really great hotel to stay at in Indy.I won't stay there again. Almost $200 after taxes and then they want to charge $10.00 to have Internet in the room. It's only free in the lobby. Nope, they have gotten enough from me. Room is not the cleanest and there is hair on the bed that isn't mine! You can also hear TV's and talking through the walls!I've stayed at many hotels that are as nice or nicer than this for half the money and they offer totally FREE internet!! Screw you Sheraton!!My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night. When we got to our room at around 12:02 a.m., we called to see if we could still get room service, and they said no. I understand it was technically after midnight, but I was quite upset that they wouldn't make a small exception being our wedding night. We were also supposed to receive strawberries and champagne, which were accidentally placed in our friends' room on another floor. Our suite was nice, however I couldn't seem to shake the fact that, on someone's wedding night, some consideration and higher service wasn't provided. Very disappointing for us on what was supposed to be one of the best nights of our lives. I will not be staying here again.Pleasantly surprised by this Sheraton. Pleasant check-in experience and the room was large, clean and comfortable. I paid a little extra for a room on the club level and thought it was well worth it because of the free wi-fi and access to the club lounge (free happy hour and free breakfast). My room was very near the elevators, ice machine, and club lounge so I was a little worried about noise, but it was actually very quiet inside the room.The bed was very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep. The tile in the bathtub looked old, but the rest of the room and bathroom seem to have been recently renovated. I was a little disappointed that the club lounge ""happy hour"" started about a half hour later than promised, but the appetizers were pretty good (cut veggies, chips &amp; salsa, hot potato puffs) although the white wine was undrinkable. Breakfast was surprisingly good--full hot &amp; cold buffet (eggs, breakfast meats, cereal, yogurt &amp; fresh berries, breakfast breads, etc.).My receipt was emailed directly to me and I could check out via the TV so that part was very easy. I was there for business, but the location is also great for shopping at the adjacent Keystone Crossing mall and walk-able to several good restaurants as well. Overall, a great experience and will definitely stay there again.The good- service was friendly and the location good.  The bad-  Slow elevators, no hot water, not giving us the room we reserved.  Overpriced breakfast buffet.  $10 for wi-fi in your room, but free in lobby.  Faulty electrical plugs in room.  Loudest bedding in the world - everytime someone moved it sounded like they were sleeping on wrapping paper.  Squeaky bathroom door.  Doorstop for door between rooms didn't work- one falling down, the other not holding door.Other than that, it was ok???I hate to write a poor review.  I will give a few pros before I list the reasons why I was so upset with my stay.  The beds (if I had a chance to sleep in them) Where extremely comfortable.  The location is fantastic and I love being near shopping and so many restaurant options. As a SPG member and a frequent traveler with a company that has 700 employees (many of whom travel to this city frequently) I expected much better service.  This was my second time staying in this hotel and this experience was worse then the first.  At least the first time I was able to enjoy my bed, however the toilet in the restroom was running when I checked in my first time and it took 8 hours to fix it.  The dinning in the hotel is seating outside of the bar and the staff is nonexistent.  During my recent stay at the this hotel the fire alarm and emergency warnings went off at 1:15 am.  We were told to evacuate the building using the stairs to the fire exits.  When I left my room the hall was filled with white clouds and a terrible taste.  Many of the people on my floor where panicked as we believed there was a fire.  In the stairwells several disabled people had trouble getting down the stairs.  I had stayed on the 5th floor and during my decent stopped to check on several people who where having trouble getting down the stairs.  Several concerned guests helped these people get out of the building.  We did not see one staff member directing or attempting to help anyone.  It was a very cold night and we were all standing outside freezing.  We noticed several people sitting around in the lobby.  One of us went back in to find out why half of us where outside in the cold and the others where staying inside while the fire alarms and emergency evacuation message was still going off and the fire department was inside.  I was told by another guest  that other guests were saying that there was no fire and they believed someone pulled the fire extinguisher and sprayed it up and down one of the halls.  Only one gentleman was at the front desk and he was doing his best to answer questions but he did not know what was going on.  I did not see any other staff for at least 20 minutes.  During this ordeal not one staff member told us what was going on or if we should be inside or outside.  Several guests stayed outside in the cold.  After about 40 minutes there was an announcement that guests could return to their rooms unless they were on the 5th floor.  5th floor guests needed to go to the front desk for instructions.  Once again, nobody was told what actually had happened or what was being done about it.  My fellow guest on the 5th floor where only told that our rooms could not be accessed until they cleared out the halls.  We were never told what had happened or why the halls needed to be cleared.  In the mean time, it took another 20 - 30 minutes for the elevators to be turned back on or for other guests to be able to get to rooms by stairs past the 3rd floor.  In the mean time all of us lucky to be on the 5th floor got to stand in line to be told that we could wait to get to our rooms or switch rooms.  A few people took refunds and immediately left.  We were still not told what was wrong and when we could get our belongings.  A while later we were allowed to go to our floor to check out our rooms.  There was still white clouds from the fire extinguishers in the hall.  Most of the walls, carpet and doors where covered in white ""dust"" and it was very difficult to breathe.  I had to go back to the lobby right away as I have asthma and could not stay on that floor.  When I went back down the 1 employee at the desk was working very hard to accommodate as many people as he could.  We were told they still needed to bring the fans up to clear the halls but he did not know when that would be or how long it would take.  Several guests complained that they wanted a new room and that they did not want to be billed for this stay.  I as well as the crowd around me heard the staff member say that the credit cards where not processed until morning and we would only be charged for incidentals.  By 3:30 I was finally in another room to sleep, however I was unable to access my room until the next morning because the fan pushing the smoke out was blocking the hall and I could not breathe anyway.  To my surprise, my credit card was charged for the room and I was not given a credit as promised.  This hotel needs to work on a better Emergency/disaster plan as well as their communication skills.  The staff and guests need to be informed of what has happened and what is being done or what was done to resolve the issue.  Many of my colleagues have also had bad experiences here.  I am all for second chances but this was my second stay after a not so pleasant first one and this one was worse than the last.  I am very displeased with the service here.Located next to the Fashion Mall and just down the road apiece from Castleton Square Mall, so there are lots of shopping and dining options nearby. The guest floors are accessible only via room key for added security, although the area is not unsafe. The lobby/bar area is huge with several big screen TVs. A coffee bar is also located there. The food I had during a conference stay was extremely good for that kind of thing. There is a free parking garage with an enclosed overhead walkway to the hotel. Overall just a great place to stay.I don't usually stay in Starwood properties (I'm Diamond level with Hilton, so I just get more upgrades/amenities/stuff when I stay there), but stayed at this particular one this week for a training course I was taking.  I wish Yelp offered the ability to rate with 1/2 stars, because my experience here wasn't quite as bad as ""Meh.  I've experienced better"", but definitely not ""A-OK"".  The lobby and other parts of the ground floor are well kept and attractive.  Getting from the front desk to the elevators requires a bit of a road map, though and you may want to pack a sandwich if you're arriving anytime after 4PM and actually expect the check-in process to be swift.  When I arrived (~ 5PM Monday), the line at reception was at least 10 people long and, although they had four stations at the counter, only two were opened.  I've returned to the hotel both Tuesday and Wednesday and saw the same thing.  I'd imagine a short review of some simple data would tell this place to have a couple more people doing check in at these times?  There's not many things that are more annoying to a weary business traveler than having to wait in line 15 minutes to check into your hotel.The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but I fear the room may have been designed by a mental patient on a weekend pass.  Given the massive square footage of the place, I was really surprised to have the closet door placed so as to interfere with opening the room door and a big wall right in front of me when I walked into the room, requiring me to snake around it with my bag to get to the ""actual room"".  The Executive Lounge was well setup and appointed (albeit blasting Fox News so loud I thought I'd entered into Michelle Bachmann's head).  I was really surprised to be told that, as I Starwood Gold member, I'd still need to upgrade my room to get access to the Lounge...THAT was particularly annoying.My biggest ""challenge"" while I was at the hotel was that they managed to lose my laundry and it took them about 2 hours to find it and get it to me, all while I'm trying to get ready and out the door for my meetings.  I started to get really frustrated after an hour or so when, after being told I'd ""hear right back"" from them, no one called and I had to reach out to find out what was going on.  Thankfully the staff was very nice during the process (as they've been about just about everything) and were clearly concerned about making the situation right.Overall....it would appear there are a lot of hotel choices in this area.  You might want to do yourself a favor and consider some of the other options.Ask me on my first stay I would say a 5!!!! But over the course of staying when a problem arises depending on who you speak to it may be handled poorly. Also they will sneak charges in on you that you are entitled to through SPG. One time is an accident a few times is ridiculous.  If you don't care about handling of concerns this hotel will be great. And the lady in the club lounge at night is the nicest person ever.First time in Indy and I got to stay at this lovely hotel. The beds were to die for, I never wanted to wake up! The service was excellent as well. I was here for a conference and we couldn't have had a better experience. I will definitely choose this hotel for my future visits and it was conveniently located to tons of restaurants and shopping!Stayed there this past week for a business trip to Indy, and it was an enjoyable experience. I was surprised to see this place rated so poorly.As a Starwood Platinum member, I was placed on a SPG Preferred Guest floor (Floor 10) and in Room 1009. I could tell the room had been recently updated-- The bedding was very new looking, flatscreen TV, tasteful decorations nodding to the Indianapolis 500, and the bathroom was spotless. Why was everything so new and awesome looking? Did someone die in here? I hope not.TV and Desk Area: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=N9syzynhCaGnRzcLbSYLTw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>Wall Decor: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=n3AJZbvnFxKzWlL0Q0GBkw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>Restroom: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=XIaZ-fUeaTQt-Bfndc2mhg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>The hotel hairdryer was broken (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=IZ5pMfc8zB6W7vwodCzyXQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>) when I arrived, but they were quick to send someone up to replace it. They also threw in some complimentary toothpaste... uhh, thanks? The bathroom also had a complimentary loofah. Maybe only ladies can appreciate it, but it's nice to have (unless you travel with your loofah, which is just weird). <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=27E_iFirmH4TP9KS1ZvIEw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>Wireless wasn't free which is kind of a drag. Parking, however, was free if you skipped valet and did it yourself (and it's really close to an entrance point/the lobby).Bartender was nice and friendly. As a decent looking woman traveling alone, you are bound to have unexpected ""company"" join you if you're at a hotel bar looking to kill some time between check-in and dinner. The first night, I saddled up to the bar around 5PM... The bartender and I chatted a little bit, he hooked me up with a drink, and then he noticed a little while later that I was getting intensely hit on by a creepy dude at least 35 years my senior. Maybe my body language was a big enough cue, or the fact that the guy was yelling, ""SINCE WHEN DO ENGINEERS HAVE SUCH GREAT RACKS?"" (thanks, btw) because the bartender came over and said, ""Hey buddy, lay off or I'm going to ask you to leave."" NICE. I like you, bartender. Pour me another.The hotel is connected to the mall, which is nice for safety and other reasons (like forgetting to pack a jacket, whoops). Lots of restaurants inside. I wish there was better signage about where the hotel pass-through is if you're coming from INSIDE the mall... I got a little lost trying to get back to the Sheraton because there wasn't really much except for two white double-doors. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt74AzSQFfyQqgN7PSEg?select=2pww9C1kHjLtlq3HjzwzRg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/I2Yt...</a>I posted some pics of this place to hopefully combat the gross ones.This is the best hotel in northern Indianapolis. The hallways just barely smell like wet dog. The air conditioners squeak sometimes. The staff is very nice. The bar hours are short. The people who stay there are old.I booked this hotel last minute through Priceline at a great rate. My wife and I arrived very late on a night in early May - after 1am - due to a long drive from Tennessee on our way home. When checking in, the lobby is amazing. Shiny, new, modern. Good feelings happening. The guy running the front desk, I think his name tag said he was the front desk leader/supervisor to that effect told us he ""upgraded"" us to a suite. Our suite was located in the 2nd tower, the tower the lobby is not located in. As we were dragging our luggage clear across town to get to the other tower, we noticed the change in decor. Gone was the shiny modern look and in came an average, somewhat dated looking atmosphere. When we got to our room, we could see that it was technically a suite, however, this tower was apparantly not part of the ""$17 million renovation"" the hotel boasts on its website. This room was tired. Old worn-out 1980's furniture, CRT televisions - heck, even the mini-fridge had fake wood paneling on the front. Now you know you haven't seen that since 1987!Now I will concede that the room was spacious and clean, which says a lot when you are going for the cheap. There was a living room, which included a sofa, some chairs, a desk, and a bar area with bar sink and the mini-fridge. The bed was in a separate bedroom and was comfortable. I was a bit worried the bed was as old as everything else, but it seemed the mattress had to have been replaced at some point. The room was cold so we had to turn on the heat in the bedroom, which smelled for awhile. Maybe it hadn't been used recently.Perhaps they reserve these rooms for people who Priceline a 3.5 star hotel at the last minute for $60 a night. But this really feels like two different hotels - one 3.5 stars and one 2.5 stars. If you find yourself booked in this hotel, whether by choice or by chance, do yourself a favor and turn down the ""upgrade"" and specifically ask for a remodeled non-upgraded room. Hopefully you'll be luckier than we were.Parking is free in a garage next door, but is is no where near the front desk for checking in and out. Wi-fi in the room is not free, but there are nice computers you can use in the lobby for free.Might have given 3-4 stars if we had a renovated room, but had to deduct for the outdated everything and that they charge for wi-fi.I was here for a furry convention. The staff was friendly and accommodating. However for our event they applied odd stipulations and rules. People in costume for example couldn't be in the lobby unless there was 110 of us doing it or it was 6pm. It was really small and the key for the elevator deal was kind of a annoyance. I think our convention could benefit from a change in location. But otherwise this is a decent hotel if you are visiting family or on vacation not so much for big conventions.I love the fact that this hotel is connected to the mall. If you're new around the area, you have access to the restaurants surrounding and in the middle of a business district. Parking is free and valet is also an option. Being an SPG member, I stayed in one of their club rooms. I was able to get free internet, free hot breakfast and free afternoon cocktail and some light snacks. There's free bottled water, coffee, fruit and granola 24/7 in their club lounge. The rooms are clean and bed is comfortable. The room was tastefully decorated with Indy 500 cars and the flatscreen tv is always convenient for my late night comedy shows. Call the 1800 number for Sheraton directly to get a better rate rather than booking this online. If you have AAA membership, mention that. Ask if your company has a corporate rate so you can even save more.Stayed here 2 weeks ago and it was really great.  Would definitely recommend. Love the Wifi in the lobby and the computers. Would be nice to have free wifi in the rooms.So based on our first experience here we were eager to go back  so we did... This hotel always has the nicest associates but this time the hotel roon standards were not good...We were in room 1207 yesterday ...when we walked in the room really smelled like chlorine from pool.  so we left and came back late in evening..our toilet had black stuff under the rim..pink mold on shower tile with mildew scumon all shower hardware yuk!  We actually called downstairs at 1100 pm to have sheets changed in one of the beds because they were soiled including bed skirt and not from us.  At about 1 am we realized our air wasn't working correctly  but we were too tired to do anything about it...The next day I went down to front desk to talk about this I was given 1,000 extra points on my card for my ""incident""... I'm sorry but this room with tax was 180.00 and I really felt ripped off on the Sheraton standard....I was really disappointed  and grossed out.  That's a shame because it is a beautiful property..I stayed here for only 1 night and so far so good...whats nice about this location is that it's literally connected to a high end mall....Also with in walking distance of the hotel is about 20-30 great restaurants!!!  The lobby was nice, Starbucks actually had complimentary hot apple cider for you when you walked in from the cold....The rooms were actually like mini suites with a separate sitting area.  Very clean.   The beds were just like their sister chain ""The Westin""!!!   Very comfortable!!!!    All and all, I'd definitely stay here again!!!","Truly. Truly this is one of the worst, most run-down, old, dirty and disgusting hotels I've stayed in, in YEARS. Honestly I cannot recall seeing a hotel in this much need of restoration and cleaning and general REPAIRING for as long as I can remember. Normally, we stay at Hyatts or Hilton properties for business trips. A Marriott occasionally. I never would think to ask our travel person to book a Sheraton and, after visiting this property, I will NEVER EVER STAY at a Sheraton. Tomorrow I'm going to shoot video and take pictures- as I feel it would almost be unbelievable if I type up how awful it is. Every single area is shouting out: ""I'm an old hotel! I need to be fixed, I need to be painted, I need to be dry-walled, I need new furniture, I need to be ironed, I need a new tub, I need a vent cover...."" etc. I keep walking down the halls looking at the worn torn carpet, the beat up dented scratched walls and wondering, was there a tornado here last night? It's that bad. My room is clearly missing some furniture, some vent covers and it feels like they slapped two beds in an office. I honestly feel uncomfortable sleeping in the beds.....I recall years ago when I worked for a startup company we really had to watch our travel expenses. I would book Best Western hotels or sometimes Comfort Suites. I'd consider those hotels to be a 3-star hotel, just for comparison-sake. Literally- any BW or Comfort Suites was 200X better than this hotel. I'm appalled and plan to call corporate on this hotel and send them all the visuals I take. I will post the pictures later- but save yourself, don't stay here!! Seriously.I just stayed at the Sheraton at Keystone at the Crossing the past two nights as part of a new job and relocation process.The lobby was clean and modern and all of my dealings with the counter at check-in time were good -- very friendly and professional. I didn't take advantage of the valet parking and just parked in back of the building.The room itself was OK and the bedding was comfortable. There was a 42"" plasma TV which carried NFL Network (a must-have for me now that the season is in full swing). Hot water was always available. Ice and vending machines were right down the hall. The hotel walls were your typical paper thin variety, so expect to hear your neighbors' alarm clocks and whatnot.Wi-FI was available in the room for a fee but was reliable and speedy in my experience. I did not use any of the business center facilities in the lobby.The only complaints I had about my stay here were that my fourth-floor room was apparently located almost directly over some kind of a party/conference room.... on my second night there, there was a good deal of loud yelling and laughing sounds coming from below. Also, I didn't receive additional bath soap on my second day.I ordered room service both nights and the food was very good. On the second night, they screwed up my order by sending it to the wrong room... when I called down after an hour to find out what was going on, they admitted their mistake and redirected the meal to my room free of charge.There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and even more within a short drive.Overall, I recommend the Sheraton Keystone... I realize that hotel chains tend to give their non-frequent guests the crappier rooms in the hotel, so you might want to book something above the fourth floor. Other than that, it's a good place to stay although a little pricy.Another TREMENDOUS experience at this hotel!!!  We stayed off and on last year for around 3 weeks while conducting business in Indianapolis and loved the hotel and the associates that work there so we were very excited to return this year on business and spent a week there in October.  Being Starwood Platinum members we got a jr suite next door to the club lounge on the 12th floor where we got free breakfasts and appetizers and drinks every day!! Tamara, Maryann and James made us feel so welcome in the club lounge and Kiana and the restaurant staff took great care of us as well!! It was like  coming home to see all our dear friends at this great hotel! We also LOVE the connecting covered walkway that connects to the newly remodeled fashion mall next door where we spent a lot of ""quality"" time in our favorite shops (Nordstroms, The Walking Store, etc).  We hope to be back in January to enjoy this great hotel once more!Not all Sheratons are built equally. This one is one of the better ones.Attached garage is great, rooms are large and comfortable and staff has been great.Menu is longer and more high quality that the average Sheraton, and the club lounge goes further than average with cocktails and breakfast.Great location and I like that it is attached to the mall, however finding your way around can be extremely difficult.  Having more signage would be a huge plus for this hotel.  The staff, however, was extremely friendly.  At the little coffee cafe I ordered soy to go into my coffee, however they do not carry soy.  It just so happened that one of the ladies uses soy for her coffee and had some in the back and she offered some to me.  Being the trusting and non-germaphobe person that I am, I gladly excepted and enjoyed my coffee just how I love it.  Any staff that goes above and beyond like that definitely deserves recognition!Okay.  I'm going to try and keep this simple:For a hotel of this size, nameplate and cost per room this hotel is a complete failure.  Approaching the hotel, it looks pretty modern and nice.  It's next to what seems like a high-end mall for the WASPy suburbanite inside of you but if you don't use the valet, you have to drive around to the back B-level entrance where you get all the charm of a hospital emergency room.  The lobby is pretty nice and the staff were pleasant and helpful.  Like other reviewers they dropped the ""remodel is coming"" stuff.  I got my key and headed to my room where I noticed that there were several displays with fabric and carpet swatches with renderings of said remodel.  Whootpie-do!  What good does that do me?  Am I supposed to use my imagination and make believe when I get to my room?  Which leads me to the next point...It's very easy to use your imagination when you get into your room because there is no light switch anywhere near the door so you're in complete darkness if you check in after sundown!  Try and picture that earlier rendering because you're going to have to Stevie Wonder your way around the room until you stumble into the bathroom, the only place where I found a switchBed was clean but old.  Springs were hard and creaky.  Hot water took about 5 minutes or more to get going (6:30 AM on a Sunday, maybe I was the first to shower).  TV had all the classic hotel room channels plus the obligatory staticy channels.  I've never understood why every hotel in the US has at least a couple channels with weak signal but I digress.  No free wifi (hard wired internet was also at a cost).  No free coffee that I was aware of.  I peaked at their breakfast menu and when I saw the 8 dollar oatmeal I got my trusty (except for calls) iPhone out and yelped to the stellar Cafe Patachou.  So in short, this is an awesome Motel and a lousy Hotel.  Shop around.if you're thinking of staying here, then think again.  it's in desperate need of remodeling, which i overheard the front desk say to another guest that it was being scheduled in a few months. let's hope so.what i did like: good service from the front desk and meetings staff, and free wifi in the lobby.what i didn't like:i got put into the older tower; opened the door and walked into a room that wreaked of stale cigarettes and 80s furniture. the carpet had stains like someone rubbed red lipstick into it or spilled nail polish. the ethernet worked for an hour and then never again for the rest of my three-day stay. happily, the front desk attendant reversed the charge.  the tub was quite narrow and oddly shaped. i actually took a little tumble in the tub. luckily i was able to grab onto the shower curtain and safety bar to keep from breaking my ankle or cracking my head open.i'd recommend staying at another hotel until this one is remodeled.It had been a few years since I had been here for a conference.  The facility was nice then, but now they have made some renovations for the better. Definitely a good place to hold a conference.New renovation.  It is very clean and modern with free WiFi (lobby only).  WiFi in the room was available for a fee.  Adjacent to a renovated mall and theater with a Starbucks and Apple store.  Also, there is a Maggie Moos less than a mile away.  Plenty of food options.  The rooms were very nice with quality mattresses (firm), linens, and furnishings.  Free parking which is good considering all the downtown places charge $30+/per night.  No hidden fees.  Hotwire rates it at 4-star and I agree.Nice, clean hotel connected to the Fashion Mall....great in the winter.  The people there were super friendly and the beds are extremely comfortable.I really do appreciate hotel chains that have a consistent product - especially when you two hotels in the same area.   Last time I was in town, I stayed downtown at the Sheraton (upgraded to a suite because they were out of King rooms and because I am a loyal customer), and decided this trip to stay out at Keystone Crossing to be slightly closer to work, and avoid the $25 parking fee at the downtown version.1 Star - Hotel is in a great location.  Easy to freeway, 25 mins. to/from the airport, close to some decent chain restaurants, and a mall if you need that kind of distraction.1 Star - Free parkingChecked in at 11 p.m.  All the King rooms were booked...and no upgrade.  Rooms here are nothing like the downtown version.  Small rooms (think NY small), and don't look they have been updated at all in the past 5ish years.  The TV in the room is so old the welcome screen from the Hotel TV menu has been burned into the screen (i.e. when turned off, you can still see it on the screen)...and either not noticed, or no one cares to replace. Next time I'm in town, I'll stay downtown...stick with the consistent one.The rooms are fine, though dated.  I like being able to walk directly into the mall, and it's just a brief foray outside to Patachou, my favorite area spot for breakfast.  My fondness for the hotel is definitely due, in part, to its receptivity to low bids through Priceline.I really like Nancy W's checklist of this hotel.  It's dead-on.  (Though I can't relate to the whole Knob Creek situation)  I was shocked to find that the room didn't have wireless internet and that I actually had to pay for access as well (even a crappy, cheap-ass hotel I stayed at in Ft. Worth at least had wireless available - and it was free).  I wouldn't spend the money on the breakfast buffet.  Not worth the money.  Go to Panera just down the street.Overall, good service, but the property and amenities itself aren't so good.  I won't be running back anytime soon.Well this was the last straw for me with this hotel, if you get the older tower RUN! dirty dirty dirty bring your tent instead! I will now be staying at the Marriott next to it.I visited this weekend from Chicago for a family member's baby shower and didn't have the best experience.  Pros: (agree with some others) close to highway, nice shower with great pressure, nice bar downstairs, many comfortable couches and chairs to sit on it the various lobbies.Cons: The bed (it was the pullout bed in the suite) was really uncomfortable, the operator staff was really rude, extremely noisy hotel.  I called the operator because the front staff (who were very nice) sent us to the wrong room.  The woman on the phone was so rude to me and acted as if I should know where I was going in the hotel (and I know there are at least 3 different elevator banks taking you to different parts of the huge hotel).  Later in the night, we heard music so loud that we couldn't sleep.  I called and unfortunately got the same operator.  She said the music was from Champps across the street (and we were on the 10th floor- it sounded like it was right above us) and she acted as though I should know that!  ""Well, of course, the music is coming from Champps and you're on that side of the building.""  She had a ""What do you want ME to do about it?"" attitude which really didn't help the situation.  Her attitude alone will keep me from going back.. probably ever to a Sheraton again.Great location (connected to a high end mall with Saks etc..) and close to a lot of decent restaurants.  I appreciated the great service, especially in the concierges lounge.  Didn't get a chance to try out the gym, but they have a deal with the Ballys next door (which is also connected)All in all I enjoyed my stay.  Definitely try out the bed when you first get there though because the first room I had, had a horrible bed with springs popping out.  This is one of the things I check for as I travel frequently and there is nothing worse than a night without sleep.Okay hotel, but a little run down, peeling wall paper, etc.Stayed for one week post Christmas. Unless you take adjoining rooms as a family, strangers conversations/coughs/clearing throats/fights/dogs barking etc feel as if they are in your bed with you. Only slept two out of seven nights after hotel cleared out after New Years. Connecting doors are very poorly insulated. Staff at hotel is superior...really excellent but Starwood needs to do something about insulating those doors. Have stayed many places with connecting doors and never experienced anything as bad. Poor materials used????The Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel &amp; Suites is located at Keystone at the Crossing next to the Fashion Mall,  a combination of (mostly) upscale stores and higher-end chain restaurants.  It's on 465 N so it's easy and quasi-quick to get to the airport, about 30 minutes away in non-commute times.  For my purposes, the location was perfect, just across a man-made lake (formerly a quarry) from the company I was visiting.As a business traveler, I care about the following:  Cleanliness - not so much.  The rooms and hallways are dingy-ish and the hotel badly needs an overall remodel the main floor public spaces are very well kept;A good bed - check;Excellent hot water - check;Good water pressure - YES with a fantastic shower head - just powerful enough to clear out the remainder of the Knob Creeks I consumed on Tuesday night;Decent bathtub for those post-client therapeutic baths - eh, not so good;Fast Internet - as long as you shell out 9.95 per 24 hours;A work desk - the large table was great, but the chair was HORRID; andRoom service/food - the room service servers were great but the food sucked.The bartender was great, too.All-in-all, the people at this Sheraton provide excellent service, but the property and especially the food are not so good.  Stay at the Marriott (also on the 'lake') if you can.  I think the room prices are comparable and according to one of my co-workers, it's more up-to-date and has a decent restaurant.The hotel is outdated and has turned to nickel and diming guests to make up revenue-charging $20 for a rollaway bed and $5 the gym.  Front desk staff is surly, clearly tired from having to defend their property.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-indianapolis-hotel-and-suites-indianapolis,Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,3.5,$$$,46,"Spacious room, perfect for work trips. It had to be around 800 square feet, with a room with two beds and an additional room attached with a desk and couch and tv. 10 mins walking distance to the JW. Hotel is well melts and clean. I'd definitely return!Breakfast buffet held a variety of cold and hot breakfast items.  Omelet/waffle stand was extremely slow due to only one chef working the station.We also booked the ""Hotwire"" deal therefore we could have received the less Hilton experience than others have gotten. Mainly, I just want to know why there is no refrigerator in these rooms?! We stayed for three nights, and obviously that is necessary. Also, when our room was cleaned the sheets were not even changed. The outside appearance is nice, but things were not up to Hilton standards that I have experienced before. We were tucked in the back corner room, with a prison cell window. We didn't even ask about breakfast seeing as we didn't even get access to a fridge or microwave.I probably wouldn't be writing this review if I had access to a refrigerator... And maybe free water?I had a really quite wonderful stay at this hotel in June 2015. The front desk staff seemed very busy but my room was nice, large, and had a great view from the 19th floor. I was very busy on my trip so I didn't get the chance to spend that much time in the hotel, but I really appreciated the fruit infused water in the lobby every morning when I walked through.The humidity of Indianapolis meant that the room felt moist on occasion, but the bed was super comfy and the shower was good with adequate pressure. There was lots of counter space which was great as I was sharing a room with two others. I never made it to the pool but it looked nice and was just down the hall. I never had to wait long for the elevator which is always a concern when one is on the 19th floor so that was really great! Checkout went smoothly and staff were able to divide our room payment between us appropriately given how long we each stayed so that was great! I liked how close this hotel was to everything else downtown.Well it's a nice room, very long. No fridge no microwave but there is two tvs, I don't know why either. A little tip don't close the doors to the office to cancel the outside noise the a/c vent is only in the office and you will be on fire by the middle of the night. The bar in the lobby is really good the bartender Eric is great he made the experience. And the food is very well made.The hotel initially looked nice. When we got to our room, throughout our stay, found slow draining shower so you stand in your water, hair on the walls, closet handle missing, hole in our sheets, mascara colored stain on towel, and a terrible evening of next door partying noise until 3am which ""security"" didn't resolve. The decor was attractive but it doesn't outweigh the lack of maintenance shown throughout.Very nicely appointed room.   Surprisingly quiet for a busy street.   Staff has been very helpful.   Walking distance to great restaurants including St. Elmo's.  Here with a group and enjoy this more than previous hotel!!  Valet and luggage service was seem less and efficient.Pretty good hotel, great service.  Deducting one star because on closer viewing, it is getting a little older. For example, the tub in the bathroom was stained. some nasty grout in the tiles on the tub. A couple of the floor tiles were cracked.  Elevators to the parking garage have seen better days.   And a couple of minor design annoyances.  Such as the bath towels are 6 feet away from the shower (yes, I should remember to grab one before the shower).  And you can't plug in the coffee maker where it is (power light on the coffee maker was not working also).  But all minor points.Lobby is great.  Prof service.  Good flavored water. Free wifi.  Good breakfast options. Good bedding.Great place to stay in downtown Indy. Tons of things in walking distance. Hotel staff are friendly and trustworthy. Tight pool on the top floor. Suites are spacious and plush. Nice work Hilton!The service sucks the hotel is nice the parking sucks the total costumer service is bad .. We ask about surround places the lady is to old .. We have to walk for parking  and no  help w valet... No one  help with the lou lougage. I change me review to 4 stars just because the hotel cares about what I said to my experience ! Is all about getting better and making people happy ! Even if it is just listening ! Thank you I will think about  stay there again just cause there is no parking available and there is no vallet for lougageWe are hhonors members for a reason. It's rare to have anything other than a positive experience at a Hilton. Indy Downtown was a bit of an exception. The suite was spacious but a little run down with some scuffs and paint chips on the walls. The dresser in our room had something sticky on it and the room AC/heater unit's front panel was a bad fit.Staff was with one exception Hilton-quality; the one problem we had was with a concierge at the front desk who was a little snippy with us regarding theater tickets. It was busy, but our question was simple and we got our own fix later.Would we stay again? Yes, it's a fine place in a good location and there wasn't anything wrong, just a few unpleasant surprises that are probably not the norm.Not giving 2 stars because the towels are soft, they provide lots of fluffy pillows and the bed is comfy.. What truly disappointed me about this hotel is the lack of care regarding a request I made.. I always put out the 'do not disturb' sign when staying multiple nights (in this case 3) as I don't need the cleaning crew going through my room.. Hate having strangers clean up and rearrange my stuff without me being present. No sign in my room; requested it before heading to the work conference in the hotel. Reassured by the front desk person, Rose, it was on its way. I requested nicely to not have my room cleaned and thanked her for getting the sign to my room. Well, the sign didn't come and when I got back to my room they had come in and cleaned my room. Furious I called the front desk, expressed my anger and frustration for Rose not taking my request seriously.. Felt my privacy was invaded. Finally a sign was provided.Had a brief rude interaction with a women at the front desk (tues, may26th @ 7:30am so the hotel can possibly know who it was) when I had asked her to please not have my room cleaned (same morning as my call to the front desk; they never provided a sign so followed up with her before my conference started). She made no eye contact and scuffed at me.. Thanks hotel staff person for making me feel like my request wasn't worth your attention. Sorry I'm not important. Finally, it's 11:30pm, Thurs May 28th and a very loud drilling has gone on for the last two hours!I called the front desk and was told to 'deal with it' &amp; 'we have no control over it'. Again, with an attitude. Wasn't going to add that to this review but 2hrs of this drilling noise is ridiculous! You have multiple conferences going on in your hotel, my company alone has 75 people staying at this hotel and you want me to 'deal with it' and had trouble bringing me a 'do not disturb sign' nor ensure my room wasn't cleaned.. I'm also a Hilton Rewards Member.. You are really not making me a happy customer. Shame on the hotel for this behavior.So I booked this room via ""Hotwire"", so my experience may be different if you were to book them directly or if you are a member of the Hilton Club perks. I couldn't complain about the price that we paid for a 4-star hotel. When my girlfriend and I arrived to the hotel, the atmosphere, the service, and appearance was 4-star for sure. Check in was very easy and multiple elevators which was a nice thing. When we get to the room, we felt that it was a ""Hotwire"" or bargain-type room because it was tucked away in the corner, and it was hard to explain, but you could tell that the hotel and the company decided if they don't get a lot of room sold, then that room we stayed was designated as the ""bargain"" room.Well I don't want to make it sound bad, but there were just a few things that made it seem this hotel more of 3-star hotel (more so like a 2.5 star) than a 4-star. Well I haven't stayed at much of Hilton, but I was kind of bummed that they didn't have a refrigerator inside the room. Maybe it is the type of Hilton Hotel, but come one, I can get a refrigerator at a Holiday Inn or Best Western and still paid either the same price or less. There were some certain things that made the room unattractive. The biggest thing we saw was a giant stain on the wall. Didn't know if it was old coffee and maybe that was the trash can was originally located, but it was kind of gross. They had water bottles in the room, but it was like $4 per bottle! I stayed at 4-star hotel in Chicago and they had a giant bottle of water for FREE! But you know I couldn't complain since I used the room only to sleep, but it would've been nice to have at least a refrigerator in the room.My biggest complaint about this place was the noise level. That night, there were some very ""loud"" people staying that night. I don't know how soundproof the wall is when doors are closed, but these people were very loud and very rude that they were not being considerate of their noise level. They were standing in the hallway to the rooms and even had their doors open, and they were laughing and talking very loud. I am usually a very calm and forgiving person with noise, but this was very rude. When these people decided to move their party inside the room and closed the door, it was relatively quiet, but you can still hear when they screamed and laughed out loud. We eventually had to call the front desk and maybe that did the trick because these people (who were 2 doors down from us, or almost nearly across from us), came out and started the party back in the hallway. So I am not trying to complain to the hotel, but just wanted to warn everyone that if you are a light sleeper, and if you do end up staying at this hotel, and encounter an episode like mine, please call the front desk to request for a room change. That is the only advice I could give. Yeah I know that people want to party and don't want to ruin the vibe of having a good time, but some days people forget about politeness when they are under the influence of alcohol.Overall, the hotel was OK. It's in downtown Indy and it is near by many stores to shop, and restaurants to dine at. Parking is either a self-garage parking or valet parking; both offering in and out privilege, which is a good thing. They have a restaurant (bar and grill they call it), which offers OK food and also, they are adjoined to a McCormick and Shmick? steakhouse.I would not recommend this place if you are booking directly through their website, unless you are one of those members who gets points for staying at the hotel. Once again,  i booked it via ""Hotwire"" and the money that I paid for the room was a bargain. I just wished it was a better experience. But hey, everyone has opinions and you can either take it or leave it.Thanks for reading my long review and I hope you found it to be funny, helpful, or just plain awful!CheersWe went here for the Redskins Indy game. Everyone was so pleasant, from the valet to the check in crew to the bellhop to the bar staff. It was a great experience. I ended up seeing Doug Williams retired hall of fame QB for the Redskins, also the whole team stayed there lol bonus for me haha! ;) great job as always HiltonI like it here. Stayed overnight a couple times, and also had a three day meeting here. Friendly staff and all that. I'm interested to try the McCormick &amp; Shmicks place that is on the first floor here.The bathroom tub in my room did not drain at all after my shower. I told the gentleman at the front desk about it this morning but it obviously wasn't fixed since it happened again tonight. I expected better quality service and attention to detail from a Hilton property.For $359 plus taxes I would think I would have a clean modern room, free water, stocked frig etc. what we got was a room that was decorated about 20 years ago, closet doors that don't open, dirty grout on bathroom floors. No robes, a sofa that is killing my bad back. Unfortunately this was the only room left in downtown Indy. We picked a bad weekend for a get away.I stayed here this weekend in a booked hotel  that was loaded with wedding guests and most likely some Colts fans (Saturday game) so I am writing this review based on this weekend.We were in 1902 on the top floor near the pool. 2 queen sized beds, no fridge in room.We tried to hit up the hot tub/pool but at almost 11 at night there were a ton of kids in there. Finally they shuffled off and we ran in for 10 min of hot tub time before getting kicked out. We get it they need to clean, at least we got a few min. What I liked-- clean spacious room with a cool view. Nice temperature setting. Lots of pillows and extra pillows and blanket in the closet.What I didn't like- there was an odd rocking/ clicking noise we kept hearing but couldn't figure out where it was coming from. We could hear EVERYTHING happening in the hallway. I think we even heard our neighbor drop the soap lol... The walls are thin!Seals on the door are non existent so they are not very soundproof. Um *cough* soo if you are having ""relations"" don't be too loud about it!At 2:30 am we kept hearing people in the hallway... Screaming. Yes. Screaming...banging doors, hollering and being jerks in general with no consideration of others!! We called the front desk and then it got quiet for a bit but I heard jerks again at 3:00-3:30. I didn't get much sleep. I've stayed here during gen-con with  a friend in the past but honestly the nerds are quieter!Great hotel! Convenient, clean, spacious room. Small convenient store and spa available for massages and other types of beauty services.Walking distant to several locations--restaurants, the mall, convenience store etc.Stayed here the last week of March in a deluxe suite with family.  The pros here are that the room was huge, we could have fit probably ten people in the suite without trouble.  The rooms however are old and dated.  The pullout couch where my kids slept was scary in that it looked worn and in horrible shape.  The carpets are old and stained.  Okay place to stay but its one of those places that I worried me about bed bugs.I have seen many better HIltons.  Stay away from this one.  I am marking wifi as free as I am a gold member but they do charge for it if you are not a gold member.","We snagged a same-day deal on this hotel using the BEST hotel deal app, Hotel Tonight (seriously download it right now, I get crazy deals from this app regularly). For $69 we ended up in the biggest hotel suite I've ever stayed in. The room wasn't what I'd call updated, but in true mid-western fashion it was immaculate. The king size bed was quite comfortable and I wasn't sad about the Peter Thomas Roth skincare products in the bathroom (I read somewhere that those hotel sample size branded products aren't the ""real thing"" but I prefer to believe they are).The one downside of this experience was our shower drain was very clogged, which is something that really grosses me out even at my own house. We were at the hotel for such a short period of time though, I didn't even bother calling the front desk. The valet and front-desk service were excellent.  On checkout when we called down for our car we did not have to wait at all for it to be brought around.Location-wise, you are literally steps away from the circle, as well as lots of bars and restaurants. Solid!Two words: stay away!As a property, the hotel was so-so. Like others, I've been at better Hiltons. I stayed for a conference in September. I slipped coming out of the shower on the last day and ended up on the floor under the sink. Long story short, I hurt my back and incurred some chiropractic/naprapathic bills from the fall. I suspect the hotel has had problems with this before because they put a sign and a grab bar in the bathroom, and because the staff seemed not surprised by this. Given how hard I fell, I'm probably lucky it isn't worse. They told me falls were common.I didn't hear back from the hotel about my ""incident report"" until I complained to Hilton's head office. They agreed to forward my bills to their insurance company. My dr sends them in.In late February, I get an email from my dr. She still hasn't been paid, and it's been 5 months.Pet friendly!  They don't charge you and arm and a leg to bring your furry friend, just a one time charge (I think was around $100 for your whole stay).The hotel itself is nice.  While its a bit older than some of the other hotels in Indy now, it is kept up well, and they seem to be working to keep it fresh and clean.  On our last visit there we smelled new carpet on our floor, and the lobby is always clean.  Valet service is fast and efficient!  WAY better than the JW Marriott, they get a huge thumbs down for slow service.  You can call down to get your car brought up from your room, which is hugely convenient (why can't you do that as well JW?)Finally the rooms are really clean, and with status we usually get upgraded to a huge suite that is bigger than our condo.  Status is definitely rewarded here, which is a great perk!  Overall, a nice place to stay, and a little cheaper than the Conrad down the street (and in my opinion a better value, the Conrad only has its amazing bathrooms to outdo this place.)I've stayed here with a group every year at GenCon for several years. The location is perfect. There are several options downstairs for food. McCormick's stopped doing their late night happy hour specials but the breakfast buffet is usually something we do once per year.The staff has always worked with our group. This year, our usual room was booked... on every floor. They converted the CC rooms on 2 floors for us. It was a cool setup but there are a few kinks to work out.The wifi has definitely gotten better than it was in 2012. Last year we could not even stream music over wifi. This year, 480p videos were fine even after the hordes arrived for GenCon.So many better options in downtown Indy.  This is my third downtown Indy hotel in less than a year, I DO NOT recommend staying here; - rooms are very outdated and not clean (my toilet seat was soaking wet when I arrived NASTY).  You can also hear everyone in the hall.  The doors are old and require a hard slam to close.- staff friendly but not helpful; there is a convention in town, I believe it's a cheer leading competition, and hundreds (not exaggerating) of screaming kids came back to their rooms at 11pm screaming and slamming doors.  Ok, not the hotel's fault, but when I called the front desk I was told, ""they're all arriving at te same time, they should quiete down shortly"".  At least lie to me and say you'll have someone up here right away to handle the situation. - nickle and dime you; rooms do not have fridges, must pay $10/day to get one.  Internet is $13/day.  People gave good reveiws for location; I can see 3 other hotels from the lobby.  Please take my advice and stay elsewhere!Great rooms. Clean and modern for the most part but there are a few signs of wear starting to creep out in some places (like the shower heads). Hilton HHonors Gold will get you free WiFi and other amenities.On the down side I was traveling with a group and in total we used 4 rooms. Two were ready at noon, one at around 3:30, and the last not until around 5:00 or later. It was great to have some of the rooms early but the last one dragged on later than anyone of us expected and also long after the front desk lead us to believe as well.We stayed here because our usual hotel for our Indy trips was booked (some convention or something) and were very pleasantly surprised. It was in the same Hilton points bracket as our other hotel, even though it is more expensive than our usual hotel. They upgraded us to a suite because we were staying on points and we were very impressed. The bed was comfortable, the towels and toiletries were top notch, and the customer service was fantastic. I love the location of this hotel as well. Within a block or two of everything we need to go to. We will stay here again for sure. The only con is the same with all Hilton hotels - no free wifi! And the furnishings are a little outdated, but nothing that takes away from the stay.The name and the lobby are not enough to make this a great hotel. We stayed in a state suite. The bathrooms were updated but that's it. While nice looking, the bathroms had issues. The shower diverter only transferred about 80% of the water to the shower head. The tub filled up quickly and was very slow to drain. They also failed to install vent fans in the bathrooms which was a hassle.The room itself was large, with a wall of windows overlooking the city. There is a large desk in the corner facing away from the windows and not private. There is a large round table with four chairs. The living area also had a couch and two armchairs facing the entertainment center. The furniture was old looking and uncomfortable. There is a nice little wetbar with a refrigerator and coffee maker.The sofa folds out into the single worst possible surface you could imagine sleeping on, outranked even by armchair and floor. Sleeping on a chicken wire hammock would be preferable. They also failed to include extra pillows for this option.The master bedroom has its own bathroom, a nice king bed and closes off from the rest of the room.If you have to entertain and do business, it might meet your needs.Even with the overly expensive price for what you get, they have plenty of upcharges. Internet access for example among others like $22/day for parking and half the breakfast options. The parking garage is open air and you have to walk outside from the hotel to get to it. There was an issue of a misquoted price for the service from the front desk, with the attendant being rude about it. They do offer valet for an upcharge.Basic breakfast is free with voucher, but if you want hot food, and some drinks, it costs extra. You also have to wait for their incredibly slow service to get drinks and wait to check out (even if you get the free voucher).For the price, I was quite disappointed.The location is perfect... I had no idea I would be able to just walk out the door downtown and be able to walk to not only the IUPUI law school building, a shopping mall.. restaurants, and bars all at such a short walk.. My room was a great size.. a large comfy bed.. I spoke spanish with the cleaning lady and got brand new pillows...They were so accommodating.. and I""m an annoying ask for a lot guest.. and they definitely had no problem answering all my questions.. There is no wifi.. which is weird.. and there is no safe / lockbox inside of the room to store your stuff while you're not in there..however you can get a safe deposit box from there free of charge... it's weird though because you have to keep your stuff locked up downstairs in a room behind the front desk.. it's like why travel and bring these things.. that you're going to store far away from your room and have to go through more than I would want to to get it.. that's a problem .The workout area is cool... they have many amenities...   I'd def stay here againI seem to have discovered a trend on my ~ quarterly visits to Indianapolis; really bad service delivered with the kind of pleasant smile that makes it hard to be frustrated...and the Hilton Indianapolis fits right in.  The hotel's downtown location was fabulously convenient for the meetings I had throughout the downtown area during my trip and I was upgraded to an absolutely massive corner suite that was bigger than most of the apartments in which I've lived.  With the amount of traveling that I do, having a constant  like the Hilton Breakfast is always reassuring; not the most wonderful breakfast buffet ever, but it's consistent and always good quality.  However......I tried for literally 15 minutes in a less-than-half-filled restaurant to get someone to bring me my bill.  It took so long that I almost ended up late for my first meeting that day.  The laundry that I sent in before 08:00 was nowhere in my room to be found when I returned from my last meeting at 9:00PM.  A call to the front desk was answered with an assurance my laundry would be sent up ""immediately"".  I waited 30 minutes and no laundry...a second call to the front desk went into voicemail, as did a third 15 minutes after that.  As I had an 06:00 flight the next morning, for which I had to be up by 04:00, all I wanted to do was get some sleep, but, as it was now 10:00PM and the laundry I needed to wear the next day was still nowhere to be found, I had no choice but to trudge down to the front desk to locate my laundry.  The very nice young woman at the front desk assured me it would be handled right away and that I should just hold tight at the front desk, which I did...for 15 minutes.  Finally, someone emerged from the bowels of the hotel with my laundry and a very pleasant smile and apology for the delay.  The lovely smile and pleasant demeanor didn't change that it was now 10:30 and the process to find the laundry that was supposed to have been delivered to my room four and a half hours before had now cost me an hour and a half of so badly needed sleep.I really don't know if the other downtown hotels offer any better service, but....you might be doing yourself a favor to find out...Multiple stays. Called ahead with a request and the staff took great care of us. Large rooms. Updated but not the tub/shower and they need an update. ATT hotspot wifi or pay $12.95. Don't misread Hotwire free internet to mean in room. Lobby only. Near all attractions. Close to mall which then connects to most downtown attractions indoors or short outdoor jaunts. Close does not mean connected but close. Staff nice. Price is right for our stay. Pet friendly for a fee. And they are pet friendly. You can eat at the hotel restaurant or many places downtown.  Love gyros? Try Ali Babas across the street - eat there (carry out suffers) and have the spicy gyro.WiiiiiiFiiiiiiiii!!!!!!  They finally joined the party.  Don't expect a quick connection or even an adequately amateur paced one but at least it exists.For a Hilton, I've seen better. The staff is friendly enough and the rooms are nice enough. The breakfast buffet is pretty nice, especially since it's free for the Hilton-loyal. The place just is not modern or even updated. Also, beware - the Internet is terrible. They have wi-fi but the signal is weak (and I tried two different computers, two different guest rooms on different floors, and sitting in the lobby). They also don't have access to hard line/Ethernet Internet cable. Their workaround for terrible wi-fi is just to offer a ""bridge"" which plugs into your Ethernet port but still just pulls in the wi-fi signal. For business travelers - it's painful. Overall, it's not bad, but there are better hotels in Indy at similar price points. If you're a Hilton member, I would actually suggest the HGI over the Hilton. At least they have accessible Internet.I stayed at the Hilton downtown Indy for New Years and a Colts game. Our rate was $119 a night, but we booked well in advance and noticed that the rate went up quite a bit in the couple months before we arrived. We had a king room with lots of space and a nice desk to sit at. I used the Wi-Fi downstairs in the lobby and it worked great for us(and was free). We had a problem at check in when our room wasn't ready, so the front desk offered us free breakfast at the 120 West Market, which has a wonderful buffet. We arrived after 11am when the breakfast buffet was over, so the server said we could pay $4 per person and have the brunch buffet. It was great and def worth us paying a couple bucks. If you can include the 120 W Market in your rate with Hilton, I would def recommend it. This Hilton is about 5 blocks from Lucas Oil stadium and 3 blocks from the Convention Center. Circle Center mall is a couple blocks away with very nice shops. There are great places to eat all over the place. Try St. Elmo's for shrimp cocktail and steaks, it is wonderful! Harry and Izzie's is a couple blocks away and is a great place for lunch or dinner and Peyton Manning is part owner. If you're looking for a bar within walking distance, try the Slippery Noodle. We spent a couple nights there and it's an awesome establishment! We also saw the Indy 500 museum, which is a short 10 minute ride away. We took at cab and it cost about $12 each way. Cabs sit right outside the Hilton, so they are easy to find. The Go Indy Green Line is directly across the street from the Hilton and is a great way to get to and from the airport since there is no shuttle. It costs $7 per person.Overall, Hilton was a nice place to stay at with nothing over the top, but is in a great location surrounded by the best places to eat, shop, and sightsee.Do you seriously have to pay to use the internet? Beautiful lobby and great location. Rooms showing their age and a little wear and tear but overall pretty nice.I went here with my dad for his company business party/awards banquet. I was his plus one and was able to share his room with him on the 10th floor. I'm not sure about the price per room, but what I can tell you from a strict entertainment perspective on the hotel, I was very pleased with service and overall quality. The banquet party was down on one of the lower floors underneath the lobby, which was very big, and held two bars and a kitchen. The bar service was great (an unfortunate two drink tickets per person, but this was the company, not the hotel) and made tasty drinks. The Long Islands were slightly disappointing because they used the mix instead of the actual mix of different alcohols, but that's okay in the long run. The food was good. They served salad, London broil, bread pudding with chocolate on top, a variety of vegetables, different breads, pulled pork, among other items. The meat was a little tough, but other than that, everything tasted great. The servers cleaned up the empty dishes in a timely fashion and did so without getting in the way of the ceremony. Very stealth. Because it was a company function, my parking garage ticket was stamped and did not have to pay for parking. I was very happy about this. The rooms were clean and large and had a great view of the surrounding buildings and the capital building. They have smoking rooms and non-smoking rooms. I experienced both and much rather prefer the non-smoking rooms. Rooms had flatscreen televisions, queen beds, a desk and chair, lamps, coffee makers and a wonderfully clean bathroom. My only complaint is that the drainage on the bathtub was clogged and the water got extremely high (close to overflowing) by the time the shower was done. Checking in and out was incredibly easy and everyone at the Hilton was very kind. If you're looking for a hotel in the downtown area, I would recommend staying at the Hilton.Note: Don't give the hotel the credit when you wake up with mustard stains on your sleeves and knees &amp; you're wearing your shirt as pants... that's just you being awesome. Rare is the opportunity to stay at a hotel in my hometown (hometown as in... where I be livin'), and a wedding reception at a hotel is the prime chance. This hotel is part of a giant corporate complex that's quasi-mall. The self-park underneath the building freaked me out. I really don't understand how they justify cutting it that close with the space between the ceiling &amp; the cars' roof... so I'd be sure to check the car top before you get back in it after the valet brings it to you. The front desk was totally up for a pitying upgrade to a king bedroom, late notice... so really... that's enough for a positive review. It's funny that a view of a government building (the State Capitol) is sought after... I suppose there really is a couple out there toasting their raspberry champagne and saying, ""Cheers to our lovely government. I love you, sweetheart."" Me on the other hand...I see this as a fine opportunity to moon the Capitol, elevated no less. Service is attentive. Bar is stocked and service is slow with endless seas of conference newbies to stand behind, but once at the bar... you might just meet a man named Mike from Louisville who drops knowledge like the Marlboro Man in The Big Lebowski.Rates? It seems like Hilton owns Indy, and there's no other option... last minute for a wedding reception in the same building, I'll take what they're giving me... but for no other reason. They seemed not to mind a wiley young duo scurrying through their hotel with mustard-y ham &amp; cheese croquets with bottles of beer clanging -- thanks!Note: Anyone else see that our State Capitol is listed as ""State Chiropractic Association"" on the Google/Yelp Map? Fascinating stuff.Summary: Although there are some bright-spots, ultimately this is a VERY mediocre and tired hotel. Unless you are a low-end/budget traveler, there are much better properties in the vicinity.Location: (4-Star) Ideally situated in downtown, there are better located hotels, but not many. The views afforded by higher level rooms are likely quite good. We were on the 5th floor so ours were just average. Decor/Room: (1-Star) We had a Deluxe King Suite. 1984 called, they want their decorations back. I did enjoy the rusty shower (complete with ringless shower curtain!) that took 10 minutes to drain. Our first room had a bloody Kleenex and pubes on the bathroom floor -- they quickly moved us to another pube/blood-kleenex-free room. One's imagination roams thinking about the various other body fluids that have been sprayed about the rooms. Nice. The coffee maker leaked water and was a pain in the butt, but the coffee they supplied was actually pretty good.Technology: (2-Star) Wired ethernet connections are not obviously available. There is a note that says to call the front desk if you want a wired connection. $10 daily for wireless internet access. Really? Who does that anymore? The flat screen televisions were quite undersized for our room. They may have been fine for a small box, but for a suite, they needed much larger screens. The programming was mostly in HD and pretty good. The HVAC was effective and the digital thermostats were placed appropriately in out suite.Food: (3-Star) Room service was functional, food was just ok, tray pickup took all day and by the evening the hall was littered with dirty dishes from various rooms. Their in-room dining menu is typical Hilton-fare. They have two restaurants on site -- an excellent steak-house and a mediocre diner.Hotel Staff: (3-Star) Front desk check-in, while not friendly was quick and pain-free. Valet parking was uniformly excellent!Spa: (4-Star) My wife received a massage, which she, an experienced spa-gal, deemed pretty good.Location is perfect.  So much within walking distance and we felt safe even in the early am when the streets were bare and we walked to the City Cafe for breakfast. The attached garage was $22 a night, which seems pricey but was comparable to the other overnight garages and had the convenience of being attached to the hotel.We got a King Room and the bed was ultra comfortable, I slept all night which is rare for me in hotels, and the room was clean, had everything we needed to.  The shower had fantastic water pressure (a necessity for those of us with long hair) and used Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products which was a nice and unexpected touch.Those working the front desk were kind, quick and attentive.  One was a little slow at helping us find a restaurant (her mapquest skilz weren't up to par) but she did her best and we got what we were looking for.If we were going to downtown Indy again I would definitely stay here.  It was $119 a night, plus (ugh) $20 in room tax but it was our anniversary so i'm glad we didn't go cheap.Although there are some nice pros including a great location which is walking distance to all of the major downtown attractions amd best restaurants, a beautiful lobby, friendly, efficient service at check in all in a nice big room with a spacious bath and a flat screen on a full swivel stand so that you can watch it from the desk or bed. Some major cons: NO wi-fi, only plug in ethernet cable access at the desk for $9.95/ day, no minibar or fridge, valet parking is expensive at $28/ day. Nice, but needs some technological updates!","I stayed here for the better part of a week for this year's Gen Con. Shared a King Room with a friend - bed was quite comfortable, and the room was surprisingly large when compared to other downtown hotels (Marriott, I'm looking at you). Room had a full sized desk and a sleeper-sofa, along with another chair and coffee table, plus a large dresser and flat screen TV.Bathroom is nice - lots of counter space, but the lack of a fan and the downright tiny trashcan were a bit weird. Also, the only extra we got was a coffee maker - no microwave or fridge, although we could have paid extra to have them in the room, at the rate of $10 each, per night.Other than that, the hotel is within decent range of the convention center - a ten or fifteen minute walk, depending on your pace and luck with stop lights. While I would have preferred a connected hotel (that is, connected to the convention center via hamster tubes), the Hilton was a decent alternative.The hotel was okay. It was a busy weekend during the Brickyard. The big downfall was that when booking with a third party like Priceline, you are at the bottom of the barrel in their eyes. I had called the hotel prior to my stay and requested a 2 bed room and said that I would get one if there was one available. When I went to check in, they said that all they had were king size bed rooms and wasn't ready as I was there earlier than standard check-in time. They said that they were completely booked. I went on their site and sure enough, there were 2 bed rooms priced at $329/night. I pointed it out to them and then they said, ""oh, we do have one room left."" Just because I did it through a third party, I shouldn't be treated any differently than any other guest. Was very disappointed.Great hotel with great service! I have stayed here 4 maybe 5 times and the hotel is old and the rooms are a little old but the service is great and the location is awesome if you are in town of a convention.The walls are paper thin and the staff is not friendly. While the room was very clean and nice, it would be way better if it was in isolation.The staff is unwilling to resolve problems and I got several eye rolls before I could get two extra keys and a cot in the room.A bit dated. I can only imagine the partying that goes on in these rooms during Indianapolis 500Awesome hotel with great service, very reasonably priced and phenomenal location.  Just down the street from the capital building and the monument on Meridian.  Plenty of good restaurants and nightlife within walking distance.  The area seemed safe, too.  Extremely easy access on and off I-65.  Room was spacious, beds were very comfortable.  Would definitely recommend!",,,"['spacious', 'room', 'perfect', 'work', 'trips', 'around', '800', 'square', 'feet', 'room', 'beds', 'additional', 'room', 'attached', 'desk', 'couch', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-indianapolis-fishers-indianapolis,Staybridge Suites Indianapolis-Fishers,4.0,$$,21,"My dad stays here all the time on business. So much so they even offered him a discount to stay there whenever he's in town. So of course, this is where we stayed on our stop in Indy. It's a pretty nice hotel. They have a nice courtyard in the middle and even have a few grills. My dad says they  (the staff) will grill up food for the guests during the week so he usually eats diner at the hotel. They have a huge Buffett style breakfast. Goes until 10:30am on the weekends. Perfect for sleeping in. There's a nice indoor pool, which we didn't end up having time to use, and a small outdoor basketball court. Our room was nice and even had a small kitchenette with a full size fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher! Great if you were staying a few days. Being as our room only had one bed and a pull out couch, my sister and I had to share the couch. Pretty awful pull out mattress, but I knew it wouldn't be much. Could feel the springs. Water pressure in the shower sucked. Overall very nice place.Cute little Hotel in Fishers, IN.  I flew in from Seattle for my one day of orientation at a large biotech company and this is where they placed me.  I came in late (almost 10 pm) at night.  The lady at the front desk (Pamela) was friendly and nice.  She also took care to charge my room to my company since I wasn't returning to check out and I didn't have my credit card yet. The room was really quite homey and clean.  It was set up like a studio with a cute kitchenette, 2 desk areas, ""living room"" area and a bed and bathroom.  Free wi-fi, too.A nice bonus was the free breakfast buffet.  There were a lot of  food options and self serve.  I would stay here again since it's close to my headquarters.Clean hotel. The main problem I have is that we brought our Amazon Fire Tv with us-we always bring it when we travel. This is the first hotel that we have stayed at where the hotel disabled the HDMI port on their tv so guests can't play Xbox, PlayStation, or use Apple TV and Amazon tv boxes. It's very greedy on the part of the hotel that they force you to use their pay per view if you want to rent or your kids are SOL if they want to play video games. We thought maybe something was wrong with the tv so we called the front desk and a worker came to the room that didn't even know what HDMI was. The worker did say that he heard from ""Charlie"" that none of the things on the back of the tv work anymore since the hotel put a box inside of the back of the tv. My husband called back to the front desk to ask about this and the woman said she would ask and send someone else up. No one ever came up. For this reason alone I won't be back here. We come to Indy for hockey tournaments all the time and we decide what hotels everyone stays at. We'll be looking elsewhere next time.Great hotel! Very spacious. Nice amenities. Great breakfast and they even provided some dinner meals during the week.  Would definitely come back again.Top to bottom, this was a very pleasant stay. The room was immaculate and the free breakfast rivaled many that lodgers pay top dollar for. I liked their towels too. The only strange thing was the fact that the free guest laundry is literally in the same room as the fitness equipment, but this was more than made up for by the deal they have with a close-by gym that was AMAZING. I would stay at this hotel again for sure and recommend it highly to others.This place has all.  Clean, roomy, immaculate refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, electric oven, pull out sofa and comfy bed!  Adult beverages served evenings and a nice breakfast.  I highly recommend this brand and location.Stayed here recently for work and definitely enjoyed it. The room was spacious and clean and the staff took care of every need I had. It's such a $$ saver to have a real fridge and be able to prepare meals in my room. Delicious breakfast here too.I'm a comic and was performing at Morty's Comedy Club June 4-6. I stayed at the Staybridge Suites and really enjoyed it. I used the hot tub to relax. It was great. The rooms are very spacious, nicely designed, and the beds are comfy. It's a great room and has a more spacious design than most hotels rooms. The lobby was nice to sit and read and write notes in preparation for my show. I like the shampoos and soaps. I enjoyed soaking in the tub too!  I recommend this hotel for anyone. I'm a big fan!!I stayed in a suite over the weekend with a group of performers and I was incredibly satisfied.  I stay in hundreds of hotels a year and this hotel was so nice and accommodating that I've been compelled to write my first Yelp review.  The suite we stayed in had two rooms and 3 beds and it felt like we had the privacy of a quiet 3 bedroom house.  I was able to catch up on lost rest and be refreshed with a wonderful shower.  I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting the Indianapolis area.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.Horrid service throughout due to employee prejudice and condescending attitudes. Waiting patiently in line or politely asking does not work with any employee. On several accounts I have waited for service at the front desk and others were taken care of first despite my earlier presence. After waiting patiently, the cordiality was not present and was instead replaced with a glare and a cold ""hello."" There was no, ""how are you?"" or ""thank you for waiting."" On another occasion, I went over to inform them that there were no kitchen staff present and the receptionist angrily said, ""no, someone's always there."" I politely informed her that I checked the kitchen and waited a few minutes but did not see anyone to refill the breakfast foods. She continued with her angry persistence so I said I would go back and check again. Luckily someone from the kitchen walked in as I walked in. Similarly, the staff are rude and disrespectful to each other. One staff slipped on a spilt drink that another employee thought was cleaned up. After the fallen employee stood up, she annoyingly said, ""next time put down the caution sign"" and stomped quickly away in her nonslip shoes. Honestly, whether or not people were present, it could have been said nicely. The same staff will jump in line to refill the food without even a small ""excuse me."" Along with the horrid customer service, the facilities are always dirty and something is always broken. I approached the front desk nearly weekly with items that were either not functioning properly in my room or throughout the hotel. The maintenance man does fix it up quickly but to have that many repair issues weekly is not safe for anyone. Lastly, the food is disgusting and the gym is small as well as the laundry facility for such a large hotel. I highly recommend staying away from this hotel because it really is worse than a motel.Convenient, nice rooms, free parking, and super hospitable. Would stay here again, and definitely recommend it to a friend!Super comfortable and huge rooms!  Convenient parking, very clean, nice kitchen with awesome coffee!  Great night's sleep!  Would definitely stay here again!I really enjoyed staying here! The room was nice and the staff were very hospitable and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.Would NOT recommend. They screwed up our reservation and I ended up sleeping on a pull out sofa bed.Nice hotel for the price large rooms free food and beer!! Staff is very helpful and $75 bucks a night a real bargain..Stayed a week here as temporary accomodation. So the company paid for it... but if it was out of pocket it would totally be worth it!They have breakfast everyday - make your own waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, toast, juice, coffee the usual. Pretty good and filling. Tues, Wed and Thurs they have Dinner with Beer and Wine - when we stayed there it was hummus and fresh veggies one night with bread cheese meat make your own sandwiches. Wine is good beer is OK (miller light egh)So basically for three days of the week you get breakfast and dinner! Pretty good deal to me.The A/C unit is VERY loud... but housekeeping is good the units are clean and comfortable.This is one of my favorite hotels to stay at and we stay in hotels far more often than in our own home. I work late into the morning. Went to bed at 5:30am and the housekeeper knocked on our door early even though we had a do not disturb sign posted on the door. I sincerely hope that this is just a case of a poorly trained housekeeper and not a directive from management. Housekeeper did not speak English when I tried to question why she knocked. Otherwise.....I love this place. Free food and beer for dinner. The most amazing breakfast buffet of any of the chain hotels in America. They had fresh fruit aplenty, cans of V8 juice, lots of yogurt types including Activia, Breakfast bars, Eggs, Meat, Waffles, and tons of other stuff much of which is never seen at a hotel free buffet. They also have a large pantry with lots of fairly priced, make that low-priced items. Room was a huge suite with bedroom separate from living area. Two big flat screen TV's with lots of channels. Full kitchen. Nice very large desk and nice chair. Fold-out bed. Plenty of well-lit free parking. Lots of food choices nearby. Too bad that housekeeper cost the hotel a 5 star rating. We'll come back though. Hopefully this review is noted by management and the housekeeping staff is retrained so I can sleep next time.A great hotel that's far enough away from Interstate 69 to be quiet. Close the blackout drapes and sleep in!Suites are okay.  Good to have though with kids.  The benefit is that during the week they had a full breakfast that changed slightly each day.  They also have evening reception which is basically a full meal with beer and wine Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.   The food is marginal, but nice to have to save on some costs.  Friendly staff.  Rooms were fairly clean but dated.  Some wear and tear here.  A/C is loud and turns on/off all the time.  Lock had some issues.  Smoky smell in hallways, Etc...  Small little things but the show the general small amount of wear and tear.We stayed at the  staybridge on our way to kansas and on our way back home because indianapolis was just about in the middle.  Both times were only for 1 night but we enjoyed the place.  Every morning they have complimentary breakfast with fruit, cereal, waffles and other stuff.  Tues - thursday, they have free beer and wine and some snacks and food which was a nice touch.The rooms were ok, not super luxe but comfortable. Free wifi acces is available and if you want to watch a movie, you can rent a dvd from the lobby and watch it on the en suite dvd player.   Both rooms that we were in had a kitchenette with full sized fridge.  There was an exercise room that we contemplated using but then reality set in so that was that.  The hotel is right off of 96th street which has a nice smattering of stores and restaurants nearby and its right off of the interstate so it was easy to find.   Its a nice step up from a budget chain.","I travel to Indy for work alot and call this place my second home.  Apt. style rooms, with full size fridge, dish washer, and free laundry.  Breakfast is included and tasty.  Dinner is also included but varies night to night so I usually walk next door to Cheeseburger in Paradise.  Free wine and beer is also available in the evening!The fitness center isn't much, but the pool is lap friendly.  The staff is always great and the beds are comfy.  There are also a lot of travellers that stay here long term with their dogs!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-indianapolis-downtown-indianapolis-2,La Quinta Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,2.5,$$,22,"Located about a mile off I-65 and a few miles from the heart of downtown Indy, this La Quinta is clean and has small rooms. What made my stay a pleasant one was the super friendly front desk staff.I love how accommodating the front desk guys are. When I first checked in, I was greeted with ""Hello and Merry Christmas!"" He was genuinely interested in my stay and how my travel was going. Check-in was easy and quick, and the staff was very polite when I had called earlier that day. A different front desk I greeted me in the morning the next day. He complimented me on how cute my dog was, and gave me a bag of fancy dog biscuits from the local dog bakery! I was checking out kind of late, and they were closing up breakfast, but he went and got me an oatmeal pack and a spoon for the road. FIVE STAR SERVICE! I slept comfortably knowing the room was clean- sheets were a bit worn but we're starch white, and the towels were also super white smelling of detergent and bleach! I am a German neat freak, and after doing my walk-in ritual going thru the whole room, the only thing I found was an eyelash in the bathtub! I don't have many negative things to say about this place other than the room would not be big enough to stay multiple nights, and like other reviewers mentioned, the elevator is the size of a small closet lol.Reasonably priced and comfortable, I would def recommend this La Quinta for a solid mid-grade hotel.Stopped in this place on the trip from coast to coast. Location is 5/5 perfect about one block from Indy downtown.  Service is 5/5.  Receptionist, Michael, was a very hospitable guy. Facility: very reasonable.  Breakfast: 4/5.Breakfast lounge: 5/5. Nice, tidy, quiet and comfortable to have a chat.  Price: total with tax: $127 per night for single room double bedsPros:1. Great rate2. Convenient location3. Clean room, towels, sheets4. Comfortable bed5. In room microwave oven and refrigerator6. Parking was adequate but a little bit goofyCons:1. Came across a bunch of shady characters, but it is located in the Downtown area.2. Besides the room, the rest of the hotel was pretty old.Overall: It was adequate for my trip to run the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon. I booked late and this was a pretty great find, but if I had decided earlier, I would've booked somewhere a little bit better and nearer the center of Downtown.Old outdated elevator. Close to Bankers Life Fieldhouse but not the greatest stay. Cold showers.The room was clean (although trash cans did not have trash bags in them) and the location was conveniently located downtown. That's about all I can say good about this place. The hotel front desk staff was uninformed about close by businesses. We asked if he knew where the closest gas station was. His response: ""yes."" Pause.... Me: ""well, are you going to tell me?"" Him:"" you go out of the hotel right here (hey, I'm on the phone, not standing in front of you. What does ""right here"" mean?""). I asked him for an address or intersection or name of gas station and he couldn't tell me. Not only that, the front desk accosted my bf in the morning as he went to the lobby bathroom, on his way to the breakfast area by banging on the door as he was inside the bathroom. She wanted to know if he was a guest. Could she not have waited until he came out? That was rude and uncalled for!! Never going back!!!Not the worst, but not very good.  They didn't give me the right room, so I almost had to share a bed.Yes, it's fairly close to downtown.Yes, it's rather cheap.Yes, it's a familiar brand.Yes, they have breakfast.Yes, they have pretty good parking.Yes, you won't die in your sleep or have to ward off legions of bedbugs.  But . . .It's not entirely clean, the hallways look like something out of The Shining, the service wasn't very friendly, and you'll wish you'd spent an extra 50 bucks for places four or five times nicer.The staff was helpful we asked to change the room three times due to the rooms' hygienic issues and also oldness. The hotel was very old and you can understand that by the time you step into an elevator that doesn't even show which floor you're at. However the staff was very helpful. That must have been the only good thing about this hotel. The bathrooms were very old and some of them had rust. You should stay in this hotel if you really need a cheap hotel and if you won't be in town for a long time.The hotel is within walking distance to Indy however boarders a shady part of town. The hotel is very old, the front dest was extremely nice. Don't waste your time on the breakfast. Powder eggs with either cold cheese or plastic cheese, nothing to drink except coffee or hot tea. No milk, juice dispenser ""out of order"" no water. I would pay the extra money to closer to downtown.This hotel has wonderful service! I left a necklace on the floor, left town and realized what I had done and the front desk worker (Terrance) went in my room after the maid cleaned and found my necklace for me! The hotel has wonderfully pleasant workers every time I've stayed here and you really are getting good quality for the amount paid. Everything's clean, breakfast is nice and the location is very close to downtown! Perfect choice!My dad and I had a great experience here.  We stated for the night, at a decent rate (especially during the Pacers playoff games - which is why we came to Indiana) A lot of reviews are negative about this hotel, so I will first touch on the positives-Clean room-Comfortable bed-Friendly staff-They let us check in early-The manager (Don) was so helpful to the two of us - he helped us print out our BBall game tickets, gave us directions and recommended places for us to eat-So close to Bankers Life FieldhouseCons:-typical cheap hotel breakfast - nothing good-Hallways and elevator need an updateWe were traveling through with two dogs and La Quinta was the place to stay. There were no pet fees, prices reasonable and I was really surprised at how nice the rooms were. Very modern and clean rooms. I did notice some stains on the carpet but it didn't bother me.The beds were very comfortable. Location was fantastic and convenient to downtown. We walked 10 minutes to the restaurants, etc. Overall, I was incredibly pleased.Super friendly &amp; accommodating  concierge staff. I stayed here 4 nights with my doggie and everyone was very nice. Free breakfast and they had a variety of healthy choices :) Very good nightly rate too!Don't stay here. Reasonably priced but you get what you pay for. It's a very old hotel that has been rehabbed. Staff and General Manager are less than friendly.  We had our rate raised a few days before our stay even though we booked on online weeks prior. Hotel had low-lifes and drunks that partied all night and urinated in the halls. The General Manager did nothing to address our complaints. Never will stay again. Only positives of stay were free parking and breakfast but not worth it anyway.BEWARE!!! What a ""Thanksgiving"" rip off!!! Once we received our credit card statement there was a $250 charge for ""cleaning vomit"". According to the manager, it was ""all over"" but they have no pictures, nothing to prove it. It's the first time in my life we had an experience like this (and we have traveled a lot!). We stayed a week there... do you think that is reasonable to think that the morning we left we ""vomited all over""?. The staff is as mean as the crumbling structure of this hotel. Rooms are in the small side. The building has been updated to keep the business running but the structure of the hotel is old. Some of the updates are falling and showing these problems. Our room had a funny smell. The toilet leaked and did not stop running. The breakfast area was quite small for the crowd. I definitively don't recommend this hotel to anybody.For just an overnight stay in downtown Indy on a budget this place is fine...if you don't plan on spending any time in your room.Pros1.  Decent location. 1 mile to Circle Center so it's walkable.2.  Nice staff.3.  Free parking.Cons1.  Floors in lobby area were always muddy and wet...recipe for disaster.  I understand there was snow but come on people!2.  The elevators are freaky scary, especially when you get back late at night, half-blasted and your spouse finds the light switch!  Only enough room for two people inside...and a suitcase.3.  The walls are paper thin.  You can hear your neighbors misgivings as well as the drunkards in the hallway at night.4.  The bathrooms are unforgivingly small.  No room for 2.5.  The breakfast in the a.m. is less than impressive with hard as rock, cold biscuits and gravy that looks like its has been cooking in crockpot all night long...and tastes like it has.6.  The couches in the seating area look like someone spoogied all over them.  Get new ones for goodness sake.7.  The outside of the hotel makes the area look a tad shady.  Seriously dated.8.  The room was either too hot with heater on or too cold with it off.  No in between.9.  The sheets were see through from over-use...replace them already!!Having said all that...if you're looking for a bed for 8 hours and close to downtown this is your place!If you find yourself SOL in regards to a hotel room in downtown Indy, La Quinta is certainly not the worst thing to happen to you. The Good:-Super friendly staff-Free breakfast including some fresh fruit, juice, cereal, etc-Modern lobby with decent sized flatscreen due to the remodel-Clean rooms-Nice sized LG flatscreen in said room-Beds were comfy enoughThe Not So Good:-In room bathrooms are sad: Tiny showers with an awkward, half moon curtain and a toilet from 1983, I believe-Beyond shampoo and soap, that's it for toiletries -The location is fairly close to downtown (very walkable) but it sits right on Washington St - a very busy and sometimes loud road-Elevators are incredibly slow. Just take the stairs.If you find yourself thirsty or hungry, vending machines are available on each floor, and that's where you can score your bottled water and other snacky goods. If you're in a bind or on a budget, La Quinta should work out just fine.Terrible... No water, then no hot water. Heater in room would only go on or off so either freezing or a sauna.But great sounds of helicopters all night, next to a helicopter pad....Would never stay with family, I was put up here on business trip.I travel a lot for work and stay at all kinds of hotels.  This had to be among the nastiest I've experienced.  The first room I was given smelled strongly of cat pee.  The doors separating the rooms did very little to block out the, um, sounds (which means I got to hear my neighbors get it on...goody gumdrops...).  The hotel is on a busy downtown street, so there was a lot of traffic noise, too.  The demolition project across the street did not help with the noise factor, either.  The desk person switched my room without any problems, so that's a plus.  The second room was much better.  Not awesome, but better.  Like a totally different hotel.  I'm thinking, why didn't you just give me this room in the first place?  I'll be back to Indy, but I won't be back to La Quinta Downtown.  Yuck.Oh, and the ""free wi-fi"" never worked.  Sigh...I was heading into downtown Indianapolis for a conference at the Crowne Plaza and wanted to bring along my dog to save on boarding costs.  I was excited to see that a new La Quinta (renovated older hotel) had opened in downtown.  I called to make sure they were open and to ask for the dog policy.Here are the Pros and Cons of this new place (keep in mind they had only been open a few weeks or less at the time of my stay - some kinks were expected)Cons: Check-in took a while - the attendant was a little flustered when 3 separate guests all showed up at the same time; A little further away from the middle of the action; When the doors shut, they slam shut; Next to a helicopter tour place, not too loud but it could have beenPros: Price - Can't beat less than $80 per night in downtown Indy; Pet Friendly - any room and no charge!!!; Parking - free AND covered in the hotel so pretty easy to monitor; Breakfast - Waffles, coffee, cereal, pastries, fruit; Rooms - Very comfortable beds, desk, LCD tv with basic cable, microfridge, great shower pressure, and all the regular amenities; helpful staff; close to the action but far enough removed for a restful eveningI really do recommend this hotel!  I used to be very skeptical of La Quinta but the company has really improved their rooms and amenities.  This hotel is nicely updated and offers an affordable option for downtown Indianapolis.  Easy access to the sports arenas (you could walk and save on parking because it's less than 2 miles away) and other downtown fun!  Plus, you really can't beat free stays for pets!  FREE!  Wow!  Keep it up La Quinta!My friend got 2 rooms through Hotwire at this location.  Her room was perfectly fine while my room had the following problems:Cons:-Furniture:  Ottoman leg was completely broken.  I almost hit my head on the air condition when i sat on it.-Air con:  It was an old system BUT it worked.  Problem was it leaked all over the floor.  I did not feel the carpet wet until the last day when I finally decided to open the curtains.  And when I tried to turn it to heat because it got so cold one time the fire alarm went off within seconds.  -Trash:  I moved the nightstand a little so I could plug in my charger only to find food wrappers under the nightstand.  I didn't bother to look under anything else after that.-Lighting:  Only 2 lamps worked.  The lamp on the desk didn't even have a lightbulb so I could use my laptop.  When I took the lightbulb from the other lamp to use at the desk and tried to turn it on I realized the whole lamp wasn't working.  -Cleanliness:  So much soap scum on the shower curtains.  Regardless of how you get a hotel room you shouldn't have to deal with simple issues like that.  We were told it was remodeled last year for the Superbowl but it seemed like they never did any upkeep.  There were too many issues to call downstairs and complain so I just dealt with it since I was out most of the time.  Pros:-Bed was extremely comfortable-The staff I would run into were extremely nice-Convenient location-Microwave. I rarely see microwaves in hotel rooms.","We were greeted by being told that breakfast gets crazy because the hotel has a lot of guests so there might not be food for us.  We were told of a restaurant where we could purchase breakfast if none was left.  What a great way to introduce us to your hotel.  ""Welcome!, good luck getting any complimentary breakfast that we advertised.""  The one elevator fits 2 150 lb people...barely.  Don't try to fit yourself, another person, and luggage.  My room had a dripping shower head and I found a half empty bottle of lotion left on the sink counter from the previous guest.  I guess the hotel can't afford a new bottle for each guest.  My colleague told me that he wished he had brought shower sandals to take a shower because his room was so nasty.  The hotel's hot water is luke warm at best and my shower head was not secured tightly so when I turned on the shower, water sprayed all over the bathroom.  I actually had to stand there and try and fix the shower head myself which I finally did, to a degree.  I could spend a paragraph discussing the nastiness of my toilet, but won't go into detail.  The hotel is right next to a helipad so you have helicopters flying at all hours as well as police and fire sirens.  Don't walk around in barefeet.  Don't touch anything without washing your hands.  Bring a sleeping bag to sleep in.  This is only my first night here.  Two more to go...Stayed here a couple weeks ago for a convention in downtown.  Walking up it isn't the most appealing looking building, but it changes when you walk in.  All of the guest service people at the front desk were extremely nice and helpful.  When we first checked in to our room, we noticed it had a STRONG odor of cigarette smoke, which we did not care for, so the desk attendant quickly had us in another room a couple doors down within about five minutes, and it was clean and nice.  The continental breakfast was perfect for us.  The walk to the convention center was about three quarters of a mile away, which wasn't too bad.  It was just cold out so we had to bundle up.  But yeah this hotel is really nice!  The remodel is coming off nicely!  I recommend avoiding the elevator, as it is clearly very old and very slow.  The hotel is only three stories high.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-indianapolis-carmel-indianapolis,Staybridge Suites Indianapolis-Carmel,4.5,$$,21,"The suite was perfect - living room, kitchen, bedroom all were comfortable and well equipped. Plus the free breakfast buffet was amazing. I'll be back. I wish Staybridge  had locations everywhere I travel!I stayed at this hotel in Carmel, IN at the end of February.  I was up here for a few days for work.  The hotel is situated not too far from the I-465 and U.S. 31 interchange.I arrived around 7 pm Monday evening after getting the rental car from the airport.  Traffic wasn't too bad even at that time.  One of the first things I noticed is that they know how to clear the roads of ice and snow, unlike here at home.  The staff member at the front desk was great and got me a room on the first floor.  At that point, I was exhausted, so I went to the room.  The room was quite nice and spacious.  The suite even has a dishwasher.  There was plenty of room to be able to get clothes stored, etc.  There were two things that were missing though, and is the reason I gave only four stars instead of five.  The first is that the rooms have no in-room safes.  The other reason is because this is one of the few hotels I have been to that doesn't have separate recycling for items such as bottles, glass, etc.I happened to be here during the week, so Tuesday through Thursday night, they had a social hour with food and drinks, including alcohol, all at no charge.  All of the drinks were served by Donna, who is the sales director for the hotel.  She was great to get to know and have fun with over those few days.  The one who handled getting all the food out, etc. was always on point and kept things well stocked (I believe her name was Diane).  With the social hours there, I was also able to meet some others staying here from all over.  It was fun and helped break up the end of the day.If you are in this area for some reason, this is a great hotel to go to.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.It's okay place - middle of nowhere that you could walk to. Must drive to places. If pets don't bother you then this place is good for you. They allows cat and dogs there. The room is cute and cozy. The negative thing about this place is too many people and pets roaming around. Feel like I was at a pet fair. No privacy. Like I said, it's okay - wish no pets allowed but those days, people are starting to travel with their pets. Pool is ok but small. It was crowded.We were in town with several other families for a youth sports event over the course of a long weekend.  This hotel was perfect.  We loaded up on groceries at Costco, and cooked out every night, which saved us all money and time in trying to feed a big group at restaurants every night.  The backyard/patio area was great:  gas grills and grilling tools provided, a beautiful patio with plenty of seating, and a small grassy area for the kids to play.  The kids also hung out in the pool and in the theater room.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, and clearly understood our needs.  Initially, I was worried about the room being too small for our family of four (the only availability when we booked was a room with one queen bed and a pull-out couch), but literally, all we did in there was sleep and shower.  It was perfect, and we'd do it again in a heartbeat.I definitely enjoyed my stay here.  The rooms are spacious and have a kitchen with microwave, sink, full size refrigerator and even utensils and plates.  They also have complementy breakfast in the morning and free beer, wine and food from 5:30-7 or 7:30pm from Tuesday-Thursdays.  Awesome!  The staff was friendly and amenities were clean during my stay.  Easy 5 stars.This place has been great.  Family gathering here from 8 States and Singapore to celebrate an 80th birthday.  Clean, quiet, good breakfast and wonderful staff. Highly recommend.Great place. Very big room. Friendly staff. Great ligation right next to the highway. Would definitely stay again.I had such a fun time at this hotel. I was there for a week long training but they made me feel right at home. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean &amp; up to date. There is a huge pool/hot tub to enjoy, as well as a free breakfast everyday and a light dinner with free beer and wine 3 days a week! My room was serviced and cleaned everyday. I had fresh towels everyday as well. Awesome. Both Drew and Robbie are the sweetest staff members. They were both very helpful and I was able to have a nice conversation with each of them. I had a 10/10 experience and I hope to stay in your hotel again very soon!Stayed there for the first time. Very friendly and competent staff. I watched Drew go outside in a driving rainstorm to cover up the patio equipment; didn't see him complaint or even look sour. Mary hosted the social hour and was also super-friendly. I'll stay there again next time I visit.Our family and friends stayed 4 nights for a wedding. It could not have been a better place for us to gather. They have a beautiful patio and outdoor area for us to all gather and visit. There was even free food and booze for us to enjoy on Thursday night (tues-Thurs is free food and drink nights). My kids loved to watch movies in the theater room and also swimming in the pool. The saleswoman went above and beyond to be sure we were all content. I would recommend this place for everyone, but especially people with kids. Oh AND our room had a full kitchen and two bedrooms two bathrooms. It was worth the upgrade when you have little ones.Off of US-31 and behind a block, it was a little difficult to find at night.  However the hotel was great.  Comfortable bed, newer quality stuff.  Staff was super friendly.  Wifi was decent when I used it.  Definitely will stay here when I come back to the area.A Great Hotel with outstanding people and Clean and very comfortable rooms.  I can not say enought about the staff and how helpful they were.  I was in town due to my dads surgurey at St Vincent and the team here made my stay very enjoyable (considering the circumstances) and did all they could to help out.I love the rooms....as I was in town for a while and the suites with full kitchen made life easier.A great hotel for any needs.....and Thank you to Chris and his team!  I will be back!While visiting the Indianapolis Children's Museum, decided to stay at this hotel based on other reviews. The staff was wonderful and very friendly. Drew was helpful in finding a delicious pizza place that delivers. The hotel had free beer, wine, soda, and dinner T-Th. The food was good and the beer was awesome! The kids were thrilled with the pool and the movie room. Wonderful stay!The Indianapolis Staybridge suites is the new kid on the block on a stretch of US31 that has plenty of big name hotels (Hilton, Marriott, Wyndham, Sheraton, etc....). This beautiful hotel opened in the spring of 2010.I've stayed here twice now and I'm very pleased with the service and the quality of the rooms. Because it's so new, all the furniture is very nice and the beds are amazing! I always have difficulty sleeping when it's not in my own bed but I've always had a good night sleep at the Staybridge.The best part is that they have an amazing courtyard in the back with tables, chairs, fireplaces and BBQs. Every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday the Staybridge hosts the Sundowner reception in the courtyard. This means free food and drinks for guest and a great chance to socialize with fellow travellers. They even BBQ for guests every Wednesday night!This is fast becoming my favourite hotel in Indy.I don't really have much to add to the existing reviews, except to say that the quality of this hotel has not eroded over time.  We chose this hotel for an anniversary weekend, based on yelp reviews, and were not disappointed in the least.   My wife travels a fair amount, and is pretty fussy.  But she said she would go back to this one anytime!In a drive from Houston to Indy, we stayed in three hotels and this was the nicest by a mile.The hotel was spotless and the staff was really nice. Two different rooms were comfortable, spacious and sparkling clean.Two big bonuses, free on-site laundry and the free breakfast buffet make this place a great choice. They have four washers and four dryers for hotel guest use, just bring your own detergent (or buy one-shot packs in the hotel shop for $1).The breakfast buffet was quite delicious, with make-your-own waffles, biscuits &amp; gravy, eggs, sausage, yogurt, fruit, cereal, etc.And they let you bring pets for a small fee.Just a note to say that if you ever have a need to stay in Carmel, especially long term, at a first class hotel, you want this to be the one. The facility is impressive, with many amenities including an indoor pool and hot tub, breakfast included, and lovely decor.  But it's the staff that makes your stay here really special.  There is not another like it...from the top management on down to the service people, everyone is as friendly as can be.  You will feel like you are coming home to family every time you walk in the door.  The best fun is the mid-week social hours where you get to know other guests as well as the staff, with food and drink provided.  We were there due to a house disaster from the first of August till the middle of November...nothing could have been better.  it was truly our home away from home.  XOXO to all at Staybridge Suites!!!I second Scott!.  We have been staying here for two months now. From the staff to the hot breakfast, and happy hour Tues-Thu has made it not only a great hotel but and friendly homey environment.  The staff is knowledge, helpful and accomodating.  They have delivered my mail to the door very timely, copied and faxed paper work for me.This is one of my fav hotels hands downMy family has had the chance to stay at this location a few times already, and each visit has been wonderful. Spacious rooms, accommodating staff and great breakfasts.One of the biggest selling points for us is the theater room... big screen TV, surround sound and about 9 big cushy recliners.  You can't reserve the space, it is a first come first served basis, but we planned an early evening and had no problems. We rented an action flick, ordered a pizza and thoroughly enjoyed this perk!","Okay, it's not The Ritz.  But it *IS* my FAVORITE hotel for business travel!  It is clean, quiet, has excellent amenities, including:- QUIET environment where you can get work done!- Free wireless and wired internet ALL OVER the grounds- A large ""theater"" (giant TV) and impressive movie collection- Free hot breakfasts each morning- ""Sundowner"" wine and hor d'oeuvres several nights per week- THE friendliest staff I have EVER seen- Super comfortable beds- Full kitchenettes in each room- Flat screens &amp; DVD players in each room- A huge, indoor pool and hot tub- Super easy parking and access to everything in the Carmel area.The only possible downside (which isn't one to me) is that it isn't very close to a lot of touristy attractions.  I'm always in town for business, though, and this place is a dream.  The price point is amazingly low considering all that they do.  I highly recommend it for business travelers.",,,,"['suite', 'perfect', 'living', 'room', 'kitchen', 'bedroom', 'comfortable', 'well', 'equipped', 'plus', 'free', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'amazing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-indianapolis-downtown-indianapolis,Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Downtown,3.5,$$,41,"Location: Fantastic for DT Indy. Parking: Valet was quick, friendly and I love that you can text to have your car brought around. Service: Wonderful! When we checked in the girl told us about this cool ""sleep number"" style amenity on the beds. After inspection, our double beds didn't seem to have it. We asked the front desk and the guy confirmed it's only for the King sized bedrooms. He felt bad that we searched for it, so gave us free breakfast the next day. It was perfect and the buffet was very decent. Rooms: Just fine. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large. The only complaint is that the temp wouldn't go below 68 and we both like to sleep in the cold. I would definitely come back here for another stay. Solid visit!I was recently here for a 3 day training seminar for which my company rented one of their meeting rooms. I did not stay here overnight, so this review is only about their meeting/event accommodations. First off, the location is right downtown by the circle, so it is a great place to host an event if you want your guests to be in the heart of town. There is a lot to do, lots of places to eat, and it is very easy to walk to all of the conveniences someone staying in the city would want. That being said, the parking came with a price tag. I walked here each day, but if I recall correctly, self-parking was $22/day and valet was $27, and the parking wasn't even attached to the hotel, as the attached parking garage is actually owned by Chase.  I heard good things about the valet system being convenient, in that you just texted them about 20 minutes before you were going to be leaving and they would have your car ready.The room we rented for the seminar was on the second floor, and not an ideal setup. It was U shaped, so there was no way to setup so that everybody in the room could see both the presenter and everybody else in the room. It was set up with about a half dozen round tables with 5 seats around each of them. We were using a projector and screen, and there wasn't a good way to dim the lights over where the screen was. The only windows of the room were grayed out, so it seemed like it was constantly dark and gloomy outside. They had issues with the climate control, which they made sound like was a recurring issue. The first day the room was really hot even though the thermostat was all the way down. We had to prop the doors open to keep cool, but the noise from the conference that was using the foyer area outside of our room kept us from doing that for too long. The final 2 days weren't as bad, so they did something to help. They kept a supply of bottled water and canned soda stocked, and they had both regular and decaf coffee as well as hot water for Lipton packets of black tea in the morning. We had lunches through them each day. The first lunch was great, with variety of sandwich offerings along with a couple different soup choices and some other sides. The second day was some of the worst pizza and breadsticks I have ever had. That is just not something meant to sit in a warming tray for any period of time. The third day we had less people and they just had a meat/cheese platter with bread to assemble sandwiches and an assortment of sides, which got the job done. The staff were all great the whole time. They were very polite and friendly, and made sure we had what we needed. The person who brought our lunch in to set it up in the serving area, and then came clean up afterwards, was always very courteous and did their best to get that job done without distracting us from the presenter. Overall, it worked pretty well and got the job done for what we needed. I don't know that anything stood out above what I would have expected from anywhere else, but while there a few things that would make it better, there were also no major red flags to get me to recommend against the place. If I was in charge of planning something like this, I would probably look around and see what other options existed, but I wouldn't avoid coming back if it turned out looking like the best option.Great location and the room is clean. That's about it. Stay at any other chain hotels and you would expect that. Room has neutrogena amenities so that's also nice.As a gold Hilton member I got free breakfast, but the eggs was super greasy and quality is very average in general. The elevators was super slow. I considered walking up to 12th floor. I am sure only 1 (max 2) out of elevators were working. That key got demagnetized 3 times during my stay. Even if I put it in a different compartment in my handbag, it still gets demagnetized. What a waste of time.  Drinks split everywhere on a Saturday night in the elevator and lobby.Location: great. Right off the Circle.Atmosphere: fantastic. The HGI is housed in a very old hotel building and they've retained a lot of the cool features from years past. Rooms: really nice. High ceilings, spacious and very clean. Being as old as this building is, you can hear others taking showers and whatnot, but it's not a huge deal.Staff: Friendly. We were greeted by everyone who worked there in a nice, welcoming way.Price: excellent. $129 a night.My only beef is that the elevators are small and SO SLOW. We ended up walking down the stairs when we left on a Sunday morning because the three elevators were all being monopolized. The one that did stop on our floor had three people, a couple suitcases and a cooler and was totally full.Also - and this has nothing to do with the HGI, just a warning to anyone reading this - DO NOT park in the nearby Chase Tower garage. When we left, the elevators were both not running and the unmanned exit booth was not taking credit cards (our only way to pay) and the ""call box"" was not functioning properly either. We and another couple ended up being stranded at the exit bay until I finally got enough of that nonsense and called 911. They patched me through to the security company and we were able to leave after the guard arrived a few minutes later. On one hand, free overnight downtown parking... yay! On the other... hugely inconvenient.My new favorite hotel downtown. First time staying at this location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is a great location right off of Monument Circle. Not quite as fancy as the Hilton Downtown. But feels more like home and the price is less. Go see Joey the bartender for food or a cold drink. He is awesome.My fiancee and I had a wonderful stay here. We were in town for a Colts game, and this was a great place to stay downtown...right on the Circle! Online check-in was a breeze, and our room key was waiting on us when we arrived. Our room (on the 15th) was clean and warm when we arrived. The bed was large and comfortable. Jeff in the hotel bar was a good dude and took care of us when we came in after dinner for drinks. Breakfast was included in our stay...the buffet options were ok, but the made to order pancakes, omelets, and french toast were awesome! Staff was top notch, polite, and professional-all the way from the valet guys to the check in staff, to room service. We will definitely stay here next time we have a night out in Indy!we stayed here a week ago and the valet broke our car key and put scotch tape on it. we didn't think much of the scotch tape at that time. my husband and I didn't notice until we made next stop and then went to turn the car on and the key popped open. we took photos at that time. with the holidays being around corner, it skipped my mind to call them. finally called and the valet manager asked me to send the photos so i did. i received an email telling me that they couldn't do anything since i didn't report it when i left. I'm really disappointed in this because we always stay at this hotel when we go to Indy. We go there at least once a year, if not twice since my husband's family is there. I will never stay at this hotel again.They are thieves.  Don't stay here unless you want their employees placing fraudulent charges on your credit card and then a long delay in waiting for a refund from their corporate office.  The water in the shower was also cold.  Who wants to take a cold shower on an icy February morning?  I printed off documents in their business center and they were covered in blue streaks.  When I asked for help with this the employee was rude and unhelpful.  Also, I have never stayed at a hotel with elevators this slow.  I must've been waiting around 10 minutes for one around check in and check out.  Between this and the fraud, this hotel is really on the decline.  They charge Hilton prices for sub-Motel 6 quality service.Moist...let me just say that this was the first and ever-present thought that entered my mind upon entering our room.  For the price of the room, I can say that we expected so much more.  Though the uncleanly smell/feel was just the beginning...We requested a cot for the room months ahead of time, yet upon getting to the hotel, there were none available.  Every day of our four day visit we requested a cot, and every day we were told they were given to other rooms.  Their explanation was simply that they gave out cots on a 'random' basis.  Let that sink in, rather than giving it to the guests who ask ahead of time, and check in over the course of the day, they still give them out randomly.  I will give the caveat that there was a nearby convention being held, so they had plenty of guests.  But the state of the room, and the absurdity of their randomized system puts them at the bottom of the hotel experiences I have ever had.I really enjoyed this hotel. As many others have mentioned, the location is great - right in the heart of downtown and practically on the ""circle"". There are tons of restaurants nearby, a shopping mall and the convention center is just a 5 minute walk.The building looks like it dates from the 20's, so expect high ceilings and lots of nice architectural details. Rooms are good, not great. Mine was decent sized with a Sleep Number bed, comfy chair and a microwave/frig combo unit. The air con seems to blow non-stop so be prepared for that noise - earplugs are probably not the worst idea as there can be some street noise as well.Small details make this an above average property - staffers are young, enthusiastic and very friendly. There is a small convenience market for essentials and a complimentary water/coffee bar in the lobby. My rate included breakfast and free wifi - I had a decent signal which was much appreciated. Also, bathrooms are fairly large, well lit and have ample space for toiletries.It's not a luxury hotel, but the staff and location make it worth a stop.I have such an issue with ""regular"" hotels.  You literally do not get anything for your money.  But this hotel is a solid three star, the front desk staff is polite, they serve healthy snacks and coffee in the lobby, the room was clean, the bathroom was spacious and overall it was fine for the night downtown.  It was NOT worth $250 bucks but the Big Ten football game was in town and why not charge the OSU and MSU fans an arm and a leg to enjoy their Indy experience, so the prices were very high for the evening all over town.  One thing I wasn't impressed with.  We valeted and our valet didn't warm up our car even though we called ahead - bummer since it was approximately 28 degrees when we checked out of the hotel.  It's a downtown hotel - nothing blowing my mind so just A-OK. I'm hard to please in the world of hotels but I doubt I have any need to stay here again.They are CURRENTLY renovating the elevators which are slow and cumbersome.  It shakes and rattles when you ride on it.  Just a warning, until they are done.The staff here is awesome! The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The location is great too!We didn't stay here, but I just had to stay what an AMAZING STAFF!!  They were amazingly helpful.  My S.O. came in from Illinois the afternoon of June 1.  He spontaneously purchased Pacers tickets from StubHub for Game 6.  Far from home, we walked the Circle to find FedEx in order to print out the tickets.  Unfortunately they were closed.  We walked into the Hilton to see if we could somehow use their Business Center and pay to print a couple tickets.  The gentleman at the concierge desk was so nice and and incredibly helpful.  He led us right next door and allowed us to use the computer, with no demand for compensation and no questions asked.  This really just made our day!  We certainly look forward to our next stay with Hilton, even if it is here in downtown Indy.This hotel is located steps from Monument Circle in downtown Indy. It's a great location, walkable to many attractions in Indy, including the Circle City mall (if you can find a pedestrian entrance!), Monument Circle and it's monument and cool architecture of the surrounding buildings, and the hip Massachusetts Av with bars and restaurants.  There is valet or self parking right next door at $17 a day.There is also a free fitness center and indoor pool in the basement (which we did not use.)The hotel itself is in a handsome old bank building with a spacious lobby with seating and fireplace, a 24-hour free coffee/tea station and a 24-hour small store with sundries, soda and snacks.  There is a restaurant off the lobby, which we didn't visit.The hotel rooms definitely needs an update from it's mid-80s neo-classical style, but that doesn't take away from the good-sized rooms, and functional, if not elegant bathrooms.  The rooms have mini fridges, a small microwave, TV, coffee/tea maker and good closet and drawer space.  Bath products and towels are of a good quality, and abundant, and there is good water pressure.The bed was comfortable enough, though i could not get the advertised dial to make each side harder or softer to work.Staff was pleasant and helpful, and quickly dealt with two very small issues (some trays left in the hall all day (gross); and a malfunctioning key-bard) cheerfully and apologetically.I was impressed overall.I have never witnessed such an attentive staff who seem so interested in a positive guest experience. The rooms are quite lovely and have a throw back elegant feel. The bar and kitchen staff are excellent. Superb crispy salmon delivered by the chef himself. California Club was delivered via room service very promptly and one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. I would like to see a bit more work out equipment in the gym but minor in comparison to the service. Front desk called after room service to make sure everything was satisfactory and very enthused when it was. Keep up the good work!I tried to like this hotel.  I love the fruit water,  the historic building it is in, the location, the view from the rooms and the decor.  But overall this doesn't pull more than a 3.  I have come to expect tea, coffee and hot chocolate in all hilton honors hotels.  This one only had coffee and lipton tea (for any self respecting tea drinker that is very weak).  Although i don't eat cookies, the tray was always empty so i guess even if i did there wouldn't be any and overall i didn't get a feeling people where glad to see me as in other hotels with the exception if very helpful and courteous bellboys-they need lots of creditGreat room and great location!  The hot tub and pool were great!  It is right off of the circle and so convenient to downtown bars!  We stayed here for bachelorette night and it was perfect!Tip: Street parking will save you some money but watch out Mon-Sat mornings and be sure to get to the meter before the maid!I had such a pleasant stay at the Hilton Garden Inn while i was here on a short business trip. The hotel is perfectly situated right next to the Circle--so it's within walking distance to some awesome restaurants. The roads are wide and easy to navigate. If you don't want to park, leave your car with the valet. The staff is friendly and check-in was a breeze. I had a standard room and it was spacious and had all the amenities I could need--comfy bed, nice desk and chair to do work, long mirror on the closet, and properly equipped bathrooms. And the best of all Wi-Fi was complimentary! How many hotels do that nowadays? One nit-picky thing I found was that the shower went hot and cold and back to hot for no reason. Other than that, it was perfect. I'd stay here again for sure!I stayed here for a few days and the room was well appointed.  The front desk staff were very helpful and easy to deal with.  I would stay here again.Went tot he bar there to meet soem friends who were staying the night.   It was good - but the typical hotel bar.  You should walk around and explore the city for good food.   The bartenders will tell you the good spots to go.","The hotel was nice, king suite was a bit small for what we were paying, but the thing that was unsatisfactory was the security guard who was harassing us. He would stare at us every time we went outside to smoke cigarettes. Being in a non smoking room with four smokers, he shouldn't have treated us as suspiciously as he was, especially being that we were paying guests. When we complained to the front desk the next morning, they seemed concerned and apologized, but we didn't receive any follow up that it was actually addressed. Probably would not stay there again, the guard made us feel very unwelcome.Such a cool old building, historic and very cool with old details throughout.  The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms are outdated but not terrible, they are very clean.  There is nothing that stands out really about the rooms, very typical.  Parking is across the street in a parking garage at $25/day which is completely rediculous, I've stayed in bigger cities and haven't even paid that much.  The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is definitely the fact that it sits on monument circle.Nice hotel that doesn't feel like the normal Hilton Garden Inn's that you normally see...It is definitely more like a full service hotel.  The front desk staff is helpful, the rooms are spacious and clean, and there is free wifi throughout the hotel.  The issues I had with the hotel were...1 - No closet, hangers or iron in the room.  2 - The elevators are DEAD slow.  I waited for almost 10 minutes one evening for the elevator to take me downstairs.While I feel other hotels are nice for other reasons, this one was nice in an ""upscale"" way. It's probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.I am from Louisville, KY, and I booked this trip using a weekend getaway package on an Indy tourism website. The room was about $200 and I received a $100 Simon Mall gift card as part of the package. You can't beat that. FYI: I'd probably stay here again... even if I didn't get the gift card.I love the fact that this hotel was in a historic building. I'm nostalgic about those things. I was impressed with the pool and hot tub area in the basement, which must have been recently remodeled... it looked great! My partner and I enjoyed the pool very much.... we were the only ones in it the whole time... probably 1.5 hours... must have been a slow night. The decor of the whole place was beautiful.The location, Monument Cirlce in downtown Indy, was also great. It was a neat area with some brick streets and great architecture. We were within walking distance of a TJMaxx, Steak'n'Shake, and the Cirlcle Center Mall (a Simon Mall). The Indy zoo was about 6-8 blocks away... we were going to walk it, but it was a rainy day.The check in was decent. I can't really rate the hotel staff because I really didn't need much of their service. All in all... a great place.A good place to stay. In an old historic bank building. Room was clean and the staff attended to our needs. Pool area needed some attention as there were towels all over the place and the hot tub needed some water added, as the jets were sloshing water all over the floor. The breakfast buffet was just ok. This is in the heart of downtown Indy, so the places to eat were limitless.If the Conrad is booked up. And the Hilton Downtown is booked up. And the Omni is booked up. After you're done kicking your own shins for waiting until Friday afternoon. And cussed out whatever shenanigan conference is going on in Indy.Book the Hilton Garden Inn. It'll be fine.Very, very nice hotel in a great location, with a very friendly staff. Everyone we encountered at this hotel was extra nice: the front desk staff gave us recommendations for dinner and the server at breakfast highlighted the must-see animals at the zoo for us. While I was getting ready to go out, the hairdryer shorted. No big deal. Called down to the front desk and they brought up a new one in minutes, AND gave us breakfast coupons. Nice touch! Rooms were clean and comfortable -- the Sleep Number bed was really nice!Another great Hilton Family hotel. What else can I say!!Went to Indianapolis for a Birthday weekend celebration and stayed at the HGI downtown. Excellent location. Its right in the heart of the downtown is you dont need a car for anything if you are staying here. You can get on the walking tour of Indianapolis. (They have a web site, look it up).The downtown eateries are all accessible on foot. The stadium is near by as well. Depending the direction your room is facing, you get good views. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. The bath room is slightly smaller than average. But very clean. The lobby is pretty nice. Not fancy but nicely done. The hotel is in an historic building. They have valet parking or self park. The parking structure is right across the street. So go for the self park option. It is unlimited in &amp; out anyway. They have a restaurant in the hotel. We did not try it. They did give us 10% off coupon at check in with a nice cold bottle of water. The TV has basic cable and some movie channels. Overall, good place.Typing this as I sit by the toasty warm fire place burning on a cold, crisp night.  I'm enjoying my stay here and think this may be my new hangout when I'm downtown Indy.  It's centrally located in town and I can walk to many restaurants.  The hotel has a full service restaurant and a little convenience store.  Rooms are spacious and nice and workout facilities has  new equipment.  Best part of my stay is I was able to walk across the street and get a fabulous massage at Studio 2000 (recommended by the hotel).  Great stay!whoa.    it's an above average garden inn.- friendly staff- awesome location- awesome beds- good sized, but not huge rooms- amenities: small pool, hot tub, good fitness room, nice biz center, free wifi, free printing.i have two minor complaints- bathroom door is oddly placed right next to the bed.- ac doesn't turn off.  the fan just kept running until I got fed up and turned the whole thing off and then it was warmish when I woke up.overall, I'd stay here again and I'd recommend it.One of the first hotels I stayed at in the city, the Hilton does not fail to live up to the prestige one would expect.  Thankfully, I was not required to examine the bill, so I can't be 100% certain that it was worthwhile, but these upscale hotels in downtowns, mere blocks away from key foot-traffic locations can't be anywhere in the neighborhood of cheap.  That said, I felt the experience was worth it.This location is right next to the Circle, downtown.  This place is full of cute shops, restaurants, one strange biker hangout, and picturesque landmarks are just a staircase away.  In the other direction, a slightly more hefty, but still doable, walk away, are the clubs and liquor-themed restaurants.  But none of this seedy type of traffic would ever pass by the Hilton, it's simply out of their way.  A horse-drawn carriage ride to another location in downtown would be entirely possible.Inside the hotel it's clean, the staff is helpful and prompt.  Nothing special to report either way, which is kind of the experience you want, after all, you don't come to a city to hang out in the hotel, it should be pleasantly neutral.I would not recommend it. Location is great. bartender super friendly but staff needs help. My bed sheet had holes on it. The front desk came to my door and jsut dropped sheets off versus changing them. I went to the front desk for the gym card for the athletic club and they said it was 16 a day when my friend an hour earlier said it was free.Clean, centrally located, great amenities.  The 24-hour pantry (read: extremely tiny limited convenience store) is great and they don't grossly overcharge.  The business center is likewise great - free printing!The restaurant is mediocre, and expensive.  They kept raving about this bread pudding, but it was really very sub-par.  Although the rooms have a microwave and fridge, there didn't seem to be anywhere within walking distance to buy groceries. However, do NOT check out before taking a look at your room charges.  I was charged $22 for valet parking (took a cab there) and for a 25 minute incoming call - they purportedly don't charge for incoming calls.  All was corrected but had I been in any more of a hurry I would never have noticed.a Basic Breakfast Buffet but they will cook to order included, also included is your drink, mine was coffee, they have switched to Starbucks Organic, Bonnie &amp; staff were SO  Friendly, they have fresh soups on the Lunch Buffet, which we can't wait to trywe haven't stayed here yet, but eyeing the Holiday specials!breakfast buffet plus drink $9.95Watch out - BED BUGS!!!Last week, I was in Indianapolis for business and stayed in the Hilton downtown. If I had only known ... the next morning I had 3 red bites on my belly - I googled images and learned that these kind of bites are the typical BED BUG bites, also referred to as breakfast, lunch and dinner. they itch as badly as poison oak and are very painful, too.I've called up the hotel and told them about this instance. The only response was ""Thanks for letting us know."" No apology, no shocked ""oh my god, how terrible"", no attempt to keep me as a customer and make me feel better about this horrible Hilton experience. Nothing. Are they used to people calling them up and complaining about bites?Unbelievable ... outrageous!Nice hotel!  Although I only spent 10 hours in the hotel the staff was nice, the room was clean and the breakfast service/food was good.  It is in a great location to get to anything in town.  There are many restaurant choices within walking distance.We had a great experience here! The hotel is great, rooms are clean and allow pets. The rooftop pool area needs some work...I really like this hotel!Great room. Took three calls to get the item i requested in my reservation to my room, and the pool is really depressing .. its in the basement, but this is a buisness hotel with a nice rooms.. i enjoyed my stay .","I stay at this hotel a lot as my employer is located nearby (and I don't live in Indianapolis). The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful, large and clean. Very happy every time I stay here. I've had a lot of bad hotel experiences, and this is never one of them. Each room has a mini-fridge. There is a 24 hour pantry next to the front desk. The restaurant is okay. It's great to have it, but there are a lot of other nicer restaurants nearby, so I don't usually eat in the hotel.",,,"['location', 'fantastic', 'parking', 'valet', 'quick', 'friendly', 'love',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-indianapolis-airport-indianapolis,Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Airport,3.0,$$,44,"Stopped in just to visit the lounge and have a few glasses of wine. It's a very nice area with comfortable seating nice TVs service was friendly overall decent hotel lounge.I stay near airports quite frequently. This Crowne Plaza is exceptionally close to the airport. You hear planes taking off all night long. The hotel does provide ear plugs. But then, how do you hear your alarm in the morning? The executive lounge was underwhelming. There are about 10 different types of trail mix and green apples for a nightly snack. In the morning there were breakfast bars and apples for breakfast. How about some eggs, potatoes and bacon? We were going to try the breakfast in the common area of the hotel, but a couple told us to go elsewhere as they were walking out... so we did. My coworkers have banned me from picking our hotels after this poor choice.It's an okay hotel. But it's not as great as they advertise.The staff is hit or miss, friendly and rude. They could use more training on how to not be short with their guests about useless things.The lobby is nice. Makes it seem fancy.The rooms are warm. They never really cool off, but they aren't miserably hot either. I wonder how it is during the dead of summer?Rooms are overall pretty nice. Bathrooms are okay. My bathtub leaked everywhere, but I got a surplus of towels.Everyone complains about the planes flying over the hotel. I guess I can see their complaint, but honestly the planes didn't bother me. But then again I'm around airplanes all the time, so maybe I'm just used to it.I'd recommend this hotel if you need a place to stay, but not if you're looking for an amazing stay.I arrived at the airport at 3 a.m. and expected trouble getting the hotel shuttle without some kind of wait.  But I phoned when I landed and Justin was right there and I must say he made the ride fun for a tired passenger.  I applaud him.  The room was good and the staff was fine as well for this very short stay - left at 8:30 the next morning.  Did not try the breakfast.The rooms are always great here. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. As I travel with too many work electronics, they have plenty of plugs. I have been coming here almost annually for a work trip since 2005. The staff is always the same. I like to see the same friendly, helpful people year after year. Breakfast at the buffet is okay. And there is plenty of fresh fruit and bacon. The buffet dinners feeding 200 are middle of the road. Variety is good, quantity is great but quality is so-so. See you next year!This is a very nice place and I am so glad that this was the location for our stay while in Indianapolis this past weekend. The staff were friendly, the facilities were clean and we were never bothered by the cleaning staff when we asked for privacy. That last one is always important to me, I like my privacy. It is rather loud as the hotel is directly under the flight path of the airport, but that was not a big deal and they provide earplugs if you want them. I was disappointed in the food, but the service was remarkable.Noise Noise Noise. The hotel is close to the airport and has a free shuttle. The lobby is clean and the staff is friendly. The rooms are older and if you can block out the noise from the hall and the airplanes it is ok. At least they keep a glass in the bathroom (sooooo many hotels don't). The curtains do a good job of blocking out the light. AC works well but is a bit noisyThe lobby is nice. Depending on which way you come it it could be hard to see the check in. It all smells like pool down starts due to the pool being right there. We were on the 4th floor and it was easy to find our room even though the hotel is quite large. Once in your room we had to go to the bathroom from our long trip. Unfortunately there was pubic hair and pee on the outside of the toilet and a small blood colt stuck on the inside of the toilet. This make me wonder if they clean the rest of the room.They do have free shuttle service to the airport. And everyone I talked to was friendly.My room was clean and pretty quiet but it just never cooled off. I even changed rooms and that room was no better. Its an OK hotel, it seemed a little under staffed. The food was really good....Very clean, quite place and nice staff. I did make a reservation for 2 beds when I arrived I got a king with a sofa pull out. The mattress on the pull out was 3 inches think (no joke). Access to the pool is akward the only way we found that didn't take you through the whole hotel was straight through the front lobby (who wants to do that in your bathing suit?) It is a isolated location but very quick and easy route to downtown. You are extremely close to the airport hence airport in the name. With that said you do hear airplanes through the night. Price was reasonable but we did find it on pricelineHallways very hot. Room AC made the room cooler, but I had it dialed down to 63 and it was nowhere near 63. Closer to 73. Shower/bath floor felt sticky and not clean. The bath may towel was brown in color, the original color was white. The towels weren't much better. Room opened to the interior of the hotel, so if you are worried about aircraft noise (it IS an airport hotel after all) you may want to request one of these rooms. Breakfast buffet wasn't anything special, they did have real scrambled eggs, not the nasty powdered kind and they had fresh blueberries and raspberries which were nice.  Wait staff was adequate, after flagging one down for a coffee refill. Bed linens felt clean. Bed was relatively firm, pillows seemed fluffy at first, but compacted once you put your head on it, similar to a down pillow. Maid seemed nice, she wished me a safe flight as I passed. No other interaction with hotel employees.I'll keep this one short. The hotel was nice but a few issues added to a less-than-perfect stay. Overall, if you need a really nice place with friendly staff to stay near the airport, I would highly recommend this hotel.Complimentary shuttle from the airport, and the place is nice. You can sometimes here airplanes taking off, but the noise is relatively minor.Stayed here when my flight was cancelled. Lovely indoor pool, great rooms, close to the highways.Nice place but the shuttle service is the worst!!! They do not wait for anytime frame at the airport and literally do a drive by and then leave!!! You cannot be 30 seconds late or your going to wait for another half an hour!  You can even call the front desk and they still will not wait and at midnight that is crappy! They will tell you that the shuttle runs at the top and bottom of every hour which is false ... The driver pulled in at 11:23 and at 11:24 we had already left the terminal and on the way back to the hotel! In my opinion we should have set at the airport until 11:30 and the departed!The front desk representatives are always friendly and helpful. Lobby and rooms have always been clean with fresh looking decorations and furniture. Comfortable bed. For being this close to the airport, there is very little noise. This hotel remains a regular stop for us.Lobby is well decorated for Christmas. Very well decorated. Looked like a nice pool. They offer a pantry to buy snacks as well as vending machines. Double the price of most items elsewhere. Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and had plenty of space. Beds were a little firm, but that's just me. All white bedding ( a sign to me they wash all the bedding, not leaving the comforter for each guest to leave their germs)Bathroom clean. Odd set up as far as available towel hangers....Restaurant in lobby, didn't go but ranges from $13-$35 a plate. We ordered Jimmy Johns from 3 min away. They really did show up in less than 10 min. And they delivered to the room directly. About 8 plugins in the room.I was Cold all night.Rooms are cold. heat doesn't work.The old shuttle driver is excellent--knowledgeable, helpful...Shuttle comes and goes to the airport every 30 minutes for free.Free wifiIt's a little old and dated but clean. Its super hot in the hallways; ac in the room worked well and kept the room nice and cool. Air traffic was a little noisy....completely forgot to use ear plugs; fortunately I only had to stay one night.  Staff accommodated late check out (2::00 PM).  I did get locked out of the room when I returned after 12 noon - had to ask for key card to be reactivated, which didn't work so front desk had to call maintenance.  Shuttle service to and from airport is a plus!Right by the airport with a complimentary shuttle service. Pretty hotel with a cool layout. Rooms are big and clean, try not to get a room that's right on the final approach path oryou'll be up all night listening to airplanes. Comfy beds and pillows. Work out room has a few treadmills, an elliptical, a bike, and a stairmaster. A few free weights but not much in that department. Indoor pool with an arcade room. Free breakfast buffet in the restaurant which is also a decent place for dinner, pricy though. They also have the VIP lounge on the fifth floor with snacks and goodies. Friendly staff.","This place has a lot of rough edges, staying here for three days, but will list what I've noticed in first 24 hours1.  Dirty un-vacuumed carpets in lobby.  They really need to shampoo the spots out, but I'll settle for a vacuuming.2.  Outlets in sleeping rooms don't work--they rely on lamps with extra outlets and the holes are too loose to hold a plug.  Tip:  if you need to hold a charge, use the bathroom outlet.3.  They provide earplugs as part of the toiletry kit--bad omen, which was realized in middle of night with freight planes taking off/landing all night.4.  Restaurant menus were dirty and grubby--seriously, wipe them clean.  Also, silverware was spotted.  Made me wonder how clean the kitchen was!5.  Baked potato soup special was Velveeta  with a few chunks of potato.  Gross!6.  Bartender was an untrained waitress who made it her mission to disclaim ""I don't know how to make drinks, I'm just a server!""  Manager/supervisor came by and laughed it off.7.  Hotel staff does not acknowledge or greet guests.  Please look at me and say hello when I walk by.  I'm spending money in your establishment.8.  Dirty table linens (tablecloths/napkins) in conference rooms.9.  Who serves boiled hamburgers for lunch?Have stay here 2 times and was very pleased each time. You are greeted with a cold drink and a smile every time. The staff is very friendly and they try real hard to please and meets your needs. The facility are roomy but a bit dated like the 1970 treadmills. The pool and arcade are kid safe and friendly. The best part is the most important the great big bed and fluffy pillow and plush bed spread haaaa goodnight zzzz.Great for the price!  Was not expecting it to be so nice.  Only negative was that the bathrooms in the room were quite tiny (only one person can get ready at a time), and would recommend bringing a pair of ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  Luckily, these weren't an issue for me, but I could see how this would be bothersome.My evening flight was canceled and I was rebooked on an early flight so I opted to stay closer to the airport.  I really liked this hotel.  It was clean and the wifi reliable (fast enough for free).  I loved the firm mattress!  The bedding was clean and comfortable with a bevy of comfy pillows.  The spa quality shampoo, conditioner and lotion were a welcome surprise and the soap smelled fantastic.   Nice enough towels (nothing to gush over but certainly good enough).To the people complaining about airplane noise - you're right next to an airport! What did you expect?  It was not bad at all and I slept well and comfortably.Got a great price here on priceline. The reception staff was competent and efficient. The lobby was set up for a convention and was almost impossible to navigate through. We were directed through a separate door with more direct access to our room. We were disappointed that they had removed the hot tub from the pool area. The moment we got to our room everything else was forgotten. The room was quiet and large. There was a shower with excellent water pressure and a garden tub. The bed was a bit firm but comfortable with a good selection of pillows. We were in the flight path, but once I turned on the fan before bed you really couldn't hear it. We had minimal to no noise from other rooms. Free parking and good free in room wifi made for a really nice stay.Yuck.  Would not stay here again. Staff was friendly enough but rooms need updating. A/c is very loud. Ceilings in hallway seem low. Walls are very thin- can here conversation of people next to me. And can hear lady constantly sneezing. Worst part- hot water in shower did not work!!!!Not cheap either.Seemed to be a very nice hotel. I stayed here on business. The hotel staff seemed courteous, albeit a little cold. Room seemed clean, which is the most important thing to me. I would likely stay here again.There's a lot to like about this place. In comparison to many of the places I've stayed in Indianapolis, it was cleaner, more modern and better kept. The bathroom was spotless, which I think is a big deal to a lot of people. The Wi-Fi stayed connected and was relatively fast, which is another big deal to many business travelers. The bed was comfortable and big, and the couch was a nice touch too.The airplanes are so minor in comparison to some of the complaints that have been leveled. Yes, it's loud, but there aren't enough going over to be a problem. We heard it several times, but never when sleeping. If you are going to be sleeping at 2 in the afternoon - yes, it might be a small issue, but with the AC on, it's not that bad.The bar is a little expensive, but was a nice thing to have. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, which in a small bar can be an issue.The pool was too crowded, and the people really didn't respect our space. Not the hotel's fault, but they could probably stand to expand that. I just wanted to sit in the hot tub and the parents weren't respectful enough to ask their kids not to climb over us and splash us. Plus - a woman brought her baby into it which is a terrible idea, but not the hotel's fault. It appeared to be attendees or the family of attendees of a conference, so it might depend on what is being hosted there.The one major complaint was maybe on our last day. I woke up at 10:00, and at 10:30, right before I left, the housekeepers knocked on the door. When I left, I noticed our ""Do Not Disturb"" tag had been taken. My girlfriend stayed behind to sleep in a little more and they apparently came back twice before 11:00. The front desk promised to find out what was going on and address it, but still, kind of obnoxious. It felt like they were trying to get us to leave so they could clean the room and leave for the day. I understand, but it wasn't even a late checkout, so talk about annoying.Oof. Bad. It  was just horrible. If you don't mind, I'm just going to list every crappy thing I encountered during my several meals at The Landing at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Airport.CRAPPY STUFF:1) The service: They take forever to come over to you and disappear for 15 minutes at a time. No smiles.2) The water: The h20 tasted lie poo20. If you know your water is tainted, offer bottled. 3) Appetizer: I ordered a hummus trio with fresh pita bread. Mmm the pita was warm. Problem was they tasted like pancakes. Warm fluffy flapjacks. I guess that would have been fine I would have had maple syrup hummus. Oh and the hummus was bland and tasteless. 4) Breakfast: The server was subpar and the milk was warm. 5) Cocktails: I ordered an Arnold Palmer-esque drink they call the ""co-pilot"". It tasted like watered down country time lemonade. Let down. My companion almost choked over their house cabernet. They were gagging and swirling furiously. Avoid The Landing and go across the street to the Radisson's restaurant. It can't be worse.Hotel is not Crowne Plaza quality. I think they may be downgrading to rebadging as a Holiday Inn. The restaurant here is bad. Had the worst Reuben sandwich of my life. Bread was soggy as a sponge. Inedible. Chili and salad were horrible. Overpriced too. Airport hotel choices in Indy are poor. Since they opened the new terminal, none are that close to Indy either. Stay downtown instead. Or better yet, just avoid Indy all together.What a beat up old hotel this is. Decent furniture and a comfortable bed, but the room was incredibly stuffy and the air conditioner was noisy. The unit, in a space next to the closet, had one register, so parts of the room were cold while others were hot.Planes not a big deal.Not a favorite of mine.  Restaurant is horrible and menu is limited.  Room service shuts down early as does the bar and you get to listen to airplanes flying all night.  Rooms are OK.  Beds are pretty comfortable.  Just not a real fan of this hotel.Ok, this is not a bad hotel.  I really liked the lobby and the fountain and the business center.  The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.  They are 12 minutes from the airport.  People complain about the noise form the airport; guess what, you're 12 minutes from the airport!!!  The room was nice, the WiFi free, and I had no issue or problem while I stayed here.  I presented at the hotel and the room was nice and the staff was helpful in this regard as well.  The only negative was the breakfast.  I had pancakes and they were super dry but I am a trooper.  I would stay here again, no doubt.Eh, nothing special - I did notice that the old train cars were avaliable as rooms &amp; that seemed fun. For the price, I wouldn't choose it again. The normal rooms were small and the bathrooms were tiny. We shared the room with another couple - maybe that was the downfall. 4 people in these rooms caused it to be cramped. With so many options downtown - I'd choose something different next time.Great rate, nice restaurant and polite focused staff.I enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel.  This was a last minute stay and was done through Hotwire.  I was overall very pleased with the hotel.  The lobby and interior of the hotel were well kept, and the staff were very helpful.  My room was huge, and very clean!  I ordered room service for dinner and the staff again were very nice and quick!  Overall I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would stay again if need be!I was not able to arrive and stay due to inclement weather.  It was very difficult to get a refund from this hotel.  I would definitely not recommend this hotel.Price is right with Millionaire's discount. Has a shuttle which I haven't used yet. I got stuck on 2nd level back-corner mouse maze. Up down and around. Front desk was helpful and courteous. No restaurants in the area to walk to. A rental car is a must, which I don't have. beds were comfy and hotel quiet. Exec lounge lacks amenities. Fitness center is average.Come on. It's not the Ritz Carlton. But it's clean, the staff is nice, and the restaurant is decent enough. It too is not Ruth's Chris, but for a turkey club it's quite good.Stayed here before an early morning flight. Pluses: Very nice lobby and interior. Soft plush towels. Flat screen tv in room. Large desk and free Internet. Starbucks coffee in lobby. Minuses: bed was hard as a rock. I don't do firm and tossed and turned all night. Iron and board were in poor condition.We got our room through priceline day of travel for less than usd50. Overall, pretty good experience.","This hotel sucks. Stayed here for Super Bowl XLVI. Handicap room too small, They put coffee maker next to toilet (gross), no room for roll A way bed, so my son, husband &amp; I had to share king bed. Bathroom not  accessible &amp; the door locked up.  Had to have maintenance up to unlock door.  CP employee claimed he worked at another location &amp; at his location they had keys to unlock the bathroom &amp; any interior doors.  My husband had to eventually unlock the door with tools provided by the CP employee because the CP employee was unable to unlock the door.  Elevator constantly broke down, my son is in a wheelchair, we were on the 5th floor so this was stressful.  Food &amp; buffet in dining room cold &amp; gross, but somehow room service food OK. Both use same kitchen...oh &amp; ice machines were slimy with mold. When we made basic inquiries about hotel services, most of the staff claimed that this branch was not the one they usually worked at, so they didn't know anything. Front desk staff pleasant, MOD Chris, super, bar staff great especially SALLY. However when I found a charge for $472.79 on my credit card even the accounting department, Bryan, could not explain what it was for. General Manager Mark Pogonis was rude &amp; hung up on me during our conversation, &amp; refused to take my calls when I called back. It was not a SUPER STAY. You would think that a city that handles over 100,000+ for INDY 500 for decades could handle less than 70,000 people for a football game. I was wrong.Noisy, not only from the constant line of planes landing, especially midnight-1am, but the maids are VERY loud. Front desk staff that is apathetic and the biggest problem...BED BUGS.   My colleague found one. Front desk wasn't overly concerned.  When my colleague wrote to Radisson, never even received a follow up.  At one time, Radisson was one of the better U.S. hotel chains, not any more.Whoa whoa whoaaaa! I jumped the gun on my good review! Let's take a few steps back. The walls and ceilings are suuuuper de dupppper thin! We could head all hallway traffic and get this. We heard the party upstairs peeing away.i wasn't sure I was hearing someone peeing til the toilet flushed and the toilet seat cover went down. Seriously?!!!! Cmon! Spend some money for some thicker walls none of this paper mache crap! Besides that. The rooms are great. I'm just glad we don't have a young couple upstairs or next door. Damn.. Better knock on wood now.This is not for the hotel itself but for the parking lot and airport shuttle I used when I went out of town a week or two ago.  I paid in advance (about $6 a day with tax) and the value was very good and my car was secure.  The trip to the airport (about 4:30 in the morning Christmas eve) was prompt and cordial, but on the trip back a week later I called the hotel to pick me up at 1:45 am, right as my plane landed and was told  the van would be there in 15 minutes.  It turned out to be 45 minutes; another party on my same flight needed a ride too and those people had to wait as well.  I didn't need to wait an extra half hour when told otherwise, I wanted to get home.  But with a family of five in the same van, I didn't raise a stink with the driver (I just didn't tip when he got my luggage out of the van).  When I travel I usually have other people take me to the airport and if that isn't possible, next time it will be a tough call as to whom to use to park and shuttle me.",,,"['stopped', 'visit',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-indianapolis-downtown-indianapolis,Courtyard Indianapolis Downtown,3.5,$$,22,"This hotel was absolutely spectacular!  Stayed here for three evenings in a 1 Queen-sized bed bedroom and everything was just amazing.  Of all things, I especially have to call out the bathroom - good lord, the bathroom they had in my hotel room was the type of bathroom you'd want in your house.  It had beautiful heavy duty granite for the sink and an amazing shower with ample space and glass doors instead of the classic kitchy hotel shower liner with rings.  Beautiful modern mirrors and modest decorations were on the walls and it was in every way my dream bathroom.But enough potty talk!  The room itself was spacious, had a pull-out comfy bed-couch combo unit, and had a luxurious soft bed with soft pillows.  On that bed I slept like a log every night.  Usually I find it tough sleeping in another bed that's not my own, but not these past few nights!  I was out like a light and it was just great.  There was also ample closet space, drawer-space, and a great view of downtown - simply wonderful!Finally and arguably most importantly, the concierge desk staff downstairs were extremely helpful.  If I had a question about downtown Indianapolis, they had the answer.  If I needed a taxi, they got it for me.  When the internet wasn't working downstairs, they had it fixed lickety-split.  Really a wonderful team for my entire visit!  If I had to knock this hotel for one thing, $191/night in downtown Indianapolis is just too high.  Although everything was great, I definitely felt a bit of price gouging here for a city in the middle of the country.Straight up, didn't stay, didn't even make a reservation. Didn't need to. Will be in town to run the marathon in November, they have zero rooms if ya stay one night, plenty of rooms if ya stay 2 nights (confused, yea me to). Then they charge $23 a day for you to park in THEIR parking lot. I'll stay elsewhere, ridiculous.Pretty poor for a courtyard. I have stayed here several times on business and the service at check in is always slow. And I mean 15 minutes to find a standing corporate reservation. All the rooms have feather pillows (which I do not like) and no foam pillows are ever available. Rooms are clean and in good repair but seem fairly loud.The wife and I were in town for the weekend and stayed at the Courtyard Indianapolis Downtown.  The hotel was located in the congested Marriott hotel complex consisting of the JW Marriott, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, and the Courtyard, which have different entrances from the street, but share a common parking garage.  Its location couldn't have been better as the hotel was across the street from White River State Park, the Indiana State Museum, the Eiteljorg Museum, and Victory Field and a short walk to the Convention Center, Lucas Oil Stadium, and downtown restaurants, bars and shopping.  The lobby and rooms were clean and modern with a design aesthetic consistent with the Courtyard brand.  Service from the front desk, housekeeping, and valet was seamless.  Our room was on the 14th floor, faced north, and had a good view of Victory Field and Lucas Oil Stadium.  The bathroom was reasonably spacious and brightly lit.  The shower had good water pressure and hot water was near instantaneous.  The only downside to our stay was the bed.  The wife found the mattress way too stiff and unforgiving.  I thought it was stiff, but not so much so that I didn't feel rested.  However, we both found the pillows to be woefully inadequate and lacking in support.  Each side of the bed had two pillows.  With two pillows stacked, it still felt like our heads were resting directly on the mattress.Location:  5 starsParking:  3 starsStaff/service:  4 stars  Bed/Mattress/Pillows:  2 starsBathroom:  4 starsThe Courtyard Indianapolis Downtown is a nice hotel with an outstanding location.  I would stay there again for the right price compared to other downtown hotel properties.Stayed in room 1004.Room was spacious and clean. Room has a great view of Lucas Oil stadium and the adjacent baseball field. Room service available from TGIFridays that is next door to the property. There is a $23 fee for onsite parking per day, valet parking also available. Gym area is super clean. I would definitely return to this Marriott property.Our hotel room was superb. Clean and cozy. The staff was quick to address a very squeaky bathroom door, but that was our only issue when staying here.  The other guests were very nice and courteous which made the experience that much better. We liked this hotel even more due to being so close to downtown Indy - we walked nearly everywhere on our visit &amp; loved it!Direct across from the beautiful canal walk.This hotel is excellent.Had some friends in town for the 500 weekend, so even though I'm an Indy resident stayed here a night out of convenience and spent a lot of time at the hotel. Was really impressed overall - the building was very clean and had a nice modern feel. The location near White River and the edge of downtown is extremely convenient, and they handled a crowded weekend of visitors very well.While parking is pretty expensive, for weekends especially there are metered spaces downtown within a 10 minute walk or so (on Indiana Ave or Senate for sure, may be other places as well). Considering its the same direction visitors would end up going for a restaurant or entertainment, it's definitely a budget-friendly option since some are free over the weekend and after 6 pm or so on Friday and don't mind walking a little ways.Housekeepers are theives! Beware and keep all you belongings close! My daughter left the iPad in our room, and when we found out we called the front desk and they said they couldn't do anything untill mourning. They never returned our call. When we called back they were rude.  Never going back to a Marriott.In response to courtyards response.It's funny that this is the only response we've had from you company is on a public forum. Seriously!  I have the track your iPad to your location and you still have not done anything about it. So the Marriott is fine with stolen items. Heads up people!This is a great, new-look Courtyard.  The location is terrific.  If you like to run, just go across the street and run through the park over to the zoo, or down by the canal.My room was clean, as was the bathroom.  It's new and well decorated.  I like the food options in the lobby.  Check-in was extremely quick.The only down-side (for me, at least) was the small exercise room that's shared with the conjoined Spring Hill Suites.  Four treadmills, two ellipticals, and ZERO bikes?  Come on, Marriott, give us an exercise bike or two, please.This the same Marriott with the same ugly clumsy furniture, free wifi and $ 150ish / night. That's 3 stars. I stayed at Marriott hotel 170 nights this year. The worst thing is the breakfast... OMG how can you screw up oatmeal. It tastes like you just scratched it off the ceiling throwing in some bitter nuts... Bitter MarriottNice and clean hotel but the parking is outrageous and the charge for the room because of the events in town are ridiculous. I would have rather stayed somewhere else but it was the only room left downtown. Also we were forced to park valet because the garage was full and I felt obligated to tip the drivers. Kind of sucks!A newer looker for Courtyard which is very refreshing and vibrant! It is right across the street from the park so you can hear concerts &amp; depending on your room even see them. We got to check out Daughtry on my visit. You are also right across from the baseball field as well. Call ahead of time to see if you can score some free AAA tickets. The lobby has water &amp; the hotel is connected to the skyway to the convention center. The workout room &amp; pool are small. The internet is horribly slow which is the only downfall I can truly say about this location.Stayed here over night on a whim and to use up some Marriott rewards.  Everything was extremely clean from the lobby, to the halls, to the rooms.  The configuration of all the Marriott hotels hooked together in a complex can be a bit confusing.  We got the hang of it pretty quick but directed several people around just in our short stay.  The pool is small but adequate for my four year old and the other kids that seemed to be having a great time.  Would have been extremely nice to have a Jacuzzi, but no dice.  You can walk all the way to the Circle Center mall inside through the skywalks and the convention center which is really nice when it's 20 degrees outside.  I'm sure in the warmer months the running path outside is awesome.  There is a small gym that you can use.  Overall a GOOD stay.I was very happy with my stay here!! The hotel was brand new, very modern, clean and great ambiance. All the staff I talked to over the phone, at check in and check out were all very nice. The location is fantastic! We walked everywhere (mostly because the hotel charges over $20/day for parking!!). But you can get to tons of great sites by walking so it worked out. The room was the perfect size and we had 3 girls in there for 3 nights! The hotel let my two roommates check in at 6am for no extra charge! Extra points for that. The food downstairs was good, there was a skywalk to the JW where there was a Starbucks....I really have all good things to say about this place. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone!Everything was positive about this hotel ( comfort, cleanliness,location ) . My only complaint would be that people congregate right outside the front door to smoke, so as soon as you walk outside you're hit with it. Happen to have the pleasure of walking right into 4 cigar smokers.Good location near museums, park and river walk. Also close to downtown restaurants and shopping. Very clean and has some nice updates. Got room for super cheap on priceline.Good location downtown attached to the giant marriot complex.  Right next to the baseball field and attached to Lucas Oil stadium.  I got the room on priceline for $50 before taxes during the week.  Friendly staff.Great hotel. We got a room for 48.00 on priceline. Its within walking distance of downtown and right across the street from White River Park!Great, clean, fairly new facility. Room spotless. Bathroom design very good. Great value for the money - walking distance to most downtown Indy points of interest. Friendly staff too!This hotel is one of the better ones I've stayed at over the years. It wasn't anything spectacular, but a good value for the price ($124/night weekday and $149/night on the weekend) and still considered downtown. It is within walking distance of most of Indianapolis' major attractions - zoo, gardens, canal (NCAA Hall of Champions is located here, as well as a paddleboat ride), The Lawn (concerts), Victory Field (baseball), Circle Center (shopping) and tons of restaurants. There are two museums across the street - The Indiana State museum and a western art museum, I believe.The room was clean, the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate, and the bed was pretty comfy. There's a T.G.I. Fridays on site. I don't really care for them, but they have a breakfast buffet from 6:30-10:30 am. It's a bit too pricey for my taste ($7.99), but we had a free breakfast promotion so it hit the spot. They serve eggs, bacon, biscuits and sausage, bagels, toast, Krispy Kreme donuts, cereal, and yogurt. There's also a made to order omelet station. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Indianapolis. Oh and one other thing to note - the parking is free at this hotel, which is not the case at many of the other hotels!","Excellent location, much cheaper than the attached JW Marriott skyscraper, but I still paid 157 a night via Orbiz (vs way over 200 for the attached Marriott.) If you are going to a convention in this complex, I'd recommend staying there, though my room had the peculiar stench of body odor that hit you when you first walked in. I'm not going to hold this against the hotel since I think it was an anomaly, though the same smell was present in the elevator from the parking garage.Staff was VERY helpful and friendly and I'm guessing that if I'd complained they would have given me another room, but I was too tired upon arrival to deal with it.Room was very clean, shower (no bathtub) was excellent, free wi-fi (you can upgrade to a faster service but the free was fine) and the price was reasonable for how close it was to the convention center, baseball field, and Lucas Oil stadium.I had a nice walk in the White River State Park area that is right across the street, and if you are a runner this spot would be ideal for a city run on a greenway. Staff also allowed me to leave my car in the underground parking garage for a full 12 hours after I checked out at no charge, which was nice.My wifes camera and her friends phone were stolen out of their room while they were here.",,,,"['hotel', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'three', 'evenings', 'queen', 'sized', 'bed', 'bedroom', 'everything', 'amazing', 'things', 'especially', 'call',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-suites-city-centre-indianapolis,Comfort Suites City Centre,3.0,$$,22,"This place was clean and it was a good option to stay at. Our first night Sierra and Kanaan (sorry if I misspelled that!) were pleasant to check-in with. Sierra told us she couldn't find our packages that we were expecting, but one look in the back, and we found them on our own, since the packages obviously had our names on them and were addressed to us, so you might need to be a bit more proactive on this front if you come here and have shipped stuff in advance for business like we did. Sierra also gave us great recommendations on places we could check out for fun in the Indy area and was very helpful on that front! Rudy the chef was super nice and the continental breakfast is wholesome! Although beware: the food in the breakfast area is not labeled in case people have dietary restrictions or allergies- I don't eat pork and the omelette was not labeled so I took one and it had ham, it threw me off for the rest of the day! On my check out, Nicolette was super helpful and helped me get everything I needed settled before I left. She added the missing parking charge to my bill and even ran out in the cold and opened the parking gate for me when it got stuck- thanks Nicolette!The room was large, and clean, I was surprised and happy to see it had a microwave and mini-fridge! Sheets were clean, bed was comfy, room temp was good, the couch was comfortable to sit on, and bathroom was clean (although some type of stains in the toilet bowl that surprised me the first night until I realized that it was probably rust), water pressure in shower was good, and hot tub was great to use downstairs, clean towels and amenities were restocked in my room daily.I did have a negative experience with Christa who was ridiculously unhelpful. The night before I checked out, I realized I forgot to pick up packaging tape that I needed for a box I planned to check in at the airport. I asked her if she had packaging tape. Without even checking in the back, she says ""no,"" and rudely hands me scotch tape from the front counter and says ""this is all we have."" I looked at her and knew that it couldn't be true since we were in a big hotel, also that she just wasn't helpful and not keen on doing her job of customer service. At that point I didn't even think it was worth asking her to check in the back because she made it clear that she was lazy and probably should not be employed there.However, like I said Nicolette was great, I asked her for tape in the morning and she also wasn't sure if they had any but OFFERED to look in the back, and behold, SHE FOUND TAPE! She helped me wrap my box up and I knew she was committed to her job and to helping people!Overall, this place does the job of staying somewhere clean and friendly when you're away from home and have the misfortune of ending up in Indiana. The staff was kind overall, and just a few instances where I thought there could be improvements. However, don't come here having super high expectation overall. And if you run into Christa, then good luck getting what you need!My girlfriend and I stayed here for a wedding. I booked the hotel well in advance via phone. The booking agent was polite and after everything was finished, told me what it would cost. However, he failed to mention the additional parking costs and the miscellaneous fees that would be assessed to us upon arrival. I have no problem paying these fees and understand they are a normal expense for a hotel. However I would like advanced notice of them. We went into our stay thinking the cost I was told on the phone covered everything, only to be surprised by a bill that was $50 more than communicated to us on the phone. Considering we were traveling out of state and had no choice but to pay these fees, it felt deceptive at best.The factor keeping this place from receiving a one-star is the bed. Hands down the most comfortable hotel bed I've stayed in - even better than some top-tier hotels/resorts. The hotel is clean, the staff was polite. However, the manner in which we were charged completely overshadowed all the pros of this place.While I've yet to stay at this hotel, I walked through the lobby and was surprised at how dark it was in that area of the hotel and also saddened by how busy the breakfast nook was -- it would make more sense to have more space for breakfast when breakfast is complimentary when you stay here, there being so many rooms in this venue! Otherwise it is a pretty affordable hotel.Stay away. I booked a room and was told the cancellation policy was 24 hour notice. I cancelled my reservation well before 24 hours and was then told the policy was 30 days. I was never emailed a confirmation which raised a red flag. The GM is now calling me a liar when I told him his employee mistakenly told me incorrect information.Greetings,There is a lot of upside to this hotel, but first let me hit you with the one thing that annoyed the heck out of me. They charge you $3.00 a night for the room safe. Seriously, is this a normal thing? I've been traveling and in and out of all kinds of hotels and I've never seen a surcharge for the room safe. Maybe some of you are traveling with thousands upon thousands of dollars or maybe some precious rubies you found in the Amazon, but I don't really ever feel like I need these things. I know, I know, but your precious jewelry or Rolex watch. First of all, no one wears watches anymore so stop it. This hotel will charge you and make no mention of the charge upon check in or check out, so, you've been warned. You're welcome.Oh yeah, parking is expensive so just a heads up. It's like 20 bucks a night for a car. There is some, very little, street parking nearby. If you can score one of those spots go for it. Remember, however, street parking carries some risks as well, but I digress...Now, the upside...STAFF - Friendly and helpful. The chamber maids always said hello and good morning to me when I wandered the hallways. Same with the front desk and breakfast bar staff. Speaking of...BREAKFAST - Free and downstairs in the lobby area. Standard continental type breakfast. They have waffles, bagels, muffins, pastries, cereal, juice machine, hard boiled eggs, toast yada yada yada. Staff running the breakfast is great and helpful.ROOMS - Spacious and comfortable. Nice flat screen TVs. Beds are comfortable. AC and Heater are not loud as hell so it doesn't sound like you are sleeping through a hurricane.RATES - I don't know. My company's client that booked us had a deal so I have no idea. It's probably middle of the road and speaking of...LOCATION - A long par 3 away from Lucas Oil Field. Great hotel for Colts games or concerts. They do concerts there? I assume so...Overall, you will be pleased to stay here. I would actually give this place a 3.9. You need to earn that 4th star and make your safes free! Come on!I attended a conference and stayed here for 5 nights. There are definitely pros and cons to this hotel.Pros:1) Right beside Lucas Stadium. If you are attending a game or event, this hotel is perfect.2) Free breakfast (eggs, waffles, sausages, gravy, fruits, yogurt, pastries, coffee)3) Modern, new decor, style4) Swimming pool and hot tub5) Gym (elliptical, treadmills, bikes, resistance equipment)6) Half mile walk to/from Convention Center7) Friendly staff (in general)8) General public areas were kept clean and free of clutterCons:1) My room was not cleaned for 2 days! Although the housekeeping lady apologized, there needs to be a system in place for all guest rooms to be cleaned before guests arrive back from an all day conference! Completely unacceptable for whatever reason!2) Some towels had stains.3) Breakfast items tend to disappear quick and not refilled. So, eat early at 6 am especially if there is a big event.4) Bananas were green one morning.5) Checkout time is at 11 am instead of 12 noon.6) Make sure to check your final bill because there is a chance that you are also billed for ""Safe w/ltd Warranty"" which I don't even know existed. 7) It can be noisy if there are kids and/or students next to your room.* If you are staying for 1 or 2 nights, you can definitely consider this hotel due to the proximity to Lucas Stadium and price. If you plan to stay beyond 2 nights, choose somewhere else since there are better options out there. However, I still believe in ""You get what you pay for!"" The hotel is a bargain compared to the Convention Center hotels.Gross. This hotel gave me crabs. I stayed four nights. On the fifth day I was itching. A closer inspection of the bed spread confirmed it: dead crabs. I had to go buy RID shampoo from the pharmacy. Then, when I was done with my shower, the towel I chose had food on it from the previous guest. Gross gross gross.AMAZING STAFF! Large rooms, very comfortable beds. Pool area was very clean, as was the rest of the common areas. Great rates for what you get.  Did I mention the STAFF IS AMAZING?  From the time we checked in,  we were greeted with smiles and laughter. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly. I have definitely found the hotel I will stay at every time I am in Indy.We stayed here for four nights.  Our rooms were clean and the beds were super comfy.  They have an indoor pool and fitness room.  They are currently charging $20/day for parking.  The staff was friendly.  The Wifi was free, but had a terrible signal.  The breakfast served in the morning is fairly decent.  The little cafe is convenient for a quick meal, but don't expect anything extravagant... our burgers were served on toast.  Lucas Oil Stadium is across the street... literally... less than a 5-minute walk to the door.  The 'downtown' area is about 5 blocks away and offers more places to eat.The lobby and room are about what you'd expect from this type of hotel.  Room was fairly large and clean, bed was comfortable.  We had a foldout couch, microwave, and refrigerator.  Parking was very convenient.  Also had free wifi.  Pretty good value for a hotel that's so conveniently located in the middle of everything.The free breakfast was similar to most hotels- eggs, bacon, waffles, yogurt, various breads, cereal, juice, etc.  The breakfast area (which serves as a bar in the evenings) was way too small and very crowded.  They do have an outside seating area for nicer weather.I read some reviews about bad service / attitude at the front desk and was a little nervous about our stay here.  The front desk staff were extremely friendly every time we entered and exited the hotel.  So much so that I wanted to write a review to acknowledge their positive attitudes and the way they represented the hotel.  Hopefully whoever was causing the negative reviews is no longer there.  We weren't going to Lucas Oil Stadium but for those who are the stadium is literally right across the street.  It's also just minutes from most downtown attractions.  Very convenient location.We stayed for 3 nights during the Brickyard 400. The night we checked in(around 12 am) the front  desk clerk put on a hard sell regarding the parking and the lack of safety if we parked it on the street. Well we parked it street side each day we were there and found that all the locals park on the streets too! Saved myself a significant amount in parking fees by not listening to the front desk. That aside we were very happy with the room(a king size bed and pull out) , the breakfast (sausage, eggs and waffles, plus fruits and muffins) and the amenities(decent business area, lounge , bar , indoor pool and weight room). We picked this up by naming our own price on Priceline (100 a night) and turned out to be more than satisfied.This hotel was convenient for attending a convention at the Convention Center: just a 10 minute walk away. The building and accommodations are what I would expect for a Comfort Suites, BUT be warned, you can't count on them honoring a reservation!They had supposedly set aside a certain number of rooms for the convention I am attending.  I made a reservation for one of those rooms three months in advance through the official channels, and confirmed my reservation with my credit card. One week before my meeting the hotel sent me an email confirming my reservation. So I naively  thought I was all set.But when I arrived, I was told they had no room for me. They claimed it wasn't their fault, something about the reservations coming in too fast. The fact is they just didn't actually set the agreed upon number of rooms aside: they overbooked instead. What was more aggravating, was I could see them checking in other travelers after me, while they were explaining to me that there just weren't any more rooms. They didn't even use first-come-first-serve to allocate the rooms they had. They specifically chose to bump some of us with the convention (because of our discounted price?) in favor of other (full price?) reservations!They did get me into another hotel and pay for the first night of my stay there, apparently by agreement with my convention's organizers. But now I am 6 miles away and commuting at the same price I expected to pay for a downtown location.The most basic service a hotel must provide is a room. If you can't count on that, nothing else matters, so I would have given them 0 stars, if I could.I recently stayed two nights at this hotel, everything was fine until I noticed that someone was in my room after I had specifically asked the front desk not to have my room refreshed. Then I was charged $20 each day for parking in the garage next door. I had checked in late in the evening and the front desk assistance Preston asked if I wanted to park in the garage or the lot so I opted for the lot because he said we might have ice overnight. Preston failed to point out that there was a $20 charge for parking. The next morning I specifically asked the front desk if there was a note in the file where I had asked not to have my room cleaned because there was no ""do not disturb tag"" on my door. There was a note in the file but my room was still entered. Not sure if anything was stolen. even though I in this field the items on the check-in form, I still feel that the charges should have been pointed out so beware. all I received at the front desk was I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry doesn't take away the 40 extra dollars I had to pay.If you are going to see a game at Lucas Oil and are looking for a convenient hotel to the stadium, this place is close.  They have a little bar and free breakfast.  The place is clean enough but DO NOT USE the iron.  Additionally, don't plan to get any service from housekeeping or management after hours.  This place does not empower their night crew to take care of anything.  Despite that, the people are friendly.  Don't necessarily expect a bargain because you are staying at a Comfort property.  Look around, because you may be surprised by the prices in much better locations of downtown.Hotel was clean, rooms were spacious. Price was decent. Staff was extremely friendly and the free continental breakfast was one of the better ""free"" breakfasts I've had a hotel. Would stay again.Our company booked 27 room nights while we were attending a convention. On our fourth night the hotel made a mistake and sold a room out from under us that we had already occupied and paid for.  (There was actually a hilarious side this to story -- putting two strangers in the same room, sharing toothbrushes, charging them both -- but it's too long to tell here.)  Night manager was rude, rude, rude. This was a situation where a little bit of empathy and concern for the customer would have at least made us feel better but no, he was contentious from the beginning.  Instead of apologizing and trying to make it right he tried to turn it around and make it our fault!  The whole city was booked up because of the convention so we had to send one of our people home early -- leaving at ten o'clock at night.  The hotel wasn't even planning to credit us for the room they gave away until we pressed for it. ""As as a courtesy"" they agreed to credit us. As a courtesy???  Bad experience here.First walking into this hotel, I was taken aback--it looked swanky for a Comfort Suites! I guess I was expecting the kind of decor you'd find at a Comfort Suites in the middle of nowhere. My five cross-country roadtrips have given me a bad kind of bias when it comes to certain hotels.We checked in sort of late--11pm--because we wanted to get dinner and see a show first. The front desk person was very nice and helpful. We got up to our room, went in--and it was the wrong arrangement. Too bad, apparently. Upon returning to the front desk to ask for a different room (AKA, the one we had reserved), the smiling lady at the front desk was now in a foul mood and told us there was not another room available.Seeing as we got a deal on Travelocity, I wasn't too concerned about it--just a little annoyed that we didn't get the room we reserved and were treated rather curtly when we inquired about it. We also decided to sleep in the next morning, and I thought to call down for the check-out time: 11am. It's a good thing I checked. It's one of the earliest check-out times I've heard of, and we had to rush to get out on time.All in all, I doubt we'll be back at this Comfort Suites. The room was clean and the (cramped) bed was comfortable, but the experience was not as enjoyable as I like a hotel stay to be.My fiance and I drove in from Chicago to stay here while we attended a friend's baby shower.  The rooms are spacious, the king sized bed was comfortable, the included breakfast is good, and the location is decent.  It's next door to Lucas Oil stadium and a short drive (not really walking distance) from downtown attractions.  Those are about all the positive things I can say.  Now, the negatives: thin walls, loud and rude guests, centralized and careless management, and much too expensive for what you get.  I could pay $100/night for a downtown Chicago hotel that's much more peaceful.We arrived around 7 pm and our hallway was full of loud, obnoxious people talking in the halls and slamming doors, and the walls are so thin you can hear every single word. I called ""guest services"" on the hotel phone, and it took me to a hotel chain operator, NOT someone located at the hotel, who looked the hotel up and informed me that every room was booked and she couldn't move or help us.My fiance went to the front desk to speak to management, was given the runaround, and told that they would take care of it.  It was still loud and I doubt management did anything, so I shared an elevator with a woman to go downstairs again to speak with the front desk, and she laughed about how a room reeked like marijuana, and it turned out that she's the manager (who never stopped on our floor).When I explain to her that I'm exhausted, we've made several attempts to get help, and the floor still sounds like a dance club, she tells me that she didn't hear any noise on our floor, and keeps insisting that she didn't hear anything.  The other guy at the desk takes pity on us and suggests moving us to a different floor, which is MUCH quieter, but still the walls are so thin I can hear every sneeze down the hall.If you're 21, want to stay 5 people to a room and get trashed and laugh in the halls, this is the place for you.  For anyone else, you'll be paying $100/night for a sleep-deprived night.I would have given this hotel 5 stars but they charge 12 dollars a day for parking. When I got there after I was quoted 12 dollars a day. The price went up to 14. Total rip off. The rooms are nice and the beds are so comfortable. Parking for hotel guest should always be free. Charge parking for people who are not guests.Stayed at this location for two nights during a training nearby - very convenient to both my training location and downtown.  About a 10 minute walk to downtown restaurants, etc., and literally a stone's throw from the Colts Lucas Field Stadium.The room was very nice and clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful both at the desk and the bar/restaurant.  Breakfast was decent - nothing phenomenal but ample for a quick bite before a day out and about, and I would recommend going out for lunch or dinner unless you're stuck there - the food didn't look terribly appetizing.Free internet on three computers in the lobby, an exercise facility, etc. make for an all around decent place to stay while in downtown Indy.","My daughter and I stayed here for a girl scout trip to see the childrens museum.The hotel was clean (i inspected for bugs), very spacious, rooms were very nicely furnished, shower water was great.It was quiet at night when we were there.The breakfast area is insanely crowded.  They could improve this by adding extra tables and chairs to the living room area of the lobby to accomodate all the guests wanting to eat breakfast.Our girl scout rate was $89.00 per night, we had to pay an additional $10.00 to park in the garage next door.I definately would stay here again !!Clean and smoke free. I did not have any issues. The best part was the customer service. They were so helpful in helping me find information regarding getting to where I needed and they assisted in printing out my plane ticket!!! I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice and affordable hotel to stay at.",,,,"['place', 'clean', 'good', 'option', 'first', 'night', 'sierra', 'sorry', 'misspelled', 'pleasant',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-indianapolis-dwtn-union-stn-indianapolis,Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Dwtn-Union Stn,3.0,$$,61,"Beautiful lobby, room was clean and comfortable.Hotel staff was super !!  I had forgotten my hair spray, the night staff went above and beyond to find me some!!Thank you!!!!The landings restaurant had wonderful food and our breakfast waitress was fantastic.Highly recommend this hotel as it is only minutes from the convention center and hundreds less than those right downtownA group of 6, we stayed in town for the Indy/Saints game.  Last year we stayed at the JW and were disappointed so looked around for something close.  Not only is it close, there's a tunnel and a skyway to the stadium!Anyway, the hotel is a beautiful mix of the past and the modern.  It is a real tribute to the building having once been Union Station and on the National Historic Register. It is truly hard to overstate the charm of this hotel, or its unique qualities.  Being from New Orleans, we do have a sense of history and felt right at home.Anyway, gushing about the building some more... Trains actually travel through the hotel (and you can just hear it a little bit and it's not all the time by any means).Common spaces are comfortable, plush and yet show off the roots of the building as a train station:  structural steel abounds, and there are numerous statues of conductors, footmen, stokers and such throughout the hotel.As well, several of the famous Pullman cars are set up in the hotel (see photos) as rooms.  They're very cool looking but a bit smallish, so we had regular king rooms.  The rooms are well appointed, the decor is nice and there is coffee and so on.  Surprisingly though, there were no room safes.  C'est la vie.The staff are super nice in a way that makes you glad to be there.  Everybody.  No exceptions.Okay, to the restaurant.  We went for breakfast on Saturday morning and it was busy but speedy and the service efficient and friendly.  Had the buffet, which was pretty good when compared to most other hotels. A bit better than most I'd say as far as variety; usually hotel buffets kind of suck.  Not this one.Went back for breakfast on Sunday (game day- noon kickoff) and they were just packed and hammered with guests.  Really they had available seating but were short-staffed and so the bar gang threw in and was working the buffet.Yes, I'm patting myself on the back here, but as a 40+ year foodservice guy, I sort of stood there and helped coordinate the people working the buffet. It's been a while since I've gotten to poke my head through the kitchen door and say things like, ""down to a half pan of bacon, and somebody needs to prep some melons too"".  The manager was cool with it since I wasn't griping but trying to anticipate runouts.  So it was fun and I spent about 15 minutes doing that.  But props to the crew, they got things back up to snuff by running their butts off and so I sat down and had a nice breakfast with my group.  Everyone, by the way, including the guests, was very upbeat and so it wasn't an unpleasant experience.  This hotel is also near all kinds of cools stuff:  great restaurants, a nice mall, and other stuff.  Most of this is connected by skyway and makes getting around town easy. Definitely going to stay again.I am writing this from the perspective of hosting a meeting at this venue.I plan meetings professionally around the world and when hosting here in Indianapolis, I LOVE working with the Crowne Plaza. Jessica &amp; JJ particularly keep me coming back. The Grand Hall is absolutely beautiful- our CEO even made a comment that it was one of the coolest venues at which we've done one of our large internal meetings.Their in-house Markey's manager is great, the food is great, the value is great- I could go on. Thank you Jessica, JJ, &amp; team!Super cool hotel. You can reserve a train room, extra special. We were given a room initially that had ppl already in it. They moved us to another  room that had a clogged bathtub drain. Gross. They made up and comped the stay. The train arrives from Chicago at midnight. You hear and feel the arrival. It's kinda cool if you are into that sort of thing. We are going back in the spring. And we are taking the train.This is a wonderful hotel! Such a great experience during our vacation.A couple of friends decided to book a room here for our birthdays so we would be within walking distance of the local bars. I think the price of $200 was fair because of the location. The fact that valet was full and we had to pay $49 to park was ridiculous. The guy that checked us in could've been more friendly, maybe he was having a bad day. Room was nice and clean. I wouldn't recommend staying on the first floor, it tends to be a little loud at times, especially when there's a teenage cheer competition going on. I will not be returning to the Crowne Plaza.They get an extra star for having trains for rooms. Hands-down...Super cool. The train driving through the building in the middle of the night was actually really cool, too, we loved it. Otherwise, this would have been a three star review.For a ""higher end"" hotel, they struggled. We checked in and were given our room key. Walk to the room, enter, and there are guests already in the room!! (WTF?) We go back to the desk and Mr. Clerk is like ""no big deal"" about it. Never even apologized. (Can you imagine the shock of the people who we barged in on???  Thank God they weren't in an awkward situation!)As for our (second) room:  One trash can? A dangerous coffee maker. Very creaky beds. But, the most unforgivable for me was the shower that did not drain. Ewwwww. Which the maid clearly knew about because the stopper was half in/half out. To be fair, my friend is a platinum guest at this chain, and the manager refunded us the night.I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Downtown Indianapolis a few times for various conferences.  The location, comfort, and cleanliness of this hotel is great! I also love that when it is cold you can walk through indoor paths to get to Circle Centre Mall and other downtown favorites! My only warning to people planning on staying here, it is an active train station.  I  woke up a few times throughout the night as a train would be passing through.  On the other hand, my co-worker who I often travel with was not bothered by the noise.  If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider staying somewhere else.Was here for a conference. Cool ambience as this is a renovated train station (with trains still going through and causing some rumbles). Good food during conference. Rooms were clean.I'm here for the FDIC show. I'll start with the positive. It's really close to the convention center and connected via skywalk. Also kudos to them for having a ton of outlets available to charge laptops and phones. Ok, done with positive stuff. This place is $300 per night during the FDIC show. Also known as extortion. The wifi is slow and finicky on my mac (sometimes requires restarting, at one point would not work at all), and there are no wired connections. Walls are paper thin, I could hear a pin drop in the next room. That is, assuming that the trains aren't going by and shaking the entire building. The wall switch does nothing, so I walk into a dark room and fumble around for a lamp. The local tap water has a bad taste. The rooms have little natural light, and in many rooms people walking the halls can see right into your room if you don't keep the light blocking curtains closed. Beds are very firm with a thin blanket.  New and clean bedding, but not warm or comfortable.The bar/restaurant area strikes me as dated and overpriced. All I want for breakfast is a cup of coffee and bowl of cereal. And at hotels for less than half of this price, you get it for free. Not here.The rooms appear to be nicely renovated at some point in the last few years, but at this price the overall thin walled construction and poor amenities are unforgivable. (oh look, the building is shaking again due to trains) I'm sure they will do well with their captive convention audience, but I would avoid this place in the future. Other hotels that I have stayed in for this convention offer a better value. -------update-------Manager addressed the concerns that he was able to, I adjusted the rating up a notch. I was probably overly harsh here initially. To be fair, probably every hotel in the area jacks up rates during this show.I have stayed at SO many downtown hotels and somehow completely avoided this place. Not necessarily on purpose however.  Erich and I ""hotwired"" a hotel last weekend just for fun and we landed here for $79/night.  It was a great deal considering it was a home football weekend and this place is connected to the convention center.  What a cool, unique hotel with the ""quiet rumbles"" of trains rolling through the station.  It is clear this is a landmark like no other in Indy and the elevators and train station create an ambiance you can't get anywhere else in the city.  I felt a little claustrophobic in our room b/c there is no view of the outside -- our room faced the main lobby and the other set of rooms directly across from us.  They only earn 3 stars b/c the walls are PAPER and I mean, seriously thin.  I could hear everything going on next door, full conversations and at 6 AM, it was soooo loud, I about lost it.  No real relaxation there.  While they can't control their guests and the kids running the halls, a bit of insulation would be nice.  The trains WERE quieter than our neighbors and let's just say - the ""quiet rumble"" is a bit of an exaggeration.  It was a pretty loud and rambunctious roll through. Which is fine - we are in a train station but let's not butter it up on the website, marketing team.The rooms are on the smaller side, b/c of the age of the building, I assume, but it was comfortable.  I however missed the oversized comforters that I get at JW and Marriott. I love those down filled cozy beds and Crowne just has a heavy blanket.  So there was a touch of ""lower end"" in that regard.Check in was easy and the front desk staff along with the valets were wonderful.For $79/night I thought it was an awesome deal -- for more, I'm not sure I would stay here again.Take an old train staion, hotel, turn it into a hotel, and add in a few railroad cars into hotel rooms - inside the hotel, then finish it off by adding skywalk access to the convention center and Lucas Oil Stadium and you have a great place to stay in Indy. Factor in friendly and courteous staff, clean rooms and ample room supplies and you have 5 stars. The fitness room has 3 treadmills and a cable weight machine, a small business center, clean pool and on-site restaurant/bar compliment the experience.Downside:  The interior lay-out can present a challenge getting from point A to point BWe stayed in the Charlie Chaplin train car and our friends stayed in a regular room. The train car was double the price of the regular room but inside you couldn't tell the difference. The train car is way over priced. They used to have themed rooms but now all the rooms look the same. It's a nice hotel but over priced. I wouldn't stay there again or at least not pay extra for the train car room.We hosted a meeting at the Crowne Plaza for 35 of our volunteers. Everything was set as requested. There was continual support throughout the event. The food was amazing. The staff were available and quickly replied to any needs we had. They were personable and made the experience great for the facilitators as well as the attendees. Thank you!I have never been happier checking out of a hotel than I was the morning leaving this dump.  Don't confuse this for even the worst Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in the country.The people here could not care less how rude they are to you, and they have no systems in place, at all, to take care of the simplest things like service breakfast or getting a package, or fixing their internet.  The Internet tech said the wireless wasn't working because I had somehow connected to a router on the 7th floor.....there are only 2 floors.  The manager was apologetic and said she would reduce my rate from $229 to $179....that never happened, so I went to the front desk to explain and the girl would probably still be standing there staring at the computer and shrugging her shoulders had I not just walked away.  I called down at 10:30pm to see if a package had arrived and they said they would have to call me back, which they never did.  I went down in the morning to ask for it in person and the girl stared at me like I was asking for her firstborn.  I could tell it was going to take a while, so I nicely asked if she could get it and I would be back after I walked down to a real hotel to get breakfast...she scowled at me and rudely suggested that she was just making sure I didn't need anything else.  I was being nice, she was full of it.  Ironically I was there for a wastewater show....my toilet was backed up the whole stay and I asked them to fix it at 6:30am.  When I returned at 4:30, exhausted, just wanting to lie down, the room was being made up and the maid had to call down to get the toilet fixer guy to come up.  Breakfast....joke.  Please help by getting another hotel to move in here....do not stay here!  $229 plus tax is ridiculous for this dump.First and last time staying here. Worst check in policy I have come across ever. Staying here for a wedding party. I will continue to stay at the JW on my future trips to Indianapolis.If you decide to stay here and the lobby puts you on the first floor you are screwed. You can hear anyone's conversation that walks by your room.  For us we stayed right by the pool and 10 teenage girls went to the the pool at 9am &amp; woke up our whole room because they were so loud. I would not recommend staying here Bc of this reason.Very cool hotel - an old train stationed that's been transformed into a hotel. It even has a train inside the hotel that's been converted to bedrooms. However, my biggest problem is that my room walls were paper thin. I could easily hear conversations going on in the adjacent room.This is the creepiest hotel ever. The concept of rehabbing an old train station into a hotel sounded cool but staying here was a whole other trip. The statues are creepy as they placed right in front of your room. The first two nights, I had a pair of nuns and the front desk just around the corner from my room. After a leak in the HVAC, I was moved to a room near the pool, near other statues including a little girl standing on a beam above my head. Customer service here is mediocre. The front desk staff are constantly clueless and rude. The housekeeping staff only clean parts of your room while throwing away items that aren't trash (like my commuter mug!). The only bright side is the maintenance crew-- Richard, who came to assess the leak, gave me a dinner comp ($75 for two at the Pullman lounge) for the hassle. Lastly, I found myself feeling super hot every night due to the bedding. Other colleagues staying at the hotel felt the same way. Really odd.I dreaded my stay at this hotel. The concept of being at a train station is neat the first night but the train station and the rumbling of the trains definitely got old after the second night. I could not get a full night's rest staying at this hotel. You could definitely feel and hear the trains going by. I stayed here for a week for a work event and I wanted to go home so badly. Also the creepy white statues in the hallways were weird too.","Enjoyed a wedding and wedding reception at this unique venue. Nothing else like it in Indy. Love the atmosphere!I live in Indy, but a friend was having a bachelorette party, so a group of us decided to stay in a hotel, so we could have a good time. I've been to the Crowne Plaza before, for an even in the conference rooms. I am touched by the charm. I remember when Union Station re-opened, and they had all these ""historic"" statues all over the place, and there are still a few in the hotel lobby area. Unfortunately, Union Station is no longer open in the capacity that it was. There are trains in the hotel, where you can stay in rooms. I think this would be awesome for kids. They also have an indoor pool. The hotel does seem a bit dated, though. The rooms need an overall facelift. Very convenient location for our purposes, though. I have to say, we were sooooo loud. We did not get any kind of warning or have an altercation like the one mentioned below (that sounds like a totally horrendous experience). I thought the bed was comfortable, but it was firmer and some people may not like that. I thought the accomodations were kinda sparce-no microwave or fridge. Otherwise, excellent stay. Additional note: there is parking in the Pan Am Plaza garage(underground), which is literally right across the ally/drive of the Crown Plaza. It is a bit expensive, but only $20 for 24 hours. I mean, it is literally like a 5 minute tops walk from the hotel front door to your car.Beautiful hotel. Historic building. A dream location for train enthusiasts and those who are lulled to sleep by the rumble and screech of freight trains a few yards from your window. The website fails to mention this. But they make you sign something at checkin that basically says you know the trains will keep you awake all night and they aren't responsible or refunding anything based on that.Nice people equals four stars.  I had a crappy stay and management apologized, they bought me the beverage Platinum members get.  I think it's the duty of a reviewer to comment as such correcting the review.  Give the parking garage people hell for me regarding no elevator!I stayed here for two nights during a tech conference being held in the same hotel. I was very pleased. They are in the midst of renovations, so there was some noise and the pool was closed. However, those mere minor concerns and really didn't affect my stay.The room was clean and well appointed. I had everything I needed. There are even rail cars inside the hotel converted into guest rooms, a very unique feature. There are many restaurants and a shopping mall less than two blocks away and this part of Indy is very walkable. Lucas Oil stadium is right next door. The conference itself was held in a converted train station attached to the hotel--very elegant.Most importantly, the staff were fantastic. From the valet concierge who fetched us a luggage cart when we arrived to the maintenance worker who ran an extra power cord to our table at the conference, the staff, one and all, went out of their way for us.You can do a lot worse than to stay here.Fair statement: the building is very neat. They did a great job of renovating the train station into the hotel. A child would love to stay here.I had to sign a waiver upon check in that I was made aware of the fact it is located adjacent to a live railway. I woke up a couple of times a night to trains. I can't say I recommend it given the difficulty of sleep.Went for one night to enjoy a wedding at St Johns and a reception at the grand hall . I would say this was a terrific experience . The food was good (except the cake was a bit dry but I'm not sure it was their fault there ) when it comes to the reception and yes it looked well coordinated and well done with a great amount of effort . As for the hotel and its rooms I would say it wasn't bad either but it was a bit dirty and other than that I got nothing to complain . Overall a solid place all around . The icing on the cake ? The trains and clever statues inside .We came for a weekend and while the hotel is quite beautiful the noise level from the other rooms and lobby were loud, wait staff in the hotel restaurant rude. The valets seemed to be the only staff actually courteous and respectful often appearing to be the only ones with customer service trainingWe've been there twice - both in winter and summer. It is conveniently located downtown - and on a weekend - easy to find parking. There's valet parking; but you only need it for weekdays.My wife and I stayed with our 10 year old and 16 year old. We highly recommend the train cars. There are a few restored trains - where you sleep in a train car. The room was a decent size; and the kids loved the atmosphere. Unlike the people complaining about noise and the trains passing by, in the train car, we couldn't hear a thing. The decor in the hotel is set with white mannequin-like figures throughout. Really gives a neat atmosphere. The desk people were helpful. Easy walking distance to anything fun in downtown Indianapolis.Downsides: skip the restaurant; don't know why you'd go there anyway with such good choices not far away. Don't expect much from the pool. It is there; it is small; the kids used it briefly.I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel during the NCAA Regionals. I had booked the room in advanced and paid a good price considering the events that occurred during the weekend.After reading previous reviews, I made sure to request a room near the swimming pool. Best decision ever! I was never bothered by train noises during the entire stay. The bed was so comfy and the room offered the needed basics (note: room does not have a fridge or microwave).The hotel itself is very unique with some great charm. It's conveniently located to Lucas Oil Stadium and completely within walking distance to great restaurants/bars in downtown Indy. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. One evening I needed a cab and the staff offered a ride in the hotel car! Very considerate and I greatly appreciated the assistance.I truly enjoyed my stay and look forward to visiting Indy again and staying at the Crowne Plaza!I stayed here recently after a job interview. I gave this place 3 stars because I think it's a great place to stay for the price if you're wanting a spot in the downtown area. If you happen to be a train enthusiast then this is a place for you. Trains are rolling in and out of here all the time. At first I thought it was a small earthquake, but then remembered that it was a train station. After the first train it didn't really bother me. Also the beds were so-so and the furnishings were probably nice when they were first purchased, but have started to show their age.All in all this hotel seemed like a great bang for your buck if thats what you're looking for.The people were so friendly, and I commend them for this. However, we had a few issues at the hotel while I was here for a work conference. A group of employees got stuck on an elevator, no warning given on the trains coming through, a fire alarm going off with no indication of whether we should be evacuating. This hotel was a fun shtick with the train scenery, but it definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea. A few antiquated features could be updated, but the staff is great.I gave this hotel four stars, but 3.5 would probably be more appropriate. The rooms are nice, but a bit dated for what they cost. The beds are SUPER comfortable though. The restaurant is a bit small, but the food options are decent. I didn't get a chance to interact much with the staff, but they were friendly enough when I did. The hotel's best feature would be its location. It is very conveniently located (attached via skywalk) near the Indiana Convention Center and downtown Indianapolis. Also, very short walks to both Lucas Oil Stadium and the Bankers Life Fieldhouse.I LOVED this hotel!! I had a room that overlooked the pool &amp; it was gorgeous! Everything about the hotel was gorgeous!! I would DEFINITELY stay here again &amp; again...next time I am hoping to get the train room! They told us about the trains, but we never heard any of them. The room was super clean, the beds were comfy, &amp; the decor was modern &amp; fantastic!! It is within walking distance to everything!! If you come to Indy....STAY HERE!! Also the staff was incredible!! The manager that we had a check out was awesome &amp; super bubbly....valet had my car cranked &amp; at the front of the hotel when I was leaving....they even opened the door for me!! Couldn't ask for a better stay!! OH &amp; I almost forgot to mention.....I asked for a late check out &amp; that was no problem! &amp; FREE WIFI!!!!I would prefer to give this hotel zero stars but one is the minimum.  DO NOT stay here!  Let me just tell you about my joyful experience at this disaster of a hotel.  First, we get there and only one elevator is working for the entire facility and stairs are nowhere to be found.  The 80's decorations are disgusting but tolerable.  What is not tolerable is visiting the hell-hole of a restaurant only to be greeted by a blondish-green mullet of a lady that hasn't gotten laid since the mid 90's at a Josh Groban teen concert.  When I made eye contact to request some service I thought she was going to shoot me or poison my food.  She did bring our waters within the first 30 minutes so maybe I should be thankful.  When I ordered my entree she gave me a look of disgust and rolled her eyes.  The food was as miserable as our waitresses attitude.  I looked forward to falling asleep to quickly put this memory in the past only to make it to the room where I was greeted with some pillows that are the size of the square pillows you commonly find on a couch.  They were as thick as they were wide which gave me some neck spasms that I wasn't expecting the day before my half-marathon.  The icing on the cake was when the trains rolled through every hour or so which woke me up thinking an earthquake had just occurred.  The hotel staff in general tried their best to be helpful......Great idea....let's turn an old functioning train station into a hotel.  Way to go Crowne Plaza!  You really nailed that one!  Back to Hilton for Eddie C.The best part of the stay was once we checked out and I saw the hotel in my rear-view mirror........A very family friendly hotel that has been recently remodeled. Stayed in a train car room and my 10 and 7 year old boys loved it.  Staff was all very friendly. Only complaint would be the Pullman Lounge and Restaurant service wasn't very friendly and definitely wasn't speedy. We would definitely stay here again!I stayed in a recently remodeled hotel room which was very nice. I am also a hotel member so I got some drink coupons always nice near heard the train. The place is great location is wonderful and its the oldest train station in the us... You can soon stay in new train cars... Yes, it's under construction right now but will all be so nice soon. The bar and restaurant were great. Thank you had a great stay..My boyfriend and I recently stayed in this hotel following the 2008 Drum Corps International World Finals. We managed to get upgraded to one of the traincar rooms and it was absolutely beautiful. The first night we stayed in a regular room which did not have a minifridge or flat-panel TV like the traincar room. Small but adequate workout facility. The pool is located on the main level and is out in the open, which I thought was a bit strange. The trains rumbling by are a bit unnerving at first but during our 3-day stay I eventually grew accustomed to this occurrence. The staff here was very friendly and accommodating whenever we needed directions or a suggestion on where to order pizza. The hotel is located right next to Indy's downtown area and was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. Budget for parking ahead of time since it is not included in the hotel price; parking in the ramp next to the hotel was $20/night.""WOW !! Do you want to sleep at nite ?? DO NOT STAY HERE !!! The train station is located behind the hotel. It is loud and vibrating day and nite !!! Looks nice but BEWARE trying to sleep !! Would NEVER stay here again!""The hotel is super cute. I stayed here about a year ago while I was in Indy for a week. Parking is expensive, especially when you include tips. However they do have a shuttle service that took me to my office everyday. You can hear trains going through. It was clean and a decent price.(not including parking)","This hotel has a lot of character, complete with white mannequins as decoration (kinda creepy) and an active train station that can be noisy depending where your room is.  Indianapolis is a convention city, and it seems like every time I'm at this hotel, there's a convention going on and the hotel is booked solid... which equates to a lot of activity and noise -- more in the common areas than near rooms, though.  It wouldn't be my first choice of hotel in downtown Indy, but I would stay there again.My in-laws stayed here during DCI weekend, and I also attended the Hall of Fame Induction/Kick Off party at the attached convention center.  The staff at the party was very attentive to the guests.  The hotel room seemed pretty standard for a downtown area, though to a point, I think the place could use some freshening up.  I also hate that the only way you can get in and out privileges on parking is using hotel valet.  My in-laws were interested, but they were full!  They had to get on a waiting list.  They should be working something out with the city for parking validation or something if their options aren't available to appease all guests.Bonus points for location - great restaurants and bars surround the area, and it's a quick walk to Lucas Oil Stadium.I was here for a conference, not as a guest. So let's start out by saying that Heather L's description is dead-on. The hotel is at Union Station, so everything is based on a train theme, beaten to death, revived, then beaten to death again over and over just for fun. As a hotel, that might be fun, but as a convention center, OMFG it just plain sucks. Here's why.Because this is basically a converted train depot, the space is small and not designed for what it is. Conventions are NOT meant to be held here, but are forced to be anyway... the result? Booths that are tiny (8x8 vs. the standard 10x10)... booths spread out literally all over the complex, in the hotel and throughout the adjoining ""grand hall and convention center"" which spans two blocks and two floors, so confusing that even a map won't help you find what you need... stairs interrupting everything... old elevator shafts in bizarre places... poor signage.... cramped space outside for drop-off/pickup/valet.The train theme might make for an interesting hotel stay, but it's a convention nightmare.Got a pretty good nightly rate using Priceline for a last minute business trip to Indianapolis.  Overall the hotel was worth the rate that I got, but definitely not worth the rate published on their own website.  The room was a bit dated and from what I could see none of the rooms have an exterior window.  The hotel is built inside an old train station.  There also looks to be some rooms that are actually built inside of old train cars which is pretty cool.  My personal opinion, they can made this place really cool by going with a more modern loft style interior instead of whats in there now, but obviously this was converted several years ago hence the dated look.  And whats with all of the tacky ghost statues of former train passengers and staff?My room was clean but I was placed in a room with an adjoining door to the room next door that had some loud inconsiderate guests.  I could hear the door slam as they kept going in and out at midnight.  Also the Amtrack trains still run some where very close to the hotel as I could feel the room shake and hear a hum as the trains passed by.  Initially I thought it was a small earthquake.  I guess I should have realized that something was up when I saw the little amenity pack in the room that included ear plugs. For the cheap price I got on the room, I guess I really can't complain.My one other gripe was the price of the breakfast buffet.  $15 for a buffet is a bit high for a hotel of this caliber.  And its not like the buffet was spectacular.  It was just your normal breakfast fare; the waitstaff service was good though.We stayed here for five nights while in town for DCI. It was perfect because it is so close to Lucas Oil Stadium. The staff was super friendly and always helpful. They always had good suggestions for food. We stayed on the first floor and felt none of the train vibrations that people talk about. Next year when it is DCI time again I will stay here but get one of the train car rooms.The reason I did not give it five stars because we went to the hotel bar one night to get some food and it took us 45 mins to get a sandwich to go.Just as others said, this hotel is a nice historical site smack in the middle of a train station. This is both a good and a bad thing. The Good: It gives the hotel character and apparently you can even stay in an old train car as your room. The Bad: The vibrations of the train are VERY annoying. Luckily I slept through the train coming through at 1am but some of my co-workers were not as fortunate. However, I did have to experience it during our meeting because the speaker got drowned out every time a train went through. Other than that, the hotel was pretty good. They have free internet, which is always a plus. They also gave coupons at check-in: a free drink at the restaurant and 15% off for the restaurant or room service. The room was a good size, but I was disappointed not to have a window. However, I again agree with previous reviewers that this is not the best venue for a conference. The meeting rooms were small and they could not adequately control the temperature. We had two rooms next to each other; one of the rooms was freezing while the other was sweltering.I will never stay at this hotel again!  I had a horrible experience while in town for a bachelorette party, that happened to coincide with the Summer Celebration/Black Expo weekend. Hotel staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. Manager knew she made a mistake and refused to apologize or correct the mistake- couldn't look me in the eye-a tell tale sign of lying! Staff was disrespectful to our party. I will never stay at this hotel again! I've never been more dissatisfied with a hotel!! Choose another one of the many hotels downtown Indianapolis!To be fair I am writing a review for a stay I had here a year ago...but the experience and follow up of the IHG corporate and the hotel were so disappointing that it still stings to this day.The hotel has potential but is laid out such that the rooms are very disconnected from the lobby area and the feel is kind of creepy.I stayed in a train car thinking that would be a neat experience.  It was small and the novelty wore off pretty quickly.  Hard to have privacy with the blinds not covering the windows well and people walking by.I was staying to attend a reunion which had a couple of guests who drank a little too much.  Instead of handling the problem like a professional business, the staff overreacted, shut down the event, and called in the cops to patrol all night.  The whole experience ruined it for the rest of us and the hotel staff could have cared less.  I expressed my displeasure to the manager by e-mail to get no response, I then contacted corporate and finally got a dismissive letter...after about 4 back and forths...instead of a simple apology...I got a pompus, arrogant response from the manager and from the corporate office.  For a hotel who is in the customer service business this one has failed miserably both at the local level and at the corporate level.  I would recommend staying at a Hilton property or Marriott as they know how to treat their guests and when there is a problem know how to deal with it and not treat their guests like second class citizens.Pass on this place. My company had 10 rooms here for trade show. Everyone complained. It's noisy with trains running through building, frayed grey towels, uncomfortable beds, Very worn and dirty rooms. Light bulbs out in guest room. Lobby restroom smelled like sewage. When I left the bellman called me a green and yellow cab and he got a cut of cab fare.This place is very dirty and worn..Nice hotel, nice staff.  The trains are too noisy though.  Would have preferred to have one of the rooms that was in the train car and perhaps it would have been more quiet.I will never stay at another Crowne Plaza again.  They should definitely give you ear plugs on your pillow at this location. There is a train that is under the building that goes by several times a day and night.  The hotel lied to us and told us that we would be getting a discount on the conference rooms, if we brought our conference attendees to their hotel to stay.  Well we did and they then turned around and charged us a lot to use the conference rooms, which had no water, no service other than getting the tables and chairs to the room for us to set up. We had another meeting set up near the airport and we went tot the Crowne Plaza out there and the service was so horrible! I couldn't believe, one of our attendees went around taking orders for all the tables because they were so understaffed.  The 3 people they had working couldn't do any of the things that they restaurant offered. One couldn't count change and couldn't even bring back the correct dollar amount so we could count the change out correctly.  The manager was trying to make coffee drinks but was obviously not trained in any of it. Just a really bad experience with this company and I will never use them and have already let my corporate accounts know not to use them.just stayed here wed, thur and fri night.i was there for business and thus wanted to get a good night's sleepi did not want to have a place crash after partying at bars within walking distancethe walls are so think you can hear conversations going on in rooms 2 doors down.2 of the three nights it was so loud even at midnight: random people walking down the halls on their cell phone, loudlyteenagers running down the halls stomping their feetsome frat boys coming in at 4am drunk from somewhere in the room next to me.good if you want to party and don't care about getting a good night sleepbad for everything elsei would never recommend this place to anyoneStayed here for a long weekend in April.  The hotel is very clean and the staff was Very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  We stayed in a train car room one night (yes, a real train car) and a regular 2-double-bed room the other nights.  The train car was fun but is fairly small.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey.  We paid $229 per night with a AAA discount but that could be because it was NCAA final four weekend and the Women's NCAA teams were staying in the hotel.This place is a fine place to stay if you understand that you are staying in an active train station and your room will shake a couple times a day from trains.  The pullman car rooms are adorable, but very small and narrow.  The front desk and bell desk staff was beyond sweet and helpful.  Wonderful customer service.Upgraded to a train car room for our anniversary stay. Furniture was worn, but the ambience was excellent!  A fun experience hotel stay!We got a deal on this room thru Priceline at the last minute. The price for the room was definitely a deal compared to what I heard the employee quote to someone on the phone upon check-in, but it is important to know that you have an additional $20-30 fee for parking, depending on if you self-park or use valet. Other reviews complained that the train theme was overdone or the statues were creepy, but I didn't feel that way at all. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and found the place to be exceptionally quiet, especially for a downtown of a major city. I did feel a slight rumbling a couple times from the nearby active tracks, but it wasn't enough to make my stay unpleasant, and I didn't wake up from it at all. The room itself was a bit dated, and could use an upgrade, but it was clean, quiet, and I got a pretty good night's rest. Our window overlooked the pool and I was worried about the noise, but promptly at the pool's closing time it cleared out and was no problem. I wouldn't mind staying here again of I got another priceline deal, but there are probably cheaper places comparable in accommodations.I had my wedding here, as a wedding venue it was incredible. The Grand Hall is breathtaking as is the bar. The event went off flawlessly; Megan and Katie were incredibly accommodating throughout the entire year long process, they even added rooms to our block the week of the wedding. Chef Randy made a wonderful meal and incorporated many off of menu requests (creme catalana, spatzel). The sommelier was very knowledgeable and made the tasting experience educational, while also mixing cocktails to our specifications. The waitstaff was incredibly coordinated and we did not have any issues with timing of courses and the large number of tables to be served at once.  as a wedding venue i would give it a five, as hotel i would give it a two. I personally think the ghost sculpture are strange and ugly. The pool is not in its own enclosed area and creates a dampness for the entire atrium.  We were in one of the club rooms and it i believe right up against the train tracks. I wasn't sleeping anyway (it was the night immediate before and of my wedding) but the low rumbling of the train was annoying.Try the Pullman Burger in the bar....It is just wonderful! The ghost statues are a little freaky. But all in all it is a nice place to stay.Our stay at Union Station was about as good as it gets.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The meals eaten there were good.  We were attending a convention at the Indiana Convention Center, and had a room on the second floor.  We simply walked out our room, down the hall a bit and over the skyway to the Convention Center.  How convenient is that?  No shuttles, no cabs.  I took some advice years ago and always leave a $3 tip for housekeeping with a note of thanks.  Biggest Bang for the Buck I know how to do.  Housekeeping gets the least thanks of any of the Hotel's service staff.  My room is always extra neat and clean, with plenty of amenities, and the staff wears big smiles.  I imagine they keep an extra eye out for my stuff too.  Our stay was during a big convention, and so we paid big bucks for the room.  The parking is $25 a day valet parking (come and go as many times as you like) or down the block to a public facility for $20 a day.  I would give them 5 stars for their service and facilities, but only 3 for value, so overall I am giving them a 4 star rating.Great building full of amazing history. The layout is a little confusing for conferences - we had a hard time figuring it out and explaining where everything was to the attendees - could use a little more signage or a printed layout. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Great location in downtown Indianapolis - very close to everything.","Let me begin my reminding everyone that I originally hail from Wisconsin.  As in: Wisconsin, home of The Gobbler, a motel &amp; supper club that (when viewed from the air) looked like a turkey.  Built sometime in the late 60's or early 70's, The Gobbler embraced the key-party generation and offered such treats as blue, red, and purple shag carpeting, ""passion pits,"" and 8-tracks (but only in the business suites).  The Gobbler, and its demise, have been well documented online, so I'll go no further in the description.  Suffice it to say, though, I've been raised with a natural appreciation for unorthodox theme establishments.Still, it took me a minute to adjust to the Crowne Plaza in Indy.  They have a train theme and, by golly, they are stickin' with it.  I attended a conference here recently, and when I booked my room, I learned that the hotel sits in America's first Union Station.  And that they boast 26 Pullman train car sleeping rooms.   And that the hotel is decorated throughout with white fiberglass statues depicting rail passengers of the early 20th century.  These statues are dubbed, ""ghost travelers.""  Yes, I did my research.But, as is my practice, the research was half-assed, for I somehow missed the fact that this is still an active railroad station, and freight trains go a-chuggin' through at all times of the day and night.  As my brochure explained it, ""the muffled rumbling and subtle vibrations of the trains...enhances the ambiance of staying in our hotel, where you can experience the authenticity of a living railroad station.""  OK, but the first time I heard those subtle vibrations I thought someone was wheeling a huge dumpster right outside my room.  Not my kind of ambiance.After a few eye-rolls and ""I can't believe this"" head shakes, I flipped my bitch switch to the ""OFF"" position.  The hotel was pretty nice, after all.  There were friendly staff who upgraded me at check-in, even at the government rate, to a suite in the gated portion of the hotel (the rest of you should have worked a little harder, I guess).  There were nice conference rooms.  There was tasty hazelnut-flavored Seattle's Best Coffee with the continental breakfast (which almost made up for the Folger's bullshit in my room).  And there was even a sleep kit containing an eye mask, ear plugs, and a ""Sleep Advantage"" CD.  Unfortunately, the disc's constant ""Whoosh,Whoosh, Whoosh"" sounds, coupled with the unfamiliar male voice telling me to ""relax [insert name of body part here], coupled with my neighbor playing his CD at full volume, kept me awake far longer than if I've just tried the sleep thing unassisted.Still, this place gets high marks for effort and for its commitment to the theme.  If the Gobbler had shown the same level of committment, it may still be with us today.",,"['beautiful', 'lobby', 'room', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'hotel', 'staff', 'super', 'forgotten', 'hair',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-indianapolis-at-the-capitol-indianapolis,Courtyard Indianapolis at the Capitol,3.5,$$,23,"Always love Courtyard. This location was very clean and had a modern feel to it as well. Comfortable bed, and the room had plenty of amenities.I suggest getting the Ginger snap at the bar for a night cap. Did me right!I agree with some of the reviews below. This place is ok. I travel a lot for business and choose courtyards because of the complimentary breakfast and free parking. Well this place has neither. The location is about 5min from the mall and monuments. For $210 dollars a night (including tax, room fee, Parking) I would recommend checking out other locations. On a positive note, staff is great and friendly.This is one of the better Courtyards I've stayed in. The location is great for business travelers to Downtown Indy - depending on the weather, you can walk to the University, the Capitol, the convention center or the mall. There's a ""limited"" restaurant on site but I don't know why anyone would choose to eat at a hotel when there are lots of restaurants within a short walk. Rooms appear somewhat recently refreshed - I got upgraded (Marriott Elite, holla!) and my room was absolutely huge. Be aware that the front of the hotel comes with great city views but also a fair amount of road noise. It's pretty quiet at night though. My room was very clean and I had two solid nights of sleep.In terms of amenities, they've got a small pool, a fitness room and a business center. The restaurant is only open for breakfast (not free) and dinner/drinks (5-10pm I think). The staff I encountered was really friendly and helpful. I'd absolutely stay here again.Frequent guest going on 10 years. They have updated the place - it was needed. But they also raised the price of parking. No free breakfast or cookies like they used to have. There is help yourself free coffee in the lobby. Lobby area is nicely set up for working. How do I always get a night stomper above me? I always ask to get onto a higher floor but they book up quite a bit. Small work out room but newer equipment. Very nice help at the front desk. We love Jason!Place is ok. Internet is terrible. Here's my result for the enhanced ""fast"" internet that you pay for.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fmy-result%2Fi%2F1396182576&amp;s=0afd5d440c60d85fb4294390c8ecd1a9f9929b45ebda8e50efaf88b0a2fd2ba5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/my-result/...</a>If you need fast Internet to work, don't stay here. Otherwise the location and the rooms are good.Located in the middle of Indianapolis this is an ideal location for people visiting the University or downtown area. Staff is classic Midwestern friendly and it's one of the newer courtyards that is clearly made for the business traveler. The on-site restaurant is helpful but has distinct hours, so be sure to pay attention to that or you'll miss breakfast like I did my last day!My room was clean and nice, beds were fantastic, but I was woken up at 8:00 am by the housekeeping staff asking if I wanted my room cleaned eventhough my privacy lock was on the door. I figured they would go away but they didn't so I had to wake up and walk to the door and answer it and then was already awake. I was looking forward to an extra hour of sleep!The only other down side is that the hotel is located in the middle of a few busy streets. I happened to be on the side of the building facing the busiest street and was awoken at least once by sirens. The hotel apologized and threw some Marriott points my way.I will liekly stay here again as the price is reasonable and the location is great for me.I gotta say, I'm a little underwhelmed. The check-in service was medium and there appeared to be no one running the cafe across the room. The pool was also small, and the gym only had 3 machines. It looked pretty cramped so I opted to skip my workout for the 2 nights we were staying. The room was nice at a glance, but not very functional. The shower was broken the first night and the microwave only popped a fourth of the popcorn bag. The minifridge also froze my soup and it appears that there's no way to change the temperature. The queen bed was very comfortable but again, a little cramped in the room. The pullout couch was atrocious. The mattress sagged in the middle and I could feel the springs. There were also no extra sheets the first night, just a thin blanket I found in the closet. Finally, there was no way to look at the bar menu from the room, nor a listing of popular sights and attractions. Over all, not the best hotel I've been to by far.Just ok, not as nice as the Westin , but cost a lot more.  The room had a strange smell to it and the air kept coming on in 40 degree weather.  Stains all over the carpet. Gross!!!!One more thing....the internet is HORRIBLE.  Very slow, and viewing photos on any site is impossible.I think I got my room on Priceline for around $75 incl taxes, and really couldn't have found a better place for the price.  This is a recently renovated property on the perimeter of the downtown core, within easy walking distance to Circle Center and other attractions.  The lobby is attractive (for a Courtyard) and my room was very comfortable.Parking was steep at $20/night, but I was here on a Saturday evening so I chose to park at the meters outside the hotel instead, which worked out just fine.I injured myself and the staff was so helpful in accommodating my needs. Everyone was nice - from the housekeeping staff to the maintenance to the staff at the cafe. Good location. The canal is across the street. Grocery store a block north. Easy walk to conference center and mall.The Courtyard Marriott is a discount hotel that exceeded my expectations in all areas but one.  The rooms were clean, the layout perfect for a business traveller with lots of conveniently located power plugs, a 24-hour gym, and a nice desk.  All staff (from the front desk to the housekeeping staff) were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Despite this exceptional experience, the one downside of this hotel is the lack of a reliable full service restaurant.  A cafe serves in its place with a limited but decent selection. My first night I was served by a very professional and prompt staff member.  Unfortunately, my second night I was not as lucky.  Having ordered and told I would be called in my room when the order was ready, I went down to the cafe 35 mins later only to wait 10 mins to be told my order not only wasn't started, that they wouldn't get to me for another 30-40 minutes.The front desk was very helpful in finding me delivery alternatives and I was able to locate a great Chinese restaurant that delivered to the hotel (Nasia).  When I'm away travelling, there are times I just would rather work away at the hotel and not have to fuss about finding something to eat.  Because of this, despite everything else that was great about my experience here, I will most likely not come back again.  For those of you who don't care about easy access to food, I would heartily recommend this hotel for you.Nice property in town that is close enough to the nightlife but isn't stuck in the middle of the crowds. Rooms are clean, spacious, and parking is available at the property without the fuss that yogurt from the more central downtown hotels. Also a good short walk to the canal and river walk.Nice place, got a cheap rate for a great room!We booked this room for a single overnight stay in Indianapolis, and paid just over $100 after taxes and fees.  Not bad for a downtown room!The room was fairly basic, which is exactly what I expect for the amount paid.  However, it was very clean and everything was in working order.  The WiFi had a nice strong signal and worked flawlessly.  We had a corner room overlooking downtown, and it was a nice stay overall.  Also, this would be a great place to stay if you are in town for a Colts game, as Lucas Oil Stadium is a few short blocks down the road.  Also the hotel had a decent looking indoor pool and an exercise facility, although we did not get a chance to use either.The only downside is that you have to pay $20 to park in the lot.... so in reality you might as well go ahead and tack that on to the price of the room.  Still not too bad for a downtown Indianapolis room though.  A great experience overall, if we are ever in town again I plan to look this place back up.  Good hotels at a reasonable price can be tough to find, and this one is a gem.Note: because I got booted from staying here (per my reservation) I didn't actually get to stay in this hotel. The 1 star is for the following experience...Hi Annie,I'm sorry to report I had a horrible experience with your hotel this past week.  I was scheduled to stay for 1 night, Monday May 6th and am a Gold Rewards member.  I had a long day of travel, and an extremely important day of executive interviews on Tuesday, and arrived only to be told they were overbooked and had to put me somewhere else for the night.  They were nice kids, and definitely apologetic for the inconvenience, but didn't buy their explanation at all, i.e. that they had to let current guests extend their stay or else it was a legal liability for Courtyard.  ???  That doesn't make any sense to me; if that were the case, the reservation system for any/all hotels would be moot.In any case, they explained that they booked me in an even better place, with a 2 bedroom suite.  (not that I needed it, it was just me, but they were trying to make me feel better.)  I asked about distance from the Courtyard since my first meeting was downtown in the morning, within walking distance.  She said the other place was ""downtown,"" only a short cab ride away, and was walking distance.  This was a total LIE.  I was put into the Candlewood Suites, on the outskirts of town, at least 2 miles away.  There's no way I would've been able to walk, with my suitcase, in heels, 2+ miles to my first interview.  In addition, the quality of this hotel was awful - it was a total dump, not at all what I paid for or comparable to the Courtyard by any stretch, in addition to not being the location I actually reserved my hotel downtown.  To top it all off, the iron in my room wasn't working.  When I called the front desk, they said they didn't have any spare ones.  I asked if they could get one from another guest room, and they said to come down in 15 min and ""maybe"" they would have one.  I was increasingly overwhelmed at my impending interviews and frustrated at the Courtyard for putting me in such a horrible situation. Finally, the next morning when I was packing my stuff back up - had to leave early because I needed to get a cab now that I was so far away - and my hairdryer didn't work.  !!!  I have long hair and could not show up for my executive interviews with wet hair.  I almost started crying, this hotel fiasco just couldn't have gotten worse... but yet it kept getting worse.  They didn't have ANY extras, explained that they only had ones connected to the wall, and had no proposed solution.  I asked if I could utilize an open room because I needed to dry my hair.  They finally agreed to that, so after packing up all my stuff and getting ready had to rush into another hotel room to utilize a working hair dryer.  When I got into the cab and arrived at my IV - 5 min late due to the hotel's lack of working equipment - I was completely frazzled and sweaty.  None of this would've happened if Marriott had honored my existing reservation and not forced me to stay at a much lesser, non-Marriott property.  Completely unacceptable.This whole scenario has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth for Marriott brands.  They offered me some points, but didn't make up for the nightmare I had to deal with in an already stressful situation.  The last thing I needed to worry about was my hotel or working amenities - I needed to be prepping for my interviews and getting a good night's rest.  But due to the lack of responsibility and honoring my reservation [as a Gold Rewards member] I had additional stress added to my plate.I wanted to express my deepest disappointment; it is unlikely I will continue to stay at Marriott hotels if I can help it.Excellent facility.  Staff friendly and professional, very helpful. Lovely, spacious, clean rooms. The Bristro has good food and great wait staff. Have been here for 4 days and returning next week.Great staff! Jason the manager needs to stay in a customer service roll. Without being cheesy he genuinely made me feel welcome and went out of his way to help. The bar/cafe in the lobby is excellent. Only place I'll stay, especially for the price.Loved the location! Quiet... but in the city.Courtyards always pass my 4-must-haves.Friendly, shower power, comfy bed, good wireless.The good breakfast kicks them up a notch above normal.I'm a big fan of Courtyards.  This is a good one too.  They offer good upper medium level of service with clean comfy rooms, friendly staff, and FREE internet which is a rarity at this level.  Our room had a few maintenance issues, but all in all was very nice and the staff was friendly and helpful.This hotel was excellent.  Stayed here this weekend for Mothers Day and could not be more satisfied.  The location to Circle Center is awesome as would be for anyone catching a convention, Pacers, or Colts game.  All are walkable.We had a kingroom with a pullout sleeper sofa although we didn't need that much space. The room was in really good condition and clean.  Bathroom was large as well as very clean.Hotel does have a hot tub and pool (not used by me) and does seem to have some good meeting space as well (not used by me)They have a shared lot with other hotels and you use your room key to get into and out of the parking lot.  Lots of room.The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. I'm going to try and book a room for a Colts game there this fall.A rare disappointment for me among marriott hotels.  I stayed here off and on for a week at a time (with a total of about 7 times) from 2007 - 2009 and by my last visit, swore I'd never come back.The hotel is in severe need of updating throughout.  The rooms have an overall dirty feel to them, the furniture is not comfortable in the room (except for the newer beds), and their ""upgraded"" rooms (small junior suites with a fridge) are right across from the noisy elevators and ice machines.I somewhat think that marriott isn't putting any $$ into this hotel with the new set of hotels that opened down the street....which is unfortunately because this is a good central location, close to the IUPUI's campus and the capitol.After other Marriotts in town opened up, I haven't looked back on this hotel.","We came on a weekend with no plan and were lucky to have found an online deal for this hotel.  The location is great and has access to the canal and driving to the other districts.  It's also walking distance to Lucas Oil Field.  The hotel seems to be newer, and the lobby is very nice.  The room was clean, and well decorated, with a couch as well, always a nice feature.  The towels were not soft, the pillows were small and uncomfortable, and the water pressure in the sink was low.  However, these were minor complaints.  The fact that packing is $20 a night was unexpected and for the area, could be avoided.  The staff was very nice.  The young man who ran the afternoon shift at the snack bar was excellent, friendly and on top of things.  All in all I would stay here again.don't repeat this, it's a Great place to have Breakfast during the Mini Marathon &amp; then go watch the runners throw up LOLthe place is clean &amp; the staff is friendlyOK!  Even the best have an off moment.  After being made aware of my problems, the management of the hotel contacted me.  I am confident that any issues are corrected, and that the property is run by professionals!",,,,"['always', 'love', 'courtyard', 'location', 'clean', 'modern', 'feel', 'well', 'comfortable', 'bed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-hotel-indianapolis,Embassy Suites Hotel,3.0,$$,23,"Kids, kids, kids, and more kids. The pool had about 60 kids in it. The water was not clear or even appealing. Customer service was average. Mostly, it's the perception of cleanliness. One elevator was out of service, there were piles of dirty linens in the hallways, stacks of supplies (they are remodeling), etc.Not one of our better hotel experiences.This place sucks, you can't use the WiFi and they close the bar at 11; 30 with 35 people in it wanting drinks.I will never come back. R vendors if it's free.My wife and I checked into this Embassy Suite Hotel to begin celebrating a fun filled weekend for our wedding anniversary.  We were greeted with enthusiasm as we arrived.  All hotel staff was great.  Our room was a different story.  The room seemed dirty.  I did not want to make a big deal out of it for my wife's sake.  Upon closer inspection, it was evident not much time was placed in preparing this room.Excessive dust everywhere, dried fluid on end tables, dirt and fingerprints on doors, smears on exit signs, dried fluid running down walls and living room furniture, stains and dust embedded in curtains, yellowed shower curtains, what appeared to be blood stains over mirror, no trash liners, and various colored hairs from various parts of the body on the bathroom ceiling.The bed was also broken.  My wife and I awoke realizing our heads were declining.  I ended up sleeping on the couch alone.This was a disappointing experience.  I expected more considering the $150 per night price.I am sure this was an isolated experience, but truly an unforgettable and uncomfortable one as well.Hmm... don't understand what the other reviewers are talking about. Did we stay at the same hotel?! When I was little, my family and I would come to this Embassy Suites as a weekend getaway, so maybe I have really fond, childhood memories? Nonetheless, I stayed here this past weekend and had a lot of fun.  Haven't stayed here in several years, but it seemed like it might have gotten a face lift fairly recently? The furniture in the suite seemed new - leather chairs, nice table, REALLY comfortable beds. I'm such a stickler for hotel beds, but I was super happy about Embassy's beds. Perfect combo of firm and soft. The pillows... I want to know where they get the pillows. So plush! I love the continental breakfast too. The made to order omelets are delish. Waaay better than your standard toast, cereal, yogurt breakfast that is typically in a hotel.  I also like the ambience of Embassy Suites. It's like a jungle in there! Tons of plants, a parrot... pretty fun. I don't always enjoy staying in hotels - usually they gross me out - but Embassy Suites is great and I really do love this location. When you're looking for spacious, nice rooms and a yummy breakfast and happy hour, this is it.The staff was very unprofessional.  Did not assist with requests for luggage carts upon arrival or departure.  Did not replenish towels as requested.  These are just a few of the things.  Don't do it!I have been having a rough streak with Hilton Properties but this hotel was absolutely fantastic.  From the moment you pull up, it is a beautiful property.  The staff was welcoming and extremely friendly and one of the best things, professional.  I didn't find them joking around, texting or on their cell phone, they were courteous and professional.  The room was clean, well layed out and extremely comfortable.  I think they gave me fresh, brand new towels as I have never felt towels so soft at a hotel.  One of the perks of this hotel is the manager's reception every evening and the free breakfast.  I never partake in the free breakfast but I do with the manager's reception.  The bar tenders, servers and everyone I have encountered at this hotel was very nice.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone in the area.  It can be a little more pricey than some other properties but it is well worth the price.  This has given me more hope that I just had a few bad experiences with certain Hilton properties and now can go back to enjoying my stays at Hiltons.The service was terrible!  The website advertises  a hot tub it didn't work Luke warm at best colder than pool! No towels and none after 20 minutes walked back to room dripping wet with no towel!  They did try to make it right but still disappointing they kept saying they'd fix the hot tub and never did.  They also never alerted other guests checking inPlease note: THIS IS 4-STARS FOR INDIANAPOLIS RATINGS.  If this were in another city, it would be a different story.  However, I have been greatly underwhelmed with every hotel where I've stayed in Indy (anywhere from 2-4 star hotels).  I have stayed here three times now.  The first time was a 4-5 star experience.  The second time was a two star, at best.  This last time was probably a three star.  Here's the deal though--if you're staying in Indy, stay here.  For the money, there is no doubt that this is absolutely the best value.  Drinks are included in the evening and a decent breakfast in the morning.  The gym is acceptable.  The room service is pretty good.  I've had problems with cleaning before (mildew in the shower, dried liquids in kitchenette, stains on covers).  I've experienced front desk staff who were curt and patronizing as well as some who were plesant and professional.  It is a good place to get away for the night on a budget.  Its a good place for extended business stays.  Its a PERFECT place to stay with your family.  Also, nearly every room has a balcony.  They're tiny, but great for just stepping out and getting fresh air.  BOTTOM LINE: I've liked this place enough to go three times and will likely return again.We stayed here this last weekend for 3 nights.  Embassy Suites are generally pretty decent, and this one was no exception.  The made to order omelet bar is a great thing to wake up to.  They also have a couple hours of free drinks each afternoon, and this include a couple really good tap beers and rail drinks.  Everyone that helped us during our stay was friendly.  Also, in the lobby they have a really cool looking parrot!  As far as the room goes, everything was clean, and the carpets seemed newer.  They could use some upgraded blankets, but that's minor.  I would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Indianapolis.This hotel room passed my cleanliness inspection.  The bed was alright, pretty cozy.  Room was well appointed and everything.  The dude who made my omelette in the morning did a really good job.I don't know if all Embassy Suites are like this, but I actually don't really like the layout of this hotel and how the hallways are all out in the open.  I think it makes for less privacy, personally.My experience was quiet (on a monday night) but I can see how this place could be loud with a bunch of little shits running around.People in other reviews seem to be neglecting one awesome thing: There's a parrot in the lobby!  I think parrots are awesome, and I enjoyed looking at Missy the bird.  I tried to speak to her when I was drunk but she just looked at me.Very nice property! Rooms were outstanding! Don't know how old it is, but everything looked and felt new, very clean and comfortable. Staff was very nice and accommodating. A bit annoying that when I extended my stay at the front desk, they forgot to reauthorize my room key. Got up to my room on the evening after my original reservation was up and the room key didn't work. Had to go all the way back down to the lobby. Oh well, mistakes happen. Breakfast your was average Embassy Suites breakfast buffet fare. Seemed a bit more on the buffet for the weekend. The woman working the omelette station/grille during the week was much better than the guy they had on the weekend. Manager's reception each night was excellent. Nice array of things to nosh on: veges, chips, dip, salsa and popcorn. Alcohol was free flowing: the bartender knew how to pour generously (and he was also very easy on the eyes :-)    ). Definitely wouldn't think twice about booking here again if planning to be in Indy!Last two times the same story, elevator room and very poor internet. It took me 30 minutes to get a connection to write this review. Front desk gave me a 1-800 number to call. Get a better router. If you are on business and need an Internet this won't work.I LOVE the look of the hotel, looks like a mini shopping center, the lobby is like a miniature garden with plants and fountains and the like. They also have a wonderful colorful pet macaw parrot named ""Sweetie"" she's often in the cage, but allowed out! The breakfast is GREAT made to order french toast, pancakes, and omeletes. Theres also a happy hour, yes drinks and snacks! The rooms are beautiful, designed like actual apartments to help you feel like your still at home and not a actual hotel. The pool is fantastic cool and the whirlpool is the complete opposite, a nice steamy and relaxing hot. Other than that the staff is wonderful, pleasant and always willing to help, always sent us off and greeted us with cheery voices and smiles.There's a O'Charleys, Steak &amp; Shake, White Castle, JcPenny Store, Smoothie King, Sprint Store, Panda Express, &amp; Dennys located within walking distance. There is also a Walmart across the intersection from the street perpendicular from the one the hotel is located on. There's a few good stores in that area tooOne tip is the elevators, there is four and because so many ppl are there its constantly running and comes kind of slow when called. So of course your options are the stairs, where it gets tricky, because some lead only outside, some lead no where at all, and then thats just that BUT here's is a simple secret: If you take the stairs always come out of the stairway on the second floor and walk in the direction of the pool OR the front desk if you havent been to the pool yet, that set of stairs by the pool is close to the entrance and your best bet of making it where ever on time.The room was decent for what we paid for it I guess. Found a cockroach in the bathroom the 2nd day and heat barely worked the whole time we were there. My wife's family kept getting harassed at the pool when they weren't able to produce a room key. Only positive thing was the hot breakfast which is pretty good. Won't be staying here again though.The kids, kids, kids!!! I know we were visiting on a Saturday, but the place was overrun by kids. It wasn't families with 2-3 kids, but families with 7-10 kids each. Despite being told at check-in we had to wear these wristbands for both the happy hour and breakfast, there were tables of 10 kids, none of which had wristbands. The pool was overrun with rowdy kids as well. The elevators were quite possibly the slowest I've seen.  During the morning rush, there where 20 people were trying to get on the elevator, and even the hotel maids carrying a carrying huge bags of towels demanded to get on as well.I've stayed in several Embassy Suites before, and I must say, this was my worst experience yet.  Perhaps we were just unlucky to be there the same time as hundreds of kids, but as I mentioned, the staff didn't seem very friendly either.Finally, despite the fact that it says it is close to the Children's Museum, it's several miles away.  In fact, there is another Embassy Suites which is closer.  I don't think I'll be staying here again on my next trip to Indy.This hotel is very convenient for business travelers in Carmel or anywhere around the north loop of 465.  I stayed here a few years ago and it looks like it may have gotten a facelift since then.  It offers the usual amenities - decent complimentary breakfast and happy hours, nice work area in the living room part of the suite, and medium-sized flat screens in both rooms.  The room and bathroom was clean, the front desk personnel were courteous, parking was free - just a good, decent hotel where I'll stay in the future too.I'm like Meredith, did we stay at the same hotel? We really enjoy this hotel and have had lots of good times here. Great location for what we do in Indianapolis. I await our next trip to compare notes with the others but readers. Our times here have been very enjoyable.Clean rooms, no bed bugs is always a plus.....that is a huge worry here in the Midwest.....staff very friendly, basketball rim outside, ok workout room (nothing special), nice pool and a great sauna! IDK if because i am from Chicago I expect my elevators to be quick, but this hotel needs an elevator upgrade QUICK! These are the slowest elevators ever!This hotel has definitely seen better days.  This hotel is now used by low budget travelers and school groups that need to sleep 8-10 per room.  We stayed on 8th floor.  Getting off the elevator I noticed the dirty carpeting.  Looked like popcorn ceiling had fallen onto the carpet.  The room was OK if you don't mind stained furniture.I did enjoy my stay here.  The rooms were nice and clean and bed linens were fresh and clean.  The breakfast was delicious and I would stay here again.","Bedbug Alert - My first bedbug experience! I discovered bedbugs in my room last night as I prepared to go to sleep. The hotel moved me immediately and offered to accommodate any needs I had, which were none at that time.  I will stay at the property again based on how the hotel management handled the situation. I just wanted to let everyone know to keep an eye out.I got in at 2 am and asked for a room not near the elevator.  I basically wanted a quite room.  The concierge places me right in front of the elevator which i didnt realize until i go t into my room and heard the constant noise.  I cant imagine them accompating anything else if they cant understand a simple request.Seems to be an older hotel, being renovated. but its a place to sleep.",,,,"['kids', 'kids', 'kids', 'kids',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/university-place-hotel-and-conference-center-indianapolis,University Place Hotel & Conference Center,3.0,$$,21,"Spent a week here. decent rooms, nice lobby. Did not try the restaurants. Whole IUPUI campus is covered by free AT&amp;T wi-fi (hotel has wi-fi as well). So that was nice. Parking is kind of a pain in the ass since it is all zoned for the surrounding university. You can pay the valet to take care of your car for you. No pool! What's up with that?This place is no longer open to the public as a hotel. It's been a dorm for IUPUI students since fall 2013. Chancellors restaurant onside is open to the public and is pretty good. Only eat here if you are on campus and can't walk to much better places downtownI had to travel to Cincinnati to work on my rental unit, but it was Saturday and no one could quote work until Monday...so off to Indy for dinner with an old friend from Chicago (its about half way each way).I quickly book a room on an online travel site and though this place was a little bit out of the center of the city, it was a little drive to get down to the happening places.But my friend and I still had a good time.  The place is clean and big.  Sitting smack dab in the middle of a University, this place is nicer than I would have thought.  Big rooms, clean, everything works and looks new.  Views out the windows are nothing big, but considering the price, worth it.All and all a good alternative than paying trumped up prices for being close.Not  a bad hotel, friendly efficient service, rooms are better than adequate, clean, large bed, car park $18 a day.  Room service efficient, food itself was diabolical, overcooked ribeye steak and veggies, not worth $42 at all.Tried the Den, which is a little sports bar, pappardell with goat cheese was delish and worth its meagre dollars.  Not much nearby - just a barnes and noble was all I could see.  Hotel was $95 a night so overall good value.I read the reviews on here and was a little skeptical about staying here and almost canceled. My friend was staying at the Westin this weekend, so I ended up going back and forth to hang with her via the shuttle. The shuttle is a great service! They take you where you need to go in the city and just call them before 11pm and they will pick you up. I was having too much fun with my friend and missed the last shuttle for the night. ;(I have to say that I liked my double room MUCH better than my friend's king room at the Westin. The bathroom amenities are great and they give you a mat for the shower, not a towel. I enjoyed the coffee provided. The staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful.  Parking is $18 a day, but they give you in/out privileges. There is free wifi. I would stay again.Overrated on most of the travel sites. Indy has much better to offer and would suggest unless you are getting an outrageous $, look elsewhere.Nice, clean &amp; quiet. Close to Lucas Oil Stadium and waterfront attractions but I wouldn't walk there in cooler weather or if you have kids--it's not that close. You pay for parking but you would anywhere this close to downtown. Rooms were clean and modernized. You can tell that it's an older hotel but it's been kept up. Can't do much to change bathroom size etc. with remodel. Large lobby with lounge and typical snack store. There is a shuttle that will take you and pick you up from a few specific locations downtown. Overall, I would stay here again unless I could get an actual downtown room at a place like the Sheraton for the same price.Sweeeet surprise of a hotel. All the mod cons, including an HD TV (with, oddly, no HD channels) and MP3 player in the room. Awesome bed and nice views of downtown if you're on the good side and high enough.Staff was very friendly... lobby was way cool. Never got to try the food, but the room service menu was megapricey. for breakfast. I found the usual campus fastfood suspects nearby.But... they lose a star because the official address is not where the hotel is. Actual entrance is really something like 915 North Street. It's bizarre. The hotel isn't on Michigan Street at all.Also, expect $14/night for parking. As this hotel is on a university campus and not in downtown proper, it feels like a bit of a rip-off. I'm not a student... my parents aren't paying, k? :-)I ordered a $13 driver, and they got me a $40 taxi. Not ok, never ok. Train your people. Why would anyone want to spend that much for a shitty cab, when they can get a nicer car or share a ride for $13. Its not like its a nice cab. Anyway, rooms were so-so. Staff was bland, dry, and not helpful. My key stopped working and I was blamed and it took them forever to help me. Also, check in took forever. Shouldn't they have enough people working so there aren't 5 people waiting in line?If I had my choice, I wouldn't stay here again.Was here for a work related conference and my experience was nice enough.  The facilities were clean, bed was comfortable, and having eaten all my meals here (they were provided for free by the organization I work for), I can say they were decent enough. I didn't have the time or energy to venture out of this ""complex"" into downtown, but I understand there is a shuttle.  Without the shuttle, I'd say this is only a convenient location for people having something to do with IUPUI.  Also, there is free wifi.  Finally, a random note about the box lunch the hotel provided me with on my last day--SO pleased to finally get a vegetarian box lunch with a sandwich that wasn't mainly cucumber.I agree with the others. Aside from docking my credit card $75 a day for incidentals, everything else was excellent. The breakfast place on the first floor was awful, though.Booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a>Very disorganized and short-staffed. I had to wait in line at reception and it took FOREVER. Then they were supposed to send me a receipt over email because their printers were down, so I had to call and ask for it. Which meant a Loooong time on hold. Also, not very close to city center. Unless they somehow add more staff, I'd stay away.My girlfriend and I needed a weekend away and so we got on Hotwire and snagged a couple nights at this hotel for a bargain. We had a good room with decent amenities. Parking was free at the underground garage and while not convenient to downtown (driving, not walking distance) we couldn't complain too much.The only problems we had were Saturday night and Sunday morning the lobby was roped off because apparently the Indianapolis Colts must've been staying there.Insanely FAB Conference Rooms, i've never stayed at the hotel, no matter what you've heardWorst experience I've ever had at a hotel. I actually feared for my safety at this hotel. Truly astonishing poor front desk and valet service. Vindictive and mean. Internet was horrible. Do not stay here. I could go into great detail but this place is a true dump. Be smart and stay at one of the Marriott or Hilton properties instead.Have stayed here the last five years when going to gen-con, and enjoyed the hotel.  However to put it in perspective we only sleep here.  We enjoy the walk to the convention center (or the shuttle if it is raining) The first year here we were amazed of the quality of the room, sorry the next years it was expected. We will likely be enjoying a stay here again this coming summer.Nice Hotel and staff.  If you come don't use your debit card.  Everyday they will authorize your card for $75.00 for incidentals. I was there a week and my card available balance was down $525.00 is was temp., but still.NO HOUSE KEEPING OR ROOM SERVICE!!!I recently stay at University Place Hotel for a convention being held at the RCA dome. When I booked I was told a free shuttle was being run between the hotel and the convention. When I got there and asked about it I was told ""Well I wouldn't wait for the shuttle. I haven't seen him all day (it was 2pm). He picks people up and sometimes they want to stop at CVS and stuff, so you'll be waiting awhile."" I ended up spending more that $40 on cabs over 2 days because it's too far to walk (20-30 min each way) -- not to mention they charge you $14 a day to park there, and you are near nothing else and the parking is for hotel guests only. Next, we ordered room service. An hour and 15 minutes later they brought the wrong order. I called down and informed them of what our order really was. They brought it up, and surprise!-- some food was missing, no silverware and no condiments! I called again and gave them a list of what they forgot. They came back up with some  of it. We just gave in at that point (2 hours after order)... then I got the bill. They billed us someone else's order. Instead of under $20 it was $46.The coup de gra'ce was when we walk in the door the first evening to see that room service never came to our room! I called down and asked that they send someone up. We ditched out for about an hour, and when we came back, there were 3 towels and folded sheets sitting on the desk... next to the tray of room service dishes from the morning-- UNTOUCHED! (I tossed the tray and all the dirty towels into the hall-- they did manage to get that cleaned up by the next morning.)There is no reason to say at this hotel, unless you enjoy being systematically irritated into submission.Just stayed at the hotel on a last minute trip to Indianapolis to watch the AFC Championship game (Patriots vs. Colts).  As you approach the hotel from the street, it doesn't look like anything special, but once you step into the lobby you are pleasantly surprised.The hotel looks relatively new and is very well decorated.  Rooms were spacious with extremely comfortable beds and a high definition Samsung TV.  Good cafe to grab a quick breakfast located on the 2nd floor - $13 hot buffet and $9 cold buffet.Location was convenient to downtown Indianapolis (about a 20 minute walk or a very short cab ride), though not much within a 5-minute walk like other city center hotels.I booked the hotel through Hotwire (didn't know which hotel I was getting until I completed purchase) and paid a total of $90 for this top-notch hotel.Got details of reservation wrong. Didn't help fix. Repeated calls to front desk unanswered. Finally got housekeeping to request a blanket, never delivered. Total and complete disaster. You are an embarrassment.","I cannot believe that this is considered a 4 star hotel (according to Priceline).

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-indianapolis,Drury Inn & Suites,4.5,$$,30,"This hotel is where it's at! I mean seriously.... what hotel gives you a free happy hour with food and drinks and a free breakfast full of sausage gravy and biscuits, waffles, eggs, bacon, etc. ???? I mean... I've never been to one!I definitely enjoyed my stay here. The beds are comfortable, the amenities are wonderful, and the staff is welcoming. Definitely check out a Drury Inn.Do not stay here if you are prone to seizers!  Smoke detectors are located above the beds and blinks 2 ridiculously bright and sporadic lights all night long.  You can still see the lights with your eyes closed!!  I asked management if they could do something about the lights. Management actually Said ""The lights have to blink for it to work. I had to sleep with a pillow over my face. When I got back to my room at the end of the day, they had done nothing to reduce the brightness of the lights.  Instead we found a fold-up bead in the room. (We didn't order a folding bed). "".I will not stay here again.We stayed here for a baseball tournament, my husband is the coach. We brought our 15 month old daughter and she really enjoyed the pool. The staff was so nice and everything was very clean.Had to give 5 stars.The hotel was full of baseball, basketball and robotics teams.The staff did a great job keeping up with the volume in the hotel and remained friendly and helpful.We traveled in with a baseball team (our third travel tournament this summer) and this was definitely the best hotel and experience.Everyone appreciates free snacks and free breakfast and they have guest washers and driers which was helpful.I would recommend the Drury and would stay again.Very friendly and quick check-in.  They do take AAA discount, so I think with 2 adults and a dog ($10 extra), our rate was $121 after taxes &amp; dog fee.  In my opinion, it is a good price if you are taking advantage of the snacks &amp; beverages.  They had hot dogs, chips, salad, Minestrone soup, carrots &amp; celery, baked potatos, mac-n-cheese, etc.  Plus, 3 free alcoholic drinks and free sodas.Beds were comfortable (includes 5 small pillows) on each bed.  Bathroom and room was clean.  Indoor/outdoor pools.  I did not try the Wi-Fi, so cannot comment.  Nice &amp; quick checkout &amp; the Manager was very friendly and said how cute our dog was.  I would definitely stay here again.Called to make a reservation on Thursday night for a Friday check in. Two boys in two with a stop over in Indy. Drury had some good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. Paid $60 less at this hotel than at a different brand name hotel. Way worth it. Very kid friendly. Free popcorn and fountain drinks til 10 pm. Didn't make it for happy hour but breakfast made up for it the next morning. Rooms were decent size. Staff was very friendly. Went for a half hour jog on the treadmill in the workout room. Nothing special but does the trick. Hot tub, indoor pool and outdoor as well. A little perk about this location, there was a TwinPeaks within walking distance. Almost went there to watch the Blackhawks playoff game but I was too tired and ended up watching it in the lobby with another guy staying there. Like I said above, the breakfast was fantastic for a family. I have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old boy. Both were satisfied. Waffles, eggs, toast, coffee, cereal, fresh fruit, biscuits, and sausage patties. Apple and orange juice. Good job Drury Hotel Indy. Next time we want to go to the Children's Museum in Indy, we will be staying here. In fact, we are going to seek out other Drurys while traveling as well.Very nice hotel. Here for baseball and they have and indoor and outdoor pool + hot tub, free breakfast and dinner + 3 free beverages for the adults. Definitely a top Drury hotelI should give this 5 stars but nothing is perfect. The level of friendliness of the staff especially in the food area, which is a great concept, was over the top. You feel totally welcome. I didn't think this type of service existed any more. Most places these days hire employees who are passive aggressive and hide thinly veiled contempt at best, this place has some real leadership at some level that won't tolerate modern day bad service attitude. Please take over other industries. Ah hell I just switched to 5 stars after writing the review. I travel 30 plus weeks a year and live in hotels most nights. I'm not a big compulsive reviewer on Yelp, so this is a big deal.We stay at the Drury each year during memorial weekend for the Indy 500. The strategic layout of the building is great for quick floor access so that you don't need to walk too far to your room. The elevators are right in the middle and guess what, all buttons actually work - yes, I will close the door on your face if you don't make up your mind. I wasn't aware until reading some of the other reviews that there are complimentary drinks and other freebies, had I known this I would have exploited the Drury's gratis offer, because I could not get a pop from the machine being short $0.50 :-(. Anyways, the free breakfast in the morning is great and I made sure to not miss out. The rooms are clean and spacious, but only downside is the bright halogen bulb shining into the room at night. I would recommend this place for your stay.This was our first time staying here, and it was an awesome experience. Staff was very friendly and everything was very clean. Free breakfast, free dinner, 3 free alcoholic beverages, free soft drinks and popcorn...who wouldn't want to take advantage of all those perks?! We will be staying here again!I typically stay at hiltons, hyatts or Marriotts.  Free breakfast, drinks and dinner.  What more could you possibly ask for? Rooms were clean.. Workers were fabulous. I will definitely choose drury over any other hotelGreat experience. Clean, modern rooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Pet friendly. Will definitely be back!Big breakfast buffet, free drinks at dinner.Pretty good overall.Stayed at the Drury for a week in between our buy/sell house closings and there wasn't a single issue I could complain about. If I had one nitpick, it is the fact that they are a Pepsi house and I couldn't get my Diet Coke fix while staying there. The positives are numerous: cost effective, excellent staff, great location with easy access to I-69/465 and 82nd Street, free breakfast and snack style happy hour/dinner (nachos, hot dogs, penne pasta), free soft drinks and adult beverages at night, pet friendly and the place was also super clean.My husband and I stayed at this hotel Memorial Day weekend.The location is great! Right off of I 69 and 82nd/Shadeland, which is a popular part of Indy. Yes, the hotel has complimentary appetizers and beverages everyday. While this is a nice feature, I wasn't all that impressed BUT that is just me. There were a lot of people in the dining area, so they obviously enjoyed it. They had hot dogs (which looked pretty questionable), bowls of salad, mac and cheese, chips and salsa, nacho cheese and celery and carrot sticks. The same goes for the complimentary drinks. The same goes for the drinks.... There is also a complimentary breakfast buffet, but I did not utilize it.In regards to food, the thing I did enjoy was the complimentary popcorn and soda. They have it available until 10 in the evening. It was great!The staff were extremely friendly and the check in/check out was quick and efficient.The rooms were very nice except the refrigerator did not work. We had purchased some cold cuts to make sandwiches for our trip the next day to the Indy 500 and was disappointed when I went to put them in the fridge and the fridge wasn't cool. I turned up the dial and waited, but it refused to work. Thankfully we had a cooler and access to ice, so the food didn't spoil.They had a pool (I didn't use it, but it looked really nice) and a nice business center with a couple of computers and printer.I would recommend this hotel!**GREAT STAFF**  (You should ALL get a Star!)A client booked this hotel for us for a 3 night stay.  Upon arrival we were greeted with two of the nicest front desk guys! Loved the uniforms, very neat &amp; professional looking. Was told about the ""Happy Hour from 5-7pm each night"" &amp; 3 free cocktails!! Loving it already!! And a small buffet at night too.  Not to mention hot breakfast each morning!!  This all was handy as my spouse had meeting each day and left me to find my own food.  Our room was the coolest layout: separate living room area with TV that had a door that closed it off from the bedroom.  This is VERY handy if you have a companion that stays up until 2am working! Bathroom shower came with preloaded shampoo &amp; soap etc...that was nice.  Towels were on the ""thin"" side but ok. The Second (6/11 @ 10:30am) day I miss breakfast and needed a place to eat. The girl at the desk was so sweet and helpful.  Even asked if I liked it and what I ordered when I came back in! Kudos to her! Third day I ran into somewhat of an ""issue"" and needed the hotel Managers help.  He listened, understood my issue and was very apologetic and helpful in resolving it.  ALL the staff at this Drury Inn location in Indianapolis,IN went above and beyond to help make my staff enjoyable and even made sure I was compensated for my issue. I would recommend to anyone.Only complaint: While the buffets were nice to have, I was not real impressed with ""quality"" of food but tolerable.Can anyone pronounce ""Drury"" confidently? It's such an awkward-sounding word.Anyhoo! This was the first hotel we came to after a night out in Indy, and we both vaguely remembered staying here once before and not hating it, so there's how we made our decision to bunk up at the Drooooreee for the night. When we pulled in to the parking lot, I noticed a woman walking two Malamutes. On our way to the front door, we saw a couple with a Newfoundland. A man standing just inside the lobby had a Doberman next to him. It was then that I remembered this hotel chain is pet-friendly. The whole place looked exactly like the hotel in ""Best in Show,"" which both amused and concerned me for obvious reasons. However, there was absolutely nothing to be concerned about. No noise, no mess, nothing. The dogs (and their owners) were on their best behavior... of course, they were all in town for a show at the fairgrounds, so we're talking about some well-trained pooches here, but still. Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. No complaints whatsoever.Breakfast, however, was nothing short of a clusterf**k, with children and adults in various states of dress (pajamas, swimsuits, no shoes, etc), a hockey team of tween boys hell bent on destroying all the bananas on the buffet, sour-faced teenage girls, and the occasional dog all running around the buffet and seating areas. It was, as the kids are saying, cray-cray. All the biscuits were gone and I couldn't even get to the milk dispenser and ended up eating my cereal dry with a side of sausage. Life is hard.Other than that, our stay was great.I usually stay at Marriott properties when I travel, but last night I stayed at Drury Inn and loved it. Rooms were clean. They offered food for dinner and a great breakfast. Exercise room had good treadmills as well. Overall good experience.I ended up at the drury after the hilton across the street overbooked and sent me here with a paper for the front desk. I couldn't be happier with the staff here. The two people at the front desk were very nice, funny, and personable- which I really appreciated after my experience at the Hilton. They were able to book the rest of my stay so I didn't have to go back to the Hilton and hope they had a room for me tomorrow. They also have a free happy hour type event where they gave me drink coupons and he let me know what food they would be serving the next day. Wifi is free here and breakfast is free too. I have stayed at drury before and have always had a good experience. I will be booking drury over hilton from now on.Wonderful staff, especially Brian at the front desk!  Comfortable and clean rooms.  My new favorite hotel chain.  Highly recommended!!!","We stayed here for the first time at the end of last year and again during our wedding. We were originally attracted to this facility as they allow pets at no charge. They also had excellent online reviews. We were impressed by the level of customer service we received and we were offered an additional night for half price. We decided to take them up on the offer. They also have a light dinner and cocktail hour each evening. The dinner isn't of the healthiest variety but it's free, so we'll take it. They also give you three free alcoholic beverages each evening. We don't drink but thought this was a great value. They had a full hot breakfast, as well. Briefly after our arrival, we received a knock on our door. It was children selling candy to help ""homeless children"". We didn't buy it and went about our business. A few minutes later another knock, the same thing. I called the front desk to let them know about this. It didn't happen again. Other than the soliciting, we were happy with our stay. We decided to use them for our stay during our wedding, as well as, for our guests to stay at. We set up an account with them so guests could book their room under our name. Some of guests were paying for their rooms, we payed for the wedding party's accommodations. They had a lot of confusion over this, especially once we checked in. I received a call from the front desk during my rehearsal dinner asking if we were paying for photographer's room. I told them we were and told them to use our credit card. This was a little annoying because of the timing and the fact we had given them our credit card during check and explained the situation again at that time. They were very apologetic and fixed it. With the exception of this issue, I was pleased with our stay. The hotel gets pretty crowded in the evening on the weekends, particularly downstairs. The elevators are slow during this time. This normally wouldn't be a problem, as I don't mind climbing stairs but nine stories in a wedding dress isn't easy. To sum it up this hotel reminds me a bit of Embassy Suite hotels. The cocktail hour and light dinner, along with the full breakfast seemed very similar to Embassy Suites. The room we stayed at on our wedding night was more reminiscent of the large suites, as well. Although the huge with jacuzzi tub was an added bonus. They also allow pets for no charge. I think if we stay at a Drury Inn again it'll be because pets are allowed for no charge.We had a great experience here. The rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The cable and wifi worked great. The linens were good, soft towels. We did not get to try dinner b/c of late arrival. The state fair was going on so the pool was full of children. I had an OJ and fountain soda at breakfast time. They had donuts and waffle maker out. The hot food wasn't being served until 7 AM. When it was served, it was like a cattle call!! This is one of the nicer hotels that allows pets w/o a huge service fee!Great breakfast, clean, personable staff, love the popcorn and free movie and Reasonably priced for what you get!! This has become our new second ""home""!!!Brian at the front desk is an outstanding young man.  He is truly an asset to not only this location, but also the hotel organization.  The rooms are always clean, and I love that they offer free kickbacks daily (snacks, fountain drinks, and cocktails).  The breakfast is also hot, fresh and delicious.  I feel at home every time I stay.  I find this location to not only be convenient for Indy travelers, but they also allows pets.  Any travel in my future will be at this hotel and others in it's chain.  I have to mention again how wonderful the staff is.  I think that can make all the difference anymore.Our family has traveled to Indianapolis four or five times in the last year.  We have stayed at this property on each occassion because we have been met with a very clean and pleasant environment, friendly and professional staff who had customer service as an obvious goal, and bountiful and delicious food.  The General Manager of this property clearly sets a high goal of providing great value to the guests and the provision of exceptional service.  Thanks for many wonderful stays.  We will see you again soon!We went here as a ""getaway"" , and were very impressed.  The place was clean, staff is friendly, plus its pet friendly, which helped as we have a dog.  We also chose this place as it had an indoor pool and hot tub.  The food they have for breakfast &amp; dinner is ok but  it saves you money from going out or getting take out if you don't want to. It's not the healthiest, but what other hotels offer ANY food other than breakfast? We did go over a weekend, which had a ton of kids running all over, but the staff spoke to them in a professional manner, and took care of them ruining someone elses stay.  I wouldn't go on a weekend again for a getaway, but would definitely come during the week when its more quiet.  All the rooms were clean, (lobby, dining area, lounge), which makes a big difference.   We would definitely go here again. We liked the popcorn too that they pop every evening.  We really enjoyed our time there.GREAT stay there!!  The bed was the most comfortable I have experienced at any hotel.  Wonderful breakfast with lots of choices, great staff.....just can't say enought. This would be my hotel of choice if staying in Castleton area of Indianapolis again!!!Room was clean and quiet and comfortable. Late afternoon appetizers and breakfast were very good as well.  Pool is small but was good enough for my kids. Staff was very friendly and helpful - I would stay there again.This is the 2nd time I have stayed at a Drury Inn (2 different cities) and I will not stay at one again.  They are new and clean and all good stuff.  The furniture in the rooms has this smell that I cannot stand, it smells like mold.  Maybe I am super sensitive to smells, but I won't stay at one of these hotels again.Well located, clean, and reasonably priced. Plus they allow dogs at for no fee.",,,,"['hotel', 'mean', 'seriously', 'hotel', 'gives', 'free', 'happy', 'hour', 'food', 'drinks', 'free', 'breakfast', 'full', 'sausage', 'gravy', 'biscuits',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/conrad-indianapolis-indianapolis,Conrad Indianapolis,4.5,$$$,87,"Nice hotel, very beautiful. In the heart of downtown and close to the mall, bars and restaurants. The rooms are very large and spacious and I really loved staying here and felt very comfortable. Well worth it staying here!I recently stayed here for a business trip and loved this hotel. Beautiful lobby with great lighting. Super friendly and courteous front desk staff. Great hotel rooms that offer a nice break from the traditional Marriotts and Hiltons. Right in the heart of downtown Indy and within walking distance to everything. As a runner, it was centrally located by great running paths (e.g., canal system, bridge near the zoo, etc.). I must have looked like a sweaty mess when I ran back, as the front desk offered me bottles of water right away. Overall, really pleased with the excellent customer service. Worth staying at.Very very nice hotel. Stayed here in August for a friends wedding. Great location in the heart of downtown, connected to the 3 story mall, within walking distance of bars, restaurants, museums and the park. Did I mention it was very nice? Diamond dusted portrait art greets you in the lobby with legends like Muhammad Ali. The Capital Grill and a wine tasting bar are inside. Gym is nice, has everything you need - I heard there was a sauna and a spa that I didn't quite have the time or money for...However, had a very nice stay, beds are comfy, view could have been better - looking into the building next door even on the 14th floor but whatevs. The ballroom was real fancy! That is where our friends had their reception. I haven't quite experienced anything like that before. The food and appetizers were delicious, the servers did a synchronized changing of the plates...ya it was like that...Great time, great hotel, worth the price to stay fancy shmancy.Full disclosure: I've never stayed at the Conrad, but based on my experiences, I can tell you it would be fab-u-lous. First off, the decor is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Grand lobby with marble from Verona, Italy? Check. Abstract gold Dale Chihuly inspired glass fixture? Check. A plethora of interesting artwork, ranging from Andy Warhol pop style to Salvador Dali originals? They've got it. They even have a brand new gallery space! While the Conrad is a chain luxury tier hotel in the Hilton family, I appreciate the local touches. Notice the circular patterns in the marble and carpet? That's a nod to the Circle City. The Conrad also works with a local art partner, and you'll spot lots of Robert Indiana (of ""LOVE"" fame) influences, too!Still not enough artwork for your palette? Then you have to check out the new Collections Suite on the fifth floor. Did I just step into a swanky, private New York City apartment complex for the rich and famous? Sure feels like it! My favorites are the surrealism suite with Dali influences with a cloud mural in the bedroom and the pop suite with Warhol galore. Also, the bathrooms are bright and spacious - I've never seen a bigger and more beautiful shower and tub in my life.Getting hungry? Check out the Capital Grille and Tastings: A Wine Experience, both connected to the hotel. Need some R&amp;R? The sixth floor has an infinity pool and the Evan Todd Salon and Spa. Feel like getting married? They have large ballrooms and banquet halls, and they're connected to the Arts Garden. The Conrad caters wonderfully to both leisure and business travelers. The staff is incredibly kind, whether it's the valet welcoming you to the Conrad, the front desk/concierge assisting you, or the housekeeping staff. The service is on point. It's the little things like when the valet returned my car to me and asked if I needed directions anywhere. If I didn't already live in Indy, the Conrad would be my #1 choice for staying overnight!Fantastic place, well staffed and friendly. I was there at a meeting downtown and stayed 15 minutes away near airport. because I did not want to be in town. Cindy and Roxanne were on duty and extremely service oriented. The restaurant food was good but service excellent.Royalty, that's how I feel every time I come here. Their Weddings and Event staff couldn't be more on point. Been here for a few weddings and I'm blown away again and again by their hospitality and attention to detail. Even the staff at the front desk is always incredibly helpful. Had a groom who couldn't tie a bow tie so the concierge called Jos A Banks and asked if someone could come and tie it for him. So resourceful! We also asked the front desk for any recommendations for restaurants in the area with good dessert. He brought out the most comprehensive book of restaurants (and menus) in the area that I've ever seen. The rooms are always clean. The staff is always friendly. The food is always great. And you will always feel like you are the most important person in the room.We stayed here for a weekend getaway and we found the Conrad to be very clean and inviting.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with anything that we asked of them.  The location was perfect and right in the heart of the city.   We would highly recommend the Conrad to anyone!  Two thumbs up in our book.Hat tip to concierge Lee for going above and beyond in an effortless manner, and all that while she was off the clock. Grateful for her fitness center tour.Beautiful hotel in the very center of the city. The fact of being chosen by such celebrities as the Rolling Stones to stay while on tour- it definitely sais something about the hotel. Glamorous portraits of various rock n roll stars are decorating the lobby.They have SPA and fully equipped fitness center with few cardio machines and weights. Indoor sky blue swimming pool to work out or relax. Pretty good room service menu. Cozy and spacious rooms. Breakfast a la cart downstairs at the Capital Grill restaurant which is located at the hotel building. Valet parking. Walking distance to all Indianapolis sights, restaurant and the mall. One thing that we didn't like that possibly we were bitten by the bed bugs, cause the bites seemed exactly like of the bed bugs. But the manager assured us that they checked the room after we checked out and didn't find any. So... Except for this incident everything else was exceptional:)Been here twice over the last year.  What an excellent location being smack in the middle of downtown indy.  This hotel has a great wine bar / restaurant as well as Capital Grille attached to it.   The hotel is definitely above average with service and cleanliness.   Rooms are up to date with amenities and technology.   Also good looking hotel with keeping the classy look.   I will always choose this hotel when in downtown Indy.This is the best hotel I have stayed at outside of Vegas in the continental United States. I like everything about it, especially the gym and the pool. Usually hotel gyms feel thrown together in a closet, theirs is especially nice, lots of new and modern equipment and completely empty at 5 when I have time to workout before having to be on the clients site. I believe the food is done by the Capital Grill down on the first floor, I will review that separately, but it was very good as well. So far I have only stayed here for a couple weeks this year, but I will make sure to re-review if experience changes. So far it has been been usual upscale hotel experience, everything is very clean, very quite, very pretty. Being down town I have had to depend on hotel staff to help me out more then usual, but they are very responsive and have genuine nice response want and willingness to help. The location is perfect for the traveling consultant like myself. I am able to return in the evening and walk to 100 different restaurants. So far I haven't ate the same thing twice, and have enough places within walking distance it will be quite a while before I have to get the car out of valet at night. I'll be here for another 20 weeks this year, I absolutely love my new home away from home.Fantastic stay, even for just a night.  Room is wonderfully laid out and furnished, down to in room snacks, drinks and spirits.  The entire place was clean and staff was over the top friendly and ready to serve from the valet to the front desk to wait staff during our conference.Conference facilities were top shelf as well.  No complaints, suggestions or ideas on how to improve.  Just keep doing what you're doing!  I'll be back!Very nice hotel in heart of downtown Indy. You can't beat this location just a block off monument circle. You can even walk to circle center mall and see wrap restaurants via Sky bridges and never even have to step outside. This was great since it was ridiculously windy out when I visited the Conrad and surrounding areas this week. The staff are excellent and very helpful. The atmosphere is sophisticated but not overwhelming. The bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever laid down on! If you can afford a nice night it weekend, I'd definitely recommend the Conrad.This is the first time I have ever done an event or stayed at the Conrad, and I can honestly say that nothing could have gone better. The staff is extremely kind and considerate. Had a quick conversation with one lady about an upcoming trip and for the rest of my stay she would ask me if I was excited to go. They are a real class act and well worth the money. The rooms are impeccable and the proximity to everything happening in the city makes it an ideal location to experience what Indy is all about. The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant or bar but the Capital Grill and Tastings are attached to the lobby.Thanks again to the entire team at the Conrad!AMAZING and probably the best night for our honeymoon in my humble opinion.  We checked in and parked around the corner for $24 vs. $37 valet.  Afterwards, we asked about anything special for our honeymoon.  Well, they started with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  Later, we got microwave delivered to our room for heating up some leftover pate chaud from our lunch church reception.  My new wife wanted a massage and got the concierge to do a last minute appointment booking.  Very good and attentive service since it was difficult to secure appointment within a couple of hours.  In addition to these perks, we also got two $10 breakfast vouchers at the Capital Grill (see my review).  The hotel is ideally located next to Tastings and Capital Grill which we tried both- very good/pricey but worth every penny.  That night, I reserved 2 complimentary bikes to tour the canal and river view.  We were told that we had 4-6 hours but ended up using just for 1-2 hours.  I have to give credit to my wife for toughening up with riding bike with me since she hasn't ridden bike for years.  I also got to do some laps in the pool which is absolutely huge (Olympic size) with a huge hot tub.  Each of the chairs had red/green apples and water bottles.  Well, Conrad Indianapolis went above and beyond our expectations so will have to try and get back here again.  The bed was heavenly and the soaker tub was everything we expected with Conrad.  No doubt, this is the place to be when staying in Indy.Where do I begin?When I was planning on moving to Indy, my mom and I came down for the night and stayed at the Conrad. George at the front desk learned about my upcoming move and went above and beyond to accommodate us. He provided us with information about different apartment complexes downtown - and by provided us with - I mean printed off 15 pages of information and delivered it to our room with champagne!My mom and I were so blown away by this hospitality. Then a few weeks later, per one of George's recommendations, I moved to Indianapolis. And every time my mother comes to visit, she stays at the Conrad with exquisite service.Having this special bond with George and the Conrad, when planning my wedding, the Conrad's Vienna Ballroom was the most obvious choice for us to hold the wedding and reception!We have been blessed with everyone we have worked with in planning the wedding. Stephanie Rice is amazing, and George has been there every step of the way as well!My family and I could not be more pleased with the Conrad in every way. Not only are the staff and service excellent but it is such a beautiful hotel in a prime location. Not to mention Dave Matthews stays there every year.I could keep going but I think I've made it clear that this place is amazing!Our 2 night stay was amazing! Not only are the rooms nice but the customer service was outstanding. I will definitely be back next year!Oh Conrard, how I wish I could afford to live in your hotel. The lotion-esq smell, the pillow bed menu, the full size towels -- you're perfect. I appreciate your AM local brew of Hubbard &amp; Cravens in the lobby, friendly staff, and 24-hour room service. We'll be back.Nice place to stay in downtown.  Bit noisy up to 10pm with the guy at the restaurant across the street playing the saxophone, but it is a downtown location, so I guess stuff like that u can't help.  Breakfast is served at capital grill.  If u didn't know it was the comrad, u would think ur staying at the Waldorf.  Great deal for 50k Hilton points and a free upgrade.Classy. Elegant. Expensive. Comfortable. Doesn't get much better - surprised that Indy ever snagged a ""Conrad"".  Our room had an amazing view of the circle. Everything in the room was high-quality; the bath was spotless, even the glass shower.  But $8 for a tiny first-aid kit? (in the mini-bar)  And $8 for just 2 condoms (also in the mini-bar).  Only down-side were the noisy children next door and their father (?) who was loudly sharing his misery of drinking too much at 3 a.m.  Mom and the kids left him in the room when they went down for breakfast.  Anyhow, checking in/out was a breeze as was the valet $$ervice$$.  We'll be back.","Conrad, you are amazing! If I didn't know any better, I swore I was on vacation. All that was missing from this experience was a cocktail being handed to me as I'd walk in. However, the treatment that I got was so welcoming and helpful. Each staff I'd pass by always had a warm and friendly smile. Aesthetically, the hotel is absolutely gorg!! Grandiose, classic, yet modernly elegant. The rooms rivals that of any other fancy pants, luxurious hotels I've come across. Bathrooms are equipped with huge rain shower heads, oversized tubs, flat screen and a phone right next to the twailet. My room had a spacious work area that I only walked over to, to grab a pen. Otherwise, I had spent most of my time sprawled out on the bed. For me comfy beds are an absolute must, and theirs was just short of snuggling and cuddling me to sleep. I was on cloud 9 the minute my head hit those pillows! Location wise, it was ideal with plenty of nearby restaurants and sight seeing, tourist spots that I took advantage of in between my workshop and group dinners. If I were to ever come back to this city, you can bet, this would be my first and only choice. Granted, only if work ever covers for it again; the rates are quite grandiose themselves!This was for the devourdowntown  deal...The indoor pool was worth a weekend getaway in the big city. Spa area was relaxing and comfortable.  The artwork placed around the entire hotel is incredible.  Reminds me of a New York east coast kinda vibe. No matter how much you make, a small weekend getaway is worth it here.It's the best hotel in Indy hands down! Fantastic service from check in to valet. The Conrad had 2 top notch restaurants attached to have a few cocktails/ wine coupled w great food.The rooms are clean with space.  I love the gym as it has a lot more then the typical hotel gyms. The spa looks nice and if I ever get time I will visit. It's just classy!I am a Conrad fan... See you next time! Oh btw book early it sells out frequently.Where to start... I'm giving 2 stars only because the lobby is nice. Cons:1. We booked online and with our purchase we get a free room upgrade. Come to find out that's based on availability.  So there room rates and deals are vague online.2. The hotel front desk is rude and loud when talking about specifics allowing their voice to carry,  embarrassing us.3. Robe in the room was broken and had a stain. 4. We had two robes but only one set of slippers 3. We asked for a wine carafe sent to the roo, it was chipped and dirty.  The two glasses were dirty as well. 4. Valet is all over the place andb after arrive back from dinner at about 8pm. We had to ask the front desk about getting the car. Valet is required but no one met us? 5. The lamps are old and not all the outlets work correctly. 6. On the last night of a two night stay I go to take a relaxing bath. The drain won't work so I shake it, maybe that will work. The entire drain stop is loose and come right out of the drain...no bath!7. Pool has fee towels,  spa says they provide slippers,  none were there plus it smells like mold in there.  Also the hot tub take 30min to heat up.Pros:1. Location2. Lobby is nice and food is good.For this caliber of hotel you expect more. I'm highly disappointed.  I am a frequent traveler and have found better service and amenities at lower status hotelsThe Conrad parks cars on The Indianapolis Cultural Trail, threatening everyone's safety and really ruining this section of the trail. It's also just disrespectful and rude.I had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad this past weekend for the Big Ten Championship game. Phenomenal property which reminded me a lot of the Conrad in Chicago, which is also excellent. I travel extensively for business, so I've stayed in hotels of all sorts, and this one checks all the boxes. Everything you need is right here. Friendly and attentive staff, clean and modern/luxury rooms, combined with a perfect location make this hotel a winner.From the Conrad I was able to walk to every major restaurant/venue in the city, and it also has the convenience of being attached via Skywalk to a huge mall, as well as a variety of other hotels and restaurants.If you're a business traveler or someone who is coming to Indy for a convention or sporting event, I highly recommend this place. Also, if you can, try to book in advance, as it books up quick given everything it has to offer.It was a pleasure staying here, and I really hope I get to come back this April for the Final Four.Booked a weekend trip to the Conrad and was totally taken back to days of old or better yet current day racism! Valet parked my vehicle from Friday to Sunday to find people around my car every time I left the hotel. The valet charges are a bit exorbitant to have my vehicle on display for the general public to be able to lean on and take selfies! Upon checkout I felt a bit singled out when the valet requested my identification yet did not ask anyone not of color for a single piece of ID! What gives??? I'm a professional black man of color driving a luxury vehicle and dressed appropriately for the occasion. Why single me out for the ID? I'm ok if the policy applies to all patrons.....not just the black ones! I expressed my concerns with the staff and was not offered any apology or explanation! This coupled with the lackluster service from the Capital Grill left a bad taste with me and will surely not earn my business in the future! I'm sure this will fall upon deaf ears as these comments usually do!!! -Unimpressed-Not all that great, for the price.  They were deliberately vague about a web special which supposedly included a breakfast. The front-desk acted like they'd never heard of the website before.  I got charged for the breakfast, because I didn't present a PAPER coupon, which I think room service ""cleaned up"".Don't even bother trying to get a copy of your room charges (simple request, right?)....you'll just be sent to Natalie's vmail. And Natalie doesn't seem to return many calls.C'mon guys, it's the little things, especially when you're paying $300/night in INDIANAPOLIS.The Conrad is a lovely downtown hotel. With so many options, they do a great job of personalizing the experience from the time you chat with the lead valet to being greeted upon entering the lobby.  There are many offerings within the hotel that are included in the stay - fitness facility, pool, sauna.  There is a full service spa onsite as well.The room was spacious and comfortable but our view left something to be desired.  The bathroom was lovely offering a deep tub AND stand in shower, two sinks and a television. I thought that was a nice touch.  I love hotel rooms with nice bedding and the Conrad really steps it up here with layers of blankets, sheets and pillows.  I truly enjoy the hotel experience in general and this was a nice ""staycation"" downtown Indy.I'd definitely stay here again!  The location is great - across from the mall and just down the road from the Indians, Pacers and Colts.  I would recommend it for out of towners for an upscale hotel stay.  The Conrad is also a part of the Hilton brand, so definitely give them your HHonors info for point value. :)""If an excellent hotel in Indianapolis is your requirement, look no further than the Conrad.""This hotel was so nice that I spent additional time in Indiana. It has a great overall feel, location and service. When I pulled up to valet parking I was greeted by a polite gentleman named ""Conrad"". I chuckled and gave him a few jabs about joking around, but he insisted he wasn't joking.Bellboy asked if he could take 7 minutes of my time to show me how my room worked and said yes with the distinct impression he was enjoying his job. There were two plasma TV's one in the main room and the bathroom.There was a coffee / drink bar that had everything you would want including a The Timer hour glass which has three separate hourglass timers, which will time 3 minutes, 4 minutes, and 5 minutes. You could simply tell there was a lot of though behind everything in the hotel rooms.Valet service for meetings was 100% reliable, car running and air / heat was on and ready. Meals were so so, they knew I wasn't totally satisfied so the chef made a desert just for me and by colleague ""on the house""!Firstly this rating is based on my perception of value for money AND by comparing this Conrad to other Conrads I've recently and regularly stayed at. I really wanted to like this hotel. I'm a Diamond Hilton dude and love this location. I have to say I'm not that impressed, especially compared to other Conrads I've stayed at around the country.  Couldn't get into their attached Capital Grille eatery after 1030pm - they close then apparently - so I guess it's room service. The food at their cap grille is great (did food this am and last night) but their new billing system isn't connected to the Conrad hotel system (WTF?) so that's also strange....especially if you are a hilton surpass card member and you are dining with their eateries for a reason. They want you to pay with your credit card which makes it annoying if you want one bill from your hotel stay.....plus your points ratio. I haven't stayed at the Miami Conrad but have stayed very regularly at the NYC and Chicago Conrads and this place feels not quite up to their standard. Just little things like no water left in the work out room / no cups / no kids for coffee in lobby - or less than quick responses to requests for room service. Disappointing. Will compare to JW Marriott next time I'm in town. Maybe this place is geared to the Big Race and when it's not that time standards fall. Again. Disappointed. When room service did arrive I got a can of beer with no glass (!) no water and no condiments with my burger! Another quick thing is that you can hear doors opening and closing in the rooms adjacent to you..... again not a big deal if that's not something you notice and you have a corner suite but if you just have a regular standard room then it's an issue.All in all I would stay here again but I'd make sure that I made other dining arrangements and that I'd be sure to ask for a corner room. Indy is a cool fun city and you can't beat this hotel's location.My company booked rooms here for a conference.  We had 25+ producers here with plenty of things that could have gone wrong....but nothing did! The staff here is so courteous, willing to help, and on top of things. Anything we needed was at our fingertips in minutes. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Even with March Madness going on around us it was calm and quiet up by the rooms. You need a key card to even take the elevator up to the rooms. I really liked that feature. The rooms really were pitch black, just how I like it. The bed was so comfortable and I had no problem falling right asleep. The food we had catered was delicious and the service was on point. They came around and made sure everyone had everything they wanted. I wish all of our conferences went as flawlessly as this one has.As a frequent traveller for pleasure and business, I have come to expect a great deal from the Hilton brand hotels. Before arriving at the Conrad, I was excited to stay here and see what the hotel had to offer. I was quickly disappointed. I booked a room with a king bed. At check in, I was told there were no more rooms with a king available. Ok, fine. The next morning, while chatting with coworkers who were also staying at Conrad, I come to find out that they checked in after me and were in a room with a king. Hmm.My boyfriend stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and left his car with the valet. When leaving, the valet handed my boyfriend the key - in 2 pieces. My boyfriend asked what had happened to key and the valet just shrugged it off. That night I went to the front desk to speak with a manager about the situation and was greeted with a ""tough shit"" attitude - as the valet and the hotel are separate companies. So basically I can pay $37 per night for valet, have a key broken, and the hotel won't do anything - not even comp the parking fees. At check out, I was reviewing my bill and realized I had been charged for a suite, instead of the double bed room I was in (even though I booked a king). The hotel is beautiful. The amenities are nice. The location is perfect. The service and management are awful. For this level of hotel, I expect more. I have received better customer service at lower level, less expensive Hilton brand hotels. Why am I paying more to stay at a nicer hotel, only to receive less?Four years ago my husband and I spent our wedding night here, and stayed again last night to celebrate our anniversary.  Each time we haven't been disappointed.  The Conrad is absolutely stunning from the second you walk in, to every hallway and room.  It's the cleanest hotel we've ever frequented.  This trip Dan, who checked us in, offered us a complimentary bottle of wine or champagne for our anniversary.  I told him no thank you as I do not drink wine, to which he inquired about what I do like.  I told him I like beer (I know, classy right?!).  He offered us any kind of beer we wanted, and suggested Sunking!  We love Sunking!  He had four sent up to our room on the house, and gave us $50 to spend on breakfast at the Capital Grille.  Such a nice, unexpected gesture!  It's the little things like this that will keep us Conrad faithfuls for life!  The bathrooms are beautiful, and always leave me wishing I could live there!  Staying here is worth every penny, and then some.  Keep up the awesome work guys!  We'll definitely be back!  And thanks again to Dan for making our stay extra special!This is, hands down, the best hotel in Indianapolis! As a student at Butler University, a lot of my family members come through town to visit. My parents (who are pretty high maintenance when it comes to hotels) absolutely LOVE the Conrad! As soon as you pull up, the friendly valet are at your car to greet you. You're offered a bottle of water and directed to the main lobby, which is absolutely gorgeous. The staff is very professional and friendly, the hotel is clean and smells amazing, and the rooms are quiet and spacious. The bathrooms are extremely luxurious, with a separate bath tub, and the standard size room has a couch and a desk. A lot of times, when my parents visit, I'll hang out with them in their hotel room and take a nap on the couch -super comfy! For those who are into art, Conrad has a variety of Indiana-based artist's works throughout the hotel. Priceless works of art seem to cover almost every wall. This place is upscale, but not intimidatingly so; luxurious, but not overly luxurious. It fits in perfectly with the rest of Indianapolis, providing a home away from home for visitors and locals alike in the heart of the midwest. If you're looking for great food, Conrad has that, too, boasting 2 restaurants on the main floor. It's also located in the center of downtown, a short walking distance from dozens of great restaurants. The hotel connects with the mall and other nearby locations via skywalk, so you don't even have to go outside if you don't want to (this is a pretty nice feature during Polar Vortex season). If all of that isn't enough for you, the best spa in Indy is located on the fifth floor, along with a pool and a fitness center. I saw Justin Timberlake in there one time. Can I move in?After reading many reviews that raved about this place (and yeah! it is a Conrad!) I booked with a good rate and asked for an early check-in as we would be arriving before 3.  So we go in expecting things to be smashing and we got close but no cigar on a few things.The location is good (although you could whip past it if not familiar with the area).  It is great that it is connected to the mall there and you can go back and forth to eat, shop, etc. without ever getting exposed to the elements.  The staff were all very nice (especially the cocktail waitress for the evening drinks - she was fantastic!) and the room was very good.  So what's my beef?Here's the beef! Got there at 2 was told room wasn't ready yet and would be in about 10mins.  Half hour later the room still wasn't ready and to apologize we got some coupons for some drinks and free continental breakfast.  But did they offer to take our bags and store them while we waited or wandered off like most hotels? Nope! We sat in the lobby with our stuff for that half hour until they gave us the keys.The room was great except that the nice soaking tub didn't work, water in water right back out again.  The stopper was busted. And the tv remote was acting a bit wonky too - no biggie on that one. When we had breakfast at the Capital Grill (reviewing that later) that wasn't up to par for them either (and I have eaten at Capital Grills before).  And when we were ready to leave the valet guys brought us the wrong car!I brought this to the attention of the manager and he did apologize and gave us a free one nights stay for the future when (if) we return.  Let's just say that we went in expecting Conrad top shelf across the board and they dropped the ball several times.  Not cool!What a beautiful hotel, marred by an unexpected gap in customer service. We were thrilled to be part of a beautiful wedding over the New Year's holiday, Stephanie with the Conrad excelled at every level. However the valet services, and subsequent discussion with management about said services have left us with a great sense of disappointment with the Conrad in general. As the appointed driver of our wedding party, I was charged with driving our group about Indianapolis for photos, as the Valet service positioned our vehicle, they did so by nosing it to a pylon of the cultural trail.  As the let us out to our vehicle no note of said pylon was mentioned, as we pulled away, the pylon, under the view of the hood of our vehicle caused significant damage. We were dismissed by the valet service when we addressed it, given the circumstances of the occasion, we had obviously no time to stay and further discuss. When I further called Conrad management about the situation, they noted it had happened before and dismissed me cordially with no offer to remedy the situation, and promised a return call to follow up which never came. I generally hate to write a negative review, as I am in the customer service world as well, it greatly pains me to actually. But this was significant damage, that really should have been addressed by the Conrad. I wish further guests a similarly enjoyable stay, and I hope their experience is not marred as well by a further error in judgment.Stayed here the last weekend of March with my wife and kids.  I have to say the facilities are very nice, the lobby is beautiful and impressive.  There is good security in that they require a key to access any floor.  I am a honors gold member and they upgraded me to a one bedroom suite for only 100 more a night (although some hiltons have upgraded me without an additional charge).  Here are the pros and Cons:Pros:Fitness center - great selection of treadmills and ellipticals as well as free weights.  They even had a free weight bench press which is somewhat rare in my opinion.  The fitness center is large and spacious top of the line.Pool - right next to the fitness center.  The hot tub is huge and the area is clean, the pool is beautiful and well maintained.Location - connected to the circle center mall, so if you don't want to go outside you never have to.  Its also close to awesome restaurants like fogo de chao and mesh.Room bathrooms - they are huge and spacious and have today screen TVs in them. I caught my kids sitting in the bathroom watching cartoons...lolCons:Rooms - the rooms are on the smaller side.  My family and I were quite a tight fit even in a one bedroom suite.  I would have rated them a four if this was the only issue...Service - typically a Conrad is known for its service.  Unfortunately this Conrad did not live up to its reputation.  They visibly were not welcoming to my children in fact it seemed as if they did not welcome families in the hotel.  The front desk staff were rude and I would say borderline racist...sorry to say that but I noticed they were much nicer to other guest for no apparent reason.  So either they were prejudiced or didn't like the fact that I had kids or both.Bottom line, great facilities, rooms are a bit on the small side, the lack of welcoming service is what drags this rating down.  I simply won't bring my family back here because of how uncomfortable the service made us feel.My tip upon mobile check-in to the Conrad:I would like to take this whole bed home with me kthanksbye.Really, though. This place is the place to stay if one finds themselves in the Circle City.A super-centralized location. An insanely attentive staff. A gorgeous lobby complete with sparkly black and white prints of famous old-time celebs (think Muhammad Ali and Marilyn and all that). Super nice accommodation insofar as the room itself. Free water everywhere. A relatively nice fitness center. An insanely nice-looking pool and hot tub (though I did not partake.) Amenities in-room that went above and beyond the usual cornucopia of offerings that hotels provide. An adjacent, attached Capital Grille location as well as some sort of super-cute wine cafe deal.Aaaannnddd... a killer comfy bed. Folks, this bed was better than the W's legendary ones. Not kidding. So amaze.Seems as though folks agree that the Conrad's *thee* place to stay while in Indy, and after my first experience here, I'm inclined to agree as well!Stayed here for one night for a training seminar in Indianapolis. I had never been to Indi before, and the ride to the hotel revealed a pretty shabby looking downtown area. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the Conrad Hotel. I had a King room, and it was very comfortable, nice bed, modern furnishings, and a little TV in the bathroom. Unfortunately, this TV was only set up for viewing from the tub, not the throne. I'm not a bath guy. The lobby areas and the banquet rooms were also very nice, and they had a Capital Grille steakhouse right off of the main lobby. I didn't eat at this particular Capital Grille, but I have eaten at another Capital Grille location and it was awesome. If you HAVE to go to Indianapolis, I recommend staying here.","Wonderful hotel and very close to all of the action.  Service was impeccable and the staff went out of their way to treat us well both at the hotel and the attached Capital Grille.   As far as hotel rooms go, this was very nice but on par with a high end Hilton.  They did have a great fitness area with a steam room and sauna in the locker room. Pool and hot tub were nice, quite, and relaxing.   If you are into art, they have a very nice collection adorning the walls around the first and second floors.Treated like a Queen!Went for a very special girls-day all-day spa-day and it was incredible! It was so relaxing and fun to unwind. They served us fruit and little pastries with mimosas (I of course had mine with very little OJ), and we were pampered. The massages were amazing and the mani/pedis were so nice. The staff was calm and helpful and spoke quietly. I loved the indoor heated pool and the luxurious mani/pedi chairs. They made us feel like royalty.I valeted my car on a Wednesday evening at this ""five star hotel"" only to pick it up Saturday afternoon to have two bent front wheels. Of course I can not tell a wheel is bent on the inside while it is parked at a curbside. I found out once I got up to 50mph on the highway and the front end of my 2013 Honda Accord started shaking VIOLENTLY. I immediately pulled over to make sure I didn't have a flat. No flat. So I go to the nearest tire place, Big O Tires. They squeeze me in at the end of their day (3pm now) and they pull the wheels off of my car. The front two wheels were found to be bent. Nearly flattened on one side on the passenger wheel. I then call to inform them an they say someone will get back to me. I am from Dallas so I am extremely upset that I may not make it home. They balance the wheels for me but advise me that I may not make it home, they will not stay balanced, and that I run the risk of my wheels cracking or splitting on the highway. Luckily I made it home. But it is now 20 days later and they are still denying that they will cover the damages to my wheels. I demand my wheels be replaced. I am not able to drive my car as it is because the shaking is back and completely unsafe. I have to pay for a cab or an uber to get to and from work. Please fix this issue.Per a recommendation from Jon A, as well as the many five star reviews written about this luxury hotel, I booked my room in advance of my trip to Indy, and I couldn't have been more pleased!Here are some of the highlights:*Friendly staff!  The front desk people even welcomed me by name and verified my Hilton Honors number upon arrival.  *Timely valet! My car was ready for me within minutes of calling down from my room each time I needed it.*Awesome location!  The Conrad is centrally located in the heart of downtown and I was able to walk to some nearby hotspots instead of worrying about driving everywhere or paying high prices for the hotel room service / restaurant.  *Comfortable room with many amenities! I especially loved the high-end bath products!You will pay a price to stay here, but if you plan ahead and don't mind prepaying for your room, you may be able to score a discounted rate like I did... and if it's within your budget, or even a bit of a splurge, I am telling you... it's worth it!  I'll definitely be staying at the Conrad again in the future!hands down, the best hotel in Indy.  The decor is a bit traditional, but who really sits on their hotel room couch?  The service here is fantastic, the room service is Capital Grille, and the other bar of choice is Tastings, a wine bar.  I stay here as often as I can because the service is incomparable, the cleanliness impeccable and the people as charming as a Southern Belle.  If the Conrad is in your budget and locale, then there is no other option.  In addition, the central downtown location is perfect.  You can walk to EVERYTHING in about 10 minutes or less.Thinking about blowing your wad at the Conrad? Well aye aye, sailor... it's completely worth it!The lobby is stunning, but not in that ostentatious, over-the-top ""I'm a boutique hotel, look at me!"" way. And the check-in process took all of 2.5 minutes. For an impatient girl like me, that's priceless.My room. So stately, so sophisticated. There's a small sofa, an upholstered chair, a coffee table, two end tables, a huge desk, a dresser, my king size bed and there's still plenty of room to spare. In the bathroom, we have a sleek and small flat screen TV to further enhance your soak in the GLORIOUS tub should you want to sneak in some Mad Men. The toiletries = designer Italian. I'm smelling like a bed of roses right now... thank you, Conrad!The location is fab (right downtown off the circle) and the bed is magnificent. Actually, the bed warrants its own sentence. I'm sinking in it right now, and this review is becoming less and less of a priority... on that note, I bid you adieu! Too bad you won't sleep as well as me.And that is why you should stay at the Conrad.I stay in a lot of hotels because I occasionally travel for my job. This Conrad is smack in the heart of downtown INDY. As a matter of fact, it's much more in the mix than the new JW Marriott is.They lobby is fantastic and I should mention the room was on par with other Conrads I've stayed at. First Class all the way. However, there was an incident during my stay that should never happen.I checked in around 5pm and was given my key. I went up to my room and everything looked fine until I got over to the minibar. There was a half enjoyed bottle of pinot noir sitting there with the cork half in it. I went down to the front desk and notified them of it. They seemed to not really care or offer to come up and remove it. This is supposed to be the best hotel in Indy!The frustrating part is that you wonder what else they forgot to do in my room...As good as it gets!Are 10 stars an option? A last minute trip took me to Indy and I was fortunate enough to stay at the Conrad. Having seen many of them oversees, I was excited to experience this flagship. From the time I pulled up till I hopped in the car after check out, the hotel was beyond stellar. I was in a suite that had a parlor room and bedroom, on a corner. It shared a view of the city, which at times can get a little loud but the windows were insulated well. The rooms were comfy, TVs throughout, and exceptionally comfy bed. Let's not forget the fresh flowers in the room and the shower product was scented in an elegant way. The shower head was two that extend out. It was like rain shower but in the rain forest, Ah... heaven! The lobby of the hotel was covered in fresh sunflowers, tied to the current art exhibit underway. The wine bar outside, amazing at night. The plates were larger then I anticipated they would be. Last but not least the Capital Grille located inside as well. The staff was always so friendly and attentive. I checked out at 5:30am, the front desk person offerred me a coffee to go or bottled water. Again - Impressed and details! If in Indy, I could not imagine staying at ANY other hotel, nor would I consider it.The best bed in Indianapolis.  If this was my normal home away from home, traveling for work would be so much more enjoyable.  The rooms are immaculate, although the bathrooms are its best feature.  All rooms come with a separate bath and shower, TV included.  The only knock would be the dimly lit rooms and darker colored decor.  Some brighter upholstery and more modern fixtures might bring this hotel into the 21st century.Turn down service is typical of a hotel at this level, but without the nighttime chocolate :(  Check out the pillow options.. you might like it better than the standard ones.  The hotel staff was helpful and knowledgeable about downtown locales.  Room service can bring some things, if asked nicely, from the regular Capital Grille menu.5 stars for a wonderful stay and friendly service, even if it isn't the Rtiz Carlton.As good as it gets...the Conrad Indy. Lots of elec outlets, beauty room and appointments. Am here for auto racing convention with Marshall Engine group. Placement to this hotel courtesy of MillionAir Indy, where our airplane is parked. Great downtown location near lots of activity. Several great food options here in hotel. I will surely return. Thanks folks. Well done.Conrad Hotels, the upscale version of the Hilton chain has only 3 locations in the US; Chicago, Miami and this location in Indianapolis. When an impromptu trip to Indy came up, a friend suggested I try this hotel out. With it's location central to everything that I wanted to see while I was in Indy (the Capital and the war memorial)- it was an easy decision. After a few hiccups with getting a reservation (the on line system said they only had smoking rooms left) I placed a call to the reservation number and was able to get the room I wanted smoke free. From the time I got there and was greeted by the valet, who whispered my name into his ear piece so that that front desk was alerted that I was there- the service at the Conrad was quite good. People were there to help you if you even only looked confused about something,they would jump to your aid. The only downside from a service standpoint was that housekeeping shortchanged my room a bit with only one bar of soap, no glassware and no turn down service even though when I was going out for the night- housekeeping was right next door turning down my neighbors room. I suppose I could have called to have them come back but it didn't seem worth the hassle.The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The king sized bed was comfortable with a down comforter and 500 thread count sheets that felt great to slide into at the end of the night. The work station is large and there are plenty of outlets in the room so that you can plug all of your electronics in to charge. Wi-fi in the room is an additional charge of $12.95 which seemed ridiculous given you are paying around $229 a night for the room. The bathroom is lovely, all marble with a separate shower and tub. The shower has a dual headed spray which was really nice. The Acca Kappa toiletries smell amazing (white moss was the scent) and while the basics are there- they also have a nail file, and a toothbrush in the room, There is even a small flat screen TV in the bathroom so you can catch all of that day's news while you get ready in the morning. There is a restaurant in the hotel (Capital Grill) that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also there is a wine bar called Tastings that uses the Enomatic wine dispensing system that dispenses a taste or a glass of over 100 wines with a pre paid card. Not sure when my travels will take me back to Indy- but given the great night's sleep I had during this stay- I will definitely stay here again.While many people see The Conrad merely as Indianapolis' only five star hotel, for me, it is much, much more. My adventure in Indy began here. For almost a month it was our home. Work schedule and move in-schedule didn't gel so as we waited for our permanent residence to become available, and made The Conrad our temporary home. This was my first experience of life in The Circle City. The lobby is jaw droppingly beautiful. Top of the line amenities, friendliest staff, a great wine bar (Tastings) and Capital Grill (I will never forget the first time I had their Truffle Fries!!)  A salon and spa on the 6th floor Evan Todd- A pool, whirlpool and fitness center with all the basic cardio and weight machines. And the rooms!! Oh the rooms!! If you are lucky you will get a room that is East facing and just high enough so that you have a view of The Circle.  We were there  just as they were putting Lady Victory back a top Monument Circle, after her ""makeover"" before the SuperBowl. Also amazing sunset views from that window. Great bathroom with tv, shower and tub. Sheets that feel like they are 2000+ thread count and nightly turn down service. They treat all guests like family and will do anything to make you happy. As far as hotels go nobody does it better.No paper towels!! the baskets are for the towels, i Loved that! I'm easily entertained, discovered they have FREE  art shows in the Alcove &amp; on the 2nd floor ............Truly enjoyed that ,  Lee &amp; her staff could not have been more helpful next show First Friday 9/7I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating if there were not a few issues at hand.The hotel is very nice, the beds are very comfortable, the staff is very accommodating. When we checked in and they brought us up to our room it smelled like smoke and the smoke detector had been tampered with so it was buzzing.  They upgraded us, no charge, to a smoke free room (we choose a non smoking room due to my son's recent asthma attack).  The upgrade was AWESOME.Now the bad part.My mother in law needed an extra key to our room and I was not aware that she went down to get an extra key.  This was completely fine, BUT The front desk gave her the key after she said she was staying with us and had the same last name.They did not ask for ID nor did they call up to the room to confirm this information.  She just simply asked and got a key.I am staying here with my son, had I been staying alone - this is super scary that anyone can get a key to my  room.  The front desk person does not personally know me or my family.  She only knows that my husband's name is on the room.  I get that it is my mother in law and she knows me, had it been someone in passing or sitting next to me at a restaurant that happened to overhear where I was staying, that would have been different.I feel like there should be some type of protocol for safety like you need to check with the registered guest, check the persons ID or at the very least call the room to confirm.  Not all of those things, but at least something to check the validity of the person requesting a room access key.Classy hotel.  Best bed I've slept in away from home.  An Indianapolis mainstay.  Clean, beautiful rooms with attentive staff.This is still the nicest hotel in town. We've stayed here a half dozen times or so and about an equal amount at that other new hotel to the west, and I still like the Conrad for the extra touches they provide. For the record, we are loyal Marriott peeps. I'm talking 175 Marriott nights last year. We don't stay at Hilton properties often, but if we are going to stay at one in Indianapolis, it's going to be the Conrad. The service is exceptional, and the rooms have those extra little touches that are missing from the other hotels in the area. It feels more personal and not so much like a convention/next-guest-up hotel.We stopped by the Conrad this evening after having dinner at the Captial Grille, to inquire about a stay on our wedding night in March. A young man sporting a Britney Spears headset was behind the counter. He told us he was unable to book us a hotel that far out and in fact, he couldn't even get us a rate past today. This is not what I expected in a hotel of this caliber. I hope to encounter someone a bit more competant on the phone, although a tour or some sort of information/interest from the front desk would have been greatly appreciated. I suppose I could just make the reservations online, however, when it comes to my wedding night, I'd like to be able to firm up the details with a person.Absolutely FLIPPIN FANTASTIC choice for your hotel stay in Indy!  Zak &amp; I loved our stay here!  Pulling up in our Red Mustang Convertible - YES WE HAD TO RENT A RED MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE TO FIT IN!  It's the Midwest, dummies!  FORD!  So anyway, pulling up each day and turning our car over to the Valet guys was fun.  We loved how they were always ready to carry in anything we picked up during our day out on the town.  Either the Valet guys or Concierge were always available in the lobby no matter the hour to joke with us, laugh with us, carry our cases of water to the room for us, or let us know where the heck we could get some good wings at 11pm on a Monday night.  It was great! Our room was beautiful!  The bedding was more than cozy and I loved the separate tub - We had more than a few bubble baths with wine in hand during our stay.  The DUAL SHOWER HEADS were just WOW.  Massage and a new attitude for sure!  Heavenly.  The hotel is within walking of the circle and many restaurants.  You will not regret staying here at all. THE best choice.  This IS our choice for every stay while in Indy... Hands down.Wow!  I've stayed in higher rated hotels and not had a bed that was so amazing. The staff and amenities were on par too!  I'd definitely stay here again.","One day when I rule all, I will make my way through city after city and stay in luxurious comfort with courtesans a'plenty, eat rich foods, rub my expanding, hairy belly, and make my staff assure me that I am svelte and gorgeous. Until that day, I will look for good deals in incredible hotels that allow me to daydream. Hoo-whee mama! This place is awesome! First off, the location is fantastic. Centrally located just off that big-ass circle in the middle of downtown Indy lies the Conrad and it sits there gleaming and marbley and full of awesome. The lobby is ornate without being gauche. My shoes appropriately 'click-clacked' on the marble floor and reverberated off the high ceiling, but it wasn't out of place. There was plenty of chatter from people checking in and checking in. It helped that I made my entrance in slow-motion. After being checked in by one of the most helpful and cheery desk staffs, I made my way to my 18th floor room/suite/thingie. It really is too bad that I don't have a legion of courtesans. Yet. Because, this place was made to be 'appreciated.'The king-sized bed was opulent in shape, feel and decor. The carpet was interesting, soft-yet firm to the bare touch. I had plenty of seating options from the fabricked couch to the over-stuffed chair to the leather chair that sat behind my office-sized desk. My nightstands included pullouts that added more space for books and/or water. The butler nook held all sorts of food and drink items that I could want (plus a mirror in which I beheld a sexy beast). A flat-screen TV atop the wooden bureau. An actual hallway between the door and the bathroom took more than a few steps... which is good. Once I made it to the bathroom, I had to sit down. Double-sized vanity sink. Glass rainforest-style shower. Sunken bath tub on the other end of the spacious bathroom. Warmed tile flooring. TV AND phone by the toilet -- which was separated from the sink by a half wall. The combination of wood and marble made for a completely inviting and extremely masculine space which prompted me to do some very masculine things.I wept. I poured a scotch. I called Heidi Fleiss from the toilet phone. I have arrived.All things rad, no con to be had at the Conrad! Staying at the nicest hotel in the city you live in is a strange brew of a luxury. Honestly, one of the finest treats I've ever experienced was: ""hey my room's non-refundable and I can't make it town, so you should stay there!"" Tally ho!Who doesn't like entering their room to some smooth Rod Stewart and mood lighting? Who doesn't like a gazillion-thread count comforter &amp; sheet set? Crazy attentive staff fetching ice &amp; bar keys. TV in the bathroom. TV audio feed in the bathroom, too. Stellar views of downtown. The valet is pricey though at $33/overnight... watch it. I don't allow TVs &amp; beds to go together in my own home, so a giant a flat screen at the foot of the hotel bed... immediately made me feel like ""okay... just this one time."" And it was amazing. Funny thing... I wake up the next day &amp; I feel like I'm on vacation entirely... oh, wait, I live here! Go Indy!The nicest hotel I've ever been in? I think so!We attended the Conrad's Easter Brunch, and were deeply disappointed-very dirty heavily stained table cloth from earlier sittings- bland, unimaginative foods- stale/dry/mushy food that's been sitting out for 24 hours probably- And to boot, after charging $50 per adult (which we knew would be the price), they added a $20 ""service charge"" to our bill. For just two people!! Service was good, and I would probably have left a 15% tip, but adding a mandatory $20 charge (for a buffet)?? This mandatory charge was not mentioned anywhere by the way, not in advertising, not at the entrance, not by the table, nowhere. It just appeared on our check.Having had Easter brunches at hotels all over the country, this was by FAR the worst, and grossly overpriced with a large unadvertised mandatory service charge to boot. I'm happy to pay $50-60 for an Easter brunch, or even more, but not for what the Conrad offered. Deeply disappointing, really put a damper on our Easter Day.not too happy that the WiFi is tied to one device and not just one log in.  The amount of money that we paid is great for one log in if you could use it from any device.  Outside of that, the location is great (a block walk to the convention center) and the space is large enough to have friends over.  Also the price for parking is steep (it's valet only) but it's for the whole day so you can come and go as you please.The Conrad would have gotten five stars if it weren't for all the problems with my reservation. Then when I finally got a room they checked me out the next day and I still had one more night there. After all that was settled, I enjoyed my stay. Actually, I loved my stay. The bed was ohhhhh so comfy. I had a great view of the city from my room. Every staff member with the exception of the front desk guy at check in was pleasant and very accommodating. I loved the over sized towel in the bathroom, the dual shower head and the bath products. Excellent location. The valet was on top of everything, we had our car ready to go whenever we needed it. The food was fantastic. The fitness center is open 24 hours. If you work out on ""off"" hours, you'll be fine. I had to wait for a treadmill at 6am. However, if you want a cold bottle of water, head up there, you'll find one in the fridge. I just wish my check in experience was a tad better. PS thanks for the toothbrushI simply love this hotel.  Solid company with a boutique feel.  Best Conrad in the country.  Yes......in the heartland and not a major metropolis.  Just wish I could still get the high end coffee in the rooms.Try three things:1. Pillow menu2. Room show polish service3. Lobster eggs BenedictBest hotel in Indy. Beds are huge and very soft. Great restaurant in lobby. Very close to everything in downtown Indy..This has to be the best hotel in Indianapolis.  We arrived to find a beautiful lobby and a Capital Grille next door.  When we checked in we were asked if this was a special occasion, and since it was sorta a belated anniversary trip but really a ""omg, we're having a baby in a month and we won't be able to go anywhere again"" trip, we answered that it was our anniversary.  The prize was a free breakfast at Capital Grille the following morning.  The room was immaculate, with a nice sitting area, and even a television in the bathroom!  The staff was wonderful, as upon our return from Fogo de Chao (only 2 blocks away), the room was nicely dimmed for the close of our romantic evening.Breakfast was great and we were very sad to leave the Conrad.  This is one of only three Conrads in the US.  We have only one more to go!So, you know how you watch tv and you see someone who has made a hotel their home?  Well the Conrad is definitely that type of hotel.  Located in the heart of downtown the Conrad has an old feel although it was just built about 3 years ago. The staff is great and restaurant attached is wonderful but  what do you think will be the talk of the hotel?THE BATHROOM!!  OMG!! Spa tub..separate shower with dual shower heads...AWESOME!!  I could not imagine waking up in that room everyday because I would never make it on time for anything! I would like to thank you Conrad for an excellent night of sleep and a wonderful bathroom.We spent more for one night at the Conrad than for the other 5 nights on our trip but it was so, so worth it. Valet parking is pricey compared to the other hotels in the area - $33 but the valets are very helpful in getting things from the car if you ask. The room has a huge flat screen television and there is a DVD player you can connect. The king sized bed has luxurious linens and is quite comfortable. There is plenty of room to spread out with a couch and a chair, a coffee table and a large desk. Tastings wine bar is loud and oddly self service. You buy a card and then pour your wine. The Capital Grill is where breakfast is served and we had coupons for free continental breakfast. Each of us had 3 pastries and a large dish of berries. It was plenty of food. The coffee was surprisingly weak. The pool is beautiful.  The spa was closed at our visit.  The staff was wonderful. Lee, our concierge was quite helpful. The Conrad has to be the best hotel in Indy and worth the price.This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The best service, no really, the best. The rooms are outstanding and the location is great if your in town for a convention. If you have the ability to stay here then do it. I think that there are only 4 or 5 Conrad's in the USA.Um hello it is a Conrad... Of coarse it was fantastic on every level &amp; a Capital Grill inside the Conrad that serves breakfast! BOOMCan never go wrong with the Conrad.  Comfy sheets, killer location.  It's perfect.Spectacular service, delicious room service, helpful and courteous staff.Next Gen Con, this is where to be. It's part of the block but no events are held here, so you can get to all parts of the con while in the air conditioned corridors and skywalks.It's clean, comfortable, beautiful, spacious, and quiet. Worth every penny. They'll book your car from the airport at a discounted rate; do that instead of getting a cab. It's close to the same price anyway, and you do NOT want to be in an un-airconditioned vehicle in Indy during Gen Con. Notably, the Jonas Brothers were apparently staying there, and when I and my husband walked out, we had to avoid paparazzi--no, I am not kidding.  Apparently, it's the best place in town, but you wouldn't know that by the prices they're charging. One of the best hotel values ever.This is a great hotel. Nice rooms, great food,  nice views of Monument circle. Quiet, room.The staff is very professional, very nice, on top of things.The location in Downtown Indianapolis is perfect. The hotel is not cheap. but it is worth the pricestayed locally for a downtown wedding at the Conrad. based upon the prices we expected more. we upgraded to 1 br corner suite. Marks on the walls, stains on ceiling above bed, one robe, no slippers. honor bar product was so old the dust and stains on the tops of the cans were a turn off. the topper was finding a previous guest's tennis shoes and opened and uneaten honey bun in the dresser drawer. staff came to retrieve the clothes and food but no mention of it at check out or any other time. room service food was good but the interface with the kitchen was one guy on a cell phone who took orders while delivering our order and a follow up call to room service had bad reception as he was in transit in an elevator. seemed like amateur service for the top of the line Hilton. will try the JW before returning here.Hotel awesomeness at its best. Great Hotel, great service, great restaurant, great bar. 50'' Flat screen in room, flat screen in the bathroom, capital grille and a wine tasting bar all wrapped up in one decent price. Food was great, wine bar was cool and the service was awesome. Traveling to Indy this is the place for you.I attended a pretty large holiday party at the Conrad and it was fantastic.  Great food, the best formal service I've ever seen.  Food delivery was a seamless dance that quickly moved from table to table.  The dinner, drinks, banquet room, etc. were all top notch too.I came home and craved a refreshing green apple. Oh marketing ploys that never work..the green apples everywhere is a brilliant idea! The tao of Conrad ala green apple. Refreshing, elegant, positive, understated and discreetly present. Conrad Brussels was one of my favourite places to stay, ever.  Stunned that we live so close to another Conrad gem.  Since this is a chain within a chain, I feel no issue with saying that the Conrad Chicago doesn't hit the mark like the Conrad Indianapolis or Brussels. The suites were all booked; however, double room is still worth the money without feeling like a cheap space filler. Elegant spacious bathrooms, separate shower and larger soaking tub, soft bedding, tv in main room as well as the WC.  The pool &amp; spa area and the Capital Grille were stunning additions. Quite a few European hotels have the Pool, spa, steam room/sauna with a well appointed locker room, so few places in the US attempt it.  The amenities at this location succeed in adding activities, health and benefit and no doubt have taken your needs into account.  Forgot about the winter bikini line monster and suddenly you realize, they have disposable razors and shaving creme. Are you a never nude?  Help yourself to a robe before your steam room or sauna.  So considerate and well attended. The Capital Grill will get it's own review but make no mistake, it fits and adds to the splendor of the hotel.As novel length as this review has become, let me finish with high praise for the staff.  They noticed a possible error in our reservation and I received a call with assurance it could and would be fixed as well.  In 2011, I am so amazed to say...it was.  Follow through was flawless.  From check in, to extending our stay, locking away our techno gadgets, to gratis water..this is the place we will go to first for business or leisure in Indianapolis.  It was so great, I have purposely starting looking for more clients there!","Just lovely. If I die and go to hotel heaven this is where I shall land. I mean just perfect and plush in every way. Jeez Louise if you don't find the Conrad stunningly perfect I think you must be beyond spoiled. If you be bitch'in about The Conrad you truly be a bitch!One of my favorite places to stay when in Indianapolis. If you are looking for quick and friendly service, the Conrad's staff has it down to a science. There's free wireless internet throughout the hotel. The hotel is near the Circle Centre Mall and the Arts Garden. The Conrad, in my book, certainly lives up to it's 5 star rating.Rooms - well appointed if a little on the small side. A nice king size bed with plenty of pillows, a loveseat, 2 chairs, a desk and a dresser round out the furniture. There's also a 42"" plasma HD tv on the wall and a DVD player in the dresser. In the bathroom there's a stand-up shower, full tub, sink and a 15"" flat screen tv. The mini bar has coffee and tea available, as well as snacks and drinks.Restaurants - I only ate breakfast at Vitesse, their casual restaurant. I had the continental breakfast each day I was there. I didn't eat at the Capital Grille.We splurged on a night here for a special occasion and it was wonderful!  we had actually stayed here before for work, and we were sad we were there for less than 24 hours.  I do think the valet parking is overkill with all the ""nice"" cars parked out front, right in the path of the Cultural Trail, but inside is a great experience.  I do remember using the car service when I was there last, which was very convenient, and everyone was very polite.  On their website, you can option to automatically upgrade your room if available for cheaper than if you booked it outright, so we ended up with a corner suite!  Big bedroom with a sitting couch and flatscreen TV, 2 bathrooms, each with a small flatscreen, double shower heads and full size tub (with a detachable spray head and extra high water level safety drain), sitting room with desk and couches and another big flatscreen....it's almost as big as my apt! Housekeeping came by in the evening for turndown service and put out a couple bottles of water and turned on some mood music and lighting in the bedroom.  :)  The bed is super comfy and I walked around in the robe and slippers after my extra long bath during which I watched TV. We didn't partake of anything in the mini bar, but they have full (and mini) bottles of wine and drinks and wine glasses and just about anything you could think of to splurge on, as everything was typically overpriced. what do you expect?  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and encourage anyone else who can afford it to stay here as well. Oh yeah, we did have breakfast at the Capital Grille (ordering off the menu was way cheaper than booking the room and breakfast package, especially the vat of oatmeal with fixin's for $5!). And of course, there's Tastings downstairs.  Valet parking is $33 for a night, but if you don't wanna pay that much, i'd park at the mall or something for way cheaper.Nicest hotel in Indythe best way i could describe the conrad would be to liken it to an iphone: a neat, amazing little machine with lots of cool perks, but lacking basic functions. the conrad is ~le swank hotel~: huge comfy bed; a soaking tub; bathroom WITH TV (i totally watched it while peeing every time) and phone (no, i have not called while peeing every time); huge-screen lg tv in the room; nice muted lighting as opposed to the usual harsh white bulbs you'll find; verrrry helpful staff (my boyfriend's car battery died in the parking garage, it was less then five minutes for a guy with a little  jumper box to save the day); a super speedy elevator, the fastest in the city according to the guy who helped us with our luggage; and the capitol grille in the lobby has the best onion soup i've ever had.however, ~le swank hotel~: does NOT have free parking (or even cheap parking, but i guess that's typical for downtown indy); no wifi, not even pay wifi, which is almost insulting considering the hampton, multiple drury inns, and holiday inn express we stayed in prior while on the road ALL had free wifi; our lovely dual-head-porn-movie shower leaked alllll over the floor, the seal at the bottom is not so seal-y; the lock on the bathroom door didn't work, it looked like the hole was cut too low for the bolt; and according to the boy, the one-cup coffee maker made crap coffee, though he is a real coffee snob, and apparently has not had one good cup thus far this trip.so probably the biggest gripe is the lack of internet. this is not the 90's, where the internet is a new, exciting frontier filled with magic and wonder and the only porn is ASCII pictures of boobs downloaded over an hour on 28k dial-up. you are ~le swank hotel~, stick some routers in strategic spots and get on the train. re-seal the shower, fix the lock, and we are in super-business.This is probably the best hotel in downtown Indianapolis, and I've stayed at many of them. The room is fabulous, if a bit small. The bed was probably the most comfortable one I've slept on in recent memory. The bathrooms are huge and have both a tub and a shower. Twenty-four hour room service for when you need ice cream and coffee at 2:00 am. There's a great steak place, Capital Grille, on site, as well as another restaurant that I haven't tried. The rooms have mini-bars. The lobby bar is nice. We found the staff helpful during our few interactions with them. On our way out, we asked where we could buy a couple bottles of water, and they gave us bottled water for free.i only stayed there for two nights and i can't evaluate the room service (didn't order any), the restaurant (didn't eat there), or the spa (didn't use it), but the room itself was very nice.  gotta love the flat screen tv in the bathroom, that's the lap of luxury in my book.  i would have liked slightly more extensive exercise facilities (there were 2 treadmills and 2 elliptical machines, so while it was pretty much empty and i didn't have a problem getting an elliptical, i would've been annoyed if that wasn't the case, and there were very few weight machines as well), but that's really my only complaint.  also, i found the staff to be very friendly -- perhaps too much so -- but that's better than not friendly enough.","['nice', 'hotel', 'beautiful', 'heart', 'downtown', 'close', 'mall', 'bars', 'restaurants', 'rooms', 'large', 'spacious', 'really', 'loved',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/indianapolis-marriott-downtown-indianapolis-2,Indianapolis Marriott Downtown,3.5,$$$,84,"We stayed here during hubby's trade show at WWETT 2016.  Great hotel with all the amenities, super convenient to nearby restaurants, shopping mall, attractions, Indiana State Capitol, Convention Center, and Colts Stadium.  The fitness center is immaculate.  Our son enjoyed the heated indoor pool, no hot tub though.  If you get a chance, check out the cool-looking metal pool.  Ironically, I enjoyed the laundry facility equipped with TV and microwave...it's the little things.  Having the ability to wash and dry clothes, especially when traveling with the family is a bonus!    Overall, Marriott's hospitality is exceptional.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Knocked off one star due to their small and uncomfortable pillows, couldn't sleep well.  Starbucks is located in the spacious lobby.  There are a couple of restaurants to choose from on-site, one is Champions and the other is Circle City Bar and Grill.  We dined at both, each one offers a different ambiance.  I would definitely stay here again once they get firmer pillows =)My company had a function that required large meeting space and the Marriott fit the bill. The location downtown is close to many attractions and people can walk pretty much anywhere.  Although I did not stay in a room I did see a lot of this property. It is some what outdated, the decor needs a facelift.  The carpet is very busy - think early 90's. During the meeting we had lunch. The staff was very attentive and quickly took away empty plates.  The food was good - it was standard hotel catering. When cooking for that many people nothing is going to be horribly fresh. I had chicken and beef. The beef was cooked to medium rare and was tasty. The chicken was pretty dry. The soup was tasty and the salad bar was solid.  The deserts came right out of a box.  The meeting room was plenty big for our group but it was freezing cold and no one seemed to know how to adjust the temperature. For a meeting it was a fine experience.We were staying here the night before a marathon hoping to get a good night's sleep. That did not happen. We'll never stay here again. It was actually the second time we'd been here, the first visit we thought was a fluke. But this second confirmed that this place is in no way worth the money.Pros - 1. It's in a good location, convenient to everything on the west side of downtown Indy.2. It was clean.Cons - 1. We were supposed to have a king bed, instead we were given 2 doubles. The girl who checked us in never bothered to mention that the kings were unavailable.2. The return air vents work like an intercom between the rooms, everything can be heard through them. Some teenage boys decided to have some fun with them by yelling obscenities through the vents so all the rest of us could hear how immature they were. I'm incredibly grateful we didn't have young children with us.3. The thermostat is directly beneath the heating / cooling vent. So once that 3 cubic foot area is cooled to the proper temperature, it shuts itself off and the rest of the room is still stifling.4. The pillows and comforter were are filled with down. I absolutely hate down pillows, there's a reason mankind invented foam pillows. But evidently this Marriott doesn't believe in providing an alternative.Hotel was very clean. We stayed on 14th floor right across from the ice machine. Walls were very thin. We heard Hall noises all night long. View out window was great. Direct view of victory field. All employees were friendly.Meh. I tend to like Marriott's but then realized that I've actually only liked the Renaissance and the Marriott's in ""higher end"" cities like Maui and Marco. I felt this hotel was your basic run of the mill larger chains. Stayed here one night while traveling through Indy and for over $200/night, I expected more. Our room was actually big enough as we had an end unit (which kept the hallway noise to a minimum) but the bathroom was on the small side. And while our room seemed clean, the bathroom was disgusting as I found some kind of red stain on the toilet base and shower curtain. Housekeeping really needs to step up the game here. My stars go to the valet/bellhop as they were friendly and professional as well as the girl at the desk upon checkin.The front desk staff was friendly. My room was normal, nothing fancy, nothing horrible. The vent in the shower is a little creepy, and the room was supposed to have a microwave but did not. If you elect to buy the wifi you can choose if you want dialup speeds or speeds capable of streaming. I didn't use it so I can't review the actual speeds. Concierge wasn't helpful, wound up using Yelp and Google to find what I needed instead. Checkout was quick and easy. The valet team should train the rest of the hotel staff, these guys provided exceptional service. Despite the fact they had to run to a garage and get the car, they always had it ready for you with the heater on within minutes. They were friendly, attentive, had a sense of humor, etc. For being the ones that have to stand in the cold and run back and forth between a garage, they definitely provided the best customer service.Don't be fooled by the the nice entrance and lobby of this dump. It's a trick...Dark bathroom looks like it hasn't been updated since the 70sHallway carpet smells damp and musty,  the room carpet isn't much better.  ceilings have the 80s style popcorn. Shower is sluggish. Drain stopper didn't work, No hair dryer. Sounds of pipes all night. No ice on our floor or 3 others I checked on, what the fvck.  For the 230 a night,  asked for a refund after being in the room for less than 10 minutes and they refused saying we would be charged the full amount. Would never recommend this place to anyone,  find a super 8 or motel 6, this place sucks.I've stayed at a couple of other hotels in this downtown/convention center area of Indianapolis (the Westin and the JW Marriott). I didn't have very high expectations, as I generally don't for convention hotels, but our stay included a few pleasant surprises which made the experience positive overall.When we arrived, we were checked in by Prince. I don't usually chat with people but he was so friendly that my wife (also very friendly) jumped into the check-in process. He was asking whether we wanted a king room or two doubles and my wife said she really wanted a view. So, Prince gave us a room on the top floor of the hotel with a nice view to the West of downtown. Prince pointed out the Starbucks in the lobby and my wife said she was looking forward to going there asap, so he gave her a coupon for a free drink.Our room was spacious with a nice sitting chair and ottoman, comfortable bed, big bathroom, L-shaped desk, and connectors to hook my computer to the TV (which I did to look at some detailed tables for work).The internet costs $13/day (typical business hotel), but it was fast and reliable and we had no trouble hooking up my computer, our phones, and an iPad and a second computer to the same connection.The cleaning staff was excellent. After our first night we had our toiletries strewn all over the counter, and we returned to find wash cloths placed under each collection of things. A small but nice touch.We had a nice late night snack and cocktail at the hotel bar, had no trouble getting our car or a cab from the valet, walked all over downtown Indy indoors through the convention center's tunnel system, and were happily greeted every time we returned to the hotel.I'm shocked to see so many low ratings here. Our experience was very good.My new husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon weekend and had a great experience.  The only reasons I didn't give five stars were the expensive parking and lack of free wi-fi.We checked in after a hectic wedding day and were very tired.  My husband said something about the wedding and we both laughed.  The person asked if we had just gotten married and actually gave us an upgraded corner room when we said yes.The room itself was pleasant.  We had a king-sized bed and a large bathroom.  The armchair and desk chair were both very comfortable.  The only thing that surprised me about the room was the lack of a fan in the bathroom.  We were very comfortable all weekend and slept well with a minimum of noise until morning hours when people were leaving their rooms.The location of this hotel was excellent for going to Lucas Oil Stadium.  We never even set foot outside when we went to the Colts game.  This was much appreciated since it was quite cold that day.  We used the room service for supper that night and everything was delicious and the temperatures were appropriate for both the hot and cold items ordered.We had to leave early on Monday morning to get back to work (4:30 a.m.) and the valet staff was prompt and courteous.  They even had the heater running for us and helped us with our bags at the beginning and end of the trip.  We had a very nice stay and will definitely consider staying here if we need lodging in Indianapolis again.Lobby and meeting space are very nice. Great employees. Easy access over the bridge to the convention center,  Circle center mall,  stadium, Westin, restaurants,  etc.  Never even have to go outside.  The rooms are TIRED. Refrigerator on top of a counter.  Wasted space in bathroom. You'll feel like you were transported to 2001.  Time for an update.After traveling all day and arriving at the hotel @ 3am Judy was extremely helpful in finding a room with a King bed, even though the room style booked was unavailable.  She went out of her way to find me a suitable room.The room was very nice and the bed by far has been the most comfortable that I have experienced in my many years of traveling.  All the staff was courteous and extremely helpful.  The valet parking @$42.00/night was a little steep in my opinion,  you can self park for 27..00/night in the same garage which has an elevator to the hotel.Has a Sbux, Champions Sports Bar &amp; another bar &amp; grille inside the hotel plus the hotel had an enclosed Skywalk to the convention center.We were in town to attend a graduation at the convention center so the Marriott was a perfect location. The skywalk entrance was great since it was 90degrees out. We actually got the room on Priceline for under $100 which was nice considering advertised rate was $189. Valet parking was $42... And self park was full... Which was surprising given the valet said they were only at 10% occupancy. That's a bit outrageous in my opinion... If I were staying more than one night I would have had to find alternate parking. The room was average... Clean... ample towels...cozy bed. The bathroom was a nice size but it had no exhaust fan!! After showering the mirrors were so steamed you couldn't see in them. Ladies... Bring your own hair dryer... The I room dryer feels like someone's hot breath on you, had no real power to it, but for the night I managed. We did call down for toothbrushes realizing we left ours, the staff did quickly have them sent to the room. Valets were very friendly and helpful. Offered directions and review on local attractions. Overall... What I would expect at a Marriott.I wish I could give this hotel a higher rating because it truly was a pleasure to stay here. From the moment I checked in to the moment I stepped in my cab to the airport I was greeted with a smile and help at every moment. The staff here truly was trained right. It seemed whenever I needed something from my hotel room, to extra soap, to getting on wifi, to setting up my conference room, someone was easily found and ready to help me. I do not think I have ever had a better experience at a hotel than I did on this business  trip. I have 0 complaints which is shocking, something usually always happens. While I have no desire to visit Indy again, if I had to go the Marriott Downtown is where I would stay hands down and without a doubt!I stayed here for business at the end of July. I've never stayed at a worse hotel in this price range.The conference rooms are ok, but forget about getting food/drink service unless you want to pay an enormous premium. There is nothing nearby, so if you're staying and working there, be prepared to have every meal at one of the hotel restaurants. Breakfast $18, Lunch $25, Dinner $25+The room I stayed in was, perhaps, the most underwhelming part of my stay. Ice bucket, small flatscreen, insanely uncomfortable king bed, Low-speed, High cost WiFi($16 per day), and it came complete with two clipped toenails in the bathroom doorway that were present when I checked in and present when I checked out seven days later.Do you like to sleep at a temperature of your choosing? There is a temperature control in the room, but I think it's just for show. I set it to 68 degrees, and my watch read 76. I then set it to 65 degrees, and my watch read 76.Pros: plenty of elevators, so the wait was minimal; hotel food was very good (I was here on a corporate event), very quick and gracious staff. Cons: at 10:00 PM, they had their cleaning staff cleaning rooms on my floor: chattering and laughing loudly, vacuuming, and banging into furniture. I had to be THAT GUY and call down to the front desk and complain (I hate being that guy - but I was tired!). Our room was TINY (especially for having to share with someone else). The rooms need serious updating: they only have those worthless hair dryers that are attached to the walls (my coworker and I were kicking ourselves for not bringing our own);  and no ventilation fan inside the bathroom. Both things made getting ready in the morning a little difficult - you're trying to be polite and respectful to your roommate while still prepping for business appearances. The second day once we had a pre-planned routine down it went smoother. However, this hotel accommodates A LOT of corporate meetings and retreats, so these seem like minor discrepancies they might have addressed and fixed. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. However, during a lunch break in-between meetings, once we had left, the staff rearranged the rooms, setup chairs, etc., to prep for the next meeting. In the process, they moved our personal items (purses, messenger bags) without informing us to take them or where they had placed them. While the staff were very quick and executed the transition well, this was something that caused mild panic when we returned and couldn't find our items - a forewarning would have been the better way to go.First let me state the positive things. The staff was very nice, if not exceptional. Frankly that's harder to accomplish than the things that were not great, so they should be commended for that. My wife booked this room for one night downtown for my birthday. We have two little ones so a night away is like a gift from heaven. The primary thing we look forward to is the sleep. I literally haven't slept past 7am in three years, so this was the greatest birthday present ever. Our room, however, was not conducive to this great gift. My belief is that hotels have to do 2 things well to have a satisfied customer, a great sleep and a great shower. The bed was ok, the pillows ok too. However the room lacked one important feature, the ability to leave a fan circulating the block out the constant activity that comes with a large hotel. I don't think I've ever been in a room that has no fan control feature on a thermostat, but we found it. So instead of a glorious sleep, we listened to our neighbors on the floors around us slamming doors, flushing toilets, and copulating. Needless to say, it wasn't the best sleep of my life. I'm sure they save a boatload on electrical costs with this limitation of the fan in rooms. Not sure it's worth the frustration of guests. If you're looking for a room in downtown Indy where you can get sleep, I encourage another location.I avoided posting this until now because I was trying to resolve it directly with Marriott but since this location is a Franchisee and not owned by Marriott they don't seem to care what happens here which is another reason to avoid it at all costs.I stayed at the Marriott Indianapolis Downtown for the 2015 Final Four Tournament weekend.We placed a total of nine Final Four tickets for the Championship session on April 6th into our room safe.  The safe was securely locked with a personal code and we left the hotel to have lunch.When we returned to our room we noticed that the in-room safe was unlocked and all nine tickets were missing!!!  The hotel sent a security officer, named Thomas Niemeier to investigate.  After an investigation, Niemeier abruptly stated that he had checked with all the members of his security and engineering team from the Marriott staff and definitively, no one had gone into the safe.  At this point, we contacted the Indianapolis Police, who sent an officer that same evening (April 5th) at around 7:00 pm to take an incident report.  Subsequently, an investigation was opened. Five days later (well after we left town), on April 10, 2015, the Indianapolis Police Detective contacted me and stated that the Marriott had admitted to the Indianapolis Police that the Marriott staff had indeed OPENED AND EMPTIED THE SAFE CONTENTS! The hotel claimed that they emptied the safe and threw away the tickets because they believed they were tickets from the previous game which was already played (the date for Monday's Championship session was clearly marked on the tickets).  They told the police that this was accidentally done and there was no criminal intent so the police closed the investigation since they admitted to the action.  We are fairly certain that the tickets were taken and quickly sold to someone (the street value was well over $5000) and that they were not discarded as they are claiming.  If you have ever felt secure leaving valuables in your room safe at a hotel... Don't!  At least not at this hotel. They literally came into our room and during our stay and emptied our safe!If the tickets were truly taken by mistake why were they not held by the hotel and when we inquired hours later given back to us?  Instead Niemeier the head of their ""security"" team lied to our faces and claimed ignorance at the time.The Indianapolis Downtown Marriott showed a total disregard for our property and were deliberately dishonest about their investigation. The act of the Marriott's ""security"" team in emptying the hotel safe while it was clear that there were occupants in the room, evidenced by our personal belongings, luggage and a credit card security on file with the hotel, is absolutely unbelievable.In order to replace the nine tickets to the Final Four Championship game, we had to pay substantially more money for significantly inferior tickets.  On April 6th, the ticket market for Final Four Championship tickets increased exponentially.  The negligent and criminal actions of the Marriott's employees made our trip to Indianapolis a nightmare. We have contacted Marriott's corporate office who has since denied ownership for the property since this particular Marriott is a franchise, they take no responsibility.  We have contacted Andrew Seal who apparently is the General Manager of the hotel and have received no response.  Marriott referred us to the franchisee.  Letters sent directly to the franchisee have gone unanswered although their insurance company states they are reviewing the matter.  PLEASE DO NOT STAY AT THE MARRIOTT INDIANPOLIS DOWNTOWN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  What happened to us is a disgrace.  I've never had such a horrible experience at a hotel.  They have admitted fault and don't seem to care.  I would love to see them respond to this online as I can't seem to get a response otherwise.May I just say that if I could give this hotel 10 stars, I would!I stayed there during December and the service, from the moment I walked through the doors until the moment I checked out was unparalleled.  A cheerful demeanor and a smile can really make a customer's day...especially when you are exhausted and have been traveling all day!  I also had to call the Marriott rewards customer service department regarding my account . I spoke to an agent named Lisa.  She's FABULOUS and really went above and beyond!   I wish that all hotels no matter how big or small would take that extra bit...to make their customers feel appreciated!Keep up the GREAT work!There was one and only one negative to my stay at the Marriott: the lack of free wi-fi. It's ridiculous in this day and age that despite paying however much it is for the hotel room, I have to fork over an outrageous fee for wi-fi.Otherwise, my stay was as great as it could possibly be. The lady at the front desk was very polite and actually gave me an upgraded room which was incredible. Quite possibly the best hotel room I have ever stayed in, and that's no small statement. The upgraded room had a bar area, large dining room table, big screen HDTVs in both living room and bedroom, and, my favorite, a piano. That was so very cool, I will never forget my stay at the Marriott because of that piano. (I don't play piano, I just thought it was the coolest thing to have a piano in my room.)The Marriott is about a block away from the JW. They're both nice, tho the JW is certainly newer. Personally, I'd be happy with either, so I'd say go by whichever is cheaper/available at the time. (JW requires you to pay for internet as well fyi).The fiancee and I drove to Indy for Thanksgiving and stayed at the Marriott Downtown.  It was our first time staying there.  The hotel was readily accessible by car.  The hotel common areas and guest rooms were modern and clean.The pros:  Great downtown location within walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium and Bankers Life (unfortunately the Colts and Pacers weren't playing during our visit), and downtown restaurants and bars.  Affordable room with government/military rate.  The rooms had very comfortable beds and fluffy pillows.  Housekeeping staff kept the room clean and stocked with fresh towels.  Starbucks kiosk, which accepted the Starbucks Reward card, in the lobby.  The cons:  Parking in the underground garage was exorbitant at $30/day.  No free in-room internet ($14.95) unless you're Marriott Rewards Gold level or higher.  Starbucks was only open during the morning hours.  All in all, we had a pretty good stay and it was still cheaper for us than flying.  The next time we're in town, the Marriott Downtown will be at the top of the list of places to stay.","So I will preface this review with noting that I booked this hotel through Priceline's Name Your Price option. I bid on a four star hotel in downtown Indianapolis. This was the hotel I was booked in and it is not a four star hotel and I will explain below. I complained to Priceline citing my issues and they punt it back to the hotel who said they wouldn't do anything for us. The staff at the hotel are nice enough. Everyone is pleasant, says hello and smiles. Their uniforms are worn and tattered much like the hotel. First the common areas: The lobby has stains on the floors near the elevator. The carpets are old and dingy. The pool and whirlpool area has so much potential but is also rundown. The pool's gutters were dirty and the pool is metal, not tile, giving a harsh industrial feel. The hot tub was closed during our stay but I wouldn't go near it if you paid me. Parking is astronomical, especially when you can park at a meter and pay from your smartphone ;) Now our room: drapes, dirty and ripped. Walls, dirty &amp; wall paper was beginning to peel, shower head had some green buildup on it - gross- there was no air vent in the bathroom but some odd vent that was rusty next to the shower head. The bathmat was a rolled up piece of plastic that looked like it was about 10 years old. Hair dryer had no power. The fridge was not cold at all and had mold growing in it (very dangerous for anyone but particularly for someone with cystic fibrosis). We did ask for another fridge which was brought up but it never got cold-we had to keep medication on ice for the two nights we were there. There is no free in room wifi or even bottled water. There is a vending machine on every floor but we had to go to three floors before we found one that worked. I think Priceline just looks at a brand name for its star system and not the actual hotel. There is  a newer hotel , the JW Marriott across the street  &amp; I am sure that's got to be a 5 star. We stopped in a couple of other hotels since we'll be back in Indy soon  and the Westin next door and the Hampton  nearby are both much cleaner and you get free wifi in your room!! Imagine that!!! I'll post some pictures of our room &amp; you be the judge. Four stars?!? I think not!! We've stayed in a three star Raddison in Racine, WI every year that is way cleaner and offers more amenities.The staff was amazing.  Katie at the front desk was personable and helpful. She was wonderful, you should hire like 30 more of her.  The Valet staff was great as well.  The not so great was the housekeeping.  The staff was friendly enough, but there was a piece of hairy scotch tape up high on the wall by the bed. It was high--but low enough to catch  my eye.   Could have been there for years for all I know.  Pretty gross and hence subtracting a star.   Aside from that--even at full capacity the hotel was fairly quiet and the shower was good. The beds were comfortable.  It was a positive experience!Upon check-in I was given a suite upgrade, which was nice.The internet did not work during business hours on the only business day of my stay.  I placed a call to the front desk, and I got what I would expect at the Fairfield, ""Sir, it is working fine down here.  You will have to call the vendor.""Ugg, so I called the vendor who was confused for five minutes, then mentioned they were conducting maintenance.  Call #2 to the front desk, who was not aware of the maintenance, but was now going to allow the engineer to grace me with his over the phone presence.Call #3 and engineer informs me that the maintenance was actually conducted the night before, and probably the access points just needed to be reset.An hour later, and I placed call #4 to the front desk to ask for an ETA.  I was told in an exhausted voice that she had no idea, and I was to be called upon completion.Call never came.  After I attended another business event for three hours, it was finally running.To some this is probably a very whimsical concern.  For a businessman who paid $250 a night, please keep the fancy room and give me the same basic service I can now obtain at almost every McDonalds on the planet.Clean rooms, ok concierge lounge (Gold Elite and higher), and connected to the skywalks that will take you through most of the convention center areas in town.Parking is a tad expensive but you can use the garage and walk down. There is practically no view to be had due to the location of the property, but hey, you're here to sleep as a business traveler, not as a vacationer.Otherwise, it's in a prime location next to a lot of stuff so you can keep yourself well entertained when you're not conferencing or working.I stayed here a few months ago for a work conference, and this place did not disappoint. Everyone was super friendly, and even though the place was packed due to the huge convention across the street, they were always cheerful and willing to help with anything you would need. Several times I asked for directions, and the staff at the front desk were happy to help me. My room had a wall light that made a loud buzzing sound, and when I called to ask for maintenance, they sent someone right away to fix it. I noticed someone else said this place had very thin walls, but I have to disagree. I'm a very light sleeper and thin walls really bother me, but I heard nothing from my neighbors during my stay.The room itself was incredibly comfortable and spacious. My nights here were probably the most restful I've ever had in a hotel - that is one awesome bed. But one downside is that my allergies started going haywire, and after my second night I realized it was because the bedding was made of down feathers. I hadn't seen anywhere anything that said they used down comforters and pillows - if I had, I would have requested an allergy-free room. I had booked the room through the convention people, so I don't know if that was why I hadn't been warned about it. Perhaps if I had booked through Marriott itself, I would've been told. By the time I did realize it, I couldn't move rooms since the place was full, but the front desk staff immediately sent someone up with feather-free pillows and a regular blanket.Only other downside to my stay here was the elevator situation. They had six elevators for 19 floors, which you'd think would be sufficient, except I only ever saw two functioning at any one time. It was always a really long wait for the elevator, no matter when I needed to use it. It was especially bad after the gala, when everyone decided to go back upstairs at the same time. The gala was on the 2nd floor, but the wait was so long that people went down to the first floor so they could hop on the elevator, and by the time it got to the 2nd floor, the elevator was packed and none of us could get on. I waited no less than 20 minutes before getting on one that was going down, just so I could stay in there for when it went back up.Overall I really did enjoy my stay here. It has a fantastic location in downtown Indianapolis - and the connection to the skywalk was a LIFESAVER for this constantly freezing Floridian visiting in January. I loved how I could go across to the convention center (my second home during my trip), and from there go down to the mall, all without ever having to step foot outside. I don't know if I'll ever have a need to come back to Indy, but if I do I will absolutely stay here again (and make sure to request a hypoallergenic room).This was my preferred Indianapolis hotel prior to the JW Marriott's arrival across the street.  This hotel offers excellent rooms/suites, a great concierge lounge, and my favorite Indy hotel pool.  On occasion, I stay at this hotel especially if I need to print documents at their business center.  The JW Marriott does not have a ""free"" business center.  The JW Marriott has a FedEx office.  I'd rather have complimentary printing service.We stayed here for a recent long weekend (Fri-Sun nights). We arrived on Valentine's Day and my husband had arranged for flowers to be in the room when we arrived. That didn't happen, but the flowers were found and delivered while we were in the bar, along with complimentary wine and chocolate, which was nice.The staff was very helpful and friendly wherever we went. We had a family package which included a free breakfast buffet for 2 adults and one child each morning, and a free pizza dinner one of the nights. They very considerately allowed our teen to eat the breakfast for free also. The beds were very comfortable, as were the pillows (a rare thing in a hotel, IMO!). We were in room 329, which was great for access to the pool and gym, but had a view of a wall, which wasn't very picturesque. The room was fairly quiet, except for the idiots knocking on our door at 1am on Friday, but that could happen anywhere. (We did bring our white noise machine and I'm sure that helped).The only drawbacks were:no free wifi in the rooms (only in the lobby area). Seriously? Even the cheapest motels we've stayed in have had free wifino fan in the bathroomRidiculous daily cost to park (which I suppose is standard in any large city downtown hotel, but still *ouch!*)The pool and hot tub area need major updating. The pool and hot tub looked rusty and worn.The location was good. We were able to walk to most of what we wanted to see (capitol, war memorial, several museums, NCAA Hall). There must have been a couple of big events on Saturday, because the lobby on Sunday morning looked like a convention floor, the line at Starbucks was about 50 people long, and the wait for an elevator was so long we gave up and sought out the stairs. The gym was fine, and not crowded any of the three mornings I used it.We'd defnintely stay here again.Hotel is in a great location. Stayed for a conference, the best part is the sky walk. In the rain and cold weather you don't have to go outside which is a plus. The staff is impressive and extremely helpful. Check was smooth and the hotel made they took care of the marriott rewards members.There was nothing great and nothing terrible about my stay. I got a decent price on priceline and stayed only one night for a wedding at the Columbia Club. They are fairly aggressive about trying to valet your car and giving your luggage to a bell hop. Valet is $35/day, self park is $30/day and on the weekend you can park across the street for $15/day and walk across the skywalk to the hotel. (that garage only takes cash, btw) The skywalk connecting the convention center and many of the hotels makes this hotel convenient for getting around downtown in cold weather. Please note that the skywalk is essentially closed by 10 pm.Check in at this hotel is 4 pm and check-out is 11 am. Because of this we didn't have any chance to use any of the amenities like the pool during our one night stay.Overall nothing here was great and there were a number of negative things. There is no free WiFi in the rooms. The bed was ok with an average collection of pillows. The hairdryer was under powered. They had dispensers of bath products in the shower and the shower had mediocre pressure and temperature. Our closet was large, the bathroom adequate as was the room.I would not go out of my way to stay here again.My experience is limited to an evening social  reception in one of the conference rooms. The staff was AWESOME! The room was nice and spacious, but somewhat what you would expect in a hotel conference room. The food was good; I remembered we had lamb. The salad left a little to be desired, but still good. Overall, good experience here for any conference or reception needs in downtown Indy.As a Marriott Platinum member I can say I have spent many a night in their mainline properties. This is a very solid property in their portfolio. It's centrally located, has a nice underground parking garage, and the rooms are clean and updated. The concierge lounge is very nice, and the fitness center is good. Overall it's a safe bet for the business or casual traveler. The JW is certainly nicer, but for the money this is likely a wiser selection for those on a budget.Rooms are fine, but Thursday night band (crappy cover band) rocked until 10:45 in the cheesy sports bar on the first floor. Wouldn't be so bad except it shook the entire hotel. I was on the 4th floor. Hotel should have more control over that.... It's a hotel first.Awesome place to stay and hangout after a long day!Stayed here for a conference and thought the entire staff is extremely friendly.  Overall the hotel is very nice, has lots of amenities, and extremely convenient to shops, restaurants and activities.The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious!  I was a bit dissappointed in the number &amp; location of wall-plugs.  I mean, who doesn't have an available plug next to the bed?  Weird.Also the air conditioner wasn't cooling properly.  I had the temp set to 60, but the room still felt warm. Last, the light in the bathroom was lacking.I would also expect hotels to offer free guest wifi, but this hotel required their guests to buy it.Other than the above mentioned disappointments, I thought the hotel was nice.I stayed at this Marriott for a work related conference. Our conference was hosted in the same hotel too.The rooms are nice and clean and they offer toiletries from Bath and Body works - that I love!The staff is nice and friendly and the location is right in the middle of downtown Indianapolis!During a three-day stay, I had issues with a broken tub stopper, a stopped up toilet, electrical issues with the lighting, and a faulty card reader so half the time, I could not get into my own room.Also, during a three-day stay, housekeeping only came once to clean the room. Front desk personnel seemed very uninterested in the issues mentioned. One female even yawned while I was telling her about being locked out of my room because my key did not work and asking for new keys.As a bonafide Marriott girl due to all the work travel I would say I'm definitely a somewhat expert on Marriott properties overall, so let me cut to the chase.  This is not the brand new Marriott but the ""older"" one if you want to call it that.  The location cannot be beat.  Is in walking distance to all the shops &amp; restaurants in downtown.  We parked our call via the valet (holy freakin $32/night) and walked the entire stay.  The lobby is very expansive and very nice.  Probably one of the larger Marriott lobbies I have been in.  They have a really nice Starbucks in the lobby too which sure beats that mediocre stuff they provide in the rooms.The rooms are of the more updated Marriotts.  Nice, clean &amp; modern.  Comes with the typical Bath &amp; Body Works Orange Ginger lotion, shampoo and conditioner.I would definitely stay here again but the only 2 ""eh"" things about me for this location were:A).  The steep valet/overnight parkingB).  The hotel lobby had a somewhat moldy smell.  Kinda like when you accidentally leave a load of laundry in the washer &amp; oh snap 2 days later you remember them........You know you've done that at least once in your life.  Now in all fairness to the hotel the rooms did not have the ""funk"" AND we caught the whiff of the same ""funk"" several times while walking downtown.  It's like they're having sewer issues.  We deemed it the smelliest city in the US - however we LOVED Indy and really liked this Marriott.  Next time I come I think I'll try the newer location which is almost literally across the street/highway to this one on Maryland.Stayed here on 02/15/14, got treated like the Priceline customer that I was. Was given a room on the 18th floor. The room was right next to some sort of closet or storage area used by employees. All we heard all night was cabinets being shut and music. Maybe this is their  secret hide away. Parking is outrageous at 35 a night for valet. Was told by valet, that their garage was full, and I had no choice but to valet park. Was told at check in, that we were lucky to still have our room. That the were overbook . I wish I would have looked at some of the reviews, before I picked it.    I see now the area manager does a lot of apologizing....Hello,  fix your problems.This place has razor thin walls and absolutely zero sound insulation from outside.Stayed here for a weekend with the GF for her Indianapolis reunion. We heard our next door neighbors roll in at 3AM and throw an after hours party. It sounded as though they were in the same room as us as we could clearly hear everyone's conversation.Then the next morning a booming rock concert was outside at 7AM for the opening of the Indy Marathon. We couldn't sleep late at night nor early in the morning because the sound insulation of this hotel is absolutely terrible.The pool area and workout room are really nice for an urban hotel though.Beautiful place, outstanding service, great food.  Been here for several meetings and receptions and they have all been top notch. I highly recommend if looking for accommodations in downtown Indy.","Lovely, lovely, lovely.  I've been to three parties and banquets at the Marriott in the past 4 months, and all were very well done.  Service was timely and the food almost hot.  How do you do that with 1400 seated guests?  All events had a warmth and comfortable setting even with large numbers of people.  No complaints.Plus comments:+conveniently located to convention center where conference was held and close to restaurant and shopping opportunities-starbucks in lobby and they did a good job keeping up with the breakfast crowd.Negative comments:-did not appreciate having to pay for Wi-Fi; thought it was pretty cheap in this day and age.-toilet handle broke!  but was fixed the next day.-housekeeping missed one day of service....not usually a big deal but my wastebasket was full!In here for several nights stay via MillionAir fbo. Nice hotel. Good food items in bar. Got in late last night. Great service from all. Valet park was easy....well yeah!! Room on 15th floor and views west to JWMarriott where my pax are staying for convention. My room is nice but lacks elec outlets for all the stuff we pack around which needs charged. Also, no fan-only on the temp control. Had not seen that, and I like the fan-only. Not sure I would stay here again, though there certainly are lesser places to stay. Overall, this is ok.What a sad hotel. As a platinum elite, I always choose a Marriott to stay in when traveling. This hotel, while busy, is extremely tired. First, the shower is completely outdated, and you can hear everything going on around you while in your room.  Last night, I could hear the entire conversation of the person in the room next to me, and every morning someone in my hall left the room at 5:30 AM, and each time the door slammed it woke me up. Room service is an extreme joke. Now, as of January 1, the delivery guy told me, they charge a $10 delivery fee on top of a service fee for each order. So, my nine dollar pizza quickly turned into over $20. Absolutely not worth it. I also ordered buffalo wings, yes I said buffalo wings, but when my food showed up they were actually barbecue wings, and not cooked all the way through. Seriously disappointing, especially when you're hungry. Now, as a traveler, I always use the gym. this gym, while it does have equipment, is also very tired. The treadmill I was on was lopsided, and it has very limited free weights. It is on the inside of the building, so there's no natural light coming in. The check in Clerk, was very pleasant, but sent me to the concierge to get a question answered about a shuttle. It took the clerk 10 minutes to get off the phone to address me, so I went out front to ask. The only redeeming quality of my week, was the doorman. He was very pleasant every morning and very helpful. There is also a Starbucks on site, which is a perk. If I have the chance, I will always stay at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis. This hotel loses my vote after my experience this week.After a three year absence from this particular Marriott, I once again found myself staying here for Gen Con. Unfortunately, the same problems I had before are still here, but made even worse due to the incredibly high price of our stay.I'm still blown away by the ""no fans in the bathroom"" oversight, and the Double/Double rooms are really tight if you've got four adults with luggage splitting (especially with tiny trash cans). That being said, the room was very clean, but many things in the bathroom need repair (a piece of the shower head had detached from the wall, some of the paneling on the bathroom door had been chipped off or damaged, and both the toilet seat and tub's faucet were on the brink of falling off their respective attachments). To make matters worse, neither the tub nor the sink had cold water the entire stay, and even after notifying the front desk, and supposedly having someone from engineering ""fix"" the problem, still only hot water remained.Additionally, while I appreciate a thorough cleaning, we had to specially call housekeeping to service our room on one day of our stay as it was almost 3:00 and it hadn't been serviced. Am I nitpicking? Yes, yes I am. Why? I paid $188 plus 17% tax a *night*. As a note to future travelers: Wi-Fi is not included in that rate, and is $12.99 extra a day.That all being said, the staff is still incredibly nice and accommodating, and of course the location is ideal. When it comes to future Gen Cons, would I stay here again? Likely, but outside of a con situation, where I wasn't limited on the number of rooms available in the entirety of Indianapolis, I'd skip it.The location is fantastic among a few other ones in downtown Indianapolis. Friendly staff and clean rooms are all very nice. I didn't mind the $30 parking fee, as it's conveniently located at the heart of downtown. But I am not too sure about the $15/day internet.Was here for business meetings and really enjoyed the facilities.A little dated, but close to events you have a walk way between the hotel and convention center which makes it very nice. Guest services is very helpful and nice. Room was clean, comfy beds.Horrible customer service. I have stayed at cheaper places with better service. Don't dare ask the desk clerk by the name of Prince for any assistant ,He will just make you fell stupid for asking where anything is. For the price internet should be includedStandard Marriott experience.  Great location near Circle Center.Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights because of a wedding that was there and I would say my stay was pleasant, especially during Fourth of July weekend. There were so many events going on like weddings, pageants, and even a Kappa Alpha Psi 100th year celebration. Right across the street from the convention center downtown it was next to a lot of things.  We were able to go out, find places to eat all within walking distance.The only thing that was disappointing was that there wasn't really many options of food choices within the hotel.  There was Champs Sports Bar that didn't look too exciting so we tried things elsewhere. Since it was such humid weather out there I had such a craving to go swimming and I find out they have an indoor pool! Great! Only problem was it was closed :/ c'mon during the summer?? I did get to use their 24 hour gym which was good- no one was ever in there. The room was nice with a view of the state building and close some museums. More convenient than anything.Great hotel. Well positioned downtown, close to shops, restaurants, &amp; convention center. Very attentive &amp; helpful people. Well appointed rooms. Good view fro 12th floor.  Very nice lobby restaurant. I especially liked the art work. Early Van Gogh sketches of hardworking miners; just beautiful. The conference facilities and service is excellent and very efficient. As always, the wifi is complicated but it worked well. Good string signal even in high floors. I did a webinar from my hotel room with no problems. Excellent.I stayed here with friends the evening of the DCI World Championships this August. We got the room for $150 on Sidestep -- but ended up being closer to $200 after all the taxes/fees/parking for one car at $27/night. It was kind of weird because they wouldn't guarantee us 2 double beds, but ultimately we ended up in a room with 2 double beds, they just wouldn't guarantee it??? Interesting. We tried to check in around 3pm and were told the room hadn't been cleaned yet. The hotel was pretty busy that day and the front desk promised to call when our room was ready for us to check in. So we went to dinner and tooled around Indy for 2 hours...still no phone call. We wandered back to the hotel and inquired about the room. It was ready, but no one had ever called me. Luckily the guy working the front desk was AWESOME and gave us free parking for 1 of our cars in exchange for the slight inconvenience. Awesome service, and the room was great. Perfect for 5 weary travelers after a night of watching drum corps.What room I had was fine for the price but the extra costs and other issues would make me look elsewhere. Problems that lend to star removal for me: Bait and switch on the phantom King Size bed - not even queens? doubles? $10 Internet in the room, $5.35 Internet in the business center - even to print out a boarding pass? Well no... if you are in the know you realize that they will print your boarding passes for you in the lobby for free in the morning... huh? Starbucks in the lobby closes at 8 &amp; the next nearest coffee house is.... the Circle Mall? Especially on my first night the time difference snuck up on me and this seems really shortsighted. The staff was friendly as they told me there were no King or Queen size beds, all of the staff smile and greet you as you pass them in the hall... the door men and bell people were great. BUT.. for what I need from a hotel on a business trip this isn't bliss.This place was a really nice place close to where I was visiting and a preferred hotel by my company.  Being a Hilton man, I reluctantly stayed here; however, I had an excellent stay and would return if I had the chance.Positive: Good customer service, multiple restaurants and bars in the area and a Starbucks that does specials every so often and takes Starbucks cards.  Not mean much to some but try waking up three hours earlier than usual (I'm from Cali) and getting to a client meeting at 9:00 AM trying to look awake.Negatives: Can't think of any,,,I stay at tons of Marriott's for work.This is your typical marriott in every city.Nothing special but will do the job when your in Indy!So the rooms were nice, and the staff we pleasant, and it wasn't too loud at night.And that's where the good parts end... We were there this past weekend when at least 3 events were going on between the stadium and the convention center that weekend. Understandable. But this place is like 20 floors, and are connected to the convention center via a sky-walk. You would think they'd be on top of things. Maybe it was our fault. We called and told them earlier that morning that we would need a late check in, and we'd be there by 6 at the latest. We got there pretty much right at 6 after fighting traffic. When we went to check in, they told us they'd need 15 minutes as they had to check if the room was ready, since there were 4 of us we booked 2 beds and they were going to give us a king with a roll away cot... ummm... no. We booked a room with 2 beds and told you there would be 4. It's not like we were hiding people on the billing.Half an hour went by, and its not like we could leave as we unloaded our car and the valet took it, as he said the self park was all full. Great... *end sarcasm*. So we went back up and a different person told us she'd have to call up and see if it was ready, and that they had our phone number and would call us.15-20 minutes later one of the guys with us went up and told them what was up as our event was supposed to start at 7-7:30 and it was 10 til 7 at this point. I believe he got the first gentleman we talked to and he offered us 2 Starbucks coupons for our trouble... nice gesture, but again, there were 4 of us....Once we finally got to the room, everything was fine (the beds were doubles not queen). We had a fridge, the bathroom was nice and roomy with great counter space. TV was nice, and it was spacious for a room with everything in it. The only other downside is the place price gouges. We looked to book a room 4 days before we actually did, and in that 4 days that we waited the price went up $100!!! not cool Marriott... but it is a nice hotel, there's bars and restaurants within walking distance. If you're a smoker, there's a gas station on block to your right and then make a left and go another block or 2. They do sell cigarettes for $10 a pack at the front desk.I was here for a short stay of one night.  The hotel is attached to the convention center and is very welcome place to hold an event.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  Furniture is well maintained along with a large television and a refrigerator.  The heat didn't work when I first arrived.  A call to front desk and the repair was made by the hotel dude within 15 min.  Bathroom is big with good water pressure and old fashion shaving mirrors that extend from the wall.  Main room is long and closets are plentiful.  The room service is not bad, selection is limited and they charge a lot for a service fee to bring the food.  The staff was helpful on all levels.The sound system in the conference center is weak way below standards.  Something to consider if you want to plan a big event here.  The meeting rooms are nice and big decorated with some class. Overall my stay was enjoyable parking was easy and the price was right.  Impressive lobby and plenty of places to eat nearby.For nearly every downtown wedding I have either attended or been in, bachelorette party, etc. when I don't want to drive home, I stay at the Marriott Downtown.  I have never had a bad experience from the staff at the front desk to the bellboys to the valet, everything is always wonderful.I also had the privilege of being a wedding where the whole thing was done between two banquet rooms.  The food was RIDICULOUSLY wonderful.  The catering manager attended the event and made sure everything was absolutely perfect.  I was blown away by everything in the wedding.  The staff was incredible, polite, and helpful at every turn.  The wedding was wonderful!! I highly recommend if you would like to do a downtown Indy wedding to consider this as an option.  The appetizers during cocktail hour still make my mouth water!!As for the rooms, they are spacious, well laid out and the beds are comfortable.  I have never had a sleepless night in this hotel!  I also love Champions Restaurant located inside the Marriott.  It is one of my favorite pre-Colts game hangouts.  It is also a great place to watch the games if you don't have tickets. They have a huge TV in one of the back rooms and when I've gone there is always plenty of seating.  It does get crowded on occasion, when big conventions are in town, but otherwise, we can usually get seats.  I also know the manager here and he is a great guy!  Tell Greg I said hi if you see him. :)  For my 24th birthday, we used my father in law's Marriott points and were upgraded to the Honeymoon Suite on the 18th floor, overlooking the entire city.  They gave us a welcome package with Starbucks coffee coupons, cookies and other fun treats and upon arriving home from the bars, we were treated to chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne.  Though I don't remember a LOT of this, I know it happened, b/c I had chocolate stains all over my robe in the morning!  The view from our room was incredible, the suite was fantastic and the staff was so gracious whenever we called for room service. Overall, the best hotel experience in the city.  If you are going to spend $250 a night on a hotel in downtown Indy, spend it here.Rooms:  super comfortable bed, spacious room and their suites make a lovely home away from home for the business traveler on an extended trip.   Food:  both their catering and their room service is top notch.  Fitness Center:  plenty of treadmills and ellipticals.  There are also free weights and some machines, but the free weight area is a bit small - there's little personal space between you and the stranger doing curls next to you.The biggest downside to this hotel is that there is no wifi in the rooms.  Now, I may be spoiled because I live in a wireless house, but there's nothing more stifiling than being chained to a desk via an internet cord.  Sometimes a girl just wants to surf the web sitting on her bed while watching TV.  :-)","I definitely try to get in at this FS Marriott when I come to indianapolis.  I'm definitely not disappointed with my stays here.  Nice big rooms, good concierge lounge, comfy beds...nice gym facilities.Everything is nice and clean - no complaints at all.I stayed here in August 2009 for DCI -- and it proved to be an excellent hotel choice! Its location is hard to beat, right on Maryland for proximity to restaurants, bars and the mall, and about a 15 minute walk to Lucas Oil Stadium for the main event along Capitol.Add unfailingly friendly and polite staff, and comfortable, quiet guest rooms, this was an excellent combination!The only slight let-down is some of the issues relating to their food service in the main restaurant (Circle City), particularly at breakfast. Being made to wait 20 minutes for breakfast on a Saturday morning, then having to remind the host that I was on the waitlist, then getting into the restaurant and finding a *ton* of tables empty is not a good customer experience. Also, on a different morning, multiple servers tried to claim my table, and one of said servers became slightly snippy with me over it -- not my problem if you can't organize yourselves properly, I'm afraid.For food at other times, Champions (the in-house sports bar) is a much stronger bet (and will receive its own review).Pricewise: It's a Marriott, it's going to be slightly spendy. The $12 for 24hrs Internet is good and reliable, and also includes free local and national calls -- so that strikes me as a fair extra. For the location and (general) standard of service, paying $180/night for a dual occupancy room is not unreasonable, so it's a straight 4* review. Does what it claims to do, and does it well -- but no real spark to get that last star.The location is fantastic, it is located very close to shopping center and nice restaurants. The lobby is very impressive, we stayed during Christmas holidays and everything looked festive and beautiful. The rooms are nice and clean, good size. So why 3* you ask? Well, for me the hotel must provide everything that's needed to get a good night sleep and at this Marriott I did not, it was very noisy. Not only because there was a party in one of the rooms on our floor, with people being very loud well past midnight but even later in the night I kept waking up due to various noises...I may give this place another chance in the future, not sure yet.Great service and friendly staff! You can easily access many attractions with in walking distance including the conference center.  Easily able to access other Marriott hotels.I stayed at the Marriott for one night when my college group was having a formal function there.  I have a friend who works there and she hooked us up with a great rate, $100 a night!  The room was clean and updated, the abthroom was very roomy and nice,  the location is GREAT if you are going to be downtown, and the service is friendly and helpful.  There was a bit of confusion about my room rate at check in but the staff was quick to assure me they would straighten it out without any inconveinece on my part, and so it was done.  The event I attended there was also ran smoothly by the Mariott event coordinators, the food was really good for banquet food.  Secondhand, my friends who planned the event said they were easy to get a hold of, flexible, and worked within our budget.We stayed here for New Years Eve, not bad, great location, got a good deal on Priceline, was a nice room, I think they recently remodeled them, it was $128 with tax for 1 night but parking is WAY overpriced $28 overnight parking. Also take your own pillow, theirs are the kind that flatten out when you lay your head on them, hardly slept cause of the terrible pillows.Great property!  If you are in town for business a few days, you are in walking distance to just about anything you would need food, entertainment, shopping and more. The concierge lounge is one of the best I have encountered in a very long timeSelected this hotel for its great location in downtown Indianapolis. It is right across the street from the IN Government Center and also attached to the Convention Center and the downtown Skywalk system. I visited in January and it was freezing cold and snowing outside so it was perfect to take the skywalk to the mall for meals and to take the skywalk to meetings across the street. I was on the 19th floor and had a great view of the Capitol building. My room was updated and very clean. I enjoyed the hospitality in the Concierge Lounge for both breakfast and appetizers in the evening. Would definitely stay here again.Excellent staff and very clean. Walls are just too thin...just saying.Stayed here in January for 3 nights and was quite impressed. We had a Management Institute and basically had the entire hotel booked for our organization, got an awesome rate of about $100/night. The people behind the front desk were extremely patient, courteous, and helpful in checking everyone in and out. The waitstaff = superb. Can't say I enjoy eating rubber chicken, but food was not too bad for one of these events. There is only wi-fi in the lobby, otherwise you have to pay for internet. If you are thirsty, there is iced, flavored water in the lobby (strawberry or lemon) that's quite refreshing, but it's not refilled as often as people would like. I was sick during this trip and was constantly drinking water..didn't buy water at the airport and thought I'd be able to get it at a convenient store by the hotel but there wasn't one! So I gave in and bought Smartwater @ $3/bottle in the place by the front desk. This hotel is in a convenient location - close to the mall, restaurants, and places to sight-see! Also loved the skywalk that connects to the mall, and being able to avoid the cold as much as possible.It's a pretty standard Marriott, nothing special.  There's a Starbucks in the lobby but they close super early.  The best thing it has going for it is that it's around the corner from Cafe Patachou!This was a very nice Marriott with a great location in the heart of downtown Indy. All of the great restaurants are just a few minutes walking distance and the staff were all very polite.  My kids and I enjoyed the indoor pool.  We ate at the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was pleasant although we seemed to wait forever for my son's pancakes.  I would stay here again without a doubt.The sky bridge to the Convention Center is a huge bonus. Friendly staff.  Gym and pool are clean and well mantained. Comfortable beds. Cheaper than the JW. Was a little loud on the street and could hear it from my 7th floor street facing room but it was Labor Day Weekend.Very nice hotel and great location. The price was excellent with the government discount.If you are having a convention in Indianapolis, this is the place. Let's be honest, you don't expect much from the food or service at these kind of events. Not when they are trying to feed and take care of 400+ people. The service was AMAZING. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. You don't like Italian dressing? No problem. Let me get you something else.You  have a gluten allergy? No problem. Let me see what the chef can put together for you.Truly the best service I have had in this type of setting.  The food was just okay, but the desert was fantastic. I can only imagine what they would be like when not being cranked out.The guys working the lobby are fast and attentive. When we were getting ready to leave, we had someone to help us right away. He grabbed our bags, flew out the door, and had a cab for us before we even finished getting our coats on. Everything else was good. The bar has a decent selection of wine, but closes kind of early for being a weekend. We were there at midnight and got told it was last call. Unfortunate, because we probably would have spent a fair amount. The starbucks in the lobby is nice, but expensive. Room service is fine, but super expensive and you don't get much for your money. $13 for a sandwich and they don't even give you mustard? Not cool.The lobby has free wi-fi, but the internet in the room is expensive and wired. Not good for college age women away at a convention who need to get homework done.The room itself was fine. Plenty of counter space in the bathroom for two women, but the shower head is far too short for my 6 foot self. But this is something I deal with most places I go. The bed was comfy and warm. The walls our paper thin. I first realized this getting ready in the bathroom in the morning when I could hear my neighbors getting ready in theirs. And it was reaffirmed at 2:30am when my roommate and I were laughing hysterically and they were banging on the wall. Oops.Overall excellent and I would definitely go back again. Next time, for leisure so I can see the city and enjoy something beside the lobby. I could see the football stadium from my window, and it was really making me want to come back for a game.As a regular Marriott person this one was very nice. The rooms were a good size and the bed, tv, etc..all top shelf. Had breakfast at the Circle City Grille every morning food was very good and staff friendly. Champions Bar and Grille was excellent for watching the NCAA basketball games. Excellent down town location.hmmmmm. I stayed here last weekend for a conference and pretty much got ripped off. between the hotel and the association trying to make money, the conference rate was 192 a night! ridiculous when another friend booked a room not at the conference rate and got it for 160. i did appreciate that everyone working there was really friendly and helpful. but things i didn't like include the starbucks closing at 4, paying for internet (which i didn't do), the mediocre food at the resto that wasn't open very often...Real nice Marriott in downtown Indy...close to the convention center, state house, eateries and venues.Valet guys are very attentive- they look like they are trying out for the Olympic track team. However, the $30 per night to park my rental car is a tad too steep. There are plenty of concierge guys floating around when you enter the hotel and the front desk staff is very professional. I am a Platinum Elite Marriott member and they could not get me onto the concierge level (bummer- considering I spent 140 nights with Marriott in 2010). I did get the usual access to the concierge lounge, which is on the 18th floor, plenty big, attentively staffed and with the usual food/ drink.The room is typical Marriott fare- comfy bed, screen TV, desk and clean bathroom...although the walls are a little thin and you can hear those around you. Good selection of TV channels.Room service was expensive....8oz. filet, slice of pie and 2 diet cokes= $58. Assume the position and smile while enjoying your steak. There are 2 restaurants in the lobby area, 1 of which is a sports bar. The cajun pasta in the sports bar is a good choice. If the NHL is your gig, this sports bar is no good- they do not have the NHL package, nor do they have a dish to reach the local broadcasts of games. Boo. there is a Starbucks in the lobby, which I know many folks need like crack.Overall, pretty good Marriott property. Probably a little pricey for most folks. When visiting Indy next time around, I will be back...maybe self park, steer clear of the room service and find a local watering hole with the NHL package.I've stayed here twice. Both times I was in town for GenCon.Staff is very helpful and easy to deal with. Not once in dealing with any employee in any area of the hotel did I hear any attitude. Staff presented themselves as courteous and willing to do what it took to help you.Baggage service is great. I've tipped them, but even so, they didn't hang around after handling bags expecting to be tipped.The breakfast buffet, while pricey, is quite good. I'm a big fan of the omelettes made to order. For those in a bit of a hurry, the Starbucks in the main lobby is another good place to stop for a quick caffeine &amp; sugar fix.Location to the convention center was key for me. Having it attached via hamster tube was quite nice.Room was clean, spacious, well taken care of when I was out during the day. In-room fridge was great for storing leftovers and for keeping my growler-o'-beer cold. Bed was relatively comfy.I'd stay there again.STAY AWAY.I ordered room service breakfast here and it was super-late, super-soggy and super-salty. And when I brought it up to the front desk, they didn't offer to provide a remedy. This on a room that costs $300+ a night! Save your money and go to an economy hotel instead.","I stayed here while on a business trip.  Because I didn't actually pay for it..I'll try to be as fair as possible.I know this happens all the time, but I booked a King room, and was given 2 double beds.  I stayed here for 5 nights and that was pretty much the only thing I wanted..a big bed.  No go on that one.  Internet.  $10 a DAY???  Come on, really?  I'm pretty sure my boss payed upwards of $150 a night for me to stay here..and we're charged for internet access? (It's free in the lobby)  To make matters worse, it was OUT (being ""upgraded"") for the entire time I was there.  When I went downstairs to check-out, I was surprised that the charge was on my room bill.  I told the lady ""Uh-uh..no internets were had in my room""  I tried all three restaurant options in this hotel:1) Champions - Sports bar with tons of flat screens.  Good beer selection, bar food menu..kinda like a Friday's on crack.2) Circle City Bar &amp; Grill - No.  Overpriced, and the food there just sucked.  I mean it sucked bad.  Good thing I got to expense everything.3) Starbucks - Nice lady made my coffee every morning.  There isn't really much else to say..it was average.  If the price was right, I would stay here again, but definitely don't expect anything extravagant.Stayed here a couple of weekends ago for a Bachelorette party. Staff was friendly, room was nice and comfortable. Not sure about the price since I didn't pay, but I'd definitely recommend this joint.Overall, I was very happy with my stay.  Both the room and the lobby were very nice.  The bed was super comfortable with fluffy feather pillows.My only complaints were that the hotel charged $10/day for internet (yet it was free for wireless in the lobby) and there was no fridge/mini-bar.Nice hotel. Can be a bit spendy. But, the rooms are great, there are multiple good restaurants on site, and a Starbucks.","['hubby', 'trade', 'show', '2016', 'great', 'hotel', 'amenities', 'super', 'convenient', 'nearby',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-alexander-indianapolis,The Alexander,4.0,$$$,84,"I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Indy. My stay at the Alexander was for one night while interviewing with a company in Indy. Great hotel in all respects. Location, snacks, ambiance, cleanliness, noise level, amenities, professionalism of the staff. I was offered a complimentary free breakfast (normally ~$17-$18) but had to skip it. The snacks in my room were awesome. There were Indiana-made pretzels, potato chips, and a couple types of chocolate candy. Non-Indiana (as far as I know) snacks were Jelly Belly jelly beans, a few types of trail mix, pistachios, and maybe something I'm not remembering. There was a Keurig and k-cups in the room also. The bed was very comfortable. There were reading lights built into the headboard! The only complaint I can think of is that one of the lightbulbs in my room was burnt out.**Great** check in experience with Drew (Andrew) who went over &amp; above to help out with something I'd forgotten). It's those moments that make for great customer service with me. I stay often in Indy, and this hotel is conveniently located for me. That said, there are clearly issues with housekeeping. Randomly, no soap or some such other supply not being restocked. Other than that, a downside could be a lack of a gym, but there's a brand new YMCA across the street. Overall, I'm satisfied and the interactions I have with staff in general keep me coming back. Breakfast is served by cheerful, genuinely nice people.Confession: I am obsessed with cool hotels. And The Alexander definitely falls in that ""hip and cool"" category.This boutique hotel is chic, contemporary, and art-centric with a European flair in the heart of the Wholesale District. It's just a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium, the Convention Center, and Monument Circle. The Alexander occupies a spot on the CityWay complex, which will soon be home to the largest and finest YMCA in the country. The beloved Cerulean and Platt 99 can be found here, and let me tell you, it is worth a trip just to see Jorge Pardo's incredible handmade lamps. Fun facts:-11,000 square feet of meeting space -209 rooms-six floors-the only hotel in North America curated by an accredited museum of art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art-unique artwork: take note of ""Anthem,"" with birds made of local vinyl records; the Madame CJ Walker work made out of combs, paying homage to her success in the hair care business; the word structure located by the elevators (you'll know what I mean when you see it)-outdoor plaza and lawn space for weddings and other events-Market Table exhibition-style kitchen serves breakfast and lunch-no two rooms have the same set of paintings above the beds-complimentary wi-fi throughout property-your room awakens/sleeps with your key -- eco-friendly! Hence, why it's silver LEED certified.-there's a small health club, but no pool...but really, do you need that when a state-of-the-art YMCA is across the street?As a full disclaimer, I merely toured the hotel and did not stay here. However, I can tell it would be an exquisite experience.Beautiful art everywhere you look, friendly staff, an environmentally friendly building and (most important) clean rooms with comfy beds -- The Alexander was outstanding.  I had heard wonderful things about The Alexander, and those expectations lived up to reality. So to start with: Parking. There is a public parking garage right next to the hotel if you don't want to splurge for valet. Parking overnight cost me $20, and if you park on third floor, you can take the pedway directly into the hotel. One more tip: Even though the spaces are numbered, you can park anywhere, per the hotel staff. Speaking of, the hotel staff seemed friendly and eager to help any time I encountered a staff person, whether it was at the front desk or at the front door. The front desk clerk also told me that Platt 99 in the hotel serves complimentary truffle popcorn, which I'll have to try on my next visit. I also spied the infused water bar near the front desk. And then once I got to my room, I found it to be beautifully decorated with art hung above the bed and a modern bathroom.Considering the hotel puts a focus on sustainability, it was great to see how you have to use a room key to turn on the lights in the room -- meaning that you will likely not leave the room with the lights still on. The wifi is free and easily accessible. My TV worked great, and it was easy to navigate through the channels.And as I mentioned, the bed was heavenly. It was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. I sometimes have trouble going to sleep in hotels, and I had no problem with that here. The Alexander is a short five-minute or so Uber ride from downtown Indy. Really, this hotel replaced the generic that is often found in hotels and put something unique, sometimes avant-garde and always worth a peek in its place.I can't wait to go back!So im pretty pissed, my first time here and within two hours I was down $500 due to a mishap in the kitchen and someone swipe crazy with my debit card number. The superviser offered me free breakfast for the two nights i was gonna be here, i told her that was hardly any kind of courtesy for my $500 wait for my bank to release my funds. Boo!I came to Indiana for an incentive trip through my work, and we were booked to stay here at this hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel in our limo, we were greeted by two younger lads, and directed to the front desk to check in. Our check in was quick and painless. The gentleman at the desk was also really friendly and welcoming. He gave us our room keys and directed us promptly. Once we got into our room, we were amazed at how nice it was! The room was decorated tastefully with modern art, and had a nice king sized bed. The shower was clean and tidy ready for use, and we had a nice view of the bar in the hotel and some of Indianapolis. It was all very nice. We were never bothered by room service, and when we would go out on or adventures throughtout Indiana, the room service left our rooms clean again, and none of our stuff went missing. The front hall of the hotel was also very well decorated with awesome modern art. Some of which I posted pictures of.Overall; my experience here was comfortable and fun! The location was also near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, downtown Indianapolis, and other fine dining. It is also not too far from the airport! A very nice place to stay!They turned me away.  I had a room booked and they bumped me out to accommodate a Taylor Swift fan.But everyone knows that Taylor Swift fans are more important than educators.The best hotel I've ever stayed at! I love the Alexander hotel, they take an unconventional approach to hospitality. From their intense focus on art and upscale decor to the individualized attention provided to each guest. Reasonably priced and in the heart of downtown, what's not to love? Their bar, Plat 99 is modern and inventive with unique drinks you won't find anywhere else with bartenders who are knowledgable and engaging. My recommendation? Order the Indy love drink with basil and cucumber, a refreshing drink no matter the season. Now, onto the actual rooms. The rooms have a laminate flooring that resembles dark hardwood floors with minimal carpeting that is up to date and pairs well with the art theme you will see throughout the hotel. The rooms have clean lines with dark wood finishes and large floor to ceiling windows with view of the city skyline. The linens feel luxurious and have some weight to them. Nothing about the hotel feels cheap or tired, it is extremely clean and transparent. It is connected to Cerulean, a highly recommended restaurant who takes a creative and cultivated approach to cooking. Overall, if you find yourself traveling in Indy and are in search for an experience rather than just a place to sleep, give The Alexander a try, you won't be disappointed.I should start this out by saying i've been here 3-4 times to work, but it has always been extremely nice!  Always very clean and updated, even in the ""behind the scenes"" areas that people normally don't see.  I've been able to sample the food they serve for parties and it is awesome.  I love the hotel decor!I stayed here for a business trip recently.  I absolutely loved the art installations throughout the lobby/elevators. My room was spacious, bright and seemed like it recently updated. The bathrooms were well lit so I didn't have to struggle to do my makeup (always a plus). One of the blonde front desk agents had a pissy attitude, but otherwise staff members were nice and accommodating. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Indy.I was in town for the weekend.  The Alexander was at the top of my list of places to stay since it was the newest property in downtown Indy and its price was comparable, if not cheaper, than the other downtown hotels during the time of my intended visit.  With its boutique feel and bright, airy, quirky interior replete with modern artwork displayed all around the common areas, everything about the Alexander screams hip, modern, and someplace other than Indianapolis.  Adding to the Alexander's appeal is its outstanding cocktail lounge, Plat 99, which is just off the front desk and easily in the discussion as Indianapolis' best place for craft cocktails and Cerulean, an excellent restaurant on street-level.  Having driven to Indianapolis, I left my car with valet ($29/day), which while not cheap was less expensive than other's self-park prices and seemingly more convenient than self-parking since the garage was adjacent to the hotel, not underground and  accessible by elevator.  Friendly valet and front desk staff greeted me immediately and were efficient in their duties during both my arrival and departure.  My room was clean with a modern, yet minimalist design.  The bed was comfortable giving good back support.  The shower was unique to most hotels I've stayed with its overhead showerhead. Although my stay was a brief one, the Alexander impressed me greatly.  It may not be for everyone, since its location isn't as convenient to Lucas Oil Stadium and the Convention Center as other downtown hotels, but it's still within walking distance.  For Indianapolis, it's definitely a 5-star hotel.  The Alexander is definitely a place I'd stay again.Very clean, modern, beautiful artsy space. Garage next door was convenient. Walls were thin though as I could hear my neighbors and woke up every time they flushed their toilet...I stayed at the Alexander hotel for my wedding night this past weekend. My husband and I were completely floored by the installed art throughout the space and the impeccable service. The hotel itself is a modern work of art, with feng-shui placed glass walls and views of the city. We also got a chance to peek into the Plat 99 bar during the daytime when it was not open for business and took a look through their extensive bourbon and Indiana draft pull selection. It looks like they put on interactive ""pour and play"" cocktail competitions for guests periodically so it's worth checking out for guests and locals. We had a king suite with a HUGE bathroom, complete with a glass door shower, 2 sinks, and a large bathtub. And get this, they have a TV built into the mirror! Crazy fancy. They also carry Gilchrist &amp; Soames bath products in the bathroom stock. All rooms appear to come handy with a Keurig (free coffee and tea) and local snack foods (for a fee). The bed was luxurious and came with ample bed side lighting dimmers. We also made use of the mini-fridge to keep our celebratory sparkling wine chilled. We also received a 2-fer free breakfast the following morning at their in-house restaurant, Market Table. Beautiful warm space with modern, almost molecule-featured light art. They also offered a gelato bar with their breakfast (need I say more).This place appears to appeal to a slightly younger demographic but I saw all ages staying at the property checking in and out the following morning. Central location to the fieldhouse and stadium for games and to downtown spots. Highly recommend to my style savvy traveling buddies out there in Yelpland.This was a wonderful experience. The hotel screams modern, chic, sleek and comfortable in every single way. From the auto-shut down of heat and electrical when you leave the room (which reboots once you put your key in as you walk in) to the living and breathing art museum (is this a hotel or an art museum?) and the cute little hipster touches on even the ""do not disturb signs,"" there are little surprises in every corner.The bed was super comfortable. I can just melt into a nice slumber thinking about it. Shower pressure was fantastic and the stay was pretty much perfect. Check out is 11am which is kind of early, but the staff extended is to 12pm when I called which was nice.It's a bit of a pricey stay and I think there could be more value delivered for the per night price paid (thus the 4 stars), but if you're comfortable with it; it's definitely one of the better hotels I've stayed in.What can if can i find nice to say about this hotel...... hmmmm well... the artwork is cool.  other than that.  I have to be honest, it was probably the worst hotel experience from a customer service perspective I have had in many years.  I travel frequently  as many as 150 nights a year in the past, and have stayed in all kinds of hotels from 1 start to 5 star in my travels.  This hotel rates at the bottom.  There are zero amenities for a business traveler.    MY stay started with a poor check in experience, with a front desk person who was snarky at best and at worst sarcastic.  our room was not ready, and we were told that they would call when it was, ..... they never called.        My breakfast experience was horrible as the wait staff totally forgot I was there, the food was cold, and I never did get a bill, finally tossing 20 dollar bill to the bus boy after a 15 minute wait for a server that never came back to my table.    The bar only sells bottles of soda?  yet they can make a mixed drink with soda,  but have no coke or diet coke.    The onsite mini store was the smallest I have ever seen with little to nothing that the business traveler would want or need.   Every thing else was overpriced, from the $4.00 pretzels in the room to the $19  double vodka I had in the bar.       I passed by the front desk multiple times, as it is right by the elevators, often the staff were leaning on the glass  or looking at their phones and seldom acknowledged me as I walked by.  If you are looking for a decently priced hotel that seems to care little if anything about you as a customer, then this is the place for you.The Alexander is a newly constructed hotel in downtown Indy. The building was originally designed to be a residential, and this reflects in the cozy structure of the hotel. Within days, you'll start referring to The Alexander as ""Home"" :)The quirks that make The Alexander a unique, lush, and indulgent experience:- modern and cheerful art in the lobby, hallways, and rooms- spend some time relaxing in the common area by the lobby-- it reminds me of a spacious modern ski log cabin... something about the wood decor and homey living room vibe, against the glass fixtures and roomy interior- each room's mini-bar comes stocked with local Indy popcorns and snack mixes. Irresistible.- relaxed complementary breakfasts at The Market Table, where you get the full restaurant dining experience with skilled chefs who can custom-make any egg dish your heart desires- the Platt 99 bar has a mean cocktail menu with complementary and addictive truffle popcorn- gumdrops, spa water, and coffee in the lobbyHighly recommend this swamky hotel for a pleasure tripNote that they do sell out.... so make friends with the receptionist, and book in advance!This place is absolutely gorgeous, on Pennsylvania street by bankers life field house. I went here for my 21st birthday. I really enjoyed the vibe of this place ! The lantern lights really brings a uniqueness to this bar, that no others bars have. I have to admit the drink selection is not the best. I would rather them have some more girly drinks rather than manly drinks. The bartender did their best &amp; came up with wonderful drinks for me. I appreciated the service very much ! Definitely would go back (:Was really excited to stay here for a wedding in September, but unfortunately the staff was less than helpful or friendly the entire time. We were carrying bags and a wedding gown that was heavy and awkward as we were looking for our room. We had never been there before and it's easy to get turned around. Not only did the front desk employee laugh when we went to the elevator (apparently it was the wrong elevator but instead of showing us where the right elevator was he decided to laugh at us), but he also simply pointed a general direction for us to go. Would have been wonderful to have someone walk us to the correct elevator as we were weighed down with belongings and unfamiliar with the hotel. The room was great! Very clean and spacious. The balcony view was beautiful, looking out to Lucas Oil. Everything seemed to be going well after the first mishap, but the night of the wedding a guest had the brides wedding gift delivered to her room. It was never delivered there and they still haven't given her the gift. She has called numerous times and tried to track down the package, but it's been a month and no one has been able to send it to her. A little guest service goes a long way. The hotel was immaculate but that can all go down hill if you don't treat guests correctly or if you are dishonest.Our stay was short and sweet. We needed one night as a stopover to Louisville. I was traveling with my kids (8 and 10). The kids liked the Modern esthetics, the rooms were a generous size as well as the bathrooms. My husband wished for more ""hooks"" in the bathroom. It's really the simple things, robes and slippers, safe was in a drawer. I appreciate that the creamer fir the coffee was liquid and not powder. We'll definitely be back to take more advantage of other amenities, like the lobby bar.I'm writing this as I sit in the reading chair in our room. I loved our stay at this hotel! The art installations throughout the hotel are beautiful, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and the rooms were modern, clean and definitely cozy. I came here with my two kids and as soon as they saw us at check in they offered a crib right away and had it sent within minutes of us entering the room. I also asked about using a microwave to warm up my daughter's milk and they actually brought a microwave to my room. With Yolk being just downstairs, I really don't know what else to ask for.I definitely appreciated the hospitality and the courtesy we received during our stay. It was my first impression and stay in Indianapolis and it was certainly a good one.","This is the most solid five star review I have ever written. In fact, if it were a percentage it would be 110% out of 100. After a long hard six months working for the Reds, and throwing a gigantic Halloween event, the hunny and I finally had a break at the same time and decided to take a long weekend to celebrate our nine year anniversary. Totally last minute, we jumped on Yelp, and booked through expedia to get an almost 50% discount! I had no idea which hotel to pick, and we were SO over the top ecstatic that The Alexander was the one we landed on. If you know me, you know my style is uber modern. I am not a Bed and Breakfast kind of gal. I like luxury, clean lines, and stay away from knick nacks galore (creepy and they stress me out). This hotel was everything I hoped it would be. My favorite part was the fact that the hotel is filled with tons of incredible, thought provoking art installations. They spent $2 million and commissioned the Indianapolis Museum of Art to turn this hotel into something much more than that. Every time we turned a corner we were in awe! Now onto the room. Oh. my. gawd. THE ROOM! Our bed was giant and plush. Originally we had planned to do an afternoon bar crawl, we were so thrilled with the space, we got in our pjs, and just hung out for a while. It was probably the most relaxed I have been in years. The shower was giant and had a waterfall shower head. The space in general was just soothing, clean and comfortable, just the way a hotel room should be. One other plus? The had some best of Indy mags in the room that was used with Yelp to bookmark some brunch and dinner spots. Loved that! And almost everything was within walking distance, this hotel could not be in a better location.We took naps, we watched tv, we relaxed, and had an incredible anniversary! Thank you so much for your hospitality, and for providing an oasis for those who want to escape the everyday stresses. If you are reading this and needing to make a decision on where to stay, stop looking, this is your place! Worth every penny, and we will most certainly be back!Want to love this place, but they're challenging me. Checked into an upper floor room yesterday to discover that someone else's key card was laying in the room, along with some of their trash. Glasses in the bathroom were dirty, some of the mini-bar snacks were missing, and used soap and shampoo were in the shower.Housekeeping responded promptly and made things right, but misses like this are tiresome and make you wonder how well anything is being cleaned.Pretty pretty! Indy has a fair number of solid hotels, many of which seem to book up quickly (and for a pretty penny) when conventions come to town. Thus, I'm always game to try out a new nightly abode in the circle city. The Alexander is definitely one of my faves! The Good:-Art abound! Amazing modern art installations and features throughout the hotel. -Modern rooms with extra comfy beds with reading lights-Large glass showers and nicely sized bathrooms-Lots of closet and dresser space, especially int he extended stay rooms-Kitchenette with coffee maker and bottled water (extended stay wing)-Solid, free Wi-Fi throughout-Friendly employees-Decent workout area with a handful of machines, weights and space to get your sweat on (even TVs on the cardio machines!) -Infused ice water and coffee near check in (melon water FTW)The Meh:-I found the entrance confusing (have to walk up or take the elevator up to check-in) - they could probably use more signage-No mini bar for snacking (FYI - the workout room has fresh fruit) -I called for a taxi the day prior and the front desk agent said it was taken care of, no problem. When I arrived downstairs at the entrance, the bell lady/host called upstairs to confirm and I had to wait for a bit for my taxi. She ended up hailing me one to the airport. Not sure if that was a hotel issues or a taxi issue...I hope next time I'll have a bit more time to enjoy the beautiful art and amenities at The Alexander.Beautiful hotel.  Interesting and inspiring art surrounds the visitor. Clean modern decor. Curteous and professional staff. Rooms are spaceous and offer scenic views of downtown Indy. Extreamly clean with very comfortable pillow top matresses and down pillows.This is a relatively new hotel in Indianapolis. I stayed there about a week ago for a conference and the hotel was simply wonderful. The hotel is clean and orderly. The staff was super friendly during the entire visit. There's a lot of great artwork throughout the hotel and even in the parking garage. I ate several meals at the hotel and each one was delicious. If you're looking for a very nice hotel to enjoy while you're staying in Indianapolis The Alexander is definitely at the top of my list.Ate and drank on the patio bar. Edamame, SMORES! shrimp wraps, cheese boards. All were delicious. Service was great. Waitress forgot a food order and gave it complimentary. Margaritas were perfectHubs and I stayed at The Alexander while in Indy for a conference. I had read a great deal about how artsy it was, and how it was just beautiful, but I don't think I really 'got it"" until I arrived. We were greeted by some pleasant fellas who were genuine in their hospitality. We were led up the stairs to check-in to the hotel. The front desk staff were pleasant, and the process for check-in was easy. Our room was awesome, very posh and modern. The a/c worked, which is always a plus, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. Our time spent in the conference area was also nice, the hotel put on a great nosh spread for us, and were always very friendly. The staff also helped recommend places of interest, and called a taxi when we needed one. Mentioned most in the reviews, and should not be overlooked, is the art. The place could double as a modern art gallery. Everywhere you turn is another great piece, worthy of a stop just to admire it. I really loved that part of the hotel more than anything!Me, my boyfriend, and two our our friends stayed here for a night while visiting Indy for the Kenny Chesney concert.  First of all, the customer service at the front desk is wonderful.  We arrived at 3:10 and our room wasn't quite ready.  Since they guarantee that your room will be ready by 3:00, all 4 of us were given a comped drink and appetizer at Plat 99 (check out my review for that place!) to use while we waited.  Once we got into our room, we were elated with the set up!  We had a 2 bedroom/2 bath suite for the night and it was absolutely gorgeous!  It was modern and sleek with a TV in both bedrooms as well as the common area and the balcony provided beautiful views of the city and the stadium.  The beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in at a hotel and the robes provided in the closet were lovely and soft.  All in all, I will absolutely be back and honestly, I'm not sure I'll stay anywhere else in the city!Love this hotel.  It is beautiful and clean and the staff is incredibly nice.  They are truly pet friendly and even have goody bags for your dogs.  Can't wait till we are back in Indianapolis again so we can stay here again.We love the Alexander and have stayed here 2 times in the last few months.  It's a very hip and comfortable hotel with great facilities and a nice staff.Stayed here before. The staff is still very nice and professional. However, some decisions seem to be made based on profit instead of customer satisfaction and common sense. Some requests seemed to take forever to be completed. Maid service was a little inconsistent. New softer towels should be ordered soon. Would I stay here again, yes.An excellent hotel, certainly stylish. Not cheap yet a good value for the money. Love the art everywhere, from lobby to halls to rooms. Staff is helpful and friendly. Best hotel shower I've taken with water faucet on ceiling and well lit shower (something most hotel showers/baths don't have is good lighting). Good bed and pillows. Convenient plug-ins around room. Plenty of outdoor space in restaurant and bar. Free and good wi-fi signal everywhere. I'd stay here again and will look for other Dolce brand hotels when traveling. Their slogan matches the experience: ""Hotel Reinterpreted.""Nice hotel with a very modern and urban feel to it.  Definitely a different feel than other downtown Indianapolis hotels. The location is great if you are attending a downtown event and the staff is helpful and friendly.There are 60 works of art on display in the hotel, the ones that I saw were interesting.  They are spread out literally all over the hotel so you'd have to spend quite some time here to see them all.Room rates were very reasonable and valet parking was $29 per night.I stayed at the Alexander for a interview I had in town. Honestly this establishment deserves five stars if it were not for the poor housekeeping. I am very lenient and understanding, but there were many mistakes. Upon entering my room, I found a broken off ladle to the fridge cabinet in the drawer next to it with it's respective screws. No one bothered to put it back on, making it difficult to access the fridge. My second day in town, I was gone between the hours of 9am-1pm and put the please clean room placard on the door. I returned to find my room not attended to, with the placard still on the door. I was very surprised by this since I saw three different housekeeping attendants throughout the hall when I left. The following day I requested a afternoon housekeeping with the housekeeping attendant since my interview was from 12-5pm. I returned to find my room in a ""cleaned"" condition worse than a holiday inn express. My bed was made, yet the covers appeared as if someone had laid in them, with the decorative cover in a diagonal position when it should clearly be horizontal. Additionally I left a wine glass next to visibly full wine bottles. Upon returning the wine glass was gone, yet the coffee carafe from the morning was sitting next to it without any coffee cups. The cups for the bathroom sink area were visibly dirty, not replaced, and not even aligned together. Shower caps and shampoo were missing, as well as the coffee creamers and coffee itself. Honestly I usually don't expect a lot, but this was a very lacking scenario. I expected mush better from this establishment.Looking for a change of scenery, the husband and I used the Indiana resident rate to book a night at the Alexander. For about $180, we got a room, 2 free breakfasts at Market Table and it seems like there was something else. We stopped by the hotel around 12:30, hoping to drop our bags off before lunch but, to our surprise, we were able to get into our room. I was pretty impressed. Big comfy king size bed, a nice array of Indiana-related snacks (for a fee), a Keurig, a mini fridge, and art all over the place. One neat feature is that in order to operate the lights in the room, you need to insert a key card into a slot; that way, lights aren't used when you're not in the room.The decor is phenomenal -- tons of cool installations in the lobbies, the bar and the hallways. Lots of lounge-y feeling seating areas, too.One quirk -- you enter on the first floor (ground level) but the elevator only takes you to the lobby (level 2). Then you take a separate elevator to the guest room area. Could be a safety consideration, but it was a bit strange. The only quibble is that there really isn't all that much right there. So far, Qdoba seemed to be the only retail establishment open in the CityWay development. It is convenient if you are going to an event at the Fieldhouse, however.I was at a business networking event the second day it was open - apparently the first such event after opening - and everything went without a hitch. The staff was professional, courteous, and, if you didn't know it, you would have no idea that the hotel had only been open for two days.The decoration, layout, and art at this boutique hotel is what makes it unique. Some of the art displays would stand out even at the IMA.The staff gave a tour of the hotel and it's fairly impressive. If you get a chance, definitely check out the Boardroom, which is on the 6th floor and has a 270 degree view of just south of downtown Indianapolis. There's also an outdoor terrace that surrounds it, which should be awesome when it's not 10F.Hotels like this will help Indianapolis improve its profile and image to travelers - business and pleasure alike. I wish it success.The Alexander is a gorgeous art hotel. The amount of effort and time spent on the selection of pieces in the lobbies, restaurants, public spaces, and hotel rooms' shows. The collection is unique and each time you look around, you spot something different.The pros:- Striking art- The shower is awesome and made for tall people- Location- This hotel is located within a minutes' walk of Bankers Life, Lucas Oil Stadium, and many of the downtown Indy restaurants- Free Wifi- Hotel Garage Parking- It is cheaper than some of the other downtown hotels. With in/out privileges, it is $24/day. Without in/out privileges, it is $20/day- The bedding- The comforter was thick and warm - Eco-Conscious lighting- Like European hotels, you are required to place a room card in a slot to make the lights work.  The cons:- The rooms have high ceiling and can echo. Depending on how drunk your neighbors are, you can hear them.- The bed- This is one of the biggest issues that I had with the hotel. This is one of the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on, and this is coming from a person who tends to stay in a hotel 200+ nights a year.- The chairs- Like the bed, the chairs were just not comfortable to sit in. While I understand that they went with the themes, you should also consider the functionality and comfort as well.- The price- I was lucky to score a good rack rate, if it wasn't for that fact, I cannot justify spending that much money on a room , even if I was on business and that I find uncomfortable to sleep and work in. - The restaurants on site- Plat 99 interesting take on cocktails and nice space to hang out in, but I've had iffy service on several occasions; Cerulean Restaurant- great decor, but I am just not a fan of the restaurant.I'm rating the Alexander purely on a tour of their facilities, the bar and their public art.  I've not actually stayed at the hotel, but I certainly plan to on a future staycation.I love that Indy finally has a boutique hotel.  It's a bit off the beaten path, but I think this makes for a great connection from the Lily campus to downtown proper.  The building is beautiful -- tons of art pieces in the lobby and open spaces.  And it's great to read up on the artists.The piece de resistance for The Alexander is their bar, Plat 99.  See my separate review for the bar, because it is fab-u-lous.The Market Bar is downstairs and I've enjoyed a couple of meetings in this space and the food I've enjoyed here (via catering or the Market Bar) has been excellent and far superior to most hotel dining options.All in all, this is quite a gem in our city and I think it's got some modern swank.  It's a place to go to for a cocktail or fun parties that they host (Merry and Bright for the holidays).Friendly staff, large rooms, quiet, maybe the best hotel bed I've ever slept in. Efficient check in, valet and check out. Couldn't be better. I'd go back in a minute.Absolutely loved the atmosphere!! Spent the day visiting the Indianapolis Museum of Art so to stay at the hotel that expresses art (and has IMA souvenirs in a little gift shop) it was def finishing touches for a fantasic day. Upon arrival the staff was super friendly and informative. After dinner and such a busy day we just wanted to stay in and enjoy the game (Go Irish!) So wine from room service was ordered which came with surprise chocolate strawberries. (Just because, he said) service was professional, friendly and prompt. Will def stay again!!","I have stayed in hotels around the world but this was without a doubt my best ""hotel experience"" yet. Great helpful staff, amazing bar, awesome contemporary art. Totally recommend it.The Alexander is an impressive hotel and loved the private tour offered for the event we were at. From the $2m art collection and pieces exclusively made for the hotel or the view at night from the Board Room patio will be a conversion starter for some time.  This is a hotel I can recommend with confidence and will do so often.  The entire event was phenomenal and brilliantly organized.  Be sure to visit Platt 99 where the atmosphere is inviting, relaxing and beautiful from the moment you enter. The view of the city from daytime to nighttime mesmerized us while having wonderful cocktails and never ending appetizers.  Plats outdid themselves with the food and drinks tonight. I even smiled when I received my small, glass bottle of Diet Coke...to cute. We tried everything from the pork belly sandwiches, mini lox puffs, YUM, homemade donuts puffs with 3 varieties of fillings, and my favorites, the Beef Carpaccio. Unfortunately, I  didn't get an opportunity to sample the Adult Grilled Cheese that everyone was raving about but then again just another reason to return.  My husband munched on the edamam with pinot noir salt and popcorn delivered to each table throughout the evening.  Our servers were awesome; friendly and managed our crowd very well. We're looking forward to bringing friends back for cocktails on the deck or have a weekend downtown at the Alexander.  Can't wait till the next trip to Platt 99.The Alexander is a very lovely hotel with lots of great amenities. From breakfast at the Marketplace to drinks at Plat 99, from the gym facility to the art tours, there's a lot to enjoy whether you are a business or pleasure traveler.The rooms are nice, fairly spacious with a Mad Men mod feel. My bed was super comfy and the amenities were simple, but good. There isn't a mini-bar in the room, but there is a coffee machine, bottles of water and a couple of local snacks.The rooms are really green and none of the lights will work unless you put your key card in a holder on the wall. Really interesting idea, but it takes a bit of getting used to.The staff is top notch, very friendly and I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a hotel in Indy.Beautiful hotel! As soon as you walk in you feel like you're in an art gallery, and i was eating it up!As you walk up the stairs into the lobby, there's a super swanky bar that made me want to drop all my bags and run into. Too bad I was on a busy schedule. But I wasn't too busy to enjoy the amenities! I love the modern accents. The shades that block out the outside light, the make-up mirror and most importantly... these cool little pop out bedside lights. Seriously, how can I install those in my bedroom? And, the bed, extremely comfy. Five stars for that alone!The only thing I was not into was the shower. Specifically the fact that there was no door. I get it. We're being modern with our shower. But it made it cold, I was spraying water everywhere and, if I had someone with me, I'd want a little privacy. The staff was super friendly and the best part is they called me a ""cab,"" which ended up being a town car that cost the same amount of money as a regular cab. I'm down with that! I would stay here again and again. Heck, I'd be okay living here...My wife and I got married on Leap day, 2012, so we dont know exactly when to celebrate our anniversary. This year we decided to take a little staycation night in downtown Indy to overlap Feb. 28-Mar. 1. We've been wanting to check out The Alexander for some time, and this was the perfect opportunity. Having called ahead to let them know we were celebrating a special night, I was cheerfully told, ""Great, I'll make a note of it, and we'll take care of it for you"". Not knowing what that meant exactly, we just went downtown and settled in.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we felt special. From the valet gentlemen to the front desk staff to the Plat 99 waitress, we were congratulated on our anniversary and warmly treated. The front desk upgraded our stateroom to a corner room overlooking Lucas Oil, and shortly after we got to it and unpacked, came a knock at the door. Two very pleasant staff members came in with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, and a handwritten note welcoming us and wishing us a happy anniversary. What an impression that left!The room itself was whimsical, with unique chairs (a highlight for us when we travel), spacious bathroom and shower, floor to ceiling windows with electric shades, interesting lighting units, and a bathrobe for each of us in the wardrobe. The bed was comfortable, and we fully appreciated out stay.The hotel itself is beautiful, with both specially commissioned art and purchased art decorating everything from the entrances, to the common areas, and even the parking garage (which we drove through after we left since we used the valet service). Plat 99 was a fun place to meet friends for drinks and a killer grilled cheese sandwich. Market Table was a full weekend brunch, complete with a bloody mary bar, build your own mac n cheese, a carving station, and even a gelato bar! We did not try Cerulean, but will in the future. All in all, it was a fantastic weekend in downtown in Indy, highlighted by the hospitality at The Alexander. Thank you for making our 2nd (1/2?) anniversary special!If you are visiting Indianapolis, I highly suggest this hotel. My boyfriend and I went just for one night and used his AAA discount which saved us a lot. They have a parking structure attached to the hotel for $20 a night. Starting at the garage they had such cool urban art that continue throughout our stay. The check in was an easy process and the service was amazing. Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.We checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. Overall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to Indianapolis, especially if you are going to a Pacers or Colts game, is was fantastic. Next time I go back to Indianapolis I will be staying here again.Wow!  I am super impressed with this hotel.  I love that it is almost like a mini art museum! We booked a California king room.  The room was lovely!  The view isn't that amazing (currently there is construction across the street). The bed was crazy comfortable! However the pillows were not as great as the bed!A warm welcome to a New neighbor on Indy's southside. A breath of fresh air has blown in filled with enchanting, inspiring, and rejuvinating urban modern art that graces every corner of the lobby. The Alexander is a fantastic addition to this neighborhood with many throw backs in it's design and name to the history of Indianapolis. We attended a hospitality industry function here and it was truly wonderful to see such great service and such a great facility! The art and design truly is top notch!Way to kick it up a notch, Indy. Alexander Ralston himself would have undoubtedly been proud! From the name, to the restaurant and bar to the lobby to the rooms, this place is top notch! I heard a few people criticize The Alexander for not being as good as 21C in Louisville and I presume that is only due to the public restrooms.Love the artwork in the public spaces--especially the Madame CJ portrait made out of combs: bloody clever, that. As is the record soaring out of the turntable. I could go on.The rooms are modern, tidy, with awesome local touches: a different local photo in every room and a mini bar stocked with snacks from local businesses. Very cool.Love the custom wallpaper in the halls.Plat 99: Unlike any space in the city and the one of the best hotel bars I've seen. Can't wait to hang there in the summer on the patios.Cerulean: In a word. Fab.Only downside-- room without a view. I visited a friend with a south facing scene: a parking lot and Eli Lilly HQ? Might want to look into dropping a theatre scrim outside the window or continue with the art theme and add some shapes or colors to the windows.This review is only based on my impression of the lobby while visiting the hotel bar, Plat 99.This is the hotel that could give the Conrad a run for its A-lister money.   I can really see this being the place where visiting football and basketball teams stay on their road trip.   It's super-modern and luxurious.   They've spend millions on the art alone.The house bar is a worth of visit on its own merits (see my review for Plat 99).The best hotel in Indianapolis! I love this hotel! It's the perfect blend of comfortable modern elegance. The staff was extremely friendly. Everything was impeccably clean. The room even had enough space for me to do yoga in!The lounge had live music with excellent food and was the perfect atmosphere for a relaxed business meeting.Not one detail was missed with this hotel! My favorite part about my stay was learning about all the art through out the hotel.  It's one thing to look at the art, but it's a whole different experience watching the artist's progression of each piece on a flat screen next to it. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!I too have had issues with staying in a room paid for by someone else. My room, as well as my son's room, was already paid for when we arrived. At the desk we were both asked for credit cards for incidentals. BOTH of our cards were CHARGED for each of our rooms IN ADDITION to the card that had already paid for it in full. Time consuming inconvenience that I wouldn't expect from such a fine hotel. Upon arrival I showed all of the paper work printed out so the young lady could hold it and read it. She was uninterested and in attentive when I tried to explain. Her condescending smile said it all. After our stay- Of course we had to discuss it with the front desk, the bank, and the hotel again. Plus my son is 19, has his own banking, and is away at college so dealing with that was frustrating as well. I'd give more stars if the people working at the front desk had better critical thinking skills or training. Or if anyone there even acknowledged the situation with any empathy. The front desk is the face if your business. A condescending smile instead of listening to your guest explain something isn't the way to run an expensive hotel.Beautiful hotel. Great guest service. When we arrived they had us in the wrong room. But talked to Michelle in Guest Services she fixed the problem and even received an upgrade. Nice job Michelle. Thanks again. Would stay here again!OK, It's not the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong, but The Alexander is a damned fine hotel.  And when you compare the cost per night of the Alexander to the swindlery that was being perpetrated by the big chains, such as The Marriot at $340/night, during this week of big events (NTEA show, Big 10 Basketball Conference) in Indianapolis, the Alexander is even more appealing.It's close to all of the essentials-downtown, the convention center, the Lilly Complex, Lucas Stadium, Banker's Life Stadium, etc, but the aspect most appealing to me was the impeccable appointments that you'll find everywhere in the hotel.The rooms are stunning, with excellent mid century furnishings and decor. From the Eames designed aluminum management chairs and walnut stools (painted in this case) to the Hans-Grohe faucets and shower heads, the Dolce Group eschewed the ""what's the cheapest furnishing we can find?"" mentality that is so prevalent in the hotel industry today, and instead furnished this property with a steady focus on design and quality.Comfortable beds, although I can certainly do without the 30 lbs duvet that seem to be de rigueur these days, and a very efficient work area are also standard accoutrement.Finally, The Night Light Bar has an excellent selection of local craft beer and the complimentary truffle popcorn is delicious.Book here with total confidence!My stay at The Alexander was a lovely one. The decor was tasteful, the amenities were many and the staff was friendly and eager to help. Would recommend.Had a meeting here last week, wow! The rooms are very nice with a modern theme. The food was awesome in the market! Enjoyed the bar as well. Comfy couches suit a large group nicely. In the summer they gave heated outdoor seating. The only problem with this hotel us that it isn't part of the rewards origami I have built up at another hotel! Parking us easy and it us right across the street from Lilly. The entrance is weird, as when you walk in, you gave to go upstairs. Price is right, and I really like this hotel!I stayed here while relocating a family to Indy, the staff did what they could accommodate my parking situation(Large deisel truck) so that we could have a comfortable stay and not worry about having to move that mama-jamma. Staff was really nice and told us all the fun things to do downtown. Hotel is clean and really decked out.Amazing business, art hotel!  One of the only hotels that has been fully curated by an art museum in the country.  Very modern decor throughout, with comfy beds in the rooms and a posh mixology lounge, Plat 99.  Located perfectly downtown with walking distance of a Pacers or Colts game.  7 minute walk to Monument Circle and 15 minute walk to Mass Ave.Stayed here for a conference. The check-in girl, Luan, was a little rude, like helping me check-in was inconvenient. Also, she didn't think to tell me about being able to charge the garage to the room (which costs less than if you pay and leave and return), and gave me a hard time when I asked her to confirm the room was being paid for by the conference (which it was supposed to be since I was a speaker attending for that purpose and they had made all the arrangements.)I followed up that day with my contact at the conference and it was confirmed again that they had made the reservation and were paying for the room. So I went back to check-out to let them know that the conference person would stop by and remind them, which she the head of the conference did and let the desk know to please send them the charges. Then the next day I went back and it was the same girl, Luan. When I asked about the garage, first she said that she couldn't refund the extra charges on the garage. Then when I pressed to have the double parking cost removed (as I had added the daily parking rate to my room and was charged when I tried to exit the garage earlier) then she did the return - very begrudgingly! I never would have had the extra charge if she had told me about the parking garage in the first place!She also told me that yes the person from the conference had stopped by the front desk,to confirm the conference was covering the room. But, she said that I would still need to stop by the front desk AGAIN in the morning to check with the hotel's conference person who would come in and I needed to take it up with her. seriously?It's really frustrating - for a hotel this nice they ought to check that all front desk people are well trained.Just stayed here for a conference for three days and nights. What a lovely hotel. Very clean and sleek and the staff was friendly, knowledgable and professional. Everyone had a smile and was willing to help. The food was amazing and the Market Place buffet had great choices, all fresh and delicious. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for comfort and class in downtown Indiana.","Came the hotel for an after hours social event. The space was really nice. The staff seemed cool and parking was good.This hotel has a lot of potential and great customer service. The problem I had with this hotel is the room. First of all we came in and the toilet seat was dirty. It didn't seem like feces but still gross. Let's write that off as isolated. The rug in the room overall looked dirty, and had a large stain on it. Probably hadn't been cleaned in a while.  The floor underneath seamed nice, if only they had just removed the rug. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling, and the shower head was in some serious need of CLR. To be honest the thing that annoyed me the most was they have no movie rental service. Just basic cable plus HBO. The wife and I were away from the baby for a night it would have been nice to enjoy a movie. What hotel doesn't have movie rental. What the heck?  I am not even looking for adult movies. Just something I can pick when it starts and not have any commercials. So in the end. Not worth your money. It seems really cool when you walk in but the don't pay enough attention to their rooms to make it worth it.Beautiful, modern, and reasonably priced! The decor is modern and their gym is amazing. The service is as good as it gets. I definitely recommend this hotel with high praise.Great hotel, the art creates an amazing atmosphere. Up to date, clean, modern rooms that look great. Plenty of shower room, and the overhead shower heads should be mandatory in every other hotel! Who knew this little gem existed in Indianapolis!Staff was nice, check in was easy.Only thing is I wish there was a little more walking distance around the hotel, but I'm sure in a few years the development will catch up.Would deserve a 5 star... But the lady a check out was unorganized and not helpful with the package I had coming in UPS red early AM.  Short of that the other 4 days of my stay were 5/5 stars.Everything at The Alexander is first class. If you're a guest in the hotel, you're really treated like royalty by the staff. When we checked in, the front desk asked our group (four women) if we were staying for any special reason. We explained we weren't out of towners, but we would be going out that night to celebrate a 30th birthday and wanted to stay somewhere nice downtown. They immediately upgraded our room to a gorgeous suite (full kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a corner view with a wrap-around balcony) gave us four free drink tickets, breakfast tickets, and, later, sent up a bottle of champagne with four glasses. This is not the first high end hotel I've stayed in, but I've never had so many extra perks thrown in! The women at the front desk were enthusiastic, and excited to help us celebrate. They were wonderful and helpful with all of our questions. The room was, in short, awesome. Luxurious bed linens, gorgeous furniture and design elements, wonderful lighting (no overhead!) The bathroom lighting was fantastic. We were able to crowd into one bathroom while we got ready; the mirror was big enough to accommodate everyone. There were even magnifying mirrors in each room. The kitchen was stocked with cooking utensils and glasses and a dishwasher. I think it was an extended stay room that they let us use just for the night. It even had a full size refrigerator. Each bedroom had an iHome clock radio/stereo, which we used to listen to music from our iPhones. It sounds cliche, but it really seems they've ""thought of everything.""I don't think I'll be able to stay anywhere else downtown. The Alexander has spoiled me, completely. With a AAA discount, and all of the perks they threw in, I felt like we didn't even come close to paying what our stay was worth. Even without all that, I'd still choose The Alexander over other high end establishments downtown, just thanks to the wonderful staff. They left a lasting impression. I'd give it six stars, if I could. Now go. Book a room. Who cares if you don't have a reason?The people are amazing! The place wasn't even open yet and they let us poke around. The art and atmosphere is top notch!Beautiful hotel, feels crisp and new.  Rooms are clean and bedding is SO comfortable.  Nice bath products and proper soap in the shower.  Surprised there was no tub, only shower.  Loved the fruit infused water in the lobby, very refreshing.  Breakfast was fresh (made to order eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, fruit, etc).  Plat 99 bar had cool ambiance.  Gym was a bit difficult to find, small but sufficient.  Had a billing error - was charged for minibar food I did not take.  Staff reversed the charges quickly and easily when I brought this to their attention.  Would definitely consider staying here again.Attended a one day conference here. The snack service for meetings is awesome! The meeting rooms were very nice and comfortable. This is obviously a very upscale hotel. Would love to stay here some time.Great hotel. very clean and modern. The staff at the front desk was not that knowledgeable about places to eat.There's a lot of good things to say about The Alexander. Free wifi, an in-room Keurig with several free K-cups, interactive touchscreen directories and art galore. The best thing though was the thoughtfulness of the staff. I forgot to bring batteries for some headphones I recently bought, no problem, they just gave me some for free. My girlfriend casually mentioned that it was her birthday... Free champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a well thought out card from Steve at the front desk. It's this kind of thing, particularly in contrast to some other downtown hotels, that will have us coming back to The Alexander for weekend getaways. The only downside to this place is the lack of a pool and hot tub, but seeing as they don't advertise them, I couldn't really count it against them. In all, given the price I paid, this was one of the best overall hotel experiences I've had. I certainly plan to stay again.loved this hotel. i want to stay here anytime we are in indy. the architecture and interior design is really cool. i felt like i was staying in a contemporary art museum. we spent part of an evening just roaming the floors and garage to look at all the art. very cool. i love all the lights in the bar. i felt like it was out of ""lost in translation.""the room was super nice and comfortable. it was also surprisingly quiet. it might have been that we were there on a sunday night but normally all night in hotels you can here doors slamming and elevators and random noises but it was silent. the hotel staff accommodated us getting a late start and helped us move our checkout time to noon with no extra cost. great place, great staff!What an amazing hotel!  Fabulous service, cool art, and well designed functional rooms.  One of the few times I was sad to leave a hotel.  Everything hotel wise was perfect... except for the food.  There's no where to get drinks/snacks in the hotel and all the food available is pricey.  The lunch buffet restaurant was ok...unfortunately, there wasn't enough customers to keep the food fresh and hot.  Service was again great.  Finally...the reason why I'm taking one star away...I ordered crab cakes and shrimp and grits one night for room service.  Dinner was tasty...however, i ended up sick and throwing up in the middle of the night!  Disappointing blemish on an otherwise fabulous stay.Had a morning meeting at Market Table yesterday and breakfast was fantastic. Made to order eggs, great coffee and a few items from the open kitchen was all I needed, thankfully, it came with outstanding service! Great way to start the day.The second week in April 2013  I stayed there in a corporate room. What a delightful surprise. I loved the eclectic art, the desk staff, and the food in the restaurant. The breakfast was oh so healthy and quality food in my opinion. The sleek modern room decor is fun and fresh. I especially liked the lighted magnifier mirror in the bathroom.Went on a tour of this facility through Visit Indy and oh my goodness it was so nice. Loved the implementation of art and local. Cerulean was top notch. Plat 99 food was meh, but those are different reviews.Sleek contemporary style hotel with an exclusive art collection make this place one of a kind especially in Indianapolis.  Clean minimalist rooms with a lot of light. Free wifi is always a benefit I enjoy.Nice addition to the downtown area.  I can't wait for the weather to warm up to get back down there and be out and about.one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, aesthetically. i was there during the hurricanes that swept through IN in November, and the staff was so attentive, especially when the power went out. brought guests into the basement, gave us water bottles, and played music for us until the storm had passed. i ended up leaving a scarf and a sweater in the room and when i called to see if they found the items, they shipped it back to me and took care of the shipping even when i tried to give them my CC number. seriously, wow. cannot wait to go back, such a beautiful hotel.At first, I thought ""Ick. A hipster hotel that's trying way too hard."" But when I left, I was completely convinced. Truly, a wonderful place. A little off the beaten path, but you'll get a one-of-a-kind customer experience. Their biggest draw should be their amazing (IMA curated) art collection. This would be a wonderful spot for a wedding-you could rent the entire place. Their dining areas was really nice, home to some excellent food. Plat 99 is awesome too. They have yoga on the lawn, bikes to rent, and soon they'll have a partnership with the giant YMCA going in across the street. And their prices are fantastic! I encourage you to check out this hotel.","Though this was limited-service, I had a good experience and hit up every service staff employee I could to inquire about their own experiences. I had a good vibe, despite any turnover which may exist. The limited food I had, the sliders, were very good, and I was extremely excited to know they carried Prohibition liquor. I don't know how much of the stock they have, but it's a fantastic start - recommend!!! Platt 99 was nice and the desk staff on the outskirts of the bar was fantastic. There was a female staff agent tonight who was extremely helpful, however her name escapes me. She was pleasant, friendly, and knowledgable. I will re-visit to learn her name, because she was great in my experience of The AlexanderBeware.   We stayed at the Alexander in order to be close to basketball games at Bankers Life.  Coming down for breakfast, we were told that they couldn't seat us for a buffet breakfast for 2 + hours, despite many empty tables throughout the restaurant.  It would probably not have been too bad, except there was not apology or regret at this.  Furthermore, we were told that the next closest restaurant that was open for breakfast was a substantial walk (in the frigid cold) or a taxi ride.  Beware if you would like a meal or employees that were empathetic.My wife and I decided not to go back out to the west side after a night of revelry at the Columbia Club, and happened upon the Alexander in a web search. Although I did not think the place was any great shakes (except that it is new, clean,  and very metropolitan), I will say the service was absolutely fantastic. Now, to be fair, I am an old fart and not easily impressed, nor am I easily deterred. The beds were comfortable, to be sure, the showers were big, fancy-schmancy all around. I don't think it deserved a 5 star rating just because it's new, but it is a solid, SOLID four star, and I think a younger customer might think it was all the dogs and then some.Very interesting layout and decor, including a few multiple dimensional pieces of art. Platt 99 is a very modern looking bar with a collection of art glass lighting fixtures. The room was clean and sparsely furnished with a poster on the wall in place of art - which was disappointing given their self designated ""art hotel"" moniker. Their web site as well as the info guide in the room stated that they have a museum store in their gift shop - when they don't even have any gift shop according to the employees. That is on their yet to come list, so is misrepresented in their marketing. The coffee maker in the room didn't work, even though new. The biggest issue was the lack of service available. A room service order for breakfast was still undelivered 1 hour and 2 calls later. Since the order was for yogurt, bagel, etc., I couldn't find any excuse - and none was offered by the staff. While I am sure they will get control of these issues soon, I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to return.","['highly', 'recommend', 'hotel', 'anyone', 'staying', 'night', 'interviewing', 'company',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-indianapolis-city-centre-hotel-indianapolis-4,Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel,3.0,$$,88,"This place was amazing. Great bar in the lobby area. I was there just for the night so just needed a place to rest my weary bones and relax before a long day driving the next day. I had such fun just chatting with the very friendly bartender on duty. It felt like chatting with an old friend.The room was immaculate and the bed was ohhh so comfy. I had one of the best nights sleep in a long time. I really loved this place and the view was AMAZING!The hotel's structure, rooms, amenities, and the location is great. The front desk staff is not approachable and they do not represent the hospitable standard upheld by the Sheraton brand. The location of this hotel is wonderful. It's in close proximity to lots of shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. The hotel is in great condition. This review is based mainly on how I was treated by the front desk.It was Valentines weekend. Of course this hotel would be booked to 100% capacity if not oversold however, that is not my problem. My flight was cancelled so we had to extend our stay at this hotel. Now, usually most hotels would be able to smile and say ""Sorry we don't have rooms available for tonight blah blah blah"" however, my company has a contract with this hotel and if such thing were to happen, they would have to extend it no matter the circumstance. The front desk then started complaining to me how this was an inconvenience to me and how they didn't have rooms for us and we should have checked out hours ago. I don't remember filling out an application to the Sheraton can somebody please remind me when I started working here again? I'm sorry about your issues but I'm your guest, you don't complain to me about your problems. Unprofessional.I am not a fan of this hotel and it is a last resort when all the other hotel options (The Conrad and Hilton) are sold out. On a recent trip, room service failed to answer their phone for breakfast, forcing me to go down and order and wait in the restaurant for a to go order. Similarly for dinner the server gave me the apps menu and then disappeared for more than 10 mins - I left! The hotel was also ridiculously hot, with no way to turn on any air to cool down the rooms. And don't get me started on the ridiculous bathroom layout with the toilet arranged under the bathroom counter. It is just weird! I am sure I will have to stay here again for work at some point and can only hope they fix these issues.Could Indianapolis be where Starwood is trialing their new ""use fitted sheets like a normal human"" policy? Both this and the Sheraton Keystone Crossing are acting like we all do at home, and using bed linens that don't just end up in a crumpled mess after 10 minutes. You hear me Starwood? This is awesome. Do this everywhere.That aside, this place is fine. The lobby itself is a little dated, but the rooms look to have been recently refreshed and they're pretty comfortable. I notice coworker Frank L.'s review from 2010, and would comment that while the TV has been replaced with a more modern edition, I must agree with the room temperature settings - the room was always warmer than the set point, and this during early December, something I wouldn't expect to have to struggle with. Beds were comfy (what with those fitted sheets) and the bathrooms were fine. I do want to comment that my suite (I think I got upgraded because I certainly didn't book that) featured some mood lighting built in to some bookcases, and idiot me was about to unscrew the light bulbs before I figured out that the switch to turn off said lights was a black switch built in to the black bookcase...almost impossible to see, at least for this moron. Just an odd design decision, I wonder if anyone else has had this problem, or if i'm just stupid.The lounge had a little better breakfast spread than Keystone Crossing did, but not as nice of a coffee machine. I found myself missing the cappuccino from Keystone, but this is actually a pretty nice club lounge with more fruit and juice options, as well as one or two hot items each day. Interesting to me the difference between two Sheraton lounges just about 20 miles apart (or closer).We bailed out and booked here rather than our standard Keystone Crossing when Keystone was completely booked out one week, and for whatever reason, these rooms at retail were cheaper than the negotiated rate my project team has at the Keystone Crossing. Unfortunately, the client's office is really inconveniently located from this place (no highway option, all busy surface streets and stoplight parades), and parking isn't free, rapidly eating up any savings on the room rate. But it's certainly a serviceable option, and in a good area with tons of walkable restaurants. If the rates are always as low as they were for me, this would be a solid option in downtown Indianapolis.Perfectly  little lounge spot comfortable  break spot with  a in house Starbucks and bar and grillI'd like to give this place 3.5 stars overall, though you see it as a 4 here. There's a lot of old-meets-new all over this place. The parking garage, for example, very old. I initially exited through some stairs with creaking doors into an old hallway with leaky pipes and maybe mold, then into the street. From there, walked down a quarter block to the Sheraton main entrance. By the way parking is $25 a night. After checking in, you'll notice the elevators inside actually take you to the different floors in the parking structure. That's good.Lobby is nice, and it was cool to see the bar was open even at 12:30am when I got here. Receptionist was very nice, answered my questions, and since I am a platinum guest, he let me know about the 10th floor club lounge and gave me a room upgrade to a suite. Elevators up and hallway are old, but the suite was totally new and modern. New everything, beautiful dark furniture, granite counters, flat TVs, refrigerator, and microwave. Kinda like a one bedroom condo I have back home. I like to keep the curtains open, but here can't do it because of the office building right across. Water in the room warmed up quickly, and I put the placard up to get the $5 green choice vouchers daily. Everything runs well here. If only they fixed that initial hallway and warmed up the hotel hallways a bit.Junior Suite walk-around: <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv39risJYr2Q&amp;s=34ac1982d17b0f71a47982ba63855c7dfabb855d5f97323a4be6db37c76f5333"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=v39r...</a>Parlor Suite walk-around: <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV2r9OLE9SKI&amp;s=c88729543393de65130a04edd1907ebf5549760bcce7b7861d1d7d23b65a6f15"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=V2r9...</a>It gets the job done! Good location in downtown Indy. Comfortable, clean beds. Staff was friendly - not amazinggg, but they did their job. My room was located on the 17th floor and had a gorgeoussss view. I uploaded pictures, so take a look! :) Especially at night when the lights lit up on the Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument. Parking was $25/night for self-park. Wifi was only free up to a certain GB. I got a room with 2 double beds - pretty standard. It's not superrrr close to the stadium...I think about a 20 minute walk? Or maybe I'm just a slow walker...Otherwise, it was close to lots of bars/restaurants!Mixed bag of experiences across two stays here.Here in May, for both work and the Indy 500, I booked a suite and enjoyed the 2-room (living and bedroom) space.  Large and comfortable couch, with a dark wood finish in the living room and a decent selection of interesting books on the bookshelves.  One of the main highlights of my stay was the excellent help and advice given by Judy, the rockstar behind the smooth operation of the Front Desk at night.  My second stay in November was a bit more aggravating.  I was initially excited to see that the hotel had upgraded my standard-room booking to the ""Presidential Suite"".  I'd booked on Starwood's Birthday rate, meaning I paid the regular room rate for the first night and the last 2 digits of my birth year for each additional night.  Unfortunately, as I arrived after midnight, the hotel's booking system made a mess of the billing, which took nearly a month after my stay to finally sort out fully.  Furthermore, the room itself was a bit distressing, as I was horrified to discover that the entry door did not close properly unless one slammed it brutally, which I didn't do at first, only to discover my room open to the world after coming back from dinner.  The room facelifts the hotel has undertaken are nice, but I do have to regret that the bathroom in the suite still looks old, tired, and I had issues with my running water one morning as I went in for a shower.  On a more positive note, I left behind a set of cufflinks, and Samantha from Housekeeping was quick to find them and package them up wonderfully for a next-day FedEx back to me.Probably the worst part of my November stay was trying to receive a package.  I'd had an urgent package (couldn't depart without it) sent to my attention for 8AM delivery, and at 8AM, the hotel turned away the FedEx driver.  FedEx came back and successfully the package at 10:45, but despite my numerous conversations with the Front Desk Manager and all staff on duty at the time, nobody notified me of the delivery until after noon (Front Desk Manager's excuse - ""Oh - I'm short, and the package was placed a little too high for me to see it easily"").  That delay ended up costing me my flight, and over $100 in car transfer charges to make an international connection.  As an SPG Platinum member with over 100 nights in 2014, that takes the cake as the absolute worst customer service fail of the year.All in all, two stays, and two very different customer service experiences.  I'm not entirely sure if I'd come back now that there is a Le Meridien in Indianapolis, but if I do it is only because I know that there are great staff like Judy and Samantha here who care.7226 Woodland Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46278, United StatesAwesome staff, comfortable beds, amazing view.... And to top it all off, the soap smells really good. :P The check out time wasn't until NOON!!! Our parking was FREE. The guy below who said the internet wasn't free was wrong.... He just needed to get the access code. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star is.... Where's the breakfast?OK, but not great, especially for the posted price.  The posted room rate was $500 per day.  PLASTIC CUPS, not glass.  Cheap. No mention of breakfast provided.  I discovered this a few moments ago.  The bar served HORRIBLE flavored stale popcorn.  AVOID IT.  YUK!!!   The bed was not so good, morning backache!  BUT, the parking was included.  The restaurant Alexander's served a very nice Ruben sandwich.  Great service there.  Nice rooms.  Lovely view.  Nicely decorated with pictures of Indianapolis.  A very nice location, steps from  Monument Circle, and near lots of restaurants.  Very nice staff.OK, but not for $500 a night.$350, nope.   $275, maybe.$25 for parking. That's all you need to know. It's a nice hotel, in a great part of town, and great value for my Starwood Points...but $25 for parking! This isn't NYC, it's Indianapolis. I've stayed at dozens of Sheraton's over the years, and parking is usually cheaper for those staying at the hotel, especially when I'm a Gold Starwood Member. I get it, I'm a spoiled hotel traveler who doesn't want to pay for parking. But seriously, if you're considering staying here budget for the ridiculous the $25/daily parking rate.Possibly the most convenient location ever for access to downtown Indy, as it's right on Monument Circle with swarms of taxi fleets downstairs. But overall, not too happy with my experience at this Sheraton.Pros:- Great location for downtown, with pretty much a taxi hub downstairs.- Not much else.Cons:- Really old building, and it shows in the rooms and hallways.- Impossibly slow elevators. Since most guests are business guests, getting out of the hotel between 7-9 AM involves budgeting ~15min to wait for the elevator.- The Club Room was a disappointment... you need to be SPG Silver/Gold, or pay $30, or get a room on the 14th floor, for access. And even then the selection isn't too great.- The connected Starbucks has a line nearly out the door for the morning cuppa Joe.do not eat at alexanders bar and grill, horrible nasty food plenty good places close by. In addition three other of my travel companions also on separate times had the worst experience and food ever.A nice room, but some issues.First, I'd like to acknowledge that the bed was great. And the hotel's location in the center of the city makes it attractive for tourists and business travelers. That counts for a something.My recent stay at the Sheraton coincided with the 99th running of the Indianapolis 500. While on the surface the hotel seemed nice, ultimately a series of small issues accumulated to make the stay less than pleasant.One of my primary gripes regarding the hotel concerns billing. Simply put, I was charged for the whole stay when the room was supposed to be billed to a corporate account. That would be an understandable error had I not pointed it out repeatedly while I was there, and assured by staff (repeatedly) that it would be taken care of.Instead, it's one week after my stay and the charge for the whole stay went through on my debit card, which was supposed to be for incidentals. Not cool. I finally contacted the accounting department directly, and the hotel is issuing a refund, but it's worth noting that this Sheraton held on to over a thousand bucks it was not entitled to for over a week. During my fourth (and hopefully final) interaction with customer service, I was told it was my fault for providing a debit card instead of a credit card. Ummm... no.Another issue pertained to noise. The guests in the next room over were clearly interested in late night partying and arguments. At 2 am I was woken up by someone shouting ""come on in and join the party"" which was followed by the thump of a subwoofer. I called the front desk, which sent security--it took seven minutes before I heard the knock on their door, and the noise subsided. But not too much later I heard a female voice scream ""You are such an ***hole"" through the (apparently thin) walls. The arguments and yelling continued and I had to call security again. I wound up getting only four hours of sleep that night.Given that I was awake at 3 am, I went to the mini-fridge to grab a bottled water--you know, the one that costs $4.00 if you open it. I opened it but could not get a single sip out of it because it was frozen solid. Oops.The elevators in the hotel were a low-light of the trip. Sometimes the cars had a mind of their own, reversing direction or refusing to stop in the lobby. And during the morning rush, the wait for an elevator seemed interminable. Another issue was breakfast. When I pay $25 for a classic two eggs and bacon breakfast, I like it when the potatoes are edible and the eggs cooked as I requested. I strongly dislike it when I am served eggs with broken yolks, as I was at the Indianapolis Sheraton. I was also baffled that the servers did not ask if I wanted OJ, I had to ask for it.One more gripe... as nice as the location is, there is a homeless presence that made stepping outside the door in the morning a bit nerve-wracking. It's not the hotel's fault, but basically if you take a left turn out of the entrance instead of a right, you might have an encounter. On the last day I was there, within seconds of stepping outside, I was approached by a vagrant who asked if I would help buy him a beverage. When I declined, I was lectured. Sorry, bud.Also, I was annoyed by the limo drivers trying to hustle for passengers when I already told him I had arranged and paid for transport. How many times do I have to say ""no?""The hotel should make an effort to maintain a nicer environment at its doorstep.OK, so on the plus side the bed was nice, the room was clean, and the shower had hot water. But I've stayed at enough hotels to know that customers should expect a bit more at the Sheraton's price point.Stayed here for 1 night with my husband. Room was fine. Bathroom was set up awkwardly. You could hear the toilet flush in the room next to us. Parking was easy. We did receive a coupon for a free appetizer at a local restaurant, so that was nice. Overall, would probably stay here again if it was cheaper then some other options.I had a very pleasant stay at this hotel!I am new to staying at Sheraton hotels, but I think it is genius for them to provide guests with a $5 voucher in place of room cleaning service for the next day. There was a Starbucks in the hotel, so it was nice to use the voucher there for Breakfast. I was happy to see that they provided a refrigerator for my use (it wasn't stocked full of expensive drinks like other hotels), they provided free bottled water, and even a loofah to shower with! Their exercise room had everything I wanted, their internet was free and fast enough for me, the bed was comfy, the room was clean, the staff was friendly, I didn't hear other guests while staying in my room, the electrical outlets were easy to access for a phone charger, and they provided free Starbucks coffee and tea products in the room. The location was also perfect for me - near my work and lots of restaurants, and I had the beautiful City Centre as a view from my room.The only things that would make this a 5-star hotel is:1. Better elevators. The doors opened at random times, the numbers didn't always light up after you pressed them, I had to wait 3 minutes to get an elevator one morning, and they didn't indicate which floor the gym was on.2. Better TV reception. I don't watch too much TV, so it didn't bother me enough to say anything about it until the end of my stay, but the TV wasn't getting reception for channels like: the History channel, HGTV, Hallmark, Animal Planet, Discovery, etc. I told the front desk at the end of my stay so they could maybe fix it for a future guest and they were very nice and offered me a free $5 voucher to Starbucks for the inconvenience.Before I start, I will say that the front desk is friendly, as is one of the managers, but the General Manager (Bill) is inattentive, dismissive, and rude.I was worried about this hotel as I had heard about many bad experiences from my colleagues. My own experience was a nightmare. I did not even continue to stay there despite a stay 5 nights get 1 night free SPG promotion, which I could have gained more nights for. There were so many issues that I've made them into bullet points here:1. The bathroom water (soiled water) overflowed on the 9th and 10th floors 2. The faucets started emitting brown water (which some people accidentally were already mid-showered b/c no one told them) before the hotel temporarily shut the water down. 3. Gross spots on the bed mattress4. I grabbed a granola bar in the Club Lounge, only to later open it - take a few bites- and realize it was moldy. I was horrified, that is a serious health issue. I called the hotel very upset so that they could remove the granola bars from the Lounge, and I was furious and demanded to be called by the GM. I informed them at that time I would contact FDA/ Health Department for health violation. They promised to call him. I heard nothing for about a week. Only when I returned (because I had booked it already through work) and complained again at the front desk and to a manager did I finally get a call from the GM. He seemed apologetic initially, but skeptical of my complaint. He promised to compensate with points and inspect the food. He called again later that day, accused me of lying (I couldn't remember the exact time I called nor the date on the granola bar... BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A WEEK!!), and said that they get complaints like mine 10 times a week. I was infuriated and insulted, but most importantly worried. What kind of a hotel doesn't care about food complaints?! Further, I brought up my concern of prior issues in the hotel, and he claimed that he knew exactly who it was who complained b/c he knew where I worked...he then proceeded to name a company I do not work at. I acknowledge that the above 3 situations were resolved. But at the expense of my faith in this hotel. The GM was incredibly defensive, rude and accusatory in his emails and phone conversations with me. He also was highly aggressive by placing multiple calls to my hotel room when i was staying at the hotel to interrogate me regarding the food situation. I became so uncomfortable I vowed to never stay at this hotel again unless every other hotel in the area was booked out.I'm driven to write this now as AGAIN an issue has arisen. When I initially checked into this hotel I asked the front desk if I was all set for the SPG promotion of staying 5 nights and get 1 free night at any Sheraton. I was told ""You're all set,"" I didn't need to take any further action to register. I just called SPG (I am a platinum member) to use this promotion and was informed this was not the case. I asked SPG to resolve the issue. I then received an unsolicited email from Bill Seitl first asking me whom the staff member was (it is not my job to record which staff members tell me information), then again to deny the request which SPG put in for me (they were trying to determine how to best meet the promotion). He was rude, dismissive, and callous in his emails and phone conversations. The worst experience I have EVER had with a hotel.I travel a lot for work, but I've never had such an awful experience where I've felt the need to post online. THERE ARE MANY HOTELS IN INDIANAPOLIS - CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE!Really beautiful hotel but you definitely are paying for what you get. Their garage parking is $20 a night which is kind of steep but worth it considering the location. Since it was my SO's birthday we booked for the executive view which was definitely worth the extra splurge, super great view of the buildings and monuments. The room setup however was pretty small which isn't a huge problem since there were only two of us. The only downside is that the walls are VERY THIN. We heard the ""activities"" of our neighbors all night long which wasn't only awkward but disruptive in terms of sleep. something to keep in mind. Really nice place for a weekend getaway, and if you're interested they have a Starbucks and a full restaurant in the lobby. Staff was welcoming but not overwhelming worth noting. Clean, decent decor, but nothing too special. The lobby is a lot prettier than any of the rooms.This hotel was really nice.  Great location,  very quiet insulated rooms,  comfortable beds,  great view,  clean bathrooms,  refrigerator,  nice decor,  multiple elevators. If you travel and need a QUIET room that you can get great sleep in,  this is the place.  I have a hard time sleeping and I slept like a rock in this place.Gave us the wrong room","Pleasantly impressed as I didn't expect much with a last minute reservation so we had somewhere to stay after the Florida Georgia Line Concert.  I was able to get my corporate rate a few days in advance.  We wound up on the 20th floor (only 21 floors) for which the desk lady said had been recently remodeled.  It was newer but nothing amazing, however it was clean and had everything we wanted.  I much rather have had one king bed, but we wound up with doubles.  We had a nice view of the circle and the snow (I'm a sucker for a view).  The staff was friendly and got us checked in quickly.  We had a late night snack at the restaurant.  They had a limited late night menu, but it worked (chicken quesadilla, $12 i believe?)  There is some construction happening on the building across the road it looks like.  We didn't hear anything as we were on the other side of the building, but it may be heard on the weekday when they are working? Overall, it was a good experience, well worth our corporate leisure rate for a nice in-town get away.  (PS First Watch just around the corner had good food for breakfast)The location is great the the staff is extra friendly. I was recently in town for work and the Sheraton is situated in the middle of downtown. It was a quick walk to the Fieldhouse, convention center, shopping and nightlife. It was my first time in downtown Indy and the staff assisted me in getting around the area.Pros-great location -nice staffCons-we had to wait 30 minutes for a luggage rack when we first checked in-elevators are slow and don't seem to open the doors at the right time. At one point I saw a guy step up off the elevator at his floor. -our A/C didn't seem to be working (but we didn't say anything so this didn't factor into the review)-no ice machines. You must call down to the front desk and have them deliver it to the room, which took 30-40 minutes at leastI was flown in to Indy for a meeting at the world HQ of a pharma company, and they put me up here. The room was very comfortable, the bed was TERRIFIC, and I slept very well.I gotta wonder at the lack of HBO on the in-house TV service. I also question the fact that, if you're eating in the restaurant or bending elbows in the bar (both are adjacent to the lobby) you must ask at the desk for a key to get into the restroom. According to the desk jockeys, it's ""because of homeless people."" I'm sorry, but I didn't notice a large cohort of homeless folks in downtown Indy. And all my years in NYC gave me a ""never, not even once"" experience of having to ask permission to use a lobby restroom, particularly if I was eating dinner in the hotel restaurant.So ... only 3 stars.I read a lot of different reviews of this hotel, this is my experience:Easy to get to from the Airport, and there is a garage attached to the hotel. I fit a Durango in there no problem. The check in was easy, very courteous staff, and the room was clean. There is a Starbucks right off the lobby and they take the hotel vouchers for coffee. They have a club level which had good enough food every morning and evening... The showers were clean, hot, and good water pressure.. WiFi worked and was free for me anyway, I mean I really can't complain.I was in town for work and we ended up here because of its close proximity. I was pleased with the location, the rate and the comfort of the bed. The elevators are a bit slow, but it is an older hotel. The walls are a little thin, but thankfully, the only noises coming thru were the flushing toilet, not anything ""else"". The workout room on the top floor was open 24 hours and was very nice for my needs.  Only gripe, the bathroom was a bit small!I chose Sheraton's Indianapolis City Centre Hotel as the base of operations for New Year's Eve for a group of 4. The staff at the Sheraton made our group feel very welcome. From accommodating our room requests to assisting with food orders, each individual with whom we interacted was friendly and sincere. I had some difficulty/confusion about my online reservation and I was amazed by how quickly and effectively the staff helped me create the perfect evening for my group. The hotel has private parking which was a huge relief as downtown parking can be difficult and pricey. The lobby was very classy and I was greeted immediately. The view from our suite has to be the best the city has to offer. While some of the facilities and decor were a bit dated, it seemed as though improvements and updates were underway. The size of the suite was impressive. I wish we would have had more time to relax there and enjoy the accommodations but New Year's plans wouldn't wait. We did not have time to enjoy the Alexander restaurant in the hotel but I have read wonderful reviews. I will be staying at this classy downtown hotel again! P.S. The Sheraton has an exceptional snack room with a huge variety of munchies should you find yourself hungry after all restaurants have closed.We have stayed at 2 hotels in Indianapolis - Sheraton, Hyatt Regency. The Sheraton is definitely the better choice of the 2. We stayed here APR 2014 and a couple of years ago as well. LOCATION: Excellent. Convenient location right in the middle of the action on Monument Circle. You can walk to attractions like the park, Mass Ave, Circle Center Mall, the football stadium and basketball arena and a ton of restaurants. Downtown Indy is quite small. ROOMS: It has recently been renovated so the rooms are beautiful and modern. We had a suite on the 10th floor, which was huge! There was the bedroom with a tv and living room with a couch and tv with a small library, kitchenette with a sink, microwave and fridge. The bathroom area had 2 sinks and plenty of room. AMENITIES: The gym on the top floor (21st floor) is great! I can tell this is new. Nice equipment and great variety - elliptical, treadmill, bike and free weights and a weight machine, floor mats, medicine balls, foam rollers, etc. Definitely a very nice gym! There is a Starbucks as well as a restaurant and bar on the 1st floor. The only complaint I have from our whole stay is the old creaky elevators which seem like an anachronism in the newly renovated rooms and common areas. PERKS: Complimentary Starbucks coffee in your room to make with the provided coffee maker. Even still to this day, this is the best Sheraton Club I've been to. It's on the 10th floor with 24/7 access to the most variety of juices, coffee, tea, fruit, snacks.  Hot breakfast and nightly hot appetizers complimentary with club access. I was impressed with the hot appetizers being grilled vegetables (red and green peppers, eggplants, squash), chicken tenders, sweet and sour meatballs, and an impressive cheese and cracker plate among other selections. You could definitely make a dinner out of this! It is such a nice place to read the paper or watch TV.  TIPS: Upgrades are easier to get when you are an SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) member and you earn points for free hotel stays in the future. SERVICE: Also excellent. Our check-in was no problem and MJ at the front desk was extra helpful to us. CONCLUSION: Our experience was top notch - great location, upgraded to a suite, getting club access, and great amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel!They have recently renovated and it really does look great. We have stayed here for our wedding, got ready in a nice parlor room attached to our suite. They accommodated our needs and Brian Ward the evening manager was great. This stay was for our anniversary and same great service. The pool area is a nice roof top view  and has plenty of chairs and tables even if you're not swimming. They could tend to the cleanness the pool and area. Several cigarettes, band aids and trash about. Great stay if you're downtown and on the circleGreat hotel, recently renovated and in a great location. Upgraded to a suite on the 14th floor and couldn't be happier with the size of the room and amenities. Club Lounge is open 24/7, and had some very nice snacks waiting for us at 2am. Parking is a bit pricey, but that's to be expected in any major city.Decent hotel, but I have to knock down one star because they don't have free Internet in the rooms. The work out facility in the lobby is also very small with limited machines. However, they do have complimentary bottled water in the gym. The rooms are also stocked with Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas. The hotel is in a great location and it's behind the Monument Circle where the Soldiers' and Sailors' neoclassical structure is located. I even got a room facing it! (See my picture) Lots of restaurants and shopping in the area, but I didn't really venture out too far. It was raining, so I just went to ABP and went back to my room. I'm a Starwood Member and read that they offer free happy hour and breakfast on the 10th floor, but I woke up so late so I didn't get to try it. Maybe next time.Great room, freshly remodeled(we were first in it), great GREAT service, fast exercise room with a good view on 21st floor.  Great location in the heart of the action.  View out our window of the monument.  Easy parking.  No indoor pool was the only negative, but the exercise room was equipped well enough we didn't really miss it.The wife stayed there three days for a conference. She said the conference facilities were good but the food served through the conference was not very good. The room was a little on the small size with two queens (she shared a room). She noted the room had an ""odd smell"" that went away when she turned on the heat. Likely either a room that had not been used recently. She noted, while her room had a hot shower, a lot of her co-workers complained about cold showers. I asked if she would stay there again, if it was one her dime. ""oh hell no"" was her reply.Front Desk assured us of no construction noise, that's all we heard all day. Called down to front desk and the noise never stopped. Elevator noise also, so request a room far away from them.  Better yet if you want a place to get some sleep and rest. Go elsewhere.Horrible!!! Its after 11pm. We are staying in a suite at the hotel. And it seems there is a wedding reception venue somewhere in the general vicinity (Regions Bank tower). They knew our 17month old daughter was staying with us. But now no one can sleep because its like the horrible cover band is right in our room the music is so loud! Don't stay here or make sure you are as far from that venue as possible.Staying for a weekend trip in Indianapolis and booked directly through the hotel( did not use a travel site). The hotel failed to inform my wife and I that they were sponsoring an event that started at 7 am on Saturday and featured incredibly loud music and a loudspeaker. On the 11th floor and could hear every word like it was being broadcast directly into my room. Worse than staying at a hotel with construction.We were in town for the MEQ volleyball tournament. This was a great place to stay! I'm actually glad we didn't stay somewhere closer to the convention center since we've been exploring Indy on our walks to and from the convention center. This hotel had about everything we needed on site. And so much of downtown Indy was within easy walking distance in all directions. We parked the car on Friday night and haven't started it up since. Yes, they do charge for Internet in the rooms, the shower head was low flow, there is no free breakfast, and no mini fridge, but it was a great place to stay for our three nights in town. This is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city with a very friendly staff!Stayed here during the convention time.  The hotel is located right next to the monument, which is a very short (about 3 blocks) to the skywalk, which connects to the mall and the convention center.  Odd number rooms have better view facing the monument while the suites are on the even number rooms.The hotel rooms are very clean, although it is a bit older style.  Typical Sheraton (pre renovation) decoration.  The lobby staffs were friendly and relax.  Its much more relax feeling than other Sheraton hotels in other metropolitan city.  However, the problem with this hotels are the lift.  One of the lift have that ""Tower of Terror"" feeling.  It pull up, then stop, then pull up again.  Its quite scary (one of the four).The A/C is a bit problematic too.  Since its centralized system, if it failed, entire building gets hot and humid or other way around.If the price is right, I will not be hesitate to stay here.I stayed here for a bachelorette party downtown and it was the perfect location! We were within walking distance to plenty of bars and the hotel is really nice. Our room had an incredible view of the fountain, however we had three rooms, none of which were on the same floor, so that was a little annoying. Overall, this place was clean and in the perfect location. Will definitely book this place if we ever need to stay downtown again!The location is great, and the hotel is what to expect for a 3 star hotel.  The reason I gave it a two star is how they nickle and dime their guest.  There are a lot of random charges that you might receive at this place.  Even the internet, which they give free to the public, charge you if you try and use it in the room.  For the cost per night of the room the internet should be included.  They also charge you 25 for parking (which is normal at all places dtown) and a random amount for breakfast.   This place is on par with other hotels in looks and niceness, but the way they try to continue and charge you once you are here really lowers the value.  When this is done it makes me feel as if I am in a one star hotel (cheap room) instead of a place that is suppose to be three stars.  They need to just charge one price and be done with it.","My husband booked a room here for my birthday.  We had a view of the circle.  We had dinner and saw a movie downtown before walkign back to our room.  We didn't take advantage of any of the hotel amenities - just enjoyed relazing in our room and sleeping in the next day.  The bed was comfortable, our room was nice, and we loved the view of the circle.Front desk staff was very friendly at check-in, however when I got up to take a shower to get ready there was no water.  I called downstairs and she told me that they were working on the hot water and the water would not be on until later in the day.  Her solution was to bring up room temp bottles of water.  She said she had called every room and left a message, I had no message I even double checked in case the blinking light on my phone wasn't working.  Not a way to start your day when you have to go to work and not shower.  Very poor planning.We arrived on Friday evening by a $40 cab ride from the airport. It was either a cab ride or renting a car at the airport and parking it here $20-30 per night. Had no issues checking in, was quite a breeze. The receptionist's name which starts with a R... with the Aussie accent of some sort was very friendly, cute, and all smiles.They put us up on the 16th floor. The room was clean and it did not entirely feel brand new but it definitely didn't feel like a poor college kid's dorm. I've stayed at much worse places and this one was pretty decent. We had an awesome view of The Soldier's &amp; Sailor's monument. At night it would light up like a huge Xmas tree. Couldn't ask for a better view from my room. If you want this same view, try asking the receptionist when you check in. We didn't, we just got lucky.My only gripe with this establishment was the continuing sound of either the plumbing or the elevator noise throughout my stay in their room. I was able to deal with it but I'm sure it would drive some people up the wall. Speaking of walls, they are quite thin so you can easily hear those annoying kids running up and down the hallway playing tag at 0745am. If you plan on making noise in the room, you may want to heed this warning not unless you're an apathetic person.What's nice is that if you opt to not get your room made, they will give you a $5 credit that goes to any food establishment that is connected with the hotel. I'm not sure if it will work with the Starbucks (conveniently connected to the lobby downstairs) though. If you don't use it, you can add it to your SPG points when you check out. Bring that voucher!As for the location of the hotel, it's about a mile or so walk to Lucas Oil Stadium which was the whole point of my visit to Indy. If it's not raining or snowing, the walk isn't bad (it was about 30 degrees out). We didn't have a car, so we basically walked everywhere; to eat, shop, and do some sight seeing. Bust out them Nike Shox and just explore.For the right deal, I may consider this hotel again. If I come back for another Colts home game, I may want a hotel a bit closer to the stadium.My two nights came out to about $230ish through Expedia.No hot water this morning. You pay extra for basic wifi. Good location. Most staff are helpful. Mediocre food. Reasonable fitness center (but it doesn't provide sanitizing wipes to wipe down machines after use--ewww).LOVE the beds... THE room.. THE area... however.. after a day and a half there.. NO joke..I was ready to come undone.. I had a 310am wake up call.. about 11pm.. comes screaming children down the hall where I was already hearing the elevator all nite.. and I was not across from it.. I like the gym...but its stuffy.. I finally turned the old school ac down to 64 so i didnt have a heat stroke! haha.. bring ur water bottle and refill with cold fresh water in gym.. they have a cool bar.. decent room service.. and Starbucks on property.. as well as in the room. Lots to do within the radius of hotel.. wifi.. is not free.. but wink at the guy.. he'll give u the pass code.. I do like that I could call for housekeeping at 2pm..and they came ..after I slept my morning away.. Im a fan.. mostly...Everyone I knew who was staying at the Sheraton was in awe.  They were all staying in suites, and they probably were hypnotized by that grandeur.  It is a fine hotel, sure, but it is not nearly as nice as the Sheraton in Chicago.  If I were writing the AAA hotel book, this would be a 3 star hotel.The hallways are dark, with dated carpeting.  The room had a strange smell, which might have been Time.  The view of the circle and monument was lovely.  And the beds, well, they are immaculate.  There is free wireless, which is always wonderful.  The flat screen TVs are nice, but they have those in motels now...Service was friendly, but I requested a different room and it took 20 minutes for them to get me new keys.  My key card didn't work in the Club Lounge (as it should have).  I did appreciate the dried fruit and granola bars at breakfast in the Club Lounge.  If you can get a good deal (I did), I'd recommend the Sheraton, but I hope there are better ""4"" star hotels in Indianapolis!Seriously, Sheraton Indianapolis in City Centre?? Seriously? I'll just share what was awful about our stay here in July 2012:- $25 to self-park (or $30 to valet)- Old breakfast food sitting on a tray outside our door when we checked in. Gross.- Dance moms and their daughters running around loudly (while we had a baby sleeping at midnight)- Random pieces of plywood covering parts of the hallway- 15 minute wait for an elevator- Unattended workout/fitness area with kids playing on all the machines- Smelly room- The Starbucks wasn't open during key times on the weekend- The pool photos advertised on the site look NOTHING like the real pool. The real (small) pool had a few random chairs surrounding the murky water. A million kids playing in it.With that being said...we paid way too much for 2 nights  for such a crappy place. I understand that the location is great but really?DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! My fiance and I had thousands of dollars worth of stuff stolen from this hotel. Management never apologized or acted concerned at all. When the police were taking the police report he said this happens all the time at this hotel. He said that people from the streets walk up and down the halls checking for doors that haven't fully shut. It feels horrible to have your space violated by a stranger and have your stuff stolen. It is worse to have the people that were suppose to have taken care of your things act so poorly and never apologize or seem surprised.DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!Stayed here with my cousin on St. Patrick's Day weekend.  He is a frequent business traveler and has access to the Club Lounge.  I am really sorry I did not get her name, but the woman taking care of the Club Lounge on Sunday March 16,2014 is an exceptional employee.We arrived about 30-45 minutes before happy hour ended, and sometimes you might expect someone to start cleaning up, the woman here went out of her way to make sure we had whatever we could have wanted, and was especially nice to my cousin's son, making sure he felt special and taken care of.Sometimes it's seemingly little gestures that mean a lot, and the employees here seem to understand that.Wife booked a room here. We had not seen each other for several months so looking really forward to this stay. Booked King bed 7 weeks in advance. Upon checking in (30 minute process) was informed there were only twin beds available. Lobby was congested of teenage kids that were loud and obnoxious. Housekeeping was poor. Parking garage meter would not read our ticket. Staff didn't really seem to care rather you stayed with them or not. LOOK ELSEWHERE. You can do much better than this place.Location is excellent. Parking garage is easy to navigate. Price wasn't outrageous. Housekeeping was so-so...they didn't restock all of our towels and coffee items.  Reserved 7 weeks ahead of our trip - requested a king got two full size beds. 7 weeks in advance seems enough time to guarantee a bed preference.  Bathtub didn't drain.  Parking garage exit kept malfunctioning.  Front desk staff was unorganized and didn't seem to care about our preferences.  We stay at Sheraton hotels when we travel...this is the worst Sheraton we've stayed at.Great location and $25 a day parking w a Starbucks thrown in for good measure! We were in 1602 for a week and could view the parade prep for the Memorial Day celebrants. Large tv generous bedding, good temp control made this a comfy place to sleep. The two stars were unfortunately due to a lack of service in a couple areas. The room wasn't cleaned each day and the trash piled up. You can opt not to have your room cleaned for points....we just wanted towel and basic soap needs, we reported it twice to room services to no improvement. No ice is avail unless you call front desk. No room service either. Valet is fairly energetic...kudos!bartender couldn't make a basic bourbon n soda did sub ginger ale?. Front desk didn't key our card correctly and we really got a bit overwhelmed w the poor cleaning and service. Can't recommend this location. Note that we did not opt for the Green program. We had room cleaned partially one night , room cleaned very well one time, the third day we had privacy sign n didn't expect room service, next day no service, next day after that, no service. Each time the room should have been cleaned, I called and was offered points to make up for it. The one day I visited front desk n asked if they could clean the room they sent towels n soap, no surfaces were cleaned. That was the day after we had a note saying the head of housekeeping would personally see the room cleaned. At one time the desk said it looked like we had opted out of cleaning. We said no we hadn't. N if that WAS the case, where were the five dollar reward vouchers?. To this moment the hotel denies that they have a problem n it must be the misguided customers' fault!As far as hotels/lodging are concerned, I have very specific tastes and preferences. This particular establishment was EXACTLY what I try to find. when I speak of quality lodging. The low priced budget places along with the high end luxury places are both really not my bag. This place had the following going for it:1) Very clean2) Staff was very friendly and helpful3) Our room was in very good condition4) Our bed was very comfortable5) It was VERY close in proximity to all of the things we wanted to see6) Good value for the moneyThis place had the following things wrong with my visit:1) NothingGreat job folks! Looking forward to my next visit to Indy!Stayed here in the ""club"" lever and it was horrible. The room was small and had stains on the curtains and chair. Only 2 of the 4 elevators worked and one of them didn't have a working light. As far as the ""club"" part it wasn't anything to advertise.  Will never stay here againI was here 2 times now and the staff has been excellent. We got upgraded to club status and we had a gorgeous view of the monument circle. The hallways and doors you can tell are old, but the room with a king size bed, with beautiful, comfortable sheets and pillows were the best. Bathroom upgraded as well with granite and with a new flat screen TV. But the best is their fitness room at the top of the building and there are 4 elevators with easy access to their parking from there. This Sheraton is great but we had discount from the IU med center, so we paid 96 dollars for 1 night stay, complimentary breakfast, and upgrade to club status, with free paring. I don't know how much it is without a discounted rate, but it must be expensive.We have stayed here three or four times over the last couple of years.  Though we live in Indianapolis, we've done a few date nights and stayed here so we could be right downtown, and more recently stayed here for a wedding so we wouldn't have to worry about driving home afterwards.  The service here has always lived up to the standards I expect from Sheraton, and the rooms are always clean and nice.  As always, the Sheraton beds are pretty much the best ever.  In the summer, the rooftop pool is absolutely awesome, and as this hotel sits right on the circle, I don't think there is a bad view possible.  Even if you aren't using the pool, I suggest going out on the pool deck just to check out the sweet view.  During this stay I visited the hotel bar briefly and the bartender was awesome.  She made it so that I would drop by for a drink even if not staying here.  It was a bummer that there was no room service after 11pm, but it worked out as they have a convenience store in the lobby that is open 24hrs.  Potato chips to the rescue!As is a problem with all Sheraton's, you do you have to pay for internet, though I believe they have a business center where you can use a computer with internet for no charge.  Regardless, I feel that with the money spent for a room at a Sheraton, included wifi would be a nice touch.  Parking is also more than a bit spendy at $25 a night to self-park in the garage.There are a couple of fancier hotels in downtown Indy but this hotel is nice and the people are very friendly. There's a Starbucks right in the hotel, an outdoor pool on the 9th floor, and the hotel allows dogs so we're able to bring our puppy to stay with us. You can access the parking garage from the hotel elevators, making for an easier pack in/pack out.This was a good place to stay in the heart of Indy.  The staff made us feel special by getting us a great view of the Monument, the best feature of the hotel, and gave good advice on area restaurants.  The rooftop pool overlooking the city was a nice feature, though it's a bit spartan.  On the downside the wifi and parking were both expensive, $12.50 and $25 a day respectively.  If you take that into account before booking then this hotel is good value for its location and view.This was definitely an OK hotel for business or leisure travelers. As far as I could tell, this place is pretty much as close to ""everything"" Indy has to offer... whatever that may be. Comfortable bed, big TV, speedy room service even though the food isn't that good. I particularly enjoyed the convenience of Starbuck's in the lobby. The shuttle ride from the airport was $16 dollars - a steal in my book! Mind you, this is not a hotel shuttle, this was a private shuttle. I was extremely disappointed that the INDOOR pool was closed. I'm from California so that thought of closing a pool for any reason other than an illness outbreak seems completely irrational to me, the woman in guest services said that the pool was ""not yet open for the summer."" I was puzzled. Because it is May afterall. Regardless, my stay was comfortable and the staff was friendly. I'm not an SPG member, but they put me on the SPG floor and treated me very well. I'd definitely stay here again if I ever had to come back to Indy.I've stayed here a handful of times. The most recent time I have a complaint.Stupid United Airlines delayed my flight from Denver by 4 hours (oh, there was no weather, they just wanted to demonstrate how incompetent an airline they are) and I didn't get to the hotel until a little after 3 a.m. The next morning when breakfast comes the maids are already coming down the hall at 9:30 a.m. so I put the ""please do not disturb"" sign on my door while I eat and shower. I carefully and very deliberately took the sign off when I left a little after 10.It was a Friday, I'd been on the road all week, I was exhausted. I'm not a diva, or whatever, but I'd flown 8,000 miles in a week through six cities and was really looking forward to... just a shower  and a made bed at the end of a brutal week.I opened the door and... the room had not been cleaned. I'd had the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door for all of maybe 30 minutes that morning. I called the front desk and they said ""you had the sign on your door.""  If I take a shower in the morning and don't want the maid to hang out with me naked then you refuse to clean my room? You had 14 hours for someone to clean it. It smelled like... food. The meal, which I'd not finished because I was too exhausted to really eat, was emitting odors. No fresh towels. No water. No made bed.When you're paying over $200 a night, having your room cleaned is not some outrageous indulgence. After I called they sent someone up to take the food away and bring me a towel, but the room smelled gross all night.The location is fine for Indy, I guess, but Indy's City Center is not really that great. I've never been here when the pool was open. If it ever is open it looks like fun. I'm going to ding the hotel for charging me for a $500 stay that didn't come with a clean room.  It was a smelly reminder that Sheraton is really a second-class or third-class chain of hotels.","This hotel definitely gets the nod as being Indianapolis' most unwanted bald-headed step child, given the number of name changes this old dusty clunker has had in the past 40 years--The Hilton, Hotel Marriott, The Radisson, Sheraton....  It's not a bad hotel, but you get what you pay for here...and that may either be a good thing or a bad thing.The first thing you notice is the old parking garage--the dark, damp garage that the hotel rests on.  I love being pampered while on a getaway trip and wouldn't mind spending a few dollars more to enjoy indulgence.  Take it from me: self-park and don't do the valet parking.  The valet and self-park use the same garage.  Valet is so expensive, too.  Well, so is self-park, but it's noticeably cheaper than valet charge and tip every time you want your car.The rooms are pretty nice.  No, this is not the Conrad or the Canterbury Hotel.  You do not get Molton &amp; Brown, L'Occitane beauty products or Egyptian cotton towels.  But my room was wonderful, clean and stocked with all the crunchy starched cheap white towels I could use.  For $89/night (versus $200+ for rooms at Conrad!), the quality, location and pleasant personalities of the hotel staff far surpassed my expectations.  A special shout to the weekend hotel operator, Mark--thanks, man for being so friendly.Of course this being a hotel and not my mother's guest bedroom, you have to have a level of acceptance that yes, your comforter may have a tiny icky pink spot on it; yes, one of the bath towels may have a very faint yellow stain on it; yes, the hotel restaurant is only a couple notches above a Denny's in food quality.  But those are things I am willing to overlook for an affordable room with a spectacular Monument Circle view.Stayed here in Nov 08 during a B.O. canvassing roadtrip to Indianapolis. This is a very nice Sheraton - we're SPG members and always stay in their properties no matter what city and Sheratons don't always tend to do very well in terms of service and customer satisfaction.. but this one does a very good job. Great location, to start with. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice (we had an upgraded suite though) and the room was clean and everything else was also in well-working condition!I was recently at the Sheraton for a conference. Thankfully, I didn't stay there but I was disappointed still. The parking garage is a claustrophobia inducing, semi run down cluster...well, you get the idea. :) One of the parking ticket receipt machines you use to leave the garage was broken the entire three days I was there and you had to use the intercom &amp; wait on someone to let you out. Also, the bathroom near the meeting rooms was a tad janky. Broken, hanging toilet paper holders and soap less soap dispensers all three days of the conference made me wonder if any employees had even stepped foot in there. :( So, what made me give the hotel 3 stars, you ask? The staff! I had to pay for parking at the desk to get the special conference parking rate and the staff was friendly, efficient, and happy! Verdict: Wonderful staff, but I held them to higher standards and wouldn't stay there.The Indianapolis Sheraton is pretty much on par with other Sheraton's across the land.Great beds, nice sized and clean rooms. There is a roof top pool that overlooks the skyline and the circle. The only real thing I dislike about this particular Sheraton is the parking. It's a standard downtown parking garage with a $25 over night fee. A lot of others have similar parking, but I feel like this might be the most expensive overnight Sheraton parking I've had. If you're looking for a nice place to stay in downtown Indy within walking distance of pretty much all of downtown Indy, look no further.I will say this hotel is very clean. However, the wi fi in the room is very expensive. They do have a business center, but it is in the bar. Which is very unusual.   They put my friend and i both in rooms by the elevators. She on the 19th floor and me on the 14th. All night long you hear everything with the elevators, it gives you a headache after too long. My friend went down to have her room changed because, it was driving her mad. So instead they shut off the  elevators till 6:00am!      Which at that time it woke me up when it started up again. No hotel should have  rooms by the elevators, they know how loud it is.  Also on Sunday nothing is open inside the hotel even Starbucks was closed at 3 in the afternoon. It could be worse though ,right.Wasn't terrible, but I would probably try a different hotel next time.First, the positives: As others have mentioned, the staff is very nice and accommodating. I didn't have a *ton* of interaction with staff, but enough to know that they take pride in customer service. The concierge helped me out with my parking issue (see below), which I greatly appreciated. We stayed in a corner king room, which was pretty spacious and well-decorated. The bed was comfortable &amp; I slept OK. I did use the room's iron and was pleased that it was a newer hotel iron and worked just the way it should---not a given in other hotels that I've stayed in!Negatives: Paper-thin walls and doors. I felt like I could hear every movement of the people in the room next door and had to keep the TV on to drown out the noise. They weren't being loud or anything, just getting dressed, I guess? I kept waking up because it sounded like someone was in *our* hotel room rifling through our stuff. I feel like most of the sound came through the door that allowed us to turn the hotel room into an adjoining room. Parking --- I drive a 4Runner with a Yakima roof rack installed. So, okay, it *is* a big vehicle but I would absolutely not call it over-sized. I don't normally have issues parking in parking garages, but my vehicle could not fit into the Sheraton's garage. Luckily it was a weekend and street (meter) parking was free and allowed overnight. Otherwise I would have been pretty screwed.This is minor. I probably should have called the front desk and I'm sure they would have taken care of this. But I guess I'll mention that our TV seemed to not be programmed properly. The remote control did not work at all, and the channel numbers did not match what was printed on the guide. So we had a tough time flipping channels to find the one we wanted. But, we found this out when we got in around 11 PM and I wasn't about to call anyone to fix it.Also, the TV set was a ""standard definition"" 27 inch-ish tube TV and not anything big or fancy. Wasn't a deal breaker for me, but others might care about this.Again, this is probably something I could've &amp; should've called the front desk about, but I'll also mention that our room's air conditioner seemed unable to reach the set temperature on the thermostat. Our room stayed at a solid 75 degrees-ish during our stay and never dropped to the more-comfortable set temperature of 71. Wasn't a huge deal, but I wasn't quite as comfortable as I otherwise would've been.Finally, the bathroom: didn't affect me because I am short, but the shower head was only about 5 feet 9 inches off the ground. I'd imagine that this would be a problem for a tall individual. Also, the bathroom had no exhaust fan. This meant showers made the room even more hot &amp; humid. Also, if anyone decided to make any stinkys, the other occupant(s) in the room got to enjoy it.Very nice hotel with a friendly and helpful staff.  The only drawback, as stated in some of the other posts is that it is not connected to the convention center through covered walkways, but a brisk morning walk is a good way to wake up!I get called out by name in boutique hotels, never at a Sheraton but it was ""Mr. G-"" from the front desk staff for the few days I stayed here in August. And not only are they friendly but accomodating: they managed a few fussy room requests without blinking.Hotel location is great - right near the circle - and the view of the courthouse and monuments from my corner room was terrific. A taxi was always available out front and the embedded Starbucks means you don't need to wander Indy's squeaky clean streets for a FrappuccinoBut then there's the club room. It's cozy and a good place to work in the afternoon but charging $9 for a glass of wine? And from a server who didn't speak English (that's not some xenophobia, she didn't speak or seem to understand English at all). And she didn't know how to open the wine bottle. And wasn't comfortable actually pouring wine. Kinda bizarre. Don't get me wrong - you know I'm no cheapskate - but if you're going to turn the club room into a bar you might as well bring in better wine (what was that? Mirrasou?). In all though: a good business hotel experience with decent rates and the ability to rack up more Starwood points.First, I need to point out that this review has nothing to do with an overnight stay and everything to do with dealing with the catering/events department. Oy.So to start, my first time here was for an event through my work was in a fantastic space, the panorama room overlooking Monument Circle. Great space. Most things went well except it was the hottest day of the summer in July 2011 and they could not get the temperature below 82 degrees in the room which was confusing and disappointing since it was just an appetizer event and just so uncomfortable... especially for the cost. Then there's the food. Not horrible for catering appetizers, but not the best. Most annoying part was running out, never getting it refilled and still being charged for the refills. The second attempt here, also work-related, was for a dinner buffet event. Same room, but in January so it wasn't hot at least. This time I did 100% of the planning and figured that it should be much smoother this time, then I learned where the problem lies, the catering people. I literally sent 4 emails and discussed on the phone 3 times about requiring a cash bar for our event, no cash bar. Ironically, the food was much better and more organized and for a much better price since they do negotiate, but the fact that every single beverage other than water and iced tea had to be brought up from the bar on the lobby level 20 some floors below was just tacky. Then you have dealing with the bill. The food part worked out fine, but the A/V was another issue. We were quoted $125 for everything we needed, but somehow ended up paying nearly $600 for the dumbest things that I did not see coming and were not notified about in advance, like $15 to use an easel. Then with the billing, the receipts provided didn't exactly match the charges, each was off by $100 which broke even, but not easy to deal with when having to submit on a company credit card. Which I called to get it corrected 3 times and 2 emails and finally asked for the general manager just to get his voicemail. Then I learn that the person who was avoiding me actually thought that everything was fine and admitted to just not looking at my emails. I work a lot with event planning, but when I practically have to do the job for you, I should be getting credit for that.So my loooong moral of the story is that please read other reviews about overnight stays, but when it comes to hosting an event here, proceed with caution. I would have had an easier time working with a 1/2 star hotel with no meeting space compared to this disorganized insanity. Our events downtown are now being held elsewhere.We stayed at the down town Sheraton this past weekend. The room was smelly. The elevator old and a little scary. The AC was total crap. The pool is over sold. But the hotel is right there near City Center and all that there is to offer.Stinks out front but that's a municipal problem not specifically the hotel's issues (it stinks everywhere in this city). Very centrally located on the circle - lots of food options, entertainment, and local attractions within walking distance. Downsides were the Starbucks AC was not working (and hasn't been working for weeks), the pool is on floor 9 but the club floor is on 10 and the gym is in the basement (not convenient). There is a little convenience market in the lobby and lots of seating with free wifi downstairs. I didn't get put on the club floor since they were full so I can't comment on those amenities, but it looked nice from what I saw. The rooms were typical Sheraton rooms, but the view of the circle was great. The only real problem was that the wifi was shite, the housekeeping didn't bother to check my extended checkout time (kept trying to enter my room multiple times without knocking! - Hate it when they do that). The gym was crappy too (no AC, TVs didn't work, small space/not a lot of variety), but I guess a lot of people don't use the gym too much on travel. Front desk agents are very pleasant and were very helpful in recommending atypical things to do and places to eat.My mom always said if you have nothing good to say don't say anything. I am not following that advice. First the bed - it was about as comfortable as a roll away cot. It would squeak every time my wife or I rolled over. It was a lumpy pos. The room - small and musty. It did have a nice view of the circle though. The bathroom - smaller than my closet at home. If you are over 5'7"" or so the shower head will be too low for you. Club room - this was ok. Musty smell but the staff here was nice. 21st floor party - we were here for a wedding reception. They could not get the room cool. It was HOT. The food was good, but when you are so hot it is hard to eat.Service - the staff was great. If it was just about staff this would be a 4 star review. Sadly the property is run down so we only give 2 stars.A-OK is right. Bummed that the pool wasnt working.. in 90degree+ weather in September! Rooms were pretty nice, conference rooms were large. The staff wasn't incredibly helpful or professional- get them trained!It's obvious that this used to be a pretty good hotel. The location is good and the lobby is nicely appointed. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were ok but the air conditioning rattled badly and the entire floor (10th) smelled faintly of mildew and mold. There were also odd holes in the walls that were covered by huge sheets of painted plywood. Very strange for a ""nice"" hotel. The pool area was abysmal. Huge pool area but the poor itself was no bigger than your standard backyard pool. Not nearly enough chairs or chaise lounges around the pool either. Seems like for the price you are paying for a nice lobby and the location.It honestly pains me to lower my rating of this particular hotel. I've stayed here probably about a half dozen times, and have always been pleased. This last visit may prevent me from ever considering a future stay at this particular Sheraton.We checked in this past Saturday for a two night stay. We were here for the Colts game, and used our AMEX Starwood points, and were given one of the old, non remodeled rooms with two double beds. I normally would not have a problem with this, seeing as though we were technically not paying customers as we used our points; BUT, we were promised a King when we reserved over two months ago...A little upset, but not overly concerned, and not contemplating a complaint, we started to get ready for dinner. After about a half hour in the room, we realized that the heat was not working. The room was frigid, and there was a healthy draft coming in through the window. I figured the hotel was booked, seeing as though we were placed in a crappy room, on an outdated floor.I called the Front Desk, and was greeted by the rude, condescending jerk of an employee, ""Adrian."" Adrienne was a real jewel. I informed him / her that our room had no heat. He didn't seem to care, offered no apology, and said  the hotel was at ""capacity."" But, the Customer Service pro that he / she is, Adrienne offered to have a space heater brought up to our room! A ""space heater"" I responded. He said ""yes, a space heater."" ME: Okay, leave it outside the room as we're getting ready for dinner.ADRIENNE: No, I can't do that as it may end up in someone else's room.ME: {Laughs} Seriously? Okay, can you please bring it up soon, before we leave for dinner, as I don't want anyone in our room when we're gone?ADRIENNE: Yep. {Hangs up phone}Dear Adrienne: Starwood will be notifying you soon, my friend! I would place the odds on the used points from this past weekend being refunded to our account in the very near future.I rarely review anything other than food establishments, but I had to make a mention of this place. My friend and I stayed there over the Indy 500 weekend (for unconnected reasons) and were surprised at what a great hotel the Sheraton was.The building must have gone under some renovation since past reviews, because the carpets, comforters, towels, and even desks and dressers all felt new. The service was great. The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating when we needed to stay longer than the check-out time (Especially impressive since this was the busiest weekend of the year in Indianapolis.).The difference between valet parking and self parking was only three bucks, and the valets were fantastically friendly and capable; so the extra couple of bucks is definitely worth it. I was a little annoyed that there was a fee for in-room wireless, but that was a minor trouble in a very comfortable stay.I travel to Indy quite often for work, the Sheraton isn't the 'newest/nicest' hotel downtown but the staff is amazing, friendly, and they go above and beyond. The Sheraton also has a great bar, let's face it when you are traveling on business the hotel bar becomes your second home!If you are a Sheraton member you'll get access to the 10th floor club room, happy hour (free) and a nice breakfast...oh, and chocolate chip cookies baked fresh every night...yummmy!Ask for a king corner room, nice and spacious with a great view of the circle.The outdoor pool is a great feature, especially on a nice evening - it's on the 9th floor and overlooks downtown.Wi-Fi is free in the lobby (and the bar) but you pay in your room and it's not wireless.I'm writing this review from a fairly different perspective. We not only stayed here for several nights, but also had our wedding reception here - on the 21st floor in the Panorama Room. Initially, we looked at a lot of hotels and other establishments for our downtown wedding and finally settled on the Sheraton b/c we felt the Panorama Room had the most character (floor to ceiling windows throughout the entire room, overlooking the city and monument circle, breathtaking views) and the price was the most reasonable. The wedding day, itself, was awesome. Smooth sailing. No problems on the Sheraton's end (that I know of anyway!) The planning process was quite different. We were shifted between 3 different catering mangers during the planning - which made me a little bit uncomfortable b/c once I would establish a relationship with one manager, that manager would leave. A LOT of information got lost b/t the 3 managers so I felt like I was starting from scratch with each new contact. And email communication was poor - they very rarely replied unless I sent follow-up emails. Very disorganized, frustrating, and not the most professional (especially considering that we were going to be bringing in thousands of dollars of revenue for them!) Also, there were a few instances when one of our catering managers lied to us. I could go into the long story of what she lied to us about, but not worth anybody's time. Not just white lies, bold face lies. Sort of ridiculous actually. As far as our stay, it was mediocre. The rooms were mediocre, clean and nicely kept, but just mediocre for a downtown hotel. The 'discounted' wedding rate for our guests was actually not so discounted either. Many of our guests made reservations a few weeks prior to our wedding for $30 - 40 cheaper than our wedding block rate. Also, on our wedding night, we stayed in one of their wedding ""suites"" which is really just a king size suite (nothing special), but the toliet flushed endlessly. It wouldn't stop. And this was not a quiet toliet. It was a commerical-type toliet, so it was loud. We kept thinking that it would stop. But after 25 minutes of listening to the toliet flush, we had to ask to be moved to a different room. Imagine how frustrating it would be to be moved (on your wedding night!) to a different room at 1am. Ugh. Okay, so a quick list of pros/cons Pros: -The Panorama Room was beautiful! One of the best views in town! Great room to have our wedding reception. Our wedding reception seemed be flawless - very organized and professional on our wedding day.-All my guests said they had a good stay at the Sheraton - they loved the easy access to the mall, bars, restaurants, starbucks, etc. Cons:-unprofessional, unorganized catering managers (during the planning process anyway)-broken toliet; flushed endlessly on our wedding night! frustrating. not to mention a BIG waste of water.- the ""discounted wedding block rate"" for our guests was really ""discounted"". More expensive actually.the most run down dumpiest Sheraton i have ever stayed inGreat hotel for short stay. My room had a wonderful view of the monument circle. The breakfast in the club lounge was also great. I had a very pleasant stay here. But a few things i didn't like: the light in the hallway is dim; the elevators look old and are kinda slow.","I have stayed here about 6 times over the last 2 years.  The staff is super friendly and the location is awesome.  They accept pets with no deposit which I think is great as I love to travel with my four legged buddy.  The rooms are pretty good - standard fare but nicely done.  They look to have been remodeled fairly recently.  Housekeeping is great and does a good job.Great location, very clean, comfy beds and pillows!  I would definitely stay again.I've stayed at this hotel a few times and my experience has been excellent.  Yes it's not as flashy as the Omni, but the prices are excellent, rooms well appointed and amenities are decent.  I stayed on the Club level which provicdes free snacks and beer from 4:30-7:30 M-F (its a business hotel).  The staff are attentive and friendly and it's close to the circle so you can walk pretty much anywhere.   You can grab a beer in the bar for $4, can't beat that for a bar in a hotel.Okay hotel downtown, just a little run downI'm a repeat customer to this one. Not really because of the great service or anything, but because of the really low rate I was able to snag here thru Hotwire. I've stayed here during GenCon. Usually, hotel rates for anything within half a mile of the convention center are around $150+ per night. I got the room at the Sheraton for much less.I'll agree with what others have said about the parking garage. Self park is extortion, and valet even moreso. Still, it's pretty much the going rate for hotel parking downtown. There are other parking options in the area. Check those out before parking at the Sheraton garage.The room itself seemed pretty clean. I do remember, though, one night I had a sheet with a small hole in it. I specifically left a card on the pillow indicating I wanted the sheets and towels changed. When I came back the next night, I found the same small hole on the sheet. Even though I left the card. Even though I left a tip for the cleaning service.I'll echo earlier reviews about noise problems. The air conditioning system is noisy. Apparently, one of my neighbors was having coughing/puking problems, and those woke me up a lot during the night. Thin walls. Note to self: bring earplugs.There is a Starbucks on the first floor. Came in handy when recovering from a hangover.The breakfast buffet is average. There's a fair spread of eggs, meats, pastries, bagels, cereal, fruits and such. I went to Le Peep most of the time for breakfast.Count me among those annoyed by the lack of free in-room wireless. It is available on the first floor, though, in the main lobby.For $70-$80 a night, the stay was worth it. I will be staying there again this August, but again, more for the cost savings than anything else.Wow. This is not your father's Sheraton. I stayed here last night for a business trip. NOT coming back. Why?Noisy AC/Heat Vent? Check (let's see, do I freeze to death or have a sleepless night cuz of that rattle from the fan?)Runny, oily hash browns with your $33 room service breakfast? CheckSoap scum in bathtub? Check.Smirking, wise-a** desk attendant? Check.$2.25 bottled water at the convenience store? Check.Thin doors/walls so you can hear your neighbors and passers-by every wink and nod? Check.All for the comfy rate of $245/night plus tons of taxes, fees, tips, etc.That said, the lobby and elevators are really nice. But there are plenty of other choices in downtown Indianapolis.This is my second stay. This time I was here 5 nights. I was in a king suite (1510) and did not suffer from any noise problems as reported by other travelers. However, there was tons of noise coming from busy Ohio Street including sirens, motorcycles, etc. The room is nice, bed is comfy and I enjoyed the little extras such as the micro &amp; fridge. Location is handy to plenty of downtown shops and restaurants. There are computers and a printer for guest use in the bar area that were easily accessible.  My only complaints are the painful check-in/front desk staff and the slow elevators.  Check in time is 3pm and even though I'd made my reservations months in advance, I didn't get to check into my room until after 5pm and that was only because I was hovering in the lobby.  I'd been traveling for over 14 hours and just wanted a shower.  I did get a wifi password out of the deal, so I saved some $$.  The front desk area was always understaffed it seemed.  Despite 4 elevators, several times during the week there were lines for the elevators.  It never seemed like all 4 were in operation.  There's 1 express elevator that goes from the lobby to the 21st floor direct which is handy but still slow to arrive.When I visited INDY for the first time to celebrate my brother's last week in the US before shipping off for the military. We found this place by default. Meaning I picked him up from the base and did a 40 minute drive back to the city. We decided to go to the first hotel we found. This one if first class and not just because of it's looks. We went inside (LATE) and it was obvious my brother was military - you know the bag.. the hat. Anyway went inside after parking and the night manager was beyond classy, as was the desk man. They gave us a great rate for military soldiers, comped our car for the week- although it never really left the garage except to go to easley winery. This place is city center so we walked everywhere. Plus we had a higher floor, meant to visit the gym and pool but never did. Did the complimentary breakfast that place (the club room) is to die for.. I need one of those. The room, beautiful. Five stars in my book. Oh, and the last day we visited their bar. The last night I had to stay myself because my brother shipped the next day so I went to the bar and met a few new friends and the bartender was comporting, complimentary.. a million nice words.","['place', 'amazing', 'great', 'bar', 'lobby', 'area', 'night', 'needed', 'place', 'rest', 'weary', 'bones', 'relax', 'long', 'day', 'driving', 'next', 'day', 'fun', 'chatting', 'friendly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/jw-marriott-indianapolis-indianapolis,JW Marriott Indianapolis,4.0,$$$,193,"In love with this property! It is a true star in the JW Marriott portfolio. Let's start from the beginning-Parking-valet or self park for a lesser charge in a garage beneath the hotel.  The greeters at the door are very welcoming and have a smile on their face. Check-in- Friendly and efficient, took about 5 minutes from walking in to getting to the room. There was water mixed with different fruit out in the lobby which was very refreshing, there is also a Starbucks on the 2nd floor! Room-Standard king room on a high floor that was perfectly clean/kept with updated amenities and in-room features with a beautiful view of the river/park. There was a small plumbing issue in the bathroom upon arrival but the FD sent someone immediately and it was fixed when I came back to the room. The manager also sent a breakfast voucher which was wonderful recovery!The Bar-Great atmosphere for a cozy conversation during the afternoon or watching a game on the big screen. Enjoyed a couple cocktails with a very helpful bartender! It was slow when it first opened for the night and I had trouble deciding on a drink so he asked what I liked and crafted one himself! Breakfast-So many options in their buffet! Eggs, waffles, meats, biscuits, fruits, you name it! If i ever go back I will go with a bigger appetite than I did. The server was nice in giving recommendations for nearby restaurants/attractions as well. Surroundings-so many things to do! Everything is in walking distance or you can even rent a bike/segway to make your way around downtown. The zoo is a beautiful walk over the bridge, there are paddle boat rentals across the street, a comedy show theater, there's a plethora of dining/bar options nearby along with boutique shopping. It is one of the nicest downtown scenes i've ever explored!I'll be staying here if I get to return to the city!While I was in Indy for work I stayed here. Overall the hotel was nice, easy to get to and from the airport. The location was great for the convention center and a little walk to the mall/downtown. The hotel itself had two restaurants on the main floor which was nice as you always felt like there was something happening. On the second floor there was a nice looking gym and a starbucks. The staff was always friendly and eager to assist. The room itself was very nice and spacious. I had a king size room on the 22nd floor. The view was pretty however you could hear a lot of street noise on the 22nd floor. The shower was one of those three head showers you could opt in to use if you wanted. One thing that I've been running into is the cleaning staff and the inconsistency. Some days the staff would come early and other days they would be much later. Some days they would double up on my lotion/shampoo/etc. Other days they wouldn't replenish my tea or water. Overall this is a nice Marriott and I would be happy to stay there again.My bride (now wife) surprised me on my wedding night with a hotel reservation at the JW Marriott.  We dipped out of the reception around 10:30pm arriving at the JW Marriott at 11:00pm.  We arrived in Tux and Wedding gown.  Everyone from around the lobby was yelling congrats as we walked up to the front desk.  The attendant at the desk was having trouble with the computer system and left for quite some time.  We began to get worried and for good reason.The manager came out with the other employee to inform us that our reservation had been sold to someone else.  They handed me a voucher for 2 breakfast buffets and offered to put us up in the Residence Inn.  A very cold ""Sorry, but there is nothing I can do"".  I was left speechless, my wife was in tears,My wife had booked this reservation months ago.  She was actually enticed to book our wedding night at the JW through a special they run for all newly wed couples.  Beware, booking a reservation may not mean you have a reservation as we found out.  The JW Marriott was 100% aware that it was our wedding night!We walked to the front door in embarrassment and people were now calling out to us ""Where are you going?!"".  The answer not here.The view! We stayed on the 33rd floor and could see victory field, the zoo, white river and the canal. Our room was amazing, it was a single king sized bed. The bathroom had only a shower but the shower had 3 shower heads, I could have stayed in there forever. We enjoyed dinner at Osteria Pronto and everything was delicious we had the steak and sea bass. I highly recommend eating there. Since I am 9 months pregnant, we ordered room service later and that would be my only complaint. The room service only deserves 2 stars. Our burger was cold, dry and over cooked. Our salad came with the wrong dressing and we had fruit stuck to the bottom of our plates. The breakfast buffet at Osteria Pronto the next morning was truly amazing, the best breakfast buffet I have ever enjoyed at a hotel.Stayed at the JW Marriott a few weeks back for a tradeshow in Indy. Very close to the convention center, large bar/lounge area, plus a restaurant and additional sports bar.I found the staff friendly, rooms nice/clean and the shower was hot - I don't really ask for a lot more :)Service was a bit slow in the hotel bar, but there was a lot going on that week/weekend, so understandable. Signature cocktails were awesome, though.Would definitely go back.The staff at JW Marriott is a well oiled machine of professionals who keep their cool and follow up to ensure all flows smoothly for those planning events and meetings. Each of the staff members I interacted with provided VIP service and made our 3 day stay flow seamlessly.  The views from the upper levels are breathtaking, whether overlooking Indianapolis Indians' Victory Field or The White River Canal.  The luxury bedding made me want to  hit snooze forever!  I must admit that getting around from conference rooms and levels can be somewhat confusing, but the signage provided by the event staff generally gets you where you need to go.  If there's one area that my guests commented on most, it was the catering menus, which were clearly prepared differently than our last meeting at the JW.  Perhaps there was a new chef, but they weren't at all impressed with the options provided, outside of the fresh seafood bar that I ordered for our reception.  After (several) long days in a conference room, I certainly appreciated the Concierge lounge at the end of the day for pick me up snacks and adult beverages.  A big thanks to the entire staff for always looking out and being ready to assist!Very nice hotel and a most attentive staff. We went on our honeymoon and were treated like royalty. Put us up on the 32nd floor, gave us the romance package with chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne. We also received two complimentary breakfast buffets in the restaurant on site. It was amazing, with a waffle bar and an omelette bar. The pool was nice, but small. Hot tub was great. I also liked the hi-rise elevators! Those scream all the way up!! It's like a thrill ride!  Also, valet is on top of things. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our vehicle, and on that note, we also had great room service. Anyways. Overall impression was it's a very nice hotel. Just too bad Indy is becoming a sort of gang neighborhood. 20 cops arresting gang members in Circle Centre and 2 cops arresting gang members 2 blocks from the hotel.Definitely a fancy hotel. And while I've not stayed here, I did take advantage of the restrooms, the meeting facilities and the lobby at various times during the conferences I was attending in Indianapolis. The conference rooms themselves are well appointed and there are a number of different configurations that can be used for different styles of events. The restrooms are large and well maintained. The lobby is crowded but otherwise useful.My one complaint is that the entrance to the hotel on ground level (the one not via pedway) is really oriented to car traffic rather than pedestrian traffic which is frustrating when one doesn't want to get here via the pedway from the convention center.New York in Indianapolis. Beautiful room with the nicest of linens, soft towels, high quality soaps and exceptional service. Walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium and downtown if you like a short hike. Parking cost was also New York caliber. We grabbed a quick bite in the bar/restaurant. Was not impressed. I'm usually not a fussy eater but the bun was like cardboard and inedible. Meat was dry. I expected so much more for what it cost. Left without eating half of it. Recommend finding another place to catch a bite.Excellent location! Location location! The service was great! Their gym is also great valueHonestly probably one of the top hotels at which I've ever stayed.  I stayed here for a conference and received a King room on a high floor with a view of the city (the park is the other view option).  I LOVE the city view which overlooks downtown Indy and I even got to watch the sunrise from my window waking up the first day. Fanstastic!My cab driver told me this hotel was built only a few years ago for Indianapolis to host the superbowl which makes sense - it's huge and everything seems so new and modern (but still cozy)!My room is quite large and equipped with all the traveling essentials including plenty of outlets, lamps, a desk + chair, ample closet space, micro-safe, and even a mini-fridge that was pleasantly empty for the storage of beverages and any leftovers. Speaking to others in attendance at the same conference, I think the mini-fridge is somewhat of an anomaly, so perhaps make a request for one if you think you'd use it!Like the executive suite mentioned by a previous reviewer, the shower in my room also has 4-way shower heads which are just awesome and super relaxing after a long day of corporate presentations or enjoying the sights. A couple of museums are right around the corner with many fine restaurants and shopping options within blocks. This hotel is definitely pricey and I'm sure some other high-end options in the area may compare but I'd definitely recommend for the amenities, overall quality/cleanliness, and the friendly customer service.My second stay here. All I did was inform Kenny at the desk during check in that my fiancee and I were about to get married and we were in town for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. What followed was a commotion of niceties from the choc flavored strawberries and champagne brought up to our 32nd floor suite with wondrous view to the complimentary breakfast for our entire stay to unfettered access to the lounge. It was a very upscale and totally enjoyable weekend. I rarely give 5 stars but I will give this time because customer service was great and every employee seemed happy with their work and excited to help us. I would have fussed about parking but I got a very affordable $6 parking at the 'public' parking garage opposite the hotel. Thanks Kenny!!We stayed here for Thanksgiving. The rooms were excellent and the service was superb. We even enjoyed the hotel restaurants.For Indianapolis, this is about as swank as it gets.  It is very conveniently located by Lucas Oil Stadium and the Southwest corner of Downtown (also not too far from Ooey Pooey).   I have been to numerous conferences here.  Indiana Bar Association meetings, CLE's, private parties.  The place is always clean.  To be honest, in my humble opinion, nothing quite matches up with the classic hotels of yore.  This is no Palmer House, no Waldorf.  It lacks that degree of character.  It is somewhat ironic that is named similarly to the Marrott, an old hotel that did have such character and closed long ago.   As someone who is by no means a fan of modern architecture, this looks pretty cool.  I dig the blue glass.  But it is too sterile and disposable to be really classic.   So it gets for stars because there really isn't much else by way of hotels in Indy.  If you want class, convenience, service, and good food... this is probably your stop.   (The Canterbury is such an old hotel, but back in the day it was a flophouse.  It has been remade into a boutique hotel, but it lacks gravitas--it's a good option, too, though.)I'll preface my review by saying I really do not like traveling for business and so I am difficult to please when it comes to conference hotel accommodations. But here I was at the JW Marriott for a week-long conference, hoping for a good experience.The first thing you'll notice upon entering this hotel is that it is very beautifully decorated, modern, and clean. And then you'll notice how attentive the staff is, because someone will generally greet you within a few seconds of entering the lobby. They have a lot of ""floaters"", or people who are tasked with directing guests, answering questions, and providing a good customer experience. They are really on the ball--I was very impressed. They will direct you where to check in, where to get bell service, where to eat, and pretty much anything else you might need. Check in was a breeze. I actually arrived really early (like 5 hours before check in time) and was prepared to check my bags and go roaming around the city--but the desk clerk even offered to see if there was a room available. Turns out there wasn't, but I appreciated the gesture.The rooms are very nicely appointed and clean. The beds are on the firm side, which I don't mind, and the bathrooms are comfortable and modern. A complaint I do have is that the thermostats are very limited in their range of temperatures. The room was 70 when I got there, and it only goes down to 66. That is WAY to warm to sleep, so I was pretty uncomfortable every night. They probably do this to conserve energy and all that, but I don't care for it.The conference accommodations where very good. The wifi was strong and reliable. I gave presentations in two different rooms, and someone always came in before my session to make sure I was set and that there weren't any tech issues. Very nice touch. The food was pretty good, nothing out of this world but definitely good for any mass catering effort. They kept enough variety in the conference provided meals that it was a pleasure to eat each of the meals.I had limited experience with the staff in the other eating venues in the hotel (mostly just having a beer at the High Velocity bar) but they seemed like a great staff with interesting menus.I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the downtown Indy area. If you have a conference here, you are in for a good experience!Wish my conference has been at the Conrad Hilton!  We were at the JW for five nights. What a disappointment!  1.  When I walked into my room there was a musty/moldy smell. 2.  Had a dust ball on the carpet when I got there. It was still there five days later. The carpet was never vacuumed. The maid carts don't even have vacuums on them. 3.  One day I had no bath mat nor soap4.  One day a coworker had no soap5.  Ice machines are all on the 2nd floor, I was on the 25th of 33. 6.  TV remote went missing one day. 7.   While looking for remote found about 1/8"" of dirt/dust under the bed. Co workers rooms were the same. YUCK!!If this is Marriott's flagship, then the ship is sinking. Put on your life vest and swim to the Hilton!I cannot stress how wonderful my stay was here. The front desk crew were always quick to 'do' for you. The room was gloriously lovely with a view that was spectacular. I know, Indianapolis spectacular? What drugs am I on? None at the moment. I was so impressed with the city, the people, the restaurants and the walking around. Even the mall was nice, not full of derelicts like the one back home. I was hesitant to come here for a conference, I almost skipped it but staying here and visiting INDY was something that I'll never forget and believe me I've travelled quite a bit.My first experience in a JW Marriott and I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice hotel with great amenities and restaurants. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel shampoo and conditioner were better than most. I am traveling for work so not sure of the cost but I would definitely stay here again!Probably the nicest hotel in downtown Indianapolis. Great views of downtown and the surrounding areas. Conveniently located to several venues and restaurants. Beds are the most comfortable I have slept in. Hotel features two restaurants and a bar.Good things first: Mr. Miller and Mr. Nathan are two bar tender legends in the Marriott Velocity Bar. Bar is the best feature of the hotel as well as the gym. Concierge lounge is over average, too. Rooms are great, Italian restaurant is okay. The hotel lobby and the bar are extremely noisy and mostly filled with conference-attending groups. This would be a 4-5 star hotel but the major flaw is the lack of commitment to pricing. I booked my trips frequently (8 months) to Indy using my customer rate. The website spits out $125. But that price is changed upon your arrival and you may learn it or not. Depending on the person checking you in. If you figure at check-in the associate will tell you that since you did not book through the travel department of the customer they can't give you the price. I'm platinum premier and I don't like games especially not if adding that tiny portion of arrogance. ALTERNATIVE: stay at Courtyard or Springhill Suites. Less $$$ and more friendly. @JW: smart move... I spent about $20K on hotels in Indy in the last 8+ months. And you got a fraction of that budget.","We stayed at the JW Marriot for a wedding that I was in. The hotel also hosted the wedding. If you are looking for a hotel that has everything in it, the JW Marriot could be the choice for you.Location: The hotel is located centrally downtown Indianapolis. There are several restaurants and entertainment spots within walking distance of the hotel. There are also a lot of historical and cultural places in the area as well. There is a skywalk to the convention center as well as one to a mall. There is also a skywalk to two other Marriott hotels (courtyard and Springhill) that connect to the JW.Amenities: The JW holds two restaurants and a Starbucks inside the hotel. One restaurant is High Velocity, which has a sports pub feel to it. There are TVs located inside, a bar, and they serve American food. The other, is Osterio Pronto which is an Italian restaurant. Both are open for lunch and dinner. Osteria is open for breakfast as well. There is also a stand alone bar in the lobby with a large seating area for guests. I visited the fitness room while I was there and was thrilled about the large size of it as well as the large selection of equipment. There were several treadmills, elliptical machines, and stationary bikes, all of which were facing a large window with a nice view. There were free weights, medicine balls, and weight lifting machines. There was also two areas with large mats for stretching/yoga, a seating area with water, towels, and earplugs, and a large locker room with showers. I peeked in at the inside pool. It was small but the fact that it is inside was a plus due to it being cold during my visit.The rooms were very clean and decorated nicely. Ours had a nice view of city as well. When you turn on the TV, it reads, welcome (whoever's name is on the reservation). My friend who was getting married was staying in the presidential suite on the floor and there was a complimentary cheese and chocolate tray with a bottle of wine delivered shortly after she arrived.Service: The hotel was EXTREMELY busy while we were there. There were several conventions and another wedding being held within the 4 days we were there; however the staff was exceptional! There was always someone around asking if we needed help, or directions or whatever. When we called for something to be brought to our room, it was there in a matter of minutes. We also ordered room service and was told that our food would take 30-45 minutes; however 20 minutes later they were knocking on the door with our food, plus other little things that we had not even asked for. Although pricy, if you have the opportunity to stay here, I highly recommend it!I stayed at the JW Marriott during the Down syndrome convention last month. We had some complications with our company's reservation, and it could have been a disaster.There were some folks that left a night early and the plan was for me and a coworker to take their room so that our company could cancel one room. After a long day at the convention, we got to the front desk at 10pm only to find out that someone forgot to add our names to the room. Obviously, for legal reasons, we couldn't get keys without permission of the cardholder- who was out having a romantic meal with her husband and unreachable. The front desk supervisor, David Munoz, was so wonderful and kind and helpful to us. He offered to take our bags and suggested we wait to hear from our boss at the bar. He even gave us a complimentary drink to enjoy while we waited. The whole mess got sorted out while we were enjoying our wine, we got into our beautiful room and had a wonderfully restful sleep. Once again, this could have been a trip-ruining event. David made us feel at ease and assured us that one way or another it would work out. And it did. He deserves a raise.A beautiful and very busy convention hotel in the heart of Indy.  Great service, ok food, good bar and very clean rooms.This is the first time I've stayed at a Marriott and been disappointed.  We came to Indianapolis to take our 5 and 7 year old to the Children's Museum (which was awesome).  We chose to stay here because it was the closest Marriott and we always choose them if possible.I realized this is a convention facility, but when I think conventions, I guess it typically think of businesses or at least adults.  However, there is a cheerleading convention here right now.My girls were really excited about swimming in the pool.  They are both still learning and hotels and vacations are really their only opportunity.  I assumed the pool would be crowded given the multitude of cheerleaders.  However (a) this was the smallest pool I think I've seen at a hotel and (b) kids are running amok in there and no one cares.The whole time we were there, which was not long, about 15-20 kids ranging in ages from probably 7-13 were running full speed, doing cannonballs, and probably worst of all doing what I guess you would call basket tosses and other types of tosses where they spin/throw the girls around the pool off their shoulders.  Several times they almost landed on my two small children and us.  The rest of the time they landed so close to us it was like a tidal wave to the face.  Then they would run full speed between the hot tub (which is supposed to be off limits to kids) and the pool screaming bloody murder about the temperature change and soaking our stuff in the process.I tried talking to one of the ""cheer moms"" but she ignored me and encouraged the kids to continue so she could videotape them.This is not the hotel's fault.  Where I fault them is for (a) not giving the parents clear expectations about acceptable behavior (b) not monitoring the pool when they have a convention full of children and (c) not doing anything about it when they saw it with their own eyes.I didn't even bother trying to call the hotel from the pool because an employee was in there at least 3 times and all he did was make sure the cheer people had enough towels and completely ignored their behavior.  I did call when I got back to the room but the lady that took my call seemed pretty disinterested and just said she'd notify security.  At this point our evening is already ruined and because some of the cheer moms were making snotty and hostile comments because we didn't want their children landing on us, I really don't even feel comfortable heading down to the lobby to try to go get dinner.The wife and I were in town for a few days.  When we're in town, we always opt to stay downtown at a Marriott property.  This trip, we decided to stay at the JW Marriott.  I was impressed with its entrance and main lobby, which seemed more Vegas modern than staid, conservative Naptown.  Check in was a snap.  The front desk staff was friendly and professional, with one of the associates walking us to the elevator while describing the property to us.  The elevators required a guest key to access guest room floors (a security feature I liked) and were clean and very quiet.  Actual ascent/descent of the elevators was almost imperceptible.Our room on the 22nd floor was plenty spacious, clean, and modern.  We had a nice view of White River Park to the west.  The bathroom, while not the largest and actually with a single sink and smaller vanity than I expected, had modern fixtures and a large shower with multiple heads.  Most important to me, the mattress and bedding was very comfortable.  The pillows were soft, but quite supportive (unlike the pillows found at its sister hotel, the Courtyard).  I slept well.  The JW Marriott easily has the best bed I've slept in at any Indianapolis hotel.  Sadly, the guest rooms didn't have free wifi, although it was available in the lobby.  Maid service was unseen, but our room was cleaned up daily with fresh towels.  Besides the quality of the bed, the thing that separated the JW Marriott from the competition was its fitness center.  The fitness center was clean, quite large, with the latest in fitness equipment ranging from treadmills with TVs, ellipticals trainers, and stair climbers.  There were also plenty of free weights, weight machines, as well as open space for people to throw down yoga mats (mats not provided).  It was the best hotel fitness center I've seen.The JW Marriott would've been 5 stars in my book had the guest rooms had free wifi.  I haven't stayed at the Conrad or the new Le Meridien (formerly the Canterbury), so I don't have a basis for comparison, but compared to everything else, the JW Marriott is, hands down, the nicest hotel in Indy and will be the wife and my first choice to stay the next time we're in town.Well, my experience here doesn't include a room- but comparing the staff to the Courtyard behind, is like yin and yang- wonderful and helpful people!!!!! Soooo wish I was staying over here !I dont have any house in Indianapolis anymore.. I ll stay in here just couple weeks ... Its so nice ,quiet and clean..***JW Marriott Indianapolis is a new and mostly luxurious hotel--two things that are not that common with the Marriott brand***Like JW Marriott LA LIVE, JW Marriott Indianapolis is both a JW Marriott (obviously) and a new hotel (it was built in 2011).  JW Marriott or new properties (or refreshed properties for that matter) are not that common to the Marriott brand so it is nice to be able to experience both in one hotel stay.  Marriott is a strong brand with consistently great service and a good range of prices, but it is hard for a loyal Marriott member to experience luxury and a hotel that feels new and modern.I think there will be more JW Marriotts in the future (one will launch soon in Austin).  It is a good brand that many are not familiar with.  It does not feature the traditional elegance of a Ritz-Carlton or some of the upscale modern touches of some of the high-end boutique hotels, but it is noticeably more luxurious than Marriott and Renaissance.This JW Marriott has great luxury touches throughout the hotel.  It starts with the exterior.  It has a striking and modern blue exterior that stands apart from the many longstanding buildings in Downtown Indianapolis.  It continues with check-in where the front desk warmly welcomes you into the hotel and goes over the hotel with a good personal touch (great service by Paula).  The lobby is sleek and upscale and so are the elevators.  The rooms have contemporary touches too like floor-to-ceiling windows and glass showers.There are other unique elements of this JW Marriott that sets it apart from the Marriott brand.  This property almost has a Vegas resort-like feel with the many restaurants, the availability of both valet and ample self parking, the nice and roomy fitness center with a great layout, and the different elevators to get to the low floors or the high floors.Like other Marriotts, Renaissance properties and JW Marriotts, this hotel has an Executive Lounge for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members.  This lounge is open 7 days a week for breakfast as well as nightly appetizers and desserts.  The breakfast was good.  Even though the eggs were slightly soupy, they were fluffy and freshly made.  The bacon was crispy even though it lacked the thickness, chewiness and meatiness of really good bacon.  There were many items though to put together a satisfying breakfast though including a wide variety of breads, breakfast pastries and muffins (including good individual jam jars).  Fresh fruit, cereal, oatmeal, and good cheese (brie and muenster among traditional offerings) were also available.Nightly appetizers were not as good.  There were beef wellington puff pastry bites (kind of dry and too much unrendered fat, which was unpleasant), dry beef sliders, and surprisingly decent mini grilled cheese sandwiches.  Like other JW Marriotts, this property featured cocktail party-style hors d'oveures including some very basic offerings like macaroni salad and tuna salad.  Cheeses were not as good as what they offered for breakfast.  There were also pita chips with hummus and tortilla chips with salsa.Desserts were okay and more high-end than Marriott and Renaissance Concierge Lounges.  There were cupcakes, chocolate chip bars, pecan tarts, chocolate dipped Rice Krispie treats, kind of fancy chocolate mousse cakes, and even slices of chocolate cake with layers of thick chocolate ganache.Rooms were nice but definitely not as nice as the JW Marriott Denver Cherry Creek.  Still, the rooms had a clean and contemporary look even if the furniture lacked that luxury feel.  The room was comfortable (good A/C unit), but the shower's water pressure was a little low.Room rates are decent here.  Depending on what is going on, you should be able to get a good room rate here on weekdays or weekends.  It might be slightly or even noticeably more expensive than nearby properties, but this hotel probably also offers advantages over other nearby hotels (especially if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member).JW Marriott Indianapolis is a good upscale hotel with great amenities.  It is also right next to White River State Park (where lots of events happen) and within walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium, which makes it a good option for personal travel in Indianapolis.  It is also the kind of Marriott brand property that I wish was more common throughout the US.Both pay self and valet parking are available.  Self parking is less expensive and easy getting in and out of.Good: The rooms are pretty quiet and very well-maintained.Nice little touches throughout the place. The entire staff was helpful and genuinely friendly. Roasted chicken dinner entree was terrific. Bad: Had dinner in their expectedly expensive Osteria Pronto restaurant. Maybe we caught it on a bad night. 3 of 4 entrees were sub-par: sea bass, lamb chops &amp; beef tenderloin. (The roasted chicken was the tasty exception.) We ended up being jealous of the table next to ours that had pizzas that looked pretty good. We should have sent back 1 bottle of the 2 suggested wines but who does that? Exceptionally slow wifi.I'm a long-time Marriott fan but overall the food should have been much better, especially when you consider the prices. For example, $17 for the not-that-special burger ""special"" in the sports bar?JW Marriott always lives up to mark and this one was no other. The rooms were good,service was excellent. The only reason why I gave 3 stars and not more is because the concierge lounge lacked options for vegetarians like us. For breakfast as well as snacks. We have been here for 3 days already and leave tomorrow early morning and all 3 days I checked their snacks. There are usually two things on the menu and they both are meat. Sometimes pork and beef,pork and chicken etc.Apart from that our stay was smooth,nothing else to complain about.Very nice hotel that I stayed in last week for a couple nights while in town for work. Here are a few highlights:- best gym I've ever seen in a hotel, hands down, from cardio machines to free weights. Plenty of towels and even some cold damp ones in a fridge. The view is also pretty nice if you're on the elliptical or treadmill.- rooms were spacious, bathrooms were nice and ""modern"" with the extra 2 shower heads in the wall. The floor to ceiling windows offer an excellent view.- service was great by any staff I encountered from the front desk to the ones in the Executive Lounge.- speaking of the Lounge, it's nice even if alcohol isn't included. Stopped by multiple times throughout the day just for water, sodas and snacks. I went by one evening for the hors d'oeuvres and it was a decent spread.- only bad thing I can speak of is the parking, it's expensive ($31 for self park, $37? for valet). I came in at a time when some event from the Indians stadium across the street was getting out and the way the deck is laid out, all the inbound traffic was deadlocked by ppl trying to pay and leave. I ended up having to circle around the wrong way down to avoid waiting for easily 30 min for things to clear up.They will not allow pizza delivery to the room, so you have to go down to the lobby in pajamas to receive your pizza order.  I complained and nobody really cared.Beautiful, clean rooms; friendly and courteous staff. Lots of lounge space with various setups (some relaxing, some tables, etc)- great space for working or meeting with friends or colleagues. Breakfast buffet was hot, tasty and a reasonable price.Stayed here for MPACT 2015.  I think our entire group received excellent service &amp; the walkway to the Indiana Convention Center was a plus!The staff was so attentive and friendly.  The only down side was how extremely busy the front desks are as they have over 1000 rooms.  The room was clean and the bed comfy.  I wish the wifi was free with the cost of the rooms it was rather expensive so i did without.For about $400 a night, not impressed. There was nothing per se wrong with the hotel, but there was nothing special about either.  We were woke up at 9 am by the maid trying to clean the room. 11 am check out is early for a so-called luxury hotel.  Self parking was difficult as many spots were reserved for valet and the cost of $37 was high. Location is ok, but not ideal. We were told upon check in that there were free drinks on the 31st street.  We got up there and there were no alcoholic free drinks, just soft drinks. Lame. Again, at this price point, free water and Pepsi does not cut it. When I have had upgraded rooms at competing hotels, beer and wine were included during happy hour. The breakfast was weak and, yet again, was consistent with an average, $150 a night hotel, not what one should expect at Marriott's supposed top level hotel.  I would not return.I'm an events manager for a living - the JW Marriott is fantastic! I highly recommend the JW for events. Their facilities are clean, new, lovely. Catering is very good. Service is phenomenal. There is a FedEx office on site to help with all your shipping needs. I just can't say enough how impressed I am with the staff and their high standard to make sure our event went as smooth as possible:Event Facilities: 5/5Event Service: 6/5 - The red coat service went above and beyond. Thank you, thank you!Catering: 4/5Hotel room: 5/5 - Our room overlooked downtown, facing West St, simply beautiful. Rooms are clean, well laid out and full of amenities. I am getting married next year and want to book here for sure!Hotel service: 5/5 - Room service and housekeeping were top notch. All of the hotel staff are super attentive.Valet: 5/5 - Easy to use and very helpful.We stopped here on a roadtrip at 100 am hoping to catch a good nights rest before heading back on the road the next morning. There are certain things you expect from a hotel such as competent service, working facilities, and normal smelling rooms. We checked in and the shower wasn't draining in the first room.  We called 2x and explained that whatever quick fix the person was trying to tell us to do wasnt the problem and we wanted to switch rooms bc we wanted to sleep asap and get an early start. The lady insisted we were just doing something incorrectly and complying w our request continued to waste more time and called an engineer. The engineer upon seeing it immediately understood it was indeed a draining issue as we had tried to explain to the person on the phone and we would need to switch rooms. Our second room had a very odd odor, stains on the carpet and floor, and a barely made bed. At this point we were exhausted so we made the decision to stay here called down let them know about the room and the person on the phone couldve cared less. Horrible customer service. For what its worth the initial guy at the front desk that checked us in was really nice but the management above him and whatever customer service lady spoke to us did not care. I edited the review with one extra star purely for the breakfast buffet. It was pretty good and put us in better spirits after checking out.This place is amazing.  The rooms are super nice and very clean. The fitness center is spot on!  And the food!! OMG!!  Please please please try the brick chicken!!  Thigh and leg in a Mole sauce over potatoes, asparagus, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers from the BAR???!!!!!! Yes! My new number 1!!!Arranged a meeting room rental here through the hotel for a business meeting. They have no problem hosing you NYC style (Yes Sheraton NY...that means you) for food and beverage even though it's Indy. $600 for coffee and tea for 6 people. This is in addition to the room charge. We should have each had our own personal waiter pouring the sodas. We paid for an internet connect- it was wi-fi. No AV in the room. Would have cost another outrageous amount.  Other than that the room was nice. Staff is helpful and professional. All else- completely absurd.","I have been staying at the JW Marriott since the hotel was built. Over the last couple of years I have probably stayed over 50 nights at this location. I have never had such an non welcoming experience as I have the last 2 nights in concierge lounge. They literally start closing down at 9 while guests are still trying to enjoy the lounge. Food is picked over and not replenished, no coffee or hot water - it had been put away. When a colleague joked that it wasn't like this when Laura ran things. Savanna said ""then maybe you should leave."" Then Kyle starts passively aggressively giving us a count down on when they were closing and at exactly 10 he shut off all the lights and said ""we are closed"". We were headed to the exits prior to Kyle kicking us out. So rude! I called him out on it and he was simply indignant. Either these 2 aren't cut out for the service industry or this hotel has jumped the shark.Though top notch service is demanded at a JW, I was thoroughly impressed with the property, service, and staff. I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible, but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star. Overall, the GM of the hotel seems as though he/she has it together. Thanks to all the staff for a nice stay.This has been a great stay at the JW. I have stayed at several JW's and this with the convention center attached has been nice. From the front desk checking me in to walking me to elevator, room service, and area restaurants, this was a great selection. The Marriott selection in the area is vast. There are other properties in the general area. I would recommend this location and recommend highly.  Enjoy.I travel for business often, and have stayed in this hotel 2 or 3 weeks in the past couple months. I left a glowing review on trip advisor, but since they don't let you post another review on the same place for 3 months and you can't edit your original review, I'll review here. Overall, it's a great place to stay. I have had NO issues during previous stays. This week.... was not the hotel's best week. First off, they had two conferences in town and were operating at max capacity. That means people EVERYWHERE. Even the Concierge Lounge, normally quieter, roomy, and a good place to work was full and rowdy in the mornings and evenings.But the reason that I am writing a second review is because of the housekeeping services. Earlier in the week I was in my room working (because the lounge was full), and someone starts knocking on my door. I yell ""No thanks,"" because whatever it is, I didn't request it, but the person knocks again. I yell ""No thanks"" louder, but at this point the person inserted their key card and started to open the door. I said ""Can I help you?"" and at this point the person apologized and closed the door. This was in the evening, so maybe turndown service? The second housekeeping incident happened this morning. I have to get up early every day for work. Friday being my travel day, I can sleep in a little (until 9). At around 8:30 housekeeping is knocking at my door. Again with the yelling saying ""No Thanks,"" again with the knocking anyway. Listen, I can hear everything that goes on in that hallway - don't try to tell me you can't hear me yell ""No Thanks."" Luckily this time I had the door dead bolted. Yes, ""Do Not Disturb"" signs would have helped in both of these cases, but in all honesty - who expects to get woken up by housekeeping before 9am!?The four stars I gave this hotel may seem confusing in light of the issues I had above, so I will copy and paste my trip advisor review below for context:(3 weeks ago)I am currently staying at the JW Marriott on a week long business trip, and even though I still have one day left on the trip I wanted to make sure and write this review before I forgot. This hotel embodies excellence. When I walked in the door to check in, an employee walked up to me, greeted me, took my bags and walked me to the concierge desk where he proceeded to check me in. He was possibly the most excited concierge I've ever seen to have me stay at their hotel. He then took my bags and walked me to the elevator. Who does that!?Being a Gold Rewards member, I get free access to the Executive Lounge on the 31st floor. I have nothing at all negative or neutral to say about the lounge: The layout is great, the free food is fantastic, the honor bar is always well stocked, the coffee is fresh. Breakfast is consistently amazing. The king bed and pillows are among the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in a hotel - you just sink into them. It makes it really hard to get up! I'm not kidding - I usually wake up several times a night at home to use the bathroom or toss and turn, but here I don't wake up at all until my alarm goes off. My wife hates traveling with me because she says I'm never satisfied and always find something to ""complain about."" In my defense, I tend to notice little things that could be better and comment on them. In no way do these take away from the amazing ness of the hotel, it's just how my brain works. Here are a couple things I've noticed:The water tastes like well water, which was a surprise and a negative at first - but then I noticed the free bottles of water they have set out in the room. I drank both bottles the first night, and room service replaced them the next day along with two more bottles - one on the bathroom sink and one next to the bed. This is great attention to detail. I feel like they are acknowledging the bad tasting water and are actively doing something to mitigate it. There was not a fridge in my room. This **maybe** gets close to being a negative, but everything else is so spectacular that the absence of a fridge just makes me go ""huh?"" I feel like even budget hotels have a fridge in the room. The first night I ordered a large pizza, thinking that I could just put the leftovers in the fridge (assuming I had a fridge). Turns out I didn't have a fridge. Oh well, small price to pay for such an amazing place to stay! If I could give one suggestion though, it would be to put mini fridges in the rooms. That's literally the only thing that could make this place better. Oh, and I ate dinner at the Italian restaurant in the lobby one night. It was pricey - $60ish for an entree, two glasses of ($7) wine and tip - but it's in the lobby of the JW and I had no complaints about the quality of food or drink.Stayed January 2015, traveled on businessI stayed at the JW Marriott for a traditional foods conference. It's the kind of event that is challenging for any hosting facility, as the organization involved does not simply select menus from the regularly available event menus. Instead, food starts arriving a week or so in advance of the conference (thus requiring appropriate storage be available - ever asked a venue to clear a walk-in for you?) and a chef comes in to direct the kitchen staff in traditional foods preparations methods. There have been issues at past venues for this event; the Indianapolis Marriott did a great job. One of the best I've seen.Now, on to the hotel stuff. I was in a regular room on the 9th floor. My room was pretty close to the elevators and I could hear them whooshing and dinging. It wasn't super-loud, though, and it didn't keep me awake. The room was clean and everything seemed to be in good repair. The linens were above-average for hotel linens (especially the towels, which were both large and soft). The water pressure in the bath was not great; the hot water was hot enough to poach me when I wasn't careful.At first the tub didn't drain particularly well (probably hair in the drain - they never know to fix it if someone doesn't tell them); a maintenance person was sent up promptly to service it. And they left a chocolate-popcorn treat with a ""sorry there was a problem"" note. That was totally unexpected and unnecessary.The friend I split the room with said the hotel exercise room was one of the better ones she's used. The pool is small but clean and nice. All ice is found in an ""ice room"" near the elevators on the 2nd floor, which puzzled me at first.The hotel staff is excellent. Every one that I encountered was helpful and friendly. I would happily stay there again.Stayed here during Gencon 2015. At first they changed my 2 Queen room to a King with a cot, then after I got that fixed their housecleaning staff threw away a bag of purchases I had from Gencon worth about $200 and they offered no compensation. In addition I feel like if they would have just searched their recycling, they could have probably found it, but while the staff were very polite the stock answer they kept giving me was that they were ""following protocol"" instead of telling me what they were actually doing.My wife and I were able to get the JW for Gen Con 2015.  First the good:  it's really swanky.  Great staff all around, parking that was really convenient, and our room was great.  Best views of the city too.  The bad:  no free breakfast or wifi, and everything was expensive.  Like being nickled and dimed, only with tens and twenties.  Pool was small but no big deal.  All in all, we'd stay again because of the convenience and the staff, but we'd have to steel ourselves for the bill.Wonderful property, however the poor customer service during our most recent stay may cause me to book the Westin or Conrad the next time I'm in Indianapolis. I called prior to our arrival and asked if it was possible to have a rollaway in our room when we arrived--as we were getting in at midnight--and was told it was not a problem.  Unfortunately, this did not happen and it took over an hour to have one delivered--then we had to wait another 30+ minutes for a pillow and blanket!  The icing on the cake was when housekeeping knocked at the door at 8 am--repeatedly!  Not a good night.I stayed at the hotel for an event recently and was blown away by the customer service that the staff at the JW provided. The best part - all 1,200 people at the event walked away feeling like they were superstars because of the staff at the hotel, not just me!My room was on the 24th floor overlooking the White River State Park, and it was perfect. It was much bigger than I expected (although the bathroom was a little cramped) and very comfortable. The temperature of the room was a little warm for me. I like to sleep in a freezing cold room, and the lowest I could go on the thermostat was 65, and there was no fan override. Not a huge issue, but I still would have liked it a tad cooler in the room. I know I know, 65 IS cold, but still..Once I got home I realized I left a garment bag in the room. I called the hotel and was directed to the loss prevention department, who sent someone up to the room and pulled my garment bag AND a sweater I forgot. They called me back within 10 minutes and had the items waiting for me when I got back to pick them up. Again, super fast, efficient and friendly service.Stayed here for a conference in March.  They have what's called a Skywalk, so you can walk through an above-ground walkway directly to the Convention Center without having to go outside (in case of bad weather)!  The hotel was pretty upscale, esp for someone like me who usu won't stay anywhere nice due to funds, but work was paying for this!  I didn't try any of the food in the hotel, but there was an Italian restaurant as well as a Sports Bar restaurant.  My room was not huge but it was nicely decorated.  I was able to request both a microwave and small fridge be brought to my room.  The fridge would not fit where it was supposed to, so I had to leave it sticking out and blocking part of the hallway.A negative was that the drain plug to my faucet didn't work - it kept popping up when I wanted to close it.  Also, I stayed there 6 nights and only requested the housekeeper clean for two of those days.   I was not given any new amenities (shampoo, etc) during her second cleaning stint, even tho I had removed them earlier!  I have NEVER had that happen.  I couldn't believe this  hotel was too cheap to give me another set of shampoo/conditioner/soap after paying over $200  night w/ taxes.  In addition, there is no free wifi except in the lobby or second floor.  Otherwise, it was $14.95 for 24 hours.  Sometimes I had trouble logging in, too, and had to do it several times.  I think parking costs an arm and a leg, too, but I cabbed it over.  On Level 2, there's a Starbucks (huge line in the mornings) and several ice machines.  Overall, my stay could have been better but the place was clean and beds were comfortable.Shout out to Nayim for going above and beyond to see that we were taken care of!  (From 8/8/14 - sorry so late with my thanks!)  Awesome stay again!!I find a room online last minute. Good deal. But how'd I know some !!# would get messed up. Called ahead made sure we could check in early. Was assured we could. When we arrived the girl (yes girl) at the counter told me they were booked. I politely told her we had a reservation. She went to the back and returned saying they're getting our room together. She said my card would be charged  $20 for incidentals. Then it'd be refunded if no incidents happened.  Ummm ok. I get to the room exhausted at 4 a.m. look at my bank account and I was charged twice by the hotel for the entire room cost!!! Wtf! I call down and they admit fault and that at least one charge will be refunded. But it'll take some days. Wtf! I took a chance on booking this hotel last minute and this is what I get... wth! I am very unhappy and dissatisfied with the lack professionalism of the staff. Their mistake was costly to me and my family. The rooms ok. Desk staff incompetent. If you don't mind a hassle then by all means. I on the other hand can't stand a hassle especially when I drove 20 hours and all I wanna do is relax and not deal with BS. Won't be staying here again. Will update when issue is addressed.The JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis is absolutely beautiful with some of the best views of the city. The hotel has anything you could ask for from restaurants to the High Velocity Sports Bar to Starbucks. A few friends and I stayed here for a Bachelorette Party and its location in the city made it easy to walk to and from dinner without having to go outside in the snowy weather we had and is pretty centrally located. Although the room was not quite ready at 3:00PM when we checked and there was no fridge in the room, these were minor things compared to the excellence of this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and made sure to assist their guests with any inquiries. The rooms were beautiful with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. I would definitely recommend this hotel not only for its amazing view of Indy, but for the excellent service they offer to all of their guests.The worst experience I've ever had. A beautiful hotel in a great location.  All ruined by an incompetent and unprofessional staff. I have stayed at Marriott properties all over the world and have never had an experience like this... it's a shame because I had high expectations due to my other JW experiences..Love the JW Marriott Indianapolis.  This hotel is a great place to forget about things for a few days and enjoy the treats here at the hotel.  Some local people might not think to stay downtown but it's so much easier than day trips.The JW has two great places downstairs to get drinks or if you are Marriott Elite you can maybe score access to the Executive Lounge on the 31st floor, with great views of the city and pretty reasonable drink prices with excellent and personal service.The Osteria Pronto restaurant was fantastic (I'll review that later) and you can get adjoining rooms for a larger group (like you saw in Modern Family).  The rooms are large and comfortable, especially the towels and bedding.  Be sure to bring your HDMI cable because you can stream movies from your PC to the TV in the room.Just a couple of other things.  Prices - you cannot find this quality hotel for these prices anywhere.  You can see I travel a lot and Indy is definitely a bargain.  Parking's not cheap but it's almost double in Chicago.Trendy, staff is high quality, restaurants, good choice new ideas, drinks top notch. Rooms are great, they really do need to vacuum under the beds. When sitting in bed working on my laptop I could see a full rug of dust bunnies under the other bed, yes checked my bed and same thing. It had obviously been a long time since the vacuum had been fully under the bed. The room otherwise was clean and had everything one could need.This is an outstanding place to stay when in town! The rooms are large and very clean with great views. The Italian place downstairs is a three-star place to eat, but the Velocity Sports Bar has surprisingly yummy food! Regardless, if you don't want to eat in the hotel there's lots to go out for close.**This review is following an event at the JW - - not an overnight stay.Space: Beautiful! Great views of Victory Field, Lucas Oil Stadium - I'm certain the rooms towering over Downtown have excellent views as well...I'm a sucker for a view. The event I was attending had an estimated 300-400 attendees. We started the evening out with a silent auction in the hallway of the third floor before entering into the ballroom for dinner and dancing. JW's staff was very friendly and kept the room swirling with wine and hors d' oeuvres. I can't speak for the appetizers because the only one I came into contact had salmon (seafood allergy=boo). However it looked appetizing = smoked salmon wrapped around a sprig of asparagus and (cream cheese?). The ballroom area was very sexy - purple/blue lights, a perfect-sized dance floor and intimate round tables centered with a large votive candle tower. I give the atmosphere a strong 4 stars. The service 5. The food: 3. I can only imagine how much was being paid per plate for this meal, so I was a tad surprised that the meal was dry stuffed chicken on-bone, a carrot with a few green beans and sorbet rimmed with chocolate and rainbow sprinkles (interesting choice?). The highlight of the meal would have to be the salad with nuts, bleu cheese and endives. I was still hungry after the meal. I know I have a reputation for putting it down, so I was reassured when my tablemates were also still hungry after dessert.Came here for a Beck's Hybrid conference and the staff was very kind and well versed. We were given the option to use a phone in our conference room in order to meet any needs that we may have had. In several instances they promptly supplied us with the amenities needed. Even something as simple as an extension cord they supplied us with one. Great experience and we will all be back next year.The JW Marriott has a superb location and, as a newer hotel, is very modern. The good: Very nice, modern, clean hotel. Everything's shiny and new, as well it should be since the hotel is only something like 5 years old. The staff - really nice, very helpful, going out of their way to help. Walking guests to the elevator is a bit much perhaps, but great to see that effort.The rooms are large, great views, all of the creature comforts of home. Good TVs, plenty of channels, good beds, nice bathrooms. That's all you need.The bad:None really.The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I was somehow booked in a hospitality suite - not the full room, just the adjoining suite. But there's no bed, it's a Murphy Bed (folds out of cabinet) which I had to do myself. I get that the hotel's busy sometimes, but at least set up the room for the guest to sleep in the room. Overall, very happy, would definitely stay there again.","I love the JW.  It's me and the hubs ""go to"" staycation hotel.  I mean, there are plenty of inexpensive options but we really enjoy the ease that JW offers within the city. Soooo easy to grab a cab, park the car, valet is my fave and the elevators are fast.  Rooms and views are consistently clean, comfortable and nice.  There are no bathtubs which bums me out but we love the executive level bar area and perks that come with high level Marriott status.  We always get treats and upgrades, so it makes the entire experience just a little upgraded.  I love nice hotels and this one doesn't disappoint.I've stayed in lots of 5 star hotels all over the country, and yet I can say with no hesitation, the JW Marriott Indianapolis is one of my absolute favorite places to stay because although it's technically listed as a 4 star hotel, it has better service than 99.9% of the 5 stars I've stayed at.Now before youo get the wrong idea, it's not like the service is the only place where this hotel shines.  Let me tell you now that the JW in Indy is a downright beautiful hotel. I mean truly gorgeous.  The decor is as tasteful, upscale and sophisticated as you'll find, contemporary without being too showy, but also not boring and conservative.  And the food....  the Italian restaurant inside has some of the best food my wife and I have ever tested, and the High Velocity sports bar/restaurant is everything a sports enthusiast could ever want.The rooms are beautifully appointed.  If you get a chance, get a two wall of windows suite or corner room with a view.  Looking out over the Indianapolis skyline at Lucas Oil Stadium, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the canal, The Eiteljorg and the NCAA headquarters is actually quite striking.  Also, the executive lounge is worth it.  Not only is it a beautiful, ultra comfortable area, but the free drinks in the evening and especially the free breakfast is delicious.But again... the service is where The JW Marriott Indianapolis sets itself apart.  I have never experienced a hotel where all the employees from the valet, to the bellhop and everyone in between, are soooo genuinely nice and concerned with giving you the best experience possible.  Wifey and I have been many times and they are consistently amazing.  The last time I stayed there I had (for the very first time) a slightly unsatisfactory experience with one of the women who checked me in at the front desk.  The customer service manager went well beyond what was expected and bent over backwards to make things right for me, even including a free glass of premium wine of my choice every evening I was in the hotel.If you're staying in Indianapolis downtown, make sure you book at the JW Marriott first.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It's total experience blows some of the more expensive hotels around it out of the water.Every time I stay at the JW Marriott Indianapolis it feels like home! Always welcoming from the moment you step foot in the door. High quality service from this luxury brand hotel is top notch. I highly recommend staying here.For a JW Marriott I wasn't that impressed like I am at so many others. The service was phenomenal the room was okay nice view kind of a little walk to the circle downtown. Looked beautiful on the outside but the inside Decour was just okay I would recommend staying here next time you're in IndyDoesn't get much better than this. Vegas style hotel in indy. I think I am going to have to look for more jws when I travel. Incredible rooms, great beds, outstanding 24 hr gym and a great bar/ lobby. Really could not be better. Friendly staff and a beautiful facility. Great restaurant choices within walking distance or in the hotel.Friendly staff. Can't go 5 feet without someone asking how they can help. Breakfast buffet is amazing with the omlet station and waffles station. Nice gym equipment in gym, clean rooms, prompt service and no smoking in any of the building. Gave it 4 stars Because we came back from dinner and were told we HAD to valet our car because the garage is full. How does a hotel garage fill and not have enough room for registered guests? When I said something about it he was quick to ask someone on his radio a question, then said he would valet it at the self park rate.I spent seven days at JW for the International Vet Emergency and Critical Care Society  (IVECCS) conference and just got back today. I had such a great time at the conference and that was directly related the the fantastic service I experienced from each and every individual employee working at the hotel.The five stars were well earned!When we arrived in a group of three with several luggage, they promptly opened an additional counter to aid in the check-in process. At check in they also allowed me the option to select my preference of x-ray key cards inspired by IVECCS. They assisted us with our luggage and showed us where and which elevator to take. The first night, I phoned the front desk to ask for assistance in requesting room service to be delivered shortly after I return to my room after my yoga class the following morning. The whole thing was seamlessly executed.  The delicious hot food was delivered on time, exactly as ordered with a coffee pot that kept the coffee hot to the perfect temperature for hours!The front desk assisted me in locating a yoga studio, the hotel bar and High Velocity were all staffed with friendly and courteous employees. They helped us when my friend fell on the escalator and gave us band-aids. There was so much more I cannot include here in it's completeness. I felt so strongly about the positive experience that I wanted to share it with the hotel. I wrote just a brief note that it was a great experience and each staff I encountered contributed to that. In the note I also included two items that had room for improvement. One was the key card access in the elevators were tedious, and difficult to manage when our hands are full or when the elevator was crowded. The other was that I felt the in room wifi was too expensive and should be included with the room, especially since I am here for a conference. Less than 5 minutes after I dropped off the notes, while I was still in the lobby, my phone rang. It was the JW manager (I don't recall the name), who phoned to thank me for bringing the feedback to the lobby. She also credited the charge to my room for the wifi. It was impressive that they responded so quickly and positively and ensured that I had the most positive experience possible. Now, next year, our conference will be at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in DC. I will be looking forward to it!Beautiful hotel, gorgeous lobby. Our room was on the 32nd floor and while not large was adequate. We had a gorgeous view of the white river state park and the zoo. The bathrooms just have a shower, but it's large. The beds comfortable. Their executive lounge was very nice. The ladies who run the happy hour at night are wonderful! I'd have given the JW five stars, if they had treated us,as members of their elite program, better. The hotel was 1/3 empty, yet we were not upgraded to a suite. The elite program is not what it used to be, except at the marriott renaissance properties. Still I would return to the JW as I believe it's the best marriott downtown.Huge. Nice.  One of the nicest hotels I've been in.  Went to a conference here and walked away very impressed with the service and amenities.Hmm...this is puzzling. I guess I'm in line with what Yelp describes as a three-star experience (""A-OK""). We were gifted a one-night stay with a romance package. This was a fun weekend, and even though we live in Indy, a staycation is always a nice way to jazz things up. I guess my feelings are that while it was a perfectly nice hotel, I really just expected more. From bad to good, because I like to end on a positive note:Cons:-No WiFi in the rooms. I've read several responses to other Yelp reviews that indicate that the fee-for-WiFi situation is a Marriott-wide policy. I understand it's a company policy, but I think it's unacceptable. For a few hundred bucks per night, this is non-negotiable. I have stayed in cheaper hotels (or coffee shops) that offer this service. THIS ALONE is enough for me to NEVER recommend this hotel to a friend or family member coming in town. I don't mean to sound so begrudging, but I hope this is loud and clear, JW--I seriously would never suggest this location to anyone because of this issue. I think it's worth figuring something out.-Though we didn't need it for our one night, I thought it was strange that there was no refrigerator in the room. The walkability to restaurants lends itself to visitors having leftovers, and for people who may be staying for a few days (convention guests, etc.), it seems like a fridge would be a must.Meh:-The ""romance package"" didn't seem very geared toward two people. There was only one robe in the room (which my husband let me have, thanks dear!). Part of the deal was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, but there were only 4 strawberries. Maybe we're just big eaters?-Part of the romance package was being booked on a ""high floor room"". We were on floor 23, which was the lowest floor in the ""high floor"" elevator bank (23-33). I get that it's technically a higher floor, but it didn't really seem to be in the spirit of what was promised (and we weren't visiting on a particularly busy weekend).-I would've expected name-brand toiletries, but not a huge deal.Pros:-Great location, which enabled us to walk to a bar and restaurant during the evening-Very friendly staff who for the most part seemed genuinely happy to be doing their jobs. I saw a family checking in, and there was a staff member with a mini treasure chest offering some cool toys to the kids :)-Cool shower with side jets! Can I get one of these for my house?-Delicious breakfast buffet, which we got as part of our special package. My omelet was really fabulous.-Really nicely decorated, and you can tell that the hotel is still new and fresh even after a few years.-Love to see that JW management is active on Yelp responding to customer reviews (positive and negative). I like businesses that are hip to social media!Overall, the experience was just fine. I doubt I would come back, but that's OK. My bottom line would be that for the price, I would just expect more.Awful -- check in is at 2:30 and we arrive at 4:15. They do not have a room ready for us. Therefore they give us vouchers to Starbucks upstairs. We head up there and it is closed! The bar has a 3 hr wait. Now there was a big turnaround on cleaning as it is a colts game weekend but don't you think they should have planned for this! Frustrated.A good night's sleep - that's why you usually want a hotel room. The JW does not offer that. You also want the room clean, modern, and functional. The JW has some of that.Many reviewers offer 5-star reviews because of the JW's proximity to nearby restaurants or the skybridge to neighboring buildings. Other Indianapolis downtown hotels share these identical amenities, including the other Marriott hotels that reside in the cluster alongside the JW. So I'm going to rate my experience in the hotel room itself, instead of its proximity to Victory Field, Zoo, Eiteljorg Museum, St. Elmo's, stadium, restaurants, etc.1. The thermostat uses a motion detector. I awoke in the middle of the night, wet with sweat, because the air conditioning kept disabling. I had to change beds to be closer to the thermostat to keep it working. Through the discomfort of the heat, changing beds, and wide temperature swings, I didn't sleep well.2. The thermostat does not have a fan ""on/off/auto"" setting.  I usually turn the thermostat fan to ""on"" to maintain air circulation (prevents room from feeling stale) and create some white noise. Instead, the JW room air got still and stale between the air conditioning cycling. So I was constantly throwing covers off, only to pull them back up. This compounded  the sleep disturbance.3. Although the glass facade is very fancy, the room was very noisy. The thermal expansion and contraction of the glass facade loudly popped, creaked, cracked, and groaned all night. This compounded  the sleep disturbance. Having a thermostat ""fan on"" switch would have been useful to create some background white noise to cover the building's creaks and groans.4. Although the curvature of the building creates an architectural interest, the curvature also serves as an acoustical lens. On the 17th floor, I could clearly make out conversations of pedestrians on the street below. This also meant every motorcycle, truck, and car enthusiast sounded like they were in the room with me. This compounded  the sleep disturbance. I slept with earplugs, an honor I usually reserve for many of the Chinese hotels I commonly stay.5. Room service knocked on my door at 8:00AM on SUNDAY MORNING. I was still trying to recoup a little bit of sleep. That was the last straw. This place does NOT offer a comfortable stay. This was the only problem with staff. Why send the staff to wake up hotel guests on weekend mornings?The nearby (connected) Springhill Suites, Courtyard, or Fairfield are imminently more comfortable. I've stayed at all three. Within the gigantic Marriott cluster on Washington Street, the JW is the least comfortable choice.6. Our stay was to celebrate our anniversary. We paid extra for a corner room, but was surprised to have two small beds instead of a single king bed. Due to the thermostat issue (above), I switched beds in the middle of the night. On our anniversary! We slept in separate beds! However, neither one of us really slept well. Not really how we wanted to remember things.7. Internet service costs $14.95/day, whereas it is free elsewhere in the hotel cluster. This is silly to not offer internet service, even for a ""full-service"" hotel.8. As a ""full-service"" hotel, it is lacking an in-room refrigerator ... or even a mini-bar.9. There are TONS of staff everywhere, but they can't help with inherent deficiencies of the JW. The problem is not with management, it's just a poorly equipped and bad building.If your goal is status and panache, then the JW is your best choice. There are glamorous German and Italian cars parked on the entry drive. But expect frustrations. If your goal is getting a good night's sleep in Indianapolis downtown, with an exceptionally functional room and equally friendly staff, perhaps choose the Springhill Suites or Courtyard. You can still access the same restaurants and skywalk (to the Convention Center and Circle Center Mall) from anywhere in the Marriott cluster.I'm in town a lot. I enjoy the perks of being platinum elite.  The concierge lounge is awesome,with great service. I brought my family and they treated my boys like royalty in the lounge.   The valet department could use some help. They are way overwhelmed and it takes forever to get your car and one guy who completely hates his job...so I started self parking because the it in the morning can take forever, even if you call ahead. Love the comfy beds, and multiple jets in the shower. Rooms are always clean and the gym is one of the best I've seen in any chain, and I travel a lot! Always stay here when I'm in town, but find its getting more popular, so harder to get a room!  Osteria has an awesome buffet with made to order omelets, and the sports bar has good apps great service. Overall, love this place. I prefer it to any hotel downtown.I love this place.  And I don't hand out five-stars often.First, the location is stelar.  Walk to good restaurants and pubs.  Go running along the canal, museums, and zoo.  (I did and loved it.)It's fresh and well furnished.  Even their standard room made me feel like a bit of a rock-star.  Quite swanky for my business travel.The Elite Lounge (or whatever Marriott calls their Gold-Elite lounge on the 31st floor) is great, with a killer view and some upscale snacks.I'm so terribly disappointed in what I just encountered as my colleague and I attempted to check in with our reservations.  We were told that the hotel has overbooked itself and we're being sent 20 mins back toward the airport.  It's after midnight and we have to be downtown early in the morning which is why we booked the hotel we did.  I travel extensively for work and pleasure and have never encountered anything like this.  They also didn't offer sort of restitution for the horrible inconvenience.  I won't be booking with Marriott for a while.It's a nice place. But a non-smoking hotel should mean non-smoking. I shouldn't have to smell it in the elevator to the parking garage, and then smell it in the parking garage. Service for dinner was adiquate, but take offense when half the table is offered coffee, and the other half isnt. Then we can't get iced tea or refills on our water! I'm not paying $7 for a bottled water or $5 for a can of soda!!. Waiting for elevators is a cluster. For the price, go somewhere elseRooms are okay. You can get a very nice view on fairly any side of the hotel. Food is typical of a hotel, nothing special. High priced as any other hotel. Decent location. The lobby bar is a little small and tight to maneuver and is somewhat slow in service. The main bar has a decent beer selection and mostly a very nice staff, but the service can be a bit slow at times and not due to the number of customers. VERY IMPORTANT............IF YOU ARE THERE FOR AN EVENT OR EVEN A PROVIDER OF AN EVENT OF ANY KIND... BE AWARE THAT THIS PROPERTY IS EXTREMELY HIGH IN THEFT. Apparently, the management does not care to control their staff and does not care if someone that is bringing thousands of dollars to their facility is repeatedly the victim of theft. The last four visits to this property has left my company filling out theft paperwork. After traveling the country extensively, this is the only property where I have had pricey items walk away. It's clear that the Marriott management could care less. Security? Cameras? That's a joke. This place needs a sting operation set up to bring down the thieving scum.Great property and in line with the JW Marriott reputation.This flagship property is connected to the convention center, right next to the minor league ball field, and overlooks the river and NCAA museum. The staff has always taken care of my needs and were great in providing breakfast coupons when I couldn't access the lounge due to early departure times for military duty.The only item that cost the fifth star is that to get to the Friday's in the Courtyard Marriott, you have to walk through a parking garage. I'm sure this was something that came later in the design phase, but it is annoying to have to go down to the basement, walk through the parking structure, and then go up the elevator in the Courtyard Marriott just to eat. But hey, we can't all be perfect, right?Great facility. Horrible service. Overcharged. Had to wait two hours to get in my room after check in time. Room was fairly clean, but overall it was not my favorite experience.Came in town for a business meeting and my boss wanted to stay here. Upscale atmosphere, friendly front desk personnel, I'm thinking this is going to be a nice stay. Upon check in I noticed that parking is $31.00 per day. First sense of outrageous. Get in my room, unpack and start my routine of ironing all of my clothes for the week, but the iron is missing. Call the front desk and they said they would send one right up. 30 minutes later, still no iron so I call back. They apologized and again said they would get one to me, which happened about 10 minutes later. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning. Next I get my computer set up and find that WiFi access is 14.95 per day. Second sense of outrageous.  Especially since the 2 other hotels connected to this one offer free access. (Oh yes, their parking rates are $23.00 per day, which is still high, but all 3 use the same underground parking garage! Couldn't figure that one out)The next morning (and for the rest of the stay) I had to let the hot water run for about 10 minutes before I got any hot water. Third sense of outrageous.  While taking a shower, the tub didn't drain normal so I ended up standing in a few inches of water. Told the front desk as I was leaving about it. The clerk wrote it down,  apologized and asked if I wanted to move rooms. I said that wouldn't be necessary but did ask that they send someone up with some draino or something. Said okay and gave me a Starbucks gift card for the trouble. Thought it might be getting better.Next morning, same issue with the drain but didn't have time to tell the front desk again since I was running a little late. Just hoped that they didn't get a chance to get to it the day before but would that day.Got up this morning to leave and, yep, had to take a shower/bath again.  Was going to tell the front desk about it as I left so that the next person they put in that room wouldn't have to deal with it, but the desk was empty. Yes, it was 5:30, but the desk should be manned 24/7.Bottom line, there are many hotels in the downtown area to choose from. I recommend looking at those before this one. I won't stay here on future trips to Indy. The rooms are good, but not overly so. The amenities are the same as any other hotel. My opinion, not nearly enough bang for the bucks spent.","This is a new hotel (built for the 2012 Super Bowl) and it has all the bells and whistles.  It was easy to find (but did require a legal(?) u-turn to get into the drop off, the staff and service were impeccable, rooms were great (check out the shower and robes!)  the fitness center is top notch, and the restaurant in the place was stellar.  Excellent experience; I look forward to being back.Very nice high end Marriott Hotel.  It is pricey but worth it.  Check out the deals on their website, we got a Labor Day special that included, breakfast, and parking for $199,Both side of the hotel have great views.  If you are a Gold Marriott or higher member, you get additional perks that make it so much better.The only down side was that everyone and their child, stroller, teenager, grandmother with a Gold Card was in the private lounge and it was a bit of circus.The staff was very nice.Came here for a breakfast meeting at Circle City Bar &amp; Grille  (not an overnight stay)Great selection of food, plus a chef doing omelets at the very far end of the dining room.I got some friends a room at the JW for the night as a gift the night of their wedding.  The only request I made of the front desk was that the bride and groom would not have to worry about any expenses.  2 of us separately went down and gave credit cards to the front desk to make sure everything was taken care of.  I got a phone call at 11:30 that night from the bride and groom saying that they were being asked to pay for parking.  Huge fail JW.  When I asked to talk to the manager, all he did was make excuses.  No apologies, no reassurance that they would be well taken care of for the rest of their stay.  If you want a seamless stay, this is not the place.  Huge disappointment.I love the JW Indianapolis.  All the things you would expect from the brand.  The rooms are not cramped because this wasn't rehabbed or retro fitted to be a hotel.  This was built for the Super Bowl and therefore we know that Americans, especially football fans, need a little more room than the rest of us.  Well done.  The gem of this facility is the restaurant that I can't remember the name of.  It's located in the lobby on the right side of the registration area.  The breakfast was EXCELLENT and the service was even better.  I wish I could remember the name of the server.  She was exceptional and made my JW Indy experience a great one.  She deserves to be recognized and I failed at her name.  Putz!  Anyhow, I hope that the service remains impeccable there.  This facility is my go-to for a hotel in downtown Indy.  Terrific.The JW is a great addition to downtown Indy and I enjoy staying here.  Check-in/out is easy, service is excellent.  Always made to feel like a valued guest.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  I have requested a king bed every time I visit but have always received 2 doubles, not preferred for a solo business traveler.  Parking at $30/night (self park) is outrageous but I keep coming here for the classy facility, fabulous fitness center, and amazing breakfast (made to order waffles and omelettes!)My company party was hosted here and everything was perfect.The food was awesome and there was tons of it: sushi (yummm), potato and pea samosas, popcorn, pretzels with cheese, mini crab cakes, mini corn dogs, and tons more.  Dinner was fantastic even though I was only able to eat a few bites after being stuffed from hor d'oeuvres.  I had beef with asparagus, carrots, fingerling potatoes, and a puree of some kind.The service was wonderful.  Plates were all of a sudden cleared.  Some of the staff had their faces painted to match the circus theme was was really cool.Everyone had a great time.  I'd highly recommend hosting your event here!Pros:-The hotel is in an excellent location. It is within walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and activities.-The hotel is well maintained and is on the newer side. It is only ~3 years old. - The concierge lounge is open every day serving breakfast, h'orderves , and sweetsCons: -The pool is on the small side. The photo makes it look much larger than it actually is.-JW classification- as a person who travels and stays on average 160+ nights a year in a hotel, 120+ in Marriott's in a variation of their different brands, I feel that it would fit better into the Marriott Hotel flagship brand.I stayed here two nights for a corporate meeting (at the onsite conference center). All in all, I had a perfect visit: very friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms, and an overall high satisfaction will all amenities.The lobby Bar is awesome.  The staff could not be more accommodating, fast and efficient and the food at the bar was great.  Beer selection is from local brew houses and single malts two notches above typical.   Really for a very busy hotel, the staff is always there and ready to help. The place to stay in Indianapolis.Late review, but better late than never. We stayed here Spring of 2012.We were pleasantly surprised to find such a luxurious hotel located in Indianapolis. The exercise facility was hands down the nicest hotel exercise room I've ever been in- free headphones- Who does that? You rock, JW! The rooms were beautiful, clean, and modern. Two downsides - it was Monster Truck Convention weekend in Indy- what a crowd, we could not relax at the pool. Second downside was the restaurants surrounding the JW- mostly chain restaurants, but I've found that to be trend in Indianapolis.Excellent hotel at nice location. It was a bit crowded due to the Indy marathon but the service of the hotel staff did not suffer. The porters were smiling all the time and the reception was quick to help and pleasant. Rooms are nice with great beds.Jw Marriott is unlike any other hotel. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and the staff are out standing. They have meeting space 2 restaurants and a starbucks. High velocita and Osteria Pronto are excellent. There truly is no other place to stay in Indy. The architetture is incredible and it is connects to the convention center by a Sky walk which also will connect you to the mall. It can get you so many places without even going outside!Beautiful hotel. Great location. Friendly staff from the moment you walk into the lobby.  Had a room on the 19th floor great city view. Impressed with housekeeping I would leave my room early morning and I would stop back before noon and the room was already cleaned. The High Velocity sports bar off the lobby is great . Especially the bartenders Max, Sarah and Katy!! Food was also great. Would definitely stay at another JW anytime !My husband and I stayed for one night which included the romance package. The room was beautiful and well decorated. The view from our room was breath taking. We stayed on the 24th floor! Wow! Everyone was very friendly! The breakfast buffet at the restaurant was to die for! I would return just for that! As soon as I called room service and let them know I was ready for my champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, they were at my door. Under 5 minutes. The only negative I have is they seem a bit over staffed. There were a lot of employees just standing around.I came to visit friends and family in Indianapolis. JW Marriott opened right when I was moving away from Indy, so I decided to stay. Little did I know I had booked my trip during a major college sports event. When I arrived at the hotel it was late and everyone was attentive. The staff was lovely and very friendly through most of my four night stay. However, the swarm of families and children at the hotel made this feel more like a Holiday Inn than a JW Marriott. And the staff - again, very friendly (except one seemingly grumpy young woman who made me a cappuccino in the beautiful lobby bar) - seemed overwhelmed. I hate when I walk into a hotel and there are tons of people and tons of luggage being ""held"" in the lobby, and that's what this place was for the majority of the weekend.liked:-awesome shower-nice views (I had a corner room on the 27th view that overlooked the river, nice sunset) -lovely staff-two bar options and lots of seating (and types of seating, couches, booths, stools, etc)-free bottled water in your room-delicious chicken fingers from the sports bar, ha!dislikes:-no mini bar. Big hotel, I get that the capacity for a mini bar isn't high, but, I like the convenience. -no spa (I had to go to the Conrad)-I had an appointment and called to have my car pulled around. The valets pulled my car around, and I sat in my car for 5-7 minutes waiting because they lost my keys. !?!?!-too many TV's. I've never been in a building with so many TV's. -cleaning services were just ""OK"" I'd often find things unattended that I would expect cleaned. I even tip, and was surprised by this. I was not provided complimentary water on my last night stay. -I also had to request a robe. I had accidentally left mine on the floor my first night, and they must have collected it with my towels, but I had to request a robe, it was never replenished. -having to pay for internet in your room. this is the 21st century, let's fix that. or, at least give club members free internet. -a staff member told me that they were giving discounts to people for the sports event, so everyone and their mother was staying here. It felt more like a Holiday Inn Holidome than a high end hotel. I figure though, that if I came any other time, and not during an unexpected sporting event, I probably would have felt the type of experience I expect out of the higher end Marriott label. I was told by a staff member that this was the largest of all the JW's until the Dubai location was built - and that makes sense, it's a massive place. Sadly I did not take advantage of the pool or work out area, the swarm of children made it particularly unappealing. But, I'm a single woman traveler who likes her peace and quiet, and generally finds it at luxury hotels like this. So, note to self: next time I visit Indy look at the city event schedule and book accordingly.Stayed here for a conference. Very nice hotel and the staff is friendly and always helpful. The gym is very nice for a hotel but can get crowded during peak times. I was disappointed in the pool because it is small. Location is nice, close to tons of restaurants and bars.The service at this place is great. When we checked in, the attendant was nice but he was talking so fast that we just said yes and nodded. We kept on looking at each other to see if one of us had understood the question, but none of us did.We got to the room and it was nicely furnished. It's very modern and classy. We tried to order room service in the morning, but they said it was a 45 minute wait and we couldn't wait that long. I like that they have interactive maps. It's very helpful and useful. The meeting rooms are and the bathrooms are lovely. I think everything is tastefully designed without being too barren but not too homey. We had our conference dinner in the grand ballroom and I have to say, that was the best beef I've ever had at a hotel. The salad was not impressive. A negative is that they charge for wifi, unless you're in the lobby. I'm sorry, but even some of the cheapest motels offer free wifi. But my overall experience is a good one.I stayed here for a convention a few weeks ago.  I don't even think I left the area besides going to the stadium.  Everything about this hotel was top notch.The staff was incredibly nice and attentive.  Almost to the point where you think you're staying in a FIVE STAR HOTEL.  Oh, wait....There are two restaurants, and several in the area within walking distance, plus a lounge where you can just chill.Awesome views and even better staff!!!!!The hotel didn't allow me to do a late check-out, in fact the housekeeping knocked on my door at 9am on my last day because she thought the room was vacant.  Not her fault.  There were a few of us staying in the room, and each of us checked out at a different hour.  I was the last guest.  (But they could get a new program that let's them know if someone is in the room, eh?  Especially since the A/C kept shutting off if we didn't move.)What really irritated me was she went in my room when I stepped out to smoke a cigarette and moved my suitcase from the bed to the floor.  There was a DND sign on the door.  I mean come on.  That alone, plus the fact that I couldn't do an hour late check-out should knock it down to 3 or 4, but I'm being nice.I was very busy during my convention, and luckily during my last morning I was able to enjoy the pool, gym, and hot tub.  Why didn't I do it during my whole stay...it was nice.  Nice views from the entire spa area.So since I couldn't get a late check-out, I was informed I could store my luggage at the front desk (and get a bag ticket...very nice).  The house keeping was very pushy to get us out, and I'm not sure if she thought I had left, but she went back in my room.  If someone ever came in my room if I was naked I would have knocked them out.---make sure you have the DO NO DOT DISTURB SIGN ON.  Other than that, bam....I'd go back!Drank at High Velocity after being dropped off the Brew Bus Tour.  Good food and drinks.","['love', 'property', 'true', 'star', 'portfolio', 'let', 'start', 'beginning', 'parking', 'valet', 'self', 'park', 'lesser', 'charge', 'garage', 'beneath', 'hotel', 'greeters',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-indianapolis-indianapolis,Hyatt Regency Indianapolis,3.5,$$$,92,"My husband was there for a trade show and I was along for the ride. I really wanted to stay somewhere with a suit but I don't know, we got a good deal on this place through the show so we picked Hyatt. We loved it. From the moment I stepped out of my car at the valet I had all the help I needed. My husband arrived first and the kids and I drove there. They grabbed all my luggage and even my kids and let them ride on the cart! We had a 2 bed room, the room was clean and beds were comfortable. Yes, this place is expensive meaning valet and no free breakfast and what not, but what do you expect? I loved that their's a Starbucks in the building :) and the employee's there were so amazing, they gave my kids free cake pops and cookies and even an apple! I mean you can't beat that kind of service. There's plenty of restaurants around but there's a Subway in the building as well if you want something really quick and cheap. I love that everything is within walking distance from here. My husband didn't even go outside for 3 days because he got there from the airport and walked to the convention center and to Lucas Stadium all through the skyway. There's even a mall attracted :) and everything else you need is with in a few blocks. I love the central location of this place. highly recommended and awesome service. Thank you HyattLocation, location, location means $, $, and $. Parking is $30-36. No free breakfast like other Hyatts. DO NOT PARK to check in for more than 10min, or you'll be socked with the $30 parking charge. The room is good, and it was clean, modern, and tasteful. The staff seem used to complaints from pikers like me, oops, I mean people that are plainly shocked at their prices. But this is located only blocks from the convention center, Lucas Stadium, and other ""attractants"" to downtown Indy. If you're easily shocked and wondered if you were on Michigan St in Chicago suddenly, then try another place. I was burning frequent stayer points, so I parked down the street for $12 overnight, and went somewhere else to eat breakfast. I'm sure they didn't care.I have stayed here overnight on two separate occasions and thoroughly enjoyed each stay.  The hotel is situated on the corner of Washington and Capitol which allows views of the Capitol building and the IRT. It is also walking distance to just about everything downtown. Circle Centre, St. Elmo's, Soldiers and Sailors monument... all within blocks of the Hyatt. Oh and don't forget that The Eagle's Nest is on the top floor of the Hyatt!Our room was clean and well appointed. It feels a bit more swanky than the price tag suggests. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and the rooms are quiet. There are even nightlights located under the bedside tables that are motion activated for when you groggily stumble to the bathroom in the middle of the night! It's the little things right?!?The interactions I had with the staff were limited to check-in, check-out and the valet service. Everyone was polite and professional. Valet was a bit pricey ($34 overnight) but it was nice to not have to worry about finding parking. This is a great hotel for the price and you can't beat the location!The Hyatt is centrally located in downtown Indy and easily accessible to many of the restaurants in walking distance. The check in process is fairly quick and staff is friendly. There is a starbucks and subway located within the lobby of the hotel. I've stayed at the Hyatt on a few different occasions due to work trips. This is not my preferred hotel in the Indy area as I find the rooms to be dusty, the bathroom floors are sometimes sticky, and AC can be loud at times. Indy hotels book up very fast because there is some kind of convention every week. So if you know you're coming, book as far in advance as possible.For some reason even though they have 5 elevator banks they seem to take awhile so make sure to give yourself a little extra time or be patient for them. Room service is fairly quick. Every time I have ordered room service it will be delivered in about 20 minutes and they give you a call to notify you that your order is on its way. I do like how the Hyatt does have a healthy menu option for those that want to try and eat well while on the road. A decent size gym with variety of cardio and weight options. They also provide towels and has a water station to refill water bottles if you would like. If you order an UberX from the Hyatt sometimes they get confused as to which entrance to pick you up at but I've had luck telling them to entrance where valet pick up and drop of is. The valet staff is very friendly. Always greeting hello and goodbye and offering to help with bags even if I'm dropped off by uber versus driving a rental.We came to Indy for the Colts vs Texans game on Sunday. I read a lot of negative reviews on Yelp for this hotel, but decided to book it since that's where my friend and her husband were staying. Our room was small, but clean. Although everything looked a bit old, especially the carpet. Saturday we were able to check in early and there were no issues. Sunday we had NO hot water. We told the front desk and she said the whole hotel was out of hot water, but they were working on it. That's unacceptable for the amount of money we paid. We told her we'd like some type of compensation and she gave each of us 8,000 points on our Hyatt Gold cards. I appreciate that, but it took several attempts to get her to do anything. She just kept saying it would be fixed soon. Well, we had to get breakfast before the game so waiting around for the hot water to be restored was not an option. On Sunday we also noticed the slow elevators other Yelpers mentioned. Really really slow. We decided to walk down 5 flights of steps to get to the game, since the elevators were so slow. And the stairwell was pretty creepy. The best thing about this hotel was it's proximity to Lucas Oil Stadium and the Skywalk. It's close to a lot of other downtown Indy attractions too, but the next time I'm there I will stay somewhere else.My wife and I live in the Indy area, but we spent a night downtown to celebrate our anniversary. After much searching we finally settled on the Hyatt Regency because of the price and proximity to the things we wanted to do downtown. We booked a single king bed room. When we arrived we parked in the PNC garage underneath and paid $24 for 24 hours of parking. We were planning on walking everywhere and didn't go back to the ca until we were ready to leave.The gentleman who checked us in was very helpful. I asked if we could request a room with a view, and he put us on the 19th floor. We had a great view from our window, looking out straight across at the Embassy Suites. You could see the old theater across the street. You could also look towards monument circle and see the Conrad, Chase Tower, and other tall buildings. I've seen a lot of complaints about the slow elevators here, but we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for one. The room itself was very nice. There was a mini fridge, which was very helpful because my wife is still nursing our baby and she had to do some pumping and store the milk. The bed was very comfortable. My biggest complaint is that there was no variety in pillow sizes. All of the pillows were huge, and I like to sleep with a very thin pillow, so I didn't sleep all that well. If we go here again I'll bring my own.The bathroom/shower were very nice. The shower was very roomy, and pressure was good. The water did take a minute or two to get hot, which I had seen mentioned here before. But once it got there we never had an issue of it running out on us. We did spend some time down in the pool area. The pool was somewhat small, and there were several kids playing around in it, but the hot tub was very spacious. I don't care what time of year it is, a hot tub is one of my favorite things. The fitness area seemed to have quite a bit of equipment, but we didn't do anything there. The location here is great. You're in walking distance of anything you could want to do in downtown Indy. I'd definitely recommend a stay here.This hotel is satisfactory is most regards. However, I am giving it one star based solely on the elevator situation. I have never been in a hotel, or any high rise for that matter, and had to wait 5-10 minutes for an elevator. There is a severe shortage of elevators for the size of this hotel. I am not sure how they passed building codes.We entrusted our wedding weekend and honeymoon to Hyatt brand hotels. Our wedding was in downtown Indy and the Hyatt Regency was where we blocked rooms for our guests. (We honeymooned the week after at the Hyatt Zilara Cancun).First, the Hyatt regency offered the only competitive /decent block rate and was the most accommodating overall. Gabrelle was our contact and was always available at a moments notice if we needed something. She even assisted with some items outside her normal day to day tasks which is huge.The hotel itself is decent as far as interior/rooms. Some could be updated but it did the job for us and our guests. I have found at this hotel the rooms to be a bit musty/dusty at times when staying here before. As the groom though, they put me in a high room with a great view and surprised my wife and I with treats on our wedding night. Very nice touch.When we started arriving Thursday and Friday, the computer systems were down, which meant only one key per room and a long line to check in. With no computers it rendered half the front desk staff helpless, and basically one person was checking people in from a printed list while others tried to help or get out of the way. I would not have been able to handle the situation with the amount of patience and class that the staff at the Hyatt did...so, kudos to them for making the best of a bad situation! My wife and I are platinum gold passport members and clearly are quite loyal to the Hyatt brands. This also means I don't hesitate to complain or bring up an issue if I have one. This stay and weekend at the Hyatt regency met expectations, made our wedding weekend run smoothly, and we will definitley stay here again!My room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. The service at check-in was prompt and attentive and anything anytime I asked, the staff greeted the request as if they were personally happy to be hosting me.My favorite thing though was to have one of the employees of this Hyatt proudly stating to me and my coworkers that she has been with this hotel for nearly 20 years this year and loved it and added that she had requested this location because it was the best. That certainly builds your faith in the company!First impression? When you walk into the lobby you are stunned by the beauty of the Hyatt. It has a huge open air atrium and the hotel floors rise up majesticaly over you. You can see the walkways that snake out to the mall, the adjacent hotels and the Convention Center. You can see the glass elevators as they rise majestically to their skyward destinations. It really is a striking sight to see.Check in was easy- and the desk attendant asked if I was a Hyatt member, and I wasn't. So she signed me up and an instant perk was free wifi for 5 miutes of questions- not a bad deal at all. While checking in, I saw a bank of computer terminals for customers to use - good for boarding pass printing.My hotel room was very spacious- most definitely one of the larger chain rooms I've seen. It had an interesting design too -with an angled wall for the flatscreen and work station. The bed was very comfortable. The alarm clock had an mp3 plug so you could fill the room with selections from your iPod.There is a small alcove in the middle of the room with a mini-fridge and a Starbucks coffee maker. I didn't see a mini-bar, but since I never use them it was no great loss for me.The bathroom was very comfortable- and this is a big deal because so many chain bathrooms are petite, i remember one where I could barely close the door without smacking it into the toilet. This room was plenty big. The shower had that Herculite glass construction, and the water temp and pressure were fine. One picky thing - the bottom of the shower door leaked a little onto the floor. Not once, but every time.I asked for a late checkout on Wednesday and that was no problem everyone I dealt with here was pleasant and professional.Great hotel.  Service was great.  Staff very attentive.  The maid came by and knocked on the door to bring  me a pen that had been neglected to be placed on the stationary.  Location is very convenient to all downtown venues and restaurants.  Skywalks connect it to convention center, shopping mall making it easy to access Lucas Oil Stadium or the Field House for basketball games.  Don't have to go outside in the rain or cold.  Lots of panhandlers and ""street walkers"" on the street corners outside.  Still this isn't the Hyatts fault.Great stay.5 star hotel?? I think not. 1) While relaxing in the lobby for the rest of our guests to arrive, we brought our own alcohol to start the weekend with a drink (Since the hotel bar was CLOSED at 1pm on a Saturday!)...We had asked the concierge for ice. It was going to cost $25 FOR A BUCKET OF ICE!?! The associate who informed us of this ridiculous policy was also no help. We had to take our cups and find an ice machine on one of the hotels floors. 2) We waited 18 minutes for an elevator from our room to our lobby. We spent A LOT of time waiting for the elevator.3) The hallway light did not work in our guest room.4) I stood in line at the Starbucks for 23 minutes for a coffee. 5) We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, One South. First we waited for over an hour for our food (the restaurant was not crowded at this time)...finally when our food came, one of the guest in our party was told that they were out of what she had ordered. Had she known an hour prior, she would've ordered something else. 6) Staff is nice but not at all accommodating or helpful. Very disappointed.For a ""4 star"" hotel the service was garbage.First my ""complimentary"" wireless internet wasn't setup and I needed a phone call to have it ""activated"" and the code they gave me stopped working before check out.When we returned to our room for the second night our stay after 6pm the room was not made up. Not even looked at by the staff. I called the desk and they seemed not to care the offered to do it now, it's kind of late for that, I wanted to take a nap in the bed. I could talk to the housekeeping manager if I wanted. Neat. I had to ask them to send up fresh towels and made it know that I was unhappy.  They made no efforts to change make it right. So they clearly do not care about my money and they won't be getting it in the future. Which is a shame since I stay in Indianapolis 3+ times a year.We had a really wonderful one-night stay at the downtown Hyatt Regency. We originally planned on staying at a crappy 2 star place (we were only here to party.. high class wasn't really what we were going for!) When we went to book before leaving home, we realized that they jacked up the rates to an amount that seemed ridiculous for a non-fancy hotel. We had to start looking around for something else and were so lucky to get a fantastic rate for the Hyatt Regency on Priceline through the Express Deals.This place was really easy to find thanks to my BFF, Google maps. We arrived early in the AM with the thought that we'd probably have to just leave our bags and check in at a later time, but we were able to get a room right away on one of the top floors. Although we didn't have much of a view, we were still really impressed by the room overall. Since we were here on a Sunday evening, there wasn't a whole lot going on, but there was some kind of musical organ conference going on. All of the attendees were pretty friendly in the elevator, so much so that we wanted to go sneak in and see what an organ conference entails. Other pros:-They have an indoor pool! It's pretty small, but I was one of the only ones in it so I didn't mind.-Elevators were quick-Extremely close to City Centre mall, donut shop, coffee, fro-yo, etc.-Staff was friendly-Fridge in room - none of that weighted mini bar crap.-Spacious roomCons:-Not their fault, but a lot of businesses are closed on Sunday. We were in town for a concert, otherwise I probably wouldn't come back on a Sunday.-I love taking long baths at night especially after walking around all day! Our room didn't have a tub. (I think I read in reviews that you can request one -- not sure if that's true or not)This is one of the better hotels that I've ever stayed at, especially since nothing went wrong. I'm planning a trip back in the future and Hyatt will be my first choice!Best thing about this place is the location. The connection to the mall and proximity to Circle is great. Valet staff was hit and miss (some just outright rude) and parking was way too expensive. You know what though, Indy has a small downtown which makes almost all the hotels have a decent location. Maybe look around for other places to stay if you're in the area.A disappointment for all the money I spent. Lovely lobby and right downtown--it seemed perfect but the room was frustrating.I was here for four nights a few weekends ago for a convention. And wow, where to begin. This is supposedly a nice place? Weird. Because there were a lot of problems.1. Light by the window didn't work. Maybe it was connected to the lightswitch by the thermostat that didn't seem to connect to anything. Don't know if the bulb was just burned out or what. But, you know, basic maintenance.2. Internet: constant disconnects and crashes. Though, it was free.3.The shower curtain is a soft, absorbent fabric. It's not waterproof. That means that, as a shower curtain, it's USELESS. Be prepared to put down all your towels on the floor--cause when you step out, you will slip and die if you don't.4. Water never got better than lukewarm. Also, the ""plug"" was depressed--which I didn't realize because it still drains. So I thought it was just slow. 5. Tried to use the thermostat to warm up the room---but it would only blast cold air6. Minifridge was barely cold. Couldn't even freeze ice packs in it.7. There was an old pop can, trash and copious amounts of dust behind the work desk. 8. Water damage and stains on the bathroom ceiling9. Got short-changed at the Starbucks in the lobby. Gave the cashier a $20. She insisted I gave her a $10. I had no way to prove it--so I lost ten bucks. 10. I had the Privacy Please tag up--left my room for a little--came back and discovered that someone had been in there. Because they had decided that Saturday--which was very busy--was a good day to....trade out TVs for a slightly bigger one? So, that was a weird thing. 11. And then, at the end, having to pay $100 to park my car in their garage just seemed like a slap in the face---even though that's pretty much common practice in cities like this.Great location but this hotel needs work! Everything was unkept.  The hallways were dirty, wear and tear all over, just meh.  The room was a good size but walls were paper thin.  Could clearly hear a conversation next door.  The most annoying thing was the night lights built in to side tables that would go off whenever you moved.  Had to cover them with a pillow!Stayed here several years ago, when I accompanied the family to Indy for Bouchercon. Very solid hotel. Honestly, not overly amazing, not over-the-top fancy, but a solid hotel. Spent several very comfortable nights here.I stayed here last weekend.  I loved the bar in the lounge and the hotel is in a perfect location.  Walking distance to anything of importance and valet offers a flat fee of $35.00 for all day in and out use.The only reason I did not mark 5 stars is because there was a guy at the front desk who hastled me about my government ID to book my room at the discounted rate.  I had to get my colleague on the phone with him to argue my case.  It was sort of ridiculous.Besides that, the hotel was wonderfully clean and pleasant.  The gym is a bit small but functional none the less!The price is fair and the location is great.  Room was clean, but the staff was over zealous about wanting to clean. Started banging on doors at 9am. Everything is expensive. $17 for the buffet breakfast.  $8 well drinks at the bar. No wonder its always empty. Part of the idea here should be attracting people to mingle at the hotel bar.  I don't want to drop a Jackson every time my wife and I want a drink.  We paid less for mixed drinks at the area gentleman's club.  A guy ordered a bottle of corona. It was $6.The pool is tiny and the hot tub is not a hot tub.  It is a whirlpool. No bubbles.  Do not come here if you are planning the hotel as an inclusive facility.  It really has nothing more to offer than a room with good location.  Oh, if you want a view room, ask for it. We got a lovely view of the ac units. Bleh. We did get high up as requested.  Book through them and the internet is free. Book through a third party and you have to pay.  Parking is ridiculous.  It is part of the PNC building, so there are other people milling around in the daytime.  Don't expect or count on Starbucks being open when you want it either.","A colleague and I stayed at the Hyatt on a Wednesday and Thursday for a conference that took place at the hotel. Rooms: neat and clean.  Very modern decor, but visually busy.   Extremely comfortable beds.  We stayed in a two queen room that were each the size of a full size bed.  There was not a safe in the room to lock up your wallet and jewelry.   Exercise facility: state of the art equipment.  Cool towels for after working out.   Sauna.  Pool.  Hot tub.  (And not overly chlorinated).   Towels at the indoor pool to use,so you don't need to bring towels from your room.   Locker rooms, so bring your padlock!!  Showers in the locker room area.  Staff:   Very attentive.   Excellent food.   Chicken taco bar and plated steak meals were served.    Fresh fruit, rolls, and oatmeal, along with beverages were served for breakfast at the conference provided by the hotel. Valet parking:  polite and helpful staff.   $34 parking per day. However, on our last day we had to get our car by 2:00 unless we wanted to be charged another $34.  Our conference went until 3:30. We got our car on our lunch break and were directed to go two blocks to another, cheaper parking ramp.   It was full and so were the next two were full.  We ended up parking at another ramp for $15 and walking 3 blocks back to the hotel.    In total, it took 30 minutes to move our car and get to our played lunches, that were waiting for us, late.  I wished the hotel would let you park until 4:00 or when conferences are done.   It was inconvenient.    Overall, we enjoyed our stay.   The polite and helpful staff was the highlight.    I even requested the plated steak to please be cooked to well done and accommodated with pleasure.  They were serving at least 500 people.I stayed at this hotel for my 5 day stay in Indianapolis. The location is great, but the hotel experience was not so much. Like most others have said:-No warm water in shower all 5 days-Bathroom/shower not cleaned very well-15-20 minute average time to get from room to lobby because of constant traffic jam of the elevators-Very very noisy. This was the most bizarre to me. They had a wedding at the hotel the weekend I stayed, so I am assuming they probably hold weddings here often, the music/people from the wedding were SOOOO loud two of the nights, I couldn't sleep on the 9th floor. The wedding was on the second floor...so I can't even imagine the people on floors lower than me. The bass sounded like I was directly above a club. This went on until 1 in the morning when I finally fell asleep to the sound of the TV. Weddings I've been to are usually over at 11, so I don't know what that was about. Do they just not care about guests wanting to sleep when they book these weddings? Just weird, idk. -Parking your car is ridiculously expensive. I get that we are downtown, but holy cow, give your hotel guests a discount or something. -Upon checking in, they warned me of construction and to keep my curtains shut after showering as there apparently may be workers right outside my window? Interesting. I definitely will be staying elsewhere next time.Disappointed yet again! It would be so simple for them to retain a loyal customer. However, these guys keep messing it up. I've not once thought they were doing the right thing in terms of honoring my diamond status. Marriott and the Hilton treat their loyal customers better. Here however, I was told the corner suites were booked despite the fact that I had just booked my room online and it asked me to upgrade for $40 bucks more. That whole free automatic upgrade thing is apparently a thing of the past. I used to get that all of the time. This place works my nerves. I've never had a stay go right here. It has to be that the staff are improperly trained or the manager doesn't know how to manage his potentially awesome resources. I think this was my last attempt. The Conrad and The Alexander, along with the JW are the hotels to beat. Even the Sheraton has a leg up. I see a lot of 1 stars, so I'm hoping someone at corporate will take notice and fix the problems here.Rooms did not look fresh and clean. A couple of the pillowcases were very worn.  A family of four was scheduled to check in, yet only towels for three were left in room. My kids were hungry around 8:30. It was raining outside so did not want to go outside. The quick serve restaurants were closed. Called restaurant listed on phone and was told you can't carry out.  Went up to restaurant and realized it was very fancy and not what we were looking for. Called room service to see if we could order and pick up food.  She said yes and I ordered kids meals.  Brought back to our room and the PB &amp; J bread was stale - hard as a rock. How can you mess up PB&amp; J?  Too tired to deal with it, so threw it away. After seeing how much that PB&amp;J was on our bill. I complained at checkout and they nicely removed the charge.I'm not sure how this hotel got good reviews. When we arrived we had to ask for directions and an employee rudely answered without even making eye contact, as if we were bothering her. At check in I asked the woman helping us if she could recommend a good brunch and she asked if we wanted Italian. I replied saying we wanted breakfast and she gave me a confused look then told me to ask the concierge (and there was not a language barrier, she was American). The elevators took ten minutes to come. Finally we get to our room and there is no hot water. My shower was cold and the shower wall was slimy.  I'm not sure we will be staying at a Hyatt anytime soon, as it has given us the amenities you'd expect from a Holiday Inn, if not less.Stayed here 4 nights.  Great staff!  Comfortable beds. Clean rooms.  Great location, within walking distance to mall, food, and theatres.  Surprisingly there was not a microwave in the room and no vent in the bathroom to suck up the shower steam or smells that can occur and linger.This location is pretty much like the other Regency's I've stayed at. This is a massive location though, and has been renovated fairly recent. It also has a very nice new gym, with jacuzzi and pool.Parking is quite expensive...$34 overnight. But I guess that's to be expected at most downtown locations.The Regency Club is also fairly nice, although it's one of the smaller ones I've seen. Food was good though, and a nice view, and very attentive gentleman working it tonight.All in all, a solid 4 stars for a Hyatt Regency.Shocking how dirty the Hyatt was!My husband and I wanted to get a way for the weekend and thought we would like to stay at the Hyatt.  We have stayed there before and enjoyed our stay.  This time...not so much.  The staff is wonderful, they all want to know what they can do to make our stay better.  Once we got into our room I noticed it was dusty, not just a little dusty...VERY DUSTY!Bathroom was discussing. Toilet seat was broken, hair on the ceiling, and in the sink. I had to clean the sink myself cause I get grossed by the thought if someone's hair where. I'm going to brush my teeth. I brought it up to front desk. They had someone fix the toilet seat and they gave us a free breakfast. Nice but what about cleaning the room!  I went down later and explained that I have allergies to dust an yet no one cleaned.  Saturday house keeping came into our room and fixed our bed and somewhat replaced towels, but the hair was still on the ceiling and the dust was still everywhere. See I wrote on the desk, TV, table, nightstand, headboard and pictures/frames ""Dust Me!"" Could not miss it if you were going to clean properly. Later that evening to spoke with who said was management and once again said he was going to call housekeeping to clean the problem. Few hours later we got back to the room and NOTHING was done. My husband normally never complains this time he did.  We must have explained the story to 6 different people at the Hyatt about the cleanness of the hotel.  Very disappointed in the lack of effort. They did give us a free night, for the next visit... Ha ha that is a joke cause I do not think there will be a next time. I could have stayed across the way at the Westin for less and they updated the entire hotel.  We paid more for a hotel that was not clean!!!Eh, it's fine, and convenient for downtown business, especially convenient to the convention center.  Large (though not enormous), atrium-style Hyatt.Clean, efficient, with valet or garage parking (additional cost).  If you're working downtown, you may be able to park and forget your car until departure - this is what I usually prefer.Usual membership / loyalty benefits.  Will go back, without a concern; but nothing exceptional to note.I must preface this by saying I was not actually a customer here, but my wife stayed here for a conference in Indianapolis. It happened to be her birthday while she was staying here and I called the hotel to see if we could put together a little surprise for her. I was connected to Ms. Vicki in the Room Service department and she went above and beyond to help me organize a little morning/breakfast surprise. I couldn't be happier with the great customer service and friendliness Ms. Vicki and the Hyatt Regency staff displayed. They helped my wife celebrate her birthday even though she was far from home. Thank you Ms. Vicki and the Hyatt Regency!I stayed here before back in 2010 and had a decent experience. This time around we were traveling with our infant daughter and managed to get an upgrade to a corner king, which made a huge difference. The extra space in the room was great for fitting all the requisite baby stuff. The most convenient aspect for me was the fridge/wet bar located just outside of the bathroom. It gave me a great spot to prepare bottles without using desk space, and was right next to the bathroom where I washed everything. We have stayed at 3 other hotels since then and this was the best layout for my purposes (albeit unique).Parking here has always been awful. It is ridiculously expensive and there are no in/out privileges. The only other design flaw for us was the pathway from the room to get to the mall (which is connected by a breezeway). The conference center within the hotel occupies the 2nd floor, which is the walkway to get to the mall...there are events which always block the halls, rerouting guests to an escalator. Not stroller friendly. In order to cross over, you have to go down to the lobby, walk across, and up an elevator one story...Despite this minor inconvenience the hotel is centrally located and has always been a good spot to access most of the things we needed in Indy.I decided to try the Hyatt when I needed a hotel to call home for the week of Christmas. The price was comparable if not better than the surrounding hotels.Location: awesome! There is a skywalk that connects to the mall for colder months. Fancy (Fogo de Chao) and not so fancy (steak and shake) restaurants less than a block away. Service: great! Everyone was amazingly helpful and nice. I didn't get the typical high end ""I'm better than this"" attitude. The young and personable staff at valet and the desk were more than helpful and nice. Valet is a $30 per day charge extra, but worth it to me. The front desk even called to let us know our door had been slightly ajar per their security system!Rooms: Good. They have done renovations since the Super Bowl a few years ago, so everything is much nicer. The rooms are spacious and clean. We did have trouble out of our tv (buttons not working, had to set sleep timer to turn off). The cleaning staff did a great job. The perfect mix of give you what you need and tidy up without touching the stuff you obviously wanted to be left alone. I have a pet peeve about cleaning staff touching my toiletries or rearranging my luggage or shoes I leave in the room. Food: who knows? We actually didn't eat at the hotel restaurants at all. But from living here before, I've heard good things. We just had other plans while we were in town. Environment: great! We had no issues smelling smoke (smoke-free) or noise from neighbors, which are major decision-makers when I pick hotels. The hotel was very quiet, but I feel it wasn't very busy due to the time of year. Overall, I give a four-star rating because there are things we didn't experience (food), but loved it!Comfortable and clean rooms, but the beds don't come with a fitted sheet over the mattress. Housekeeping came ever 2 days to tidy up and clean the room. Although I was impressed when I called and asked where the microwave was so I can warm up some food, the receptionist said she would have one delivered to my room in 15 minutes - for FREE! It also came with disposable bowls, and eating utensils. And true enough- there was a knock on my door in 12 mins and I was greeted by a very polite lady with a microwave.  I stayed here for a week or more long convention and I leapt for joy when I saw that there is a STARBUCKS in the lobby!!! There was also a SUBWAY and Pizza place. The Skywalk on the second floor took us to the convention center, very convenient location for different restaurants and it is right next to the Circle Center Mall. The Valet attendants were very polite and helpful. They always made sure I got what I needed and asked me how my day was going and always brought my car on time. NEver had to wait on them guys! The manager should give them a raise for giving great customer service!!Was here for a business conference in early November, and this is one of the better conference hotels I've been at recently (as of late, it seems like I've been at Marriotts and not having good experiences). Even with the hotel full of conference-goers, there was not noticeable hallway noise so the rooms seem to be reasonably soundproofed. The room itself was comfortable, looked to have been updated and renovated within the last few years, and the hotel overall was always well-kept and clean in the public areas. The convenience of having a Starbucks in the lobby is always nice and there is a great variety of restaurants in the area surrounding the hotel at all different price points, so you can really choose what kind of food you want and how much you want to spend and you shouldn't have a problem at all finding a place that fits your needs. I ate lunch one day in the hotel restaurant and they do a pasta bar lunch special for a reasonable price. Only complaints are minor. Everyone around me commented on the elevator doors - they were barely staying open and then slamming shut. You had to zip in and out of the elevators like The Flash to avoid having them slam shut on you. It was a little strange. Also, the heating/AC unit in my room was doing this thing where it would turn on for only a few minutes, shut off for a few, then back on; rinse, lather, repeat. It was noticeably annoying when I was trying to fall asleep, so I finally just shut it off totally and hoped the temperature would be comfortable and luckily it was. Finally - yet another 4-star place that doesn't have free WiFi in the rooms. WHY???? This is the bane of my traveling existence. It is ridiculous that I have to go sit in the lobby to get my work done when these hotels are catering to a work clientele. The lobby was always filled with people using the free Wifi available there, because who wants to pay $10 a day for what I understand was pretty unreliable service in the rooms?I often find that hotels located in excellent areas tend fall short when it comes to the room and service.  The Hyatt Regency was no exception.  There are many great things that this hotel has to offer, but also many things that can be improved upon.  To start with the good, the Hyatt Regency is located in the middle of downtown Indianapolis.  You are literally a few footsteps away from restaurants, bars, the theater, and shopping.  It is also within walking distance of the zoo.  For those who do not wish to go outside, there are several restaurants located within the hotel as well as a skywalk connecting you directly to the mall.  Even though the room was pleasantly decorated, it could use some updates and fine tuning.  To start, the sink didn't drain the water properly by which I mean didn't drain hardly at all!  I would have to stop the water running several times while washing my hands to make sure that it didn't overflow.  The shower was very spacious, however I don't think I have used a more uncomfortable shower-head in my life.  It was literally painful to take a shower, something the hotel should seriously reconsider.  The bedding also had a very strange smell to it and the walls were paper thin.  It was also disappointing to come back to our room the next day at 4pm to find that house cleaning hadn't stopped by yet ( they didn't come until 5:00pm, which at that point we were getting ready for dinner).  Overall, I do not think this hotel deserves the 4 star rating, it was a solid 3 stars.  On my next trip, I would be more interested to see what other hotels Indianapolis has to offer.My boyfriend and I went to Indianapolis for a weekend to celebrate our 5 year anniversary at a Colts game. Upon arriving, we were really excited about the location of the hotel, and the aesthetics of the hotel were beautiful. When we first pulled up and spoke to the valet, he asked us whether we wanted overnight parking or hourly. I was unsure of what we wanted to do parking-wise at this point so I said let's just do hourly. The valet told me there was no point in doing hourly and basically bullied me into choosing the overnight parking, which was $40! When we went to check in, the woman at the desk was not welcoming or friendly whatsoever. She also had informed us that they ""ran out of king sized beds"" and only had rooms left with a double bed. I was initially thrown off by this, but I figured one of the beds would be big enough for us to sleep in, or worst case scenario we could push them together to make a larger bed. However, we got to the room and came to find two very small beds that were unable to be moved to push together. So, we went back downstairs and informed them that this was not going to work out, and that I had booked our room 3 months in advance so there should be no reason to not get the room we paid for. All they could offer us was free breakfast, which was almost an insult after paying as much as we did for a room that we did not get. It seemed like they were treating us poorly because we booked our trip at a discounted price through Priceline, which they continuously brought up. I did not think that would have affected the service I received. Finally, we just asked for a refund because we were able to find a more accommodating hotel a few blocks down, and they informed us that it would take 7-10 business days to process, which I was fine with. 13 business days later, I called to ask where my refund is, and they have given me multiple problems, stating that their records show that I checked out at the end of the weekend rather than the 20 minutes that I actually stayed there. I will absolutely not be going back to the Hyatt Regency Indianapolis, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable customer service experience.This place is amazing! Absolutely beautiful  and treats their guests with a high level of respect. The only things is the parking fee is $24 to self park and $35 for vallet per day and breakfast isn't included. Other than that it comes with a mini fridge and GREAT INTERNET SERVICE FOR FREE. :) I stayed in the king bedroom facing the city :)The room was great staff was great BUT BEWARE the bar staff added tips to my room without me giving permission ,me and my friend stayed there for a Colts game and after we were having a few and toward the end of the nite he asked to c my room key to make sure we were staying their to serve us another one and apon check out he added a nice tip for himself after we took care of him the nite of, did not say anything I just won't stay their again so don't show key......Timing is everything. I came in the midst of what must be a major overhaul (October 2012) and you can tell. Sorry, but no business as usual, though I appreciate the attempt. I prefer to blame all that is wrong on the construction rather than to believe that those loud noises that I can hear from my room are normal and to be expected during every stay. There was no space for the taxi to truly pull over to as I got out of the car, luckily there were no cars waiting behind us. One thing that seems to be the case regardless of the construction status is the hotel's adjacency to an office building. I mean you step out of your room and literally see people at their desks. I guess it would be convenient if you were in town to visit one of those offices, but awkward otherwise. The good: proximity to the stadium, the convention center, downtown, direct access to the skyway, a pretty nice restaurant on the top floor and low cost fast food options on the main floors. I'm a fan, but. Definitely want to hold off on a return visit until the construction is done.nice and comfortable. It was a little pricey 170.00 per night and no breakfast so that's a draw back. All in all a decent hotel Great Location.","This a great hotel on the heart of Indianapolis and has all of the great staff and amenities that one would expect in a $200 room but the standard WiFi is so bad that I never connected to a single website regardless of how long I waited.  Why can I get free high speed internet in every Mom and Pop and lesser chain but not here?  It casts a poor image upon a potentially great hotel experience.A solid choice for a downtown Indianapolis hotel. We stayed here for three nights as guests/participants in a wedding held nearby.Parking: Kind of pricy. I guess you have to suck it up and pay, though, or find an overnight lot a few blocks away and walk. Such is downtown parking. The garage is under the building, you go through the valet/registration area and make a sharp turn into it. Location: A block off Monument Circle. Connected to Circle Center mall and other downtown locations via skywalks and the ArtsGarden. Theaters, shopping, tons of restaurants and bars all nearby. Parks and museums close too.Rooms: Recently renovated (for the Superbowl I guess?) and super-clean, modern, sleek. We had a king room with a view of a nearby plaza and other buildings. The showerhead was great, the bed big and comfy, nice clean decor. Coffeemaker also has a few tea bags; mini fridge is a nice touch too. However: We could not seem to get quite comfortable temperature-wise at night, the AC wasn't working terribly well and we were just a little too warm. Other amenities: It's $9.95 a day for Hyatt wifi. Blows my mind. I hate when big fancy hotels charge for wifi -- something you can get for free at any budget motel. There is free state-supported wifi you can connect to in the lobby but be warned -- it is slow as molasses outside in an Indiana winter. AOL dial-up level slow. Try the Panera across the street.Starbucks, pizza place and gyro place in the lobby; other restaurants and room service available. 24-hour fitness center; pool available till 10.All in all a good place to spend a few days, although I wish he AC/fan had been working a little better.Got a smoking deal naming our own price on Priceline, so I can't complain TOO much.  We did have a big issue where we were charged $10 for a long-distance call that we didn't make.  I had called a local number, so I paid for the charge thinking it was just hotel-ridiculous fees, but when we looked at the numbers, one of them was a Nebraska area code.  Management reversed the charges, but they didn't credit MY card, they credited my friend's card (he had booked the reservation) so he had to send me a check... ugh, just way more hassle than it needed to be.Parking is pricey as expected (I think $22 overnight) and wifi is not free (although I'm paying twice what I'd pay for a motel with free wifi, of course).  I would only stay here again if I got another great Priceline deal.The Hyatt is a beautiful property located in downtown Indianapolis a block from Lucas Oil Stadium. The hotel is relatively easy to get to and has an easy entry for registration/valet. (Don't forget that NOT included in your room rate is parking- Valet is ~$30 while self park is ~$23). The inside of the hotel is beautiful with massive water features and 4 LED lit glass elevators spanning floor to ceiling. It has a Starbucks and Subway in addition a bar/restaurant (which I didn't visit).You really can't beat the location if needing to stay downtown. It's near the stadium, restaurants/bars, shopping and a movie theater. The rooms are modern with interesting layouts given the building's unique structure. Didn't have a problem with the beds or rooms themselves. They aren't the largest rooms in the world but don't forget you're staying downtown so didn't surprise me much. I'd stay down here again. The rate was a bit steep but you pay for location/convenience and it definitely served its purpose in that area.Great:-The price. $99 on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>!-The staff. Very friendly and helpful. -The rooms. Very stylish, comfortable and roomy. The bed was heavenly and the shower would have fit five people in it, should that situation ever arise for anyone.-The location. As others have mentioned, it's in very close proximity to a lot of popular Indianapolis attractions, restaurants and clubs. We were there for a dinner at Harry &amp; Izzy's and it was right around the corner.-The Starbucks in the lobby.Not so great:-The seemingly endless waiting for the elevators. What's up with closing off two for the Eagle's Nest traffic at 3:00 in the afternoon? We ended up tracking down the sketchy stairwell and hoofing it up to the 7th floor.-The parking garage. We wanted to save ourselves $8 and park our car ourselves (as opposed to letting the valet do it)... maybe not the smartest move. We drove ourselves into dead ends a couple times. This is seriously the tiniest, most crowded, most confusing parking garage I've ever seen. However, a lot of the reserved spots are only for Monday through Friday, so if you're there on the weekend, you can park in them with no problem.Still, the good definitely outweighs the bad here. I plan on making all of our downtown Indianapolis stays at the Hyatt.Stayed here for a conference and had a great time.  The conference staff was extremely attentive and the breakfast offerings were quite tasty.  The lunch offerings were uninspired. The bar staff was also very attentive, and one of our group had to wait a few extra minutes for a drink order - the server thought it was too long and comped the drink. Had lunch one day at the restaurant and very much enjoyed the salmon dish.  The hotel room was comfortable and well appointed.  Had a nice view of the IRT.  My only beef about the room was the motion activated footlights.  There really needs to be an off switch for those!  I had to prop pillows in front of them to ensure the room stayed dark all night.  As with all conference hotels, valet parking and internet access were ridiculously expensive.  This hotel is in a great location in downtown Indy and a short walk to great eateries and attractions.  If you need to stay in downtown, I think this is a spot to consider.I have gotten some great deals at this hotel on Priceline.  And even though the staff can see my cheapo reservation at check-in, they have treated me like any other customer.  The service here is excellent.The rooms are nicely updated, and the beds are comfy.  And I have to admit, riding the glass elevator is quite fun.After an awful day of getting the run around from other hotels this hotel went above and beyond! Amber was absolutely AMAZING!!!  She made accommodations  that made us feel so at home ... Made an awful day into a wonderful evening! Truly a great experience just to interact with her!!!! Hyatt made such a great move in hiring her!!!!I'll start off by saying that this place is definitely pricey but totally worth it.  I still can't believe they charge for Internet, but you can get a free signal in the lobby (or if your room is close to the lobby).  My room was super nice and had a view overlooking the Capitol.  The bed was huge, nice and comfy and there were tons of extra pillows in the closet.  The bathroom was large and the shower warmed up almost immediately.  Refrigerator and storage space for your convenience (and it was since I brought veggies and water!).The conference space was really nice and there was a lot of room for all of the meetings, booths, etc.  Tons of restaurants in the lobby (since it's connected to the pedway for the Conference Center), a Starbucks and a bar that's open pretty late.  Totally convenient and some pretty decent beer on tap.  Valet with in/out privileges was about $20 per night, which was pretty reasonable (compared with other large cities in the midwest).This hotel is located right in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, as well, so there's tons of stuff to do nearby.  I enjoyed the proximity to nightlife including restaurants, bars and theaters.  The Capitol is right across the street, so visit at your leisure! I'd definitely consider a stay here again if I find myself in Indianapolis in the future.UPDATE on 11/29/12: We've finally finished the painful process of ridding our apartment of the bed bugs I brought back from the Hyatt and having an inspection to confirm the bugs are gone.  I sent Jeff at the Hyatt a list of my expenses along with receipts (~$750) and the Hyatt sent a check for that amount.  They also gave me 16k Hyatt points, which is enough for a night or two at a Hyatt.  I've updated my review to 5 stars because I liked the hotel and because I think they went above and beyond by paying for my bed bug-related expenses and also giving me Hyatt points.--------UPDATE on 10/1/12: Just received a call from Jeff, the director of rooms.  He acknowledged that they found evidence of bed bugs in my room and was very apologetic.  He claims that the Hyatt will reimburse me for any expenses that this has led to.  He even mentioned that I might get a free night at a Hyatt hotel out of this.  I'll provide updates as things proceed.Jeff also mentioned that they are of course getting rid of the bugs in room 535 and that they have a preventative program that they use to avoid these types of situations.  Apparently the last time they had bugs at this hotel was 2 years ago, so I don't think this is a common issue.---------I stayed in room 535 for four nights in September 2012 for a conference.  I'm giving a 1-star review because it is very likely that there were bed bugs in my room.  These bugs caused me a lot of pain and now it seems they are in my apartment!Two days after I returned, I broke out with a bunch (~50) of very itchy spots sort of like a reaction to poison ivy but not quite the same.  I never have experienced anything quite like these bites before.  Two doctors have told me these were caused by bug bites of some kind.  Probably bed bugs but impossible to say for sure just from the bites.  I thought maybe I was bitten after I returned from the trip, but I was never bitten by anything like this before this trip.  In 10 days since my return, I have not experienced any new bites (nor has anyone else in my apartment).  Apparently bed bugs don't feed every night and it can take several days for one to have a reaction to the bites, so my reaction could have been to bites I experienced while at the hotel.I hired a dog trained to find bed bugs to check my apartment.  It checked my apartment about a week after I returned from this hotel.  The dog alerted that it smelled bugs when he smelled the bag I brought to this hotel, as well as in my closet where I put back some clothes from the trip and also by my bed.  I have not seen any bed bugs or evidence of bed bugs in my bag or anywhere in my apartment yet, but supposedly these dogs are fairly reliable (the company I used is called CemexTek out of San Jose, CA if you want to see their yelp reviews).I won't get into the details here, but getting rid of bed bugs is very difficult and expensive.  I'm working with an exterminator to hopefully nip this in the bud, but I could be in for a long battle with bed bugs.While of course it is not certain that I encountered bed bugs at this hotel, I think it is the simplest and most straightforward explanation to the evidence I have.  Check your room for bugs before going in and unpacking, or stay somewhere else!I alerted the hotel to this issue, and they said that ""due to the complexity of the issues you have described, I have forwarded your concerns to the executive management of this hotel for further research and follow-up.""  I plan on updating my review to document any further response.I can't speak to the hotel rooms, but the building itself it ok.  You can buy a monthly fitness center pass, and the facilities are very clean, if small.The pizza restaurant and Subway are reasonably priced.  The service and Charlie and Barney's is great, but they keep raising their prices.  The interior and exterior of the hotel are clean and the exterior after the remodel is very pretty. I would like to see security actually enforce the no smoking by the doors rule.Clean, comfortable rooms. Convenient with access to skywalk. Front desk staff were helpful and friendlySo I am a Platinum member with the Hyatt and my domestic partner of 15 years decided that we would get married this weekend. So I called the hotel and booked a room with my points. I called and spoke to Sam from the Front Desk and told him of the occasion and he put us in a very nice executive room on the 9th floor. We could not have been happier with the room. It is about the size of 3 normal hotel rooms. The shower was really nice. I could have stayed in there all day. The view from our room was really nice. Our room overlooked the Indiana Repertory Theater. Parking is either valet for like $35 or self parking for $24. That would be my only complaint, as a platinum member I felt that should have been complimentary. So back to Sam, he was so welcoming and very professional and even allowed for us an early check in. I asked if it would be possible for us to exchange vows and be married in their lovely roof top Eagle's Nest Restaurant and he put me in touch with Tasha who allowed for us to do so and that we will never forget. It was a wonderful evening and could not have asked for anything better. Renee was our server up there and she did a wonderful job helping us make a wonderful life long memory. We got back to our room and had a pleasant surprise from the front desk staff. There was a bottle of wine and Chocolate covered Strawberries on our table. That was so thoughtful and unexpected. They definitely went above and beyond what was required for us and was something we will not soon forget. This is such a beautiful hotel and I highly recommend it. It is close to everything. It has a sky bridge where you can walk right over to the nice Circle Centre Mall which has tons of shops, restaurants and theaters. We had lunch at PF Changs today which is inside the Mall. Also after our lovely dinner and wedding we walked 2 blocks over to the Symphony which I highly recommend. Things to do in this area is endless. There are several restaurants in the hotel here as well including a Subway and a pizza/italian place. We are locals here in Indy but if you are coming in from out of town make sure that you book your room at the Hyatt Regency!! You will be glad you did. I would be very cautious about any negative review of this hotel. I am well traveled and am on the road often and I can tell you this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in.I stayed here this week and had a very pleasant stay.  They have completely renovated the hotel rooms and they are very nice.  They are still in the midst of some construction at the front entrance which is somewhat annoying, but it truly didn't take away from the experience.  The Regency Club was great - amazing view of the capital, friendly staff and great selection of food and drink.  If ever I am back in Indy, I will stay here again!I always want to love Hyatt's, but this stay wasn't quite up to par. While the room was clean and I do appreciate the Tazo tea in room, there were a couple of problems. First, the outlets on the desk/credenza were not functioning. Like not connected. I called Guest Services and they had someone from engineering come plug them in, so that was great and they did resolve the issue quickly. Next, the hotel had a large convention hosting meetings (I believe it was the Knights of Columbus) and the elevators were not equipped to handle the additional traffic. I'm a patient person but I waited for the elevator for 10+ minutes on several occasions and then was stuffed into a service car with many other people - in July...in Indianapolis... it was hot and muggy. You get the picture. If there was an option, I would have walked the 7 flights of stairs up to my room. It was that unpleasant. At any rate, a good value and as I mentioned, the room was clean. I may give this place another shot in the future.Staying for a conference. Parking is over the top in price. In general, it appears fairly well kept,  but it's the details that make a place.  Checking in, the bedding was still all feathers; there was a very nasty deposit of something on the glass of a picture.  There was a house keeping staff close by who I asked to clean it,  and I was told that it wasn't her room, and I would need to report this to the front desk. I also found nail clippings on the carpet and bedside stand.  I informed the front desk in the a.m., but there was no resolution.Our initial room had a super noisy AC unit that clicked and whistled. At first they refused to move us and were pretty rude about it but after continued discussions they eventually moved us to a normal room.Next was the worst part, the valet said to pay him for self park and he would put it to our account. I paid him and we parked the car. When we left there was no record of the payment. The Valet Manager and Front Desk mangers both were defensive, combative and offered no refund. I've stayed at hotels around the world and of course including some Hyatts and I've never run into a problem were the managerial staff was so rude and unwilling to even try and be helpful. On top of that they basically right off the bat accused me of lying about the whole thing. It was nuts!I was not crazy angry or anything when I approached them, it even took me a second to realize that this was not just a discussion but an actual aggressive confrontation. I was just not expecting that the managers to come off so accusatory and combative.Terrible customer service by any standard, we won't ever be back which is no loss to us because Indy has many good hotels right downtown.Have stayed here a number of times over the years. They seem to have remodeled the rooms. Everything was very nice. There's a Starbucks and a Subway in the building, wonderful when you want a snack of a fancy coffee and don't want to go outside. Nice fitness center. The building is now connected to the Arts Garden, which means, if the weather sucks outside, you can walk over to the Circle Centre Mall or the Weber Grill without even going outside.For being one of the ritzier hotels in town, I would expect a little more. For the 3 days I was here, two out of the seven elevators were functioning make me spend a large part of my Indianapolis existence in front a red button staring at a wall. Extra charges for WiFi is a thing of the past - especially if all the budget hotels are giving it for free. No problems with the house-keeping or checking in/out (which I did using their e-kiosk, also signing up for Gold Passport -which you should too if you're staying at Hyatts). Room service was solid, but it should be if you pay $50 for 2 sandwiches, a martini and a bottle of domestic beer. One yelper mentioned the free yoga videos in  on demand TV which is very cool, making this Hyatt a 3.5Location, location, location! This Hyatt definitely has it. There are other hotels in the area too, but this one is great! I stayed here for a conference, so I also had the experience of being in the ballroom and several meeting rooms. My first impression was from finding how to check in from driving in. I pulled into the driveway and the valet told me to park in the garage under the building. It was the weirdest layout of any parking garage I've ever seen - like a maze with haphazard spots everywhere. It was a little confusing to navigate, but I got a spot close to the elevators with ease, once I found them! When I checked in, there was a person helping direct people to open front desk employees. The employee who helped me was very nice and honored my request to have a room without an adjoining door - I'm a light sleeper and those doors always make you hear the person next to you! I got a room that was down a hall, away from the elevators and the atrium. When I walked in, the set up was a little different than other Hyatts I've been to but it was nice! Big bed, desk, chair, TV, and decent sized bathroom. Maybe a little smaller than a normal Hyatt but still roomy enough. I was also pleasantly surprised to find a mini fridge in my room. My room was really quiet and I slept so well! I brought my white noise maker because I always sleep with it. I heard some traffic from outside but not much. What do you expect - you want to stay downtown, you are going to hear it. The meeting rooms were nice and the employees kept them clean and well stocked with water, paper and pens (and without trash) in between meetings. The ballroom was nice and the temperature was good there. Some rooms got a little hot or cold but it happens. I love that they had a pizza place, Subway, and Starbucks in the lobby, as well as a bar and restaurant. Very convenient for someone on a tight schedule. They also have a large gift shop with all sorts of stuff - except of course, what I needed! No stamps, and no books or magazines. Bummer on that. The skywalk to Circle Centre Mall was so awesome - it was really quick and easy to go shop or eat there. There are also a huge amount of eateries within close walking distance.I arrived at 4:30pm on Thursday and left at 5:30pm on Saturday. When I left the parking garage, I paid $50 (!!!!!!!!) for the privilege of parking there. Holy crap! That is awful- DO NOT drive here if you can help it! Wifi is also super expensive - I used my smartphone instead of laptop. There are several area businesses that offer it for free though, so go to Steak n' Shake or somewhere else for free wifi.Other than the parking thing, I would highly recommend this Hyatt!","Connected to the Indy Convention Center is a huge plus!I booked my room and they gave me the 20th floor on the top! Gorgeous view!I actually booked a room with two double-beds and they gave me a king-sized so they brought a rollaway for free.Small swimming pool and jacuzzi, but decent sized weight and exercise room.Came with a complimentary buffet breakfast!Very good and helpful service.Everything looked so modern and a nice waterfall in the lobby. The lounge downstairs is great too!Went here for a conference, cant complain. Nice bed, quiet room, good staff. Having an office building in your hotel is a little weird though...nice place, clean, fantastic staff. read the other reviews, they are spot on. I only give 3 stars because for the price I expect Nice and CLEAN.My room was ballin' and overlooked the theatre across the street. Everything was modern, well kept, and overall extremely nice. This is the perfect place to come if you want to pretend to be a pretentious asshole for a day. Or if you actually are one.Friendly staff and excellent location to the convention center and a bunch of restaurants downtown. Starbucks conveniently inside the lobby. The lobby has an artsy fartsy feel and there were a lot more people just hanging around doing the internet cafe thing moreso than other hotels I've stayed at. The 24 hour fitness center is also nicer than the one I have in my own town and overlooks the sidewalk, so there's decent people watching while you're on the treadmill.My only complaints would be in regard to ""environmental friendliness"" and parking. Although they advertise they're ""environmentally friendly"" and encourage you to reuse your towels and not have your linens changed, they changed mine daily the entire duration I was there despite the fact that I hung up my towels and did not request linen changes. Also, be prepared to sacrifice your first born in order to pay for parking. $22 a day. Sonofagun.The photo's of this place (I assume posted by the Hyatt) are ridiculous. My room didn't come close to looking as halfway as amazing as their photos depict BUT my view was AMAZINGOnly problem I had was some a-hole security guard at the main entrance harassing me about wether I was actually staying at the hotel. This was even after I showed him my key card. He kept at it though requesting my name and room number...Would I stay here again??? NOPE I fly in this friday and have reservations at the WestinI have really mixed feelings about this place.  First of all, I was traveling in a group for work, so I really did not choose to stay here.  I prefer boutique hotels if I want to spend some $.  We stayed here because they contracted to give us a lower rate as part of a national high school competition.  I am just going to do a pro and con list to keep it clear.  Here goes:PRO*Friendly and helpful staff, including housekeeping*Incredible view from my room!*Convenient location. . .we could walk nearly everywhere*Great restaurants nearby (I will create a list in a day or two)*A/C unit with fan I can run constantly for white noise*Hardly any outside noise due to open/atrium design.  *Valets super helpful with parking issues*Starbucks, Subway, pizza place, fancy place, and bar located in lobby*Quality linens and comfy bed. I slept like a big baby, which rarely happens when away from home*Spacious bathroom*Fridge and safe*Great fitness center!  Four nice treadmills, three bikes, two elipticals, and several weight machines.  Treadmills look out over downtown.  Also an indoor pool and hot tub, but I didn't use those.CON*Room not ready when I checked in at 6 pm??  Walked in and whomever had been there the night before definitely had a party!  They moved me up one floor, which separated me from my group :(*Laminate strip on front of dresser was halfway off and flapping in the breeze, so I ran into it no fewer than four times, hard. *No hot water!!  Shower water never got beyond lukewarm, if that much.  This made me angry.  Yes, it did.  I want a hot shower, especially when I am paying a lot of $ for comfort.*Housekeeping did not refill toilet paper for two days, and it was obvious two of us were in this room.  Finally had to call the desk.  *Housekeeping randomly distributed towels.  One day we had a bath mat and no hand towels.  The next day, vice versa.  One day our bath towels were not replaced, but the next day they were.  ???*Hairdryer did not work.  I called desk.  Took 20 minutes to bring one up.  This really cramped my style when I was on a tight schedule for work.  *Finally, one of my coworkers had to reserve our rooms on his debit card.  His card was to HOLD the rooms.  This is how all school districts do it.  Then, when we check in, we give the hotel a check for the exact amount.  Well, the Hyatt actually charged the card an ungodly amount (4 rooms for six days. . .not cheap) and this resulted in major overdraft charges for my coworker.  Three days in a row, we went to management, as they kept claiming they were reversing the charges, but the reversals never showed up.  Would I choose to stay here again?  No way!  Many of our colleagues stayed at the Marriott down the street and raved about it.  This Hyatt let me down.  The dealbreaker was charging the card and not fixing the problem.Very cold (in terms of ambiance) - room was fair- ridiculous parking fees, not really a green hotel and ridiculous restaurant prices for breakfast.  This hotel is just and only focused to corporate travelers, not those of us that are here in town and happy to be with our family.  Staff is nice and rooms are clean, but it is way to corporate for us.  Will not return.The rooms were comfortable, clean and the place was quiet which surprised me because I was there just yesterday and the whole city is a mad house with Super Bowl 46 just around the corner. The hotel has numerous restaurants, coffee shops and bars.  They also have a very nice, clean exercise facility with pool and hot tub.  The breakfast buffet is excellent and even though it was chaotic, the staff was pretty good considering they had a full house and masses of people to deal with.  The hotel is also centrally located.  Great restaurants and shops all within walking distance.  The hotel lobby is also very, trendy and comfortable.  If you're a people watcher like I am, it's great to grab a beer and hang out in the lobby watching people and/or the numerous big screen TV's.  Some negatives I've read from other Yelper's:  Wi Fi is not free and parking is expensive.  The company I work for pays for the Wi Fi, hotel and we don't have to deal with the parking issue; So based on my experience, I give this place four stars but I certainly can relate to Alison B. and Kristi M's review...maybe three stars would be more appropriate.I travel to this hotel several times a year for business.  It's spacious, clean, contemporary, but it's also a bit drab... kind of like a rainy day.  I always feel like I need light therapy after staying there.  That said, service -- bellmen, front desk, etc. -- is above average and they accommodate meetings very well.  Great location close to Circle Center.My group hosted their annual convention here just recently and we were fully accommodated and very pleased with the overall service.The rooms were great and you can get a microwave upon request, which is basically the only amenity not already in room.My only grievance is that everything is much more expensive as it is a full service hotel especially the parking. If you're going to be at the hotel for more than a night or two (especially for an event) You're most inexpensive option is actually going to be to valet your car for $30 for the whole event.There is a Starbucks conveniently in lobby for the early risers. They open at 6am every day and close at 4pm M-F and noon on S/S, too early!Overall I had really enjoyed my experience!This place was renovated for superbowl and it is great. Very clean hotel &amp; rooms. Contemporary design throughout the place and in the rooms. Room service is great, staff is friendly. Excellect price for the part of town you get to stay in. Finally, they have the softest towels ever and that makes or breaks a hotel..... doesn't it?Location is good, building is nice, rooms are Hyatt quality. HOWEVER, the Internet connection is no where near Hyatt quality!  I stayed here 4 nights, not only they charge 9.95 for one day Internet or 39.99 for 5 days.  But the connection is worse than 16k modem. How could Hyatt failed so miserably in this aspect. I called front desk, they forwarded me to the technical help desk which doesn't help at all.I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a weekend in Indy and to go to the Pacers/Heat playoff game. This hotel is great! It is right downtown in the middle of everything. Only a short walk to most popular destinations. Nothing seemed to be more than 3 blocks away. Staff was very welcoming and accommodating. I had breakfast at the One South Restaurant and though a little pricey, the food was very good. Also, had a few drinks at Level One bar, which is a great place to pregame or have a few more after dinner. I will definitely be making this my place to stay when I visit Indy in the future.Renovation turned out very nicely. My room was spacious and well appointed with convenient rolling desk which can be maneuvered to your liking for working, playing online while watching TV or enjoying room service for breakfast. There was a mini fridge in my room, always worth a half of a star for me as I don't like to eat every meal out when traveling and I appreciate being able to enjoy some yogurt, fruit or cheese plus cold water/ soda whenever I like. What removed a half of a star is that WiFi is NOT free, in fact it is $9.95 for 24 hours, even for Hyatt Club members. Get with the program please! That is an unacceptable surcharge these days. Valet parking is also expensive, close to $30/ day as I recall, but really the best option for the hotel. The valets were willing to help, but didn't always do a great job of ensuring that the ony exit from hotel (which also serves as the driveway for valet) remained clear so you could leave as soon as your car was brought around. Best aspect of hotel is the location: smack in the heart of downtown and close walking distance to everything from a plethora of restaurants to the sports venues and bars and shopping.Overall, a very appealing business travel hotel and I would stay here again if the price was right, but I will need to take in to account all of the surcharges which nudge up the bill quickly.I recently stayed here while attending a conference for work. I really enjoyed my stay. Staff was super helpful, and the amenities were great. It's also very cool that you can walk all the way to Lucas Oil Stadium and not have to take a step outside. It's a bit of a trek, but the fact that I didn't even have to put on my coat and get snowed on was pretty awesome. I'd recommend staying here to anyone visiting Indianapolis.It takes a lot to get me to write a negative review.  Alas, Hyatt Regency Indianapolis has royally failed in so many ways then I feel compelled to write my first negative review.  I will never every stay at this hotel again.  In fact, unless absolutely necessary, I will never every stay at a Hyatt.Here's my story.  I reached the hotel at around 1am (after 8 hours of travel and a long night before -- work emails you know... you gotta get them done).  I show up at the reception and nobody is there.  I pressed the bell hoping that someone would show up.  I pressed the bell again hoping that someone would show up.  I waited.  After five minutes someone emerged from an invisible door.  Ok, no biggie.  Well, the person proceeded to politely welcome me, which was nice, and then promptly told me that the hotel's computer system was down.  It took ten minutes to look up my reservation.  Up to this point, it's all good.  Because the system is down, a security guard escorts me to my room.  We get into the elevator and go to my room.  The room smells like a sewer.  Not good.  We go down all the way and try to find me another room.  We spend ten more minutes looking for rooms and this time we find me a room which doesn't smell like a sewer.After all the song and dance, and the travelling I was very hungry but alas there is no room service.  There is no food in the room either.Also, the receptionist promised me a free breakfast and free wi-fi.  There was no free breakfast the next day.  And yes, there was no wi-fi in my room either.  I switch on the TV, and guess what, the TV wasn't working -- it's showed me the Windows loading screen -- reminded me of the good old Windows 95 days.  I guess scrolling text is also fun to watch.  By the way, I'm writing this by tethering from my phone.I was exhausted and hit the sack empty stomach.  I wake up the next stay and rush to work.  It's a long day with back to back meetings and lots of emails between back to back meetings.Looking forward to catch my breath, I get back into my room and almost trip over the iron table -- the iron table which I took out in the morning was exactly where I had left it in the morning.  I was a little surprised, but no biggie, these things happen.  No Sir, my bed was also not made up properly.  I was rather amused by this and decided to call the operator.  I was going to complain but I figured what's the point.  Let me just set up a wake up call and get on with life.  I have enough emails and enough work as is.About five minutes ago I hit '0' hoping that the operator would pick up so that I could set up a wake up call.  Nobody picked up.  I tried again, nobody picked up.  Everything I have written up this point I wrote while a phone somewhere was ringing waiting for some operator to pick up.  And... the phone just stopped ringing... but not because someone picked up.  I guess the phone gave up, and I'm about to give up as well...on Hyatt.Absolutely terrible hotel.  Never ever will I stay here again.  On a positive note, I must say, the lobby is well designed and I like what they have done with the lights around the elevators.  Sadly, that's not worth much at this stage.I was disappointed with m room after hearing all of the good things about the recent renovations. Our bathroom was dirty, the tub had lots of hair in it. The comforter was turned the wrong way and I realized that when the tag was in my face in the middle of the night. There was no actual cover on the comforter, it was laying between two flat sheets, so it was sliding around the whole time. Our room smelled a somewhat smokey despite the fact that I was under the impression we were in a non-smoking room. The overall value for the money was not great and I think the only ""renovating"" was replacing the carpets and changing out the paint color. The staff was very nice during our brief interactions. Bottom line: I would expect a cleaner, more impressive hotel for the price point.@HyattConcierge @HyattIndy All shower curtains in this hotel are 6-8"" too long so they lay in tub. #Sanitary violation in any city. They don't change shower curtains between guests. Ugh.Nice TV's but all channels are analogue. So you have a bigger TV but 2001 signal. Sure miss the crisp digital channels available elsewhere.Nice hotel, good staff, but stupid things like this need to be challenged by any guest. The maids all know the problem, but the mgnt won't do anything about it.Really had a wonderful stay here.  Really nice venue, close to anything you would want.  The nicest restaurants, shopping, and football all right around the corner.  It was under construction during my stay here, but after being at the Hyatt Place in Raleigh the week before it was honestly refreshing.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay at this location again next time i'm in town on business.One of the nicer hotels in downtown Indianapolis. Beautifully decorated and modern art. Very spacious and uncrowded. The hotel has Starbucks, subway, and sit down dining. Attended a dental convention here and it was quite nice.","I was impressed.  I usually stay at Hilton's or other places, and I can't remember the last time I stayed at a Hyatt.   The bed is super comfortable.  The staff is amazingly kind and attentive.   Not sure if my watch was right...was the bar in Eagle's nest really closing early?  They are supposed to be open until 11.  Maybe my clock was still on CST.   Pool is small, and glad they have a lift for ADA needs.  The gym is modern and the equipment is very nice.  Valet parking is $30.  They should offer other options to those with handicap placards to save on the $30 daily rate.  Overall an excellent experience.I stayed here during gen con and they were just as courteous to us con attendees as you would expect them to be to anyone else.I'm with the rest of you guys on the wifi.  Who charges for that anymore?   Also the TV charged to stream music which was a bit obnoxious.  I did like that the alarm clock was an ipod dock as well, my sister plugged her iphone in and while she was in the room at least we had some tunes.Our beds were twin not queen which was odd so I don't think we'll stay here next year.  I love my husband but that was a squeeze.The keyed entry door for afterhours on the skybridge was really really wonky.  It wouldn't work if you were next to it, it wouldn't work if someone was coming from the otherside at the same time you got within sensor range it really was quite a pain. The hot tub and pool were having problems and wern't as warm as I would of liked plus they close at ten which is wayy to early.  The pool boy was pretty polite when he came to check on it and fix it so it probably wasn't a problem for long.We started off on the wrong foot.  I found out that (a) they charge nearly $10 a day for their wifi hookups to the room and (b) the hotel pool was outta commission.  Double bogus there.But this place slowly redeemed itself.  A corner room with two comfy chairs and a king-sized bed with all the pillows a gal could want was a good start.  Oh, and free yoga on demand on the TVs.  Not gonna lie, I did downward dog my way awake one morning thanks to that little feature.  The gym was very nice.  Four treadmills, two elliptical machines, a few bikes and weight machines and a set of free weights made it a totally acceptable place to work out.  Free towels, headphones and chilled towels for post-workout cool-down were a nice touch as well.  Oh, and if you were really jonesing for a swim, you could head over to a nearby hotel to get your fix.  Unfortunately, I did not get to partake in hotel hot tubbing during my stay.  I did look at the pool set-up while it was under construction and it looked very nice.A bar in the lobby, a restaurant on the first floor (and adjoining mall type of food services a la Subway and Starbucks) made it convenient to get a bite, a drink or whatever.  The Eagles Nest on the 20th Floor was very lovely as well.  I didn't get to eat there, but the server graciously accepted our raucous party and served us expediently.I'd stay here again if ever in the Indy area.  Close to downtown and a whole host of restaurants (there are some non-chains close by, you just have to do a bit of searching), the hotel has a great location for all the sights in downtown Indianapolis, including the fabulous government center, which was my sight to see.  Kidding.  Not about it being my sight to see, but about it being fabulous.  You get it.My little bonus tip to you...if you're flying into Indy and staying downtown (at the Hyatt or wherever), there is a bus service called the green line.  For $7 charge, you can get dropped off right in front of your hotel.  Better than spending $50 for a taxi...just sayin'.The group I was traveling with had to stay an extra night in Indianapolis. The Hyatt lowered prices due to ice storm and deadly cold definitely a way cool thing to do with life threatening conditions. They also had helped us park our handicapped van even with there lot being full. They when out of there way to help our group find handicapped accommodations on last minute request.  We stay at many hotels so giving them above average. We did not like how small the room was and the buffet needed a little more for it to be the price it was.  Nevertheless their staff saved them from a lower rating.  I would stay there again.Website stated that rooms were recently updated - ugh! No!!  They will be updated in July 2011 according to the front desk clerk.  Big Disappointment!  Anyhow, room on the 15th floor was musty and linens were VERY WORN.  Not to mention the dingey carpeting.  Sheets were thread-bare and fuzz-balled!  Ooh!  Went back to front desk and asked for a cleaner, more well-put together room.  Got a room on 20th floor-smelled cleaner, sheets were crisp.  One small problem...toilet smelled badly of urine.  Upon further inspection, I discovered dried urine pooled on the base of the toilet!  Ooh!Mentioned cleanliness issue to clerk upon check out.  He was very apologetic, and offered to add reward points to my account.  I accepted-what else could I do at this point, right??!!  I have been a dedicated Marriott customer in the past.  I think I'll go back to staying with the chain that knows excellent service, while providing great service with super value for the price.  Bye, bye Hyatt - please take a few lessons from Marriott!!Awesome, fun, and romantic. I've been there on two separate occasions with my wife and was never disappointed. I was also just there for a conference, and was surprised by the caliber of the open breakfast buffet. Also, kudos to the lobby bar for having Upland Dragonfly IPA on tap. I tip my hat to you, sir.I am sorry to say this but WARNING: DO NOT STAY here! Dirty hotel &amp; unprofessional management &amp; staff.  Faucets in rooms creak so you wake up when your next door neighbor takes a shower. NO windows!  I travel a lot but will NEVER try a Hyatt again!Was here on business need that was cool temperature wise and no noise. Room rate was good Arrived late, did not want room service and need a quick bite and a beer. The Level One bar was still open .The service was good and the bar tender made a few suggestions for food that hit the spot.Awesome place. We were on the 11th floor, and we had great views of the city. Valet parking super expensive.priceline this stuff baby. for 1/5 the list cost of the room, i had a great stay. room was clean (save note below...), gave me a high floor, valet parking was steep-ish at 28 (get your car out before 2pm next day, with in/out priv's) but on par with any metropolitan city center hotel that's not one of the big 5, fitness center was nice and airy and looked out on the street, atrium that was connected with the office space next door was an interesting touch.bed was comfortable, very close to tons of things downtown including dozens of restaurants and places to explore. i requested nonsmoking and they said there's only a total of 6 (or 8?) smoking rooms anyway (for you smokers out there).there was one major cleanliness issue though. a.k.a. don't shower with the bathroom door open, such that it fogs up the window in the bedroom, showing the stigmata of an uncleaned, previously-used-for-sex window (read: hand prints in the top corners, long hair/head-prints being rubbed side to side in the middle, and roundish spread of unfogged area towards the bottom = gross, but i wasn't rubbing myself on any windows so i just stayed away from that area)overall pretty good deal. those small charges rack up - but it's better than staying way out of town at a crappy motel for a similar base cost. i'm okay paying a (very small) premium for some nicer amenities.Don't stay here if you want to sleep. The renovations going on are ""24 hour"", and they do mean it. I'm writing this at 5am after a sleepless night. Constant construction noise consisting of both massive street noise (I'm on the 10th floor!) and noise from above and both sides of my room has gone on without interruption since 2:45am.  Three calls to the front desk produced no results, and in the 3rd call the person tried to tell me that there could't be noise, according to the contractor.  I politely invited them up to the room to listen, but no takers.  This has turned me off all Hyatts, anywhere, permanently.The location of this hotel is great - central to all shopping and downtown highlights. The lobby is really nice and open - the atrium design lets a lot of light in so it's not your typical endless hallways. Front desk staff was more than helpful (and never missed a wake up call!) and housekeeping was fast and thorough.Room service and food quality leaves a lot to be desired. Everything is drenched in butter. Overall, a very comfortable room and I would stay here again while in Indy.","['husband', 'trade', 'show', 'along', 'ride', 'really', 'wanted', 'somewhere', 'suit', 'know', 'good', 'deal', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-severin-hotel-indianapolis-2,Omni Severin Hotel,3.5,$$$,99,"I am writing this from the perspective of planning events &amp; booking groups.My colleague and I often book incoming training groups and host events and we absolutely love to work with the Omni. Diondra &amp; Cristy particularly keep us coming back. They are reliable, responsive, and absolutely delightful. Our guests consistently enjoy their stay and the Select Guest program (fresh coffee delivered to your room and free wifi on the first stay?!) is unmatched.Thank you Diondra &amp; Cristy. We appreciate you!I recently visited Indianapolis on business and stayed at the Omni. It was my first stay and overall, I would say it's okay but not the best hotel. Maybe I wouldn't be so critical if they didn't say they were a ""luxury"" hotel. I got an executive king room and to be honest, I'm really glad I didn't get a regular room. It was pretty tiny even for the larger executive room. Most chain hotels have larger rooms. It might not be such a big deal but there is no lighting. It's like a dark cave. There was a lamp on the nightstand and a lamp on the desk, that's it. Also, most importantly, my cellphone had bad service in my room. I have Verizon and I could receive and make calls but they were a jumbled mess, we couldn't understand one another. I could text so it was alright but if you are planning to do business, think again. The staff was less than friendly. The lady who checked me in was barely pleasant. When I checked out, I needed to retrieve my car from the valet. Now it wasn't even 8 am yet and there were only two other guests in the lobby. There was no one at the valet stand and so I had to trek back in to the front desk where the staff member seemed less than pleased to have to call valet herself. It took them over 15 minutes to bring me my car and they had let it idle for quite some time because it was warm. I don't care if my car is warm, just bring it to me. Would I stay again? Maybe. It was really quiet, the price was decent, and the location was good.Wow. WOw. WOW! I've been to hotels around the world and the Omni Severin is officially my favorite. My company has offices in Indianapolis and as a reward for even us Indy locals, rooms at Omni. I was able to check in at 9a for my night stay and was upgraded by the desk agent Angelica. The suite was 2 floors including a gorgeous view and spiral staircase - I wish I could have stayed longer! The bed was sublime, valet was easy, and everyone was very friendly and eager to help with anything we needed.Bravo to the Omni - my new local staycation spot!I had an extended stay while in Indy for job training and I was very pleased with this hotel.  The staff was very friendly, my room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable.  You can't beat the location.  It is in the center of town.  You can enter the mall without leaving the hotel.  Its also steps away from a multitude of restaurants, and stadiums if you want to catch a game.  The Omni is a real treasure.  I hope that my company makes accommodations for me to stay here when Im in Indy again.Clean and open. Just stopped in for the first floor amenities which were great. Staff were very friendly.My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times. We go for the plaza suites with a balcony. Small but nice rooms. The restaurant, 1913 is way overpriced for the food quality and preparation. Food is not bad but just ok. The Severin Bar (single bar next to reception desk) is creepy. We had a drink while waiting for our room to be available upon check in. The bartender just stood there staring at us the entire time. Overall it's a nice hotel but the service and management are absolutely horrible!Our last stay was for two nights. We got zero sleep both nights because of some kids partying in the next room all night. And I mean all night! They were completely drunk and obnoxious. Had a stereo set up on the balcony and blasted it well into the early am hours. Techno at 3am anyone? No thanks. Several guests in surrounding rooms complained and security was up there at least half a dozen times the first night. They would quiet down for about 15 minutes then start up again each time.By the second night, hotel management didn't even bother with them. I tried to speak with a manager in the morning to ask for a refund or at least partial refund, comped parking, free coffee...Anything.There was no manager working that weekend. This was October 11, 2015.I have since tried multiple times to contact a manager by phone and email. Still nothing. I recently received an email from the assistant desk manager, who offered $25 off a standard room for one night. Not even enough to make up for parking there ($38/day.)This is her:Angelina SalwakAssistant Front Office ManagerI wrote back and called but again, no response.I used to like this hotel and would have stayed again if they would have attempted to make amends. But they obviously do not care about loyal repeat customers and management, if there is any, makes that lack of interest in guests very obvious. I'll will stay elsewhere when in Indy, which is quite often. But hey! I know where to stay if I want to have an obnoxious party and disturb all of the other guests without any consequences!My stay at the Omni Severin was absolutely amazing! I was in town for a seminar that was taking place at the hotel, so I was able to fully enjoy all of the hotel's services, including the meeting rooms and catering.The hotel is conveniently located right in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. There is a sky bridge that attaches to hotel to the Circle Center mall with lots of shopping and dining options. Even outside of the mall, there are MANY varied dining options available. It is located directly across from the Indianapolis Union Station (and only blocks away from the Indiana Statehouse, Monument Circle, the Lucas Oil Stadium and the Bankers Life Fieldhouse) and was actually built to service the passengers on the trains. The historic building has a lot of charm and still has the original chandelier and post box. I really enjoyed these little details and the historic nature of the hotel.Within the lobby of the building there is access to the 1913 Restaurant, Severin Bar, Wine Thief, and Starbucks. This made it an even more convenient location to stay at!The guest rooms are quite spacious and incredibly comfortable. The staff provides nothing but superb customer service, across the board. From my room on the 12th floor I was provided with a beautiful view of downtown Indianapolis.I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and I would definitely encourage everyone to consider the hotel for business or pleasure in the downtown Indianapolis area (I saw a few weddings being planned and what a grey location to have one)! In fact, I am now very eager to try other Omni hotels during my travels because my experience here was so wonderful!Thank-you, Omni, for another fantastic stay in your hotel this past weekend.   When our friends are in town, we almost always recommend Omni for their stay.  We usually get a room, too.  Convenient location, reasonable prices and great customer service has made us loyal patrons.  This weekend was no different.  With 6 rooms between us, we were all pleased with the quality and comfort Omni provides.  We will continue to recommend and stay ourselves!I thought the hotel was nice, to be honest I was expecting a bit more. I felt the room was a tad bit dark. The size was nice, but the bathroom was a bit underwhelming and the water was slow to drain when taking a shower. The staff was very nice and courteous and seemed to care about your stay. The only other thing that I noticed in the room was the patchwork on the drywall was bulging  through the wallpaper, not to the point of making a complaint, but just lack of attention to detail during renovation. The only odd thing was returning from dinner and arriving at the hotel and the doorman never greeted me and my wife or opened the cab door, something I would have expected. I like the convenience to the parking garage and the proximity to the mall and other venues.Ok... I travel quite a bit and have stayed in a lot of quality hotels. I live in Indianapolis, but had a one night staycation downtown at the Omni.First things first, I'm not familiar with parking options in this area. It was a little confusing, I think you may have to valet park, which is fine, but just putting that out there. It's like 38 dollars for overnight parking. The valet service is great and friendly.The lobby has a bar and restaraunt, I didn't eat there, but it looks nice. The service at the front desk was good. OK so I got to my room and this is where I start deducting points. 300 dollars for a room in Indianapolis is fairly pricey. I expect to get what I paid for. For starters, this was not the room I booked. Online it showed a larger balcony with chairs, which I know is available because I saw real pictures on tripadvisor. I had also selected two full or queen beds, I can't remember which they were. My room had a little ledge of a balcony, no chairs, one king bed. I could have requested a change of rooms, but who ever wants to deal with that?.. nothing irritates me more than taking the time to pick specific things that get overlooked. Like why even ask if you're just going to give me whatever room works for you?The room itself left a lot to be desired. I'm sure most in Indianapolis probably do, however, it was super dark and dungeon-y. The glasses and ice bucket are awkwardly kept in some TV cabinet. The carpet was nice, the bed was clean and comfortable. The couch and chair were stained and worn. The bathroom was small and very hospital-esque. We had a good view of the old union station and Lucas oil stadium, wish we'd had more of a city view. All in all, it was alright... I guess that's all you csn expect here. Just seemed a little overpriced.I was hesitant to stay after reading some rather scathing reviews, but the Omni was amazing! FIVE STARS FOR STAFF, friendly and very helpful!! Valet was a little behind this morning but it was snowing and 8 am so that's expected. Bed linens, pillows, and towels were all up to par, this is something I'm rather nit picky about. Bathroom was small but it's a historic hotel that's 103 yr old so no big deal. We got a great deal on Hotwire for $150 and valet was an extra $38. All in all, I'd stay here again and would recommend to anyone!I meant to post an update a while ago, but forgot! Oops!The manager at Omni contacted me immediately and apologized for the woman's behavior at the front desk and let me know how embarrassed he was that an employee would speak that way to a guest. He offered us another night in a suite to make up for it, complimentary, and though we had to move away to Dallas for our jobs shortly after, we were not able to try it out, but I was so appreciative of the kind gesture. It was nice to know that that sort of behavior is incredibly uncommon and unacceptable and I am confident that my next stay with Omni will be enjoyable. Thank you Omni!I must say I expected a LOT more from both the price and the hotel chain. Other than the fact it is right downtown, this hotel is basic and not worth the money. Never in my life have I paid so much and received so little. Our room was tiny, barely fit a double bed (which was suppose to be a king, when asked about it, I was told there were no other rooms in the hotel). I have never seen a bathroom that was so small. It was the perfect size for a hobbit.I don't think I will ever stay here again. Not worth the money, I mean over 200 dollars a night in INDIANAPOLIS! I'd have more room if I'd stayed in my car...of course, parking was ridiculously expensive...so it won't have been much cheaper.Absolutely lovely lobby in which to sit and chat. Not only that but the lobby wifi is good and strong as well! A friend stayed in this hotel and she had no known complaints about her stay either. The restroom in the lobby was also rather well maintained. And the door person was great at letting us know when the rain let up and helping us gain our bearings such that I could get back to my hotel. Looked like a nice hotel at which to stay.I would like to Thank the Management and 1913 staff for a Great night on 02-10-2016, My Birthday were yesterday came in feeling real down any you guys made my night....Thanks.         Thanks Tyler and JonathanBeautiful lobby and very helpful valet, However valet is $38, ouch!. Staff is super nice. Everything looks a little worn out and rooms are A little cramped. Lighting is not the best, especially if you need to use the bathroom at nighttime. More likely relative to the age of the building and it's restoration the water out of the pipes is extremely musty kind of taste like a peat bog. If you don't like your water taste like single malt scotch you can always buy the seven dollar bottle of water they have by the TV.   The bathtub is extremely shallow, more like a shower stall. Be careful when you flush the toilet and be sure to stand back because it flushes so vigorously is slings water across the bathroom floor; kind of gross.The bed linens were very nice however the mattress itself is likely over 10 years old it was very creaky and would fold in the center. Nice blackout shades over the windows.Location is pretty sweet too in the bar downstairs pours the cocktails kind of heavy if you know what I mean.The rooms here are pretty small.  I was only one person and I made it work for me, but I did feel a bit cramped.  Especially in the bathroom.  I went to make some tea in the coffee pot in the room and was pretty disappointed when I noticed how dirty it was. I went down to the lobby hoping the Starbucks attached to the hotel was still open, but no luck.  I was told that the bar could make me a cup, which they did.  However it cost me $5 for a cup of hot water and a tea bag.  So much for the complimentary in room tea and coffee.I absolutely love this hotel. It is beautiful and close to everything that you want to do downtown. The employees are the nicest group of people I have encountered in such a long time. Each time I return, they make me feel so special. They go out of their way to make you happy. I believe that the person or persons do the hiring has a unique gift of knowing who to hire and who not to. It didn't matter who I encountered while there, that certain employee always had a smile on their face and was always willing to go out of their way to help. While on the elevator I had the privilege to meet the maintenance man. He even went out of his way to help me with my luggage in my room. Then when I realized that I wanted to change rooms, he helped me to my new room. Even when I book through a 3rd party, they still give me free internet in my room. I can't think of anything that they could change that would make my stay more comfortable. Thanks Omni for making my stay always so wonderful.My fiance and I decided to spend an extra night in Indy to celebrate his birthday and chose Omni to spend the evening. From the moment we walked in the door the staff at this hotel were kind and welcoming. This has been by far the best experience I have ever had at a hotel, the staff went above and beyond and we appreciate the positive experienceIts pretty classy. Breakfast was  the diamond in the rough for me--it really set me right from the start. Very professional staff all the way around. The pool was a little small, but we were not there to swim...the water was perfect temp though and that plus the pool cleanliness made up for the lack of its size. I would stay here again with my family. Go for the package deal with this!","Bartender, Jack was incredibly rude and inconsiderate. We sat down and waited for 5 minutes before even being acknowledged. There was a group of men who he talked to the entire time we were there which wasn't long because we were so disgusted. Paid $12 each for mimosas and got service as if we were at McDonalds. Never got a thank you or anything. We talk to the concierge about it and he, Andrew, was incredibly nice and apologetic.Had a 2 week stay and was treated with true hospitality and professionalism . Tony B. Helped me find all the good music spots and was over the top customer service , Melvin knew my omelet without asking every day . April was a great limo driver and got me to my regular morning stop ahead of time all the time . Lucy C. Was also very helpful at letting  me know what bands were playing where and had good recommendations for food and fun ! I will be staying here next visit to Indianapolis for sure. I only named the people I remembered that helped me DAILY, everyone I encountered was very nice as well. Most definitely the place to stay when vMy parents always stay at the Omni when they are in town visiting and it is a lovely hotel.  The customer service is outstanding, the location is convenient, and the rooms are very nice.  The suites facing south have awesome views of Lucas Oil Stadium and balconies.  The Omni is also attached through above ground tunnel access to circle center mall which is convenient.  The Severin bar in the lobby is great and the Starbucks in the lobby is convenient too.This place is amazing! The service and location is unbeatable. My fiance booked us a room here for my 30th birthday and when we arrived they gave us a free upgrade to one of the loft style suites on the 12th floor. They also threw in a hand written birthday card, some local beer, and their BBQ popcorn (which was amazing). We were able to grab dinner at St. Elmo's and then walk over to catch the Pacers game with ease. Overall, we were both blown away by how nice the staff was and how clean the room was. We will definitely be coming back!Hotel was a big disappointment.   Drove over almost two hundred miles for my 65th birthday. Booked three rooms.  When we arrived at 3 they told us only one room was ready.  My daughter with her two year and husband were told their room would not be ready until after 5. My other son and daughter were told their suite would also not be ready.  Only after my son complained did they scramble to find him a suite.   To make a long story short, my daughter with the toddler didn't get into her suite with her husband until after 8pm.  In fairness to the hotel they comped us with breakfast and parking.  They were suppose to take something off one of the rooms...just got my card charges, doesn't appear to be discounted.   There are many other hotels in the area....I would avoid this one.They ruined my 65 th birthday.....I was also told that a bottle of champagne or some other item would be in my room as a token for my birthday.   Nothing ever came.Great, clean, classy accommodations. Our room was a bit on the small side. Annoyed that parking is so expensive, but that's downtown life. Front desk clerk was a total snob and not at all warm and friendly and welcoming like you would expect for the price paid. Received better service/welcomes at Holiday Inn Express. Otherwise, decent hotel.We decided to stay at the Omni because of its downtown location and it being close to Lucas Oil. Having booked the room in January, we were pretty disappointed that they didn't have a room ready for us when we arrived, the staff saying it'd be about an hour until one was ready.We were understanding, and had just decided to wait in the lobby until one became available - even though we knew that would probably make us late for our event.The concierge, Lucy, came over and talked to us while we waited. She was incredibly nice, and went way above and beyond for something that we really weren't too upset over in the first place. She took our bags and held them for us so that we could go to our event and called us when our room was ready. When we returned later in the evening to check in, Lucy was there, and gave us a personalized letter apologizing for the inconvenience. She also included a voucher worth $50 to use in the Severin Bar. We were blown away by the kindness.Despite the fact that there were four separate events going on downtown, on top of it being St. Patrick's Day weekend, the staff were on top of everything and the front desk remembered us as we checked out and got our car from valet.We will definitely be staying here again for Supercross next year! Thanks again!Date: 8/30/2015Time:11:30amI frequent this place when I travel to INDY and I have to say that although the service inside is GREAT! Valet was a complete mess during checkout. I walked out and no one approached us but they were all at the booth standing around. I walk over to them and ask for the number of my car and the guy says ""Do you have your ticket?"" I said ""OH no, I left it in the room but have my check out receipt."" One of the three guys said ""You can't just walk up and ask for a number without a number or ID"". I replied, well you hadn't ask for my ID but here it is. Another guy gets my car keys and then asked if I checked out. I replied, yes here is the receipt. He hands the keys to me and didn't even offer to bring the car around. I told him I'll take it from here and I got my things and left.Staff may need to watch a video on being a little more nicer. Better yet, mock the team from yesterday during my check in around 2pm. Excellent service ALL DAY! Total difference this morning.Did not meet expectations of quality of service.Taking a weekend jaunt to Indianapolis and as members of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, my friend and I decided to stay in a hotel affiliated with the Historic Hotels of America. Unfortunately, the ""historic"" part of the hotel was restricted the entire time of the stay due to a private party. Also, the Sky Walk / Pedestrian Walkway that connect various hotels in downtown Indianapolis as well as to the shopping areas/restaurants were restricted by guards due to another private function. No hotel guests on this weekend (March 28, 2015) were allowed to access the walkway. This made me want to check out immediately and go somewhere else. For an amenity that the hotel markets, yet it is not accessible to guests? In addition to these segregation practices, the elevators were remarkably slow. There was usually a 10-15 minute wait for them. It became highly frustrating. And in turn, it caused large amounts of folks (especially unsupervised children) to use the stairwell which my room backed up to. I got little sleep because of the loud banging of the use of the metal stairs. Additionally, guests were extremely loud and security was lax or not enforced during ""quiet hours"" so guests could rest. Also, very few amenities exist. You'll need to pay $15 a day for WiFi access in your room and $25 for business office use (computer/printing, etc). The breakfast buffet, at $20 per person was not up to standard either. There were little hot foods and it was in short supply often running out yet no deduction was made to the bill. Overall, I would not return to this hotel and their affiliation with the National Trust and Historic Hotels of America should be reexamined.I actually really liked this hotel. Very convenient to lots of restaurants and sporting venues, rooms were clean clean clean and there were plenty of outlets for electronics. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, room service food was also quite good! The beds were comfortable and the room amenities were more than adequate. I would definitely stay here again without complaint.I stayed here this past week for a conference that was around the corner at the Indiana Convention Center.  The location is fantastic, and a close walk to almost everything: the Pacers, Colts, and Indians are all across the street or around the corner.  Lots of restaurants and fun areas all right there.  The skywalk connects the Omni to the Circle Centre Mall.  I thought everyone I dealt with was very professional, polite, and accommodating.  My room was clean and comfortable.  I got room service twice and it was prompt and delicious.  I joined the Select Guest club, mostly for the free wi-fi.  When I got my bill, they had charged me for it.  When I pointed this out to the front desk, they immediately corrected it and removed the wi-fi charge.I am not picking on Omni here because all major chains do this, but I still can't believe that wi-fi isn't automatically included.  I mean, McDonald's, school and public libraries, airports all have complimentary Wi-fi.  I still find it odd that most high-end chains charge customers $9.95 or more a day to use it.  It took a minute to join the Select Guest club, so it was no big deal.  But I must admit that it was pretty slow most of the time, and I often lost the connection and had to reboot.Just a couple of beefs - albeit minor. They advertised the fitness facilities as being 24 hours.  I went down to do laps in the pool around 10:30 one night, and there was a woman down there cleaning and said that it closed at 10.  I don't know if the website just meant the gym itself is open 24 hours, but I thought it odd that the pool would be closed but not the gym when it's all right there in the same area/room.  Second, the air conditioning in the room was really noisy.All in all, it was a great stay and I enjoyed my week there.  The original lobby, with the original crystal chandelier and marble staircase from 1913 when the Severin opened, is beautiful.Great location in downtown.  Clean throughout hotel and in the rooms.  Bathroom shower water pressure wasn't good probably could be fixed with a new shower head.  We requested a crib in room and it wasn't there.  They did bring it after but almost wish they didn't. I would hope they replace them soon.  A small pack and play would work better.  It is to deep I couldn't even put baby down without falling almost in it.  My husband had to put him in it.  Staff offer to bring a refrigerator but never did.  We made do with the cooler.  I would go back if other places were booked or if this was much cheaper than others.The hotel is nice enough, but it is nothing fantastic. Most staff was friendly, a couple were unnecessarily stuffy with an invisible stick up their bum.The room was...we'll say ""cozy"". Breakfast at the restaurant was mediocre.There is one thing that really annoyed me about this place, though...they need to keep working ice machines on each floor. It's on of those things that is a necessity in a hotel with no vending machines or easy access to refreshments.My husband and I tied the knot last month and are not originally from Indianapolis. All of our families and friends had to fly in so we wanted to pick a hotel block that would be convenient to the heart of downtown and still have some culture to it. Plus our venue was downtown so we wanted easy access. (The Mavris.. amazing!)Boy did we pick the right place! The Omni was unbelievably accommodating and super friendly. We were able to tour the rooms our guests would be staying in ahead of time and the discount was leaps and bounds better than any of their competitors. My parents, also from out of state, stayed in the presidential suite the whole weekend and it made a perfect place for our guests to gather. The large space made the wedding weekend feel a little bit closer to home. One hiccup included a fire alarm and we were all mainly on the 12th floor... trekking down all those flights holding all my wedding gear just hours before the rehearsal was a little stressful but they were so apologetic and included extra treats in our rooms once we returned!We did not stay there on our wedding night... for obvious reasons... but our wedding was on a Friday so we wanted to come back to the action on Firday before we left on Sunday for the Honeymoon. The Omni comped a honeymoon suit for us! It was unbelievable.100 years old and they keep getting better :)Great looking hotel with nice staff.  End of compliments. As you will notice, I seldom yelp.  So you know it's either great or horrible when I chime in with a comment.  This is the most uncomfortable bed in which I have ever had the displeasure of (not) sleeping.  My back is killing me.  In fact, the small of my back is on fire it hurts so bad.  My wife and I are moving to town and have been looking for apartments all day.  You have all done this, it sucks and is exhausting.  Can't stay alseep.  That's how goddamned horrible this bed is.  To all of the people complaining about the price: stay at the airport you cheap-assed clowns.  At 140 a night this is one of the cheapest places in downtown.  That and the staff are the only reason I didn't give it just one star.   This is going to sound crazy: I'd stay here again and bring an inflatable mattress.  It's a really inexpensive, cleanish (B+), nice hotel in the middle of downtown.  Maybe that's the insane sleeplessness talking, but it's true  (for now at least).  This place still might be worth the trade-off for you (money for comfort). Trying to roll over and sleep again...Wonderful service, beautiful rooms and great location if u want to walk downtown or if u r going to see a concert (it is very close to Lucas oil stadium). It is a bit pricey but u get what u pay for!This has got to be one of THE most LUXURIOUS OMNI Hotel that I have stayed at East of California. It has special memories for me for many good reasons! :p I was here for a week of shows.The hotel staff here were just outstanding. The doorman, the reservation check in agents, the elevator attendant - phenomenal service. Every space, every angle in this hotel, everywhere I wondered off, the experienced I received were ""spectacular - spectacular!""  That's from ""Moulin Rouge"" btw! :pHere's the treat though, the Omni Severin is connected to the Circle Centre Mall and it is only a via skywalk to the Indiana Convention Center. Also, it is centrally located in the heart of the downtown Wholesale District, and it is only one half block from the famous St. Elmo Steak House, and two blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium and Bankers Life Fieldhouse.---This Omni has a 24 hour Starbucks service (hooray for the coffee achievers like me). I took advantaged of many late night cappuccinos.  Awesome!!Their lobby was gorgeous. Pendant lights hung from up above. The view of their crystal chandeliers with a cinematic ambiance ""Gone With The Wind"" staircase,"" breathtaking!I did managed to see their indoor heated pool and jacuzzi - but never got a chance to use the services as they were packed with families so I decided to join my friends at the Severine Wine Bar instead after dinner which was absolutely first in its class. There, we had toasts after toasts, sharing stories after stories how our show went, and a few eye opening exchanges of ""rumors and gossips!"" Shhhh......For breakfast, we did take advantaged of their ""1913 Restaurant"" more for convenience (buffet style), but I recommend that you venture out to downtown for dinners. One I recommend is the St. Elmo Steak House. A must experience before leaving Indianapolis.As far as their rooms - amazing.  Most of us were lucky and got early bookings for their King Severin Suites(huge space) with beautiful privacy french doors that lead into a luscious and heavenly private bedroom with flat screen TV, and spa bathroom with all first class complimentary accessories. I was told all rooms comes standard with plush robes and slippers.  Ours were replaced daily; and an evening mint chocolates were delivered nightly with an orchid and a lovely note on our bed. How thoughtful! I had to remind myself that I wasn't in California - and that I was in fact in Indianapolis of all places! Who would've thought!PS - don't forget to sign up during your initial registration for their ""Select Guest loyalty program;"" there is no charge and this will give you FREE access to WiFi in your room.  Well worth the savings.Wow - this is my 100 YELP Reviews for my list ""The Yelp 100 Challenge"" for 2013.Staff is super friendly and even wore colts jerseys for the game. Old historic hotel from 1913 which has aged semi-well but is probably due for a major overhaul at some point soon. The a/c is noisy and the air stayed pretty humid and didn't get very cold despite putting it on the lowest setting, the plumbing is funky (flushing the toilet is pretty violent and almost pulls the plumbing out of the wall) and the dents/dings under the newish wallpaper bear evidence to several remodels. The bed was also interesting with some kind of pillow top that made you feel like you might fall off if you were close to the edge. The linens are high quality though and definitely make you feel bundled up and secure under them.The accessible rooms are REALLY accessible which is fabulous if you require that. However, typically when I stay in an accessible room it is dually appointed. I.e. Hooks are in both high and low places, the closet bar and shelf are both high and low (allowing for hanging long dresses/pants) etc. This one just has everything low. It's not the end of the world, but just a little inconvenient when hanging dress clothes or towels (Eco-friendly) where I had to you the assist bars as towel racks. Anyway all in all they try very hard to keep this historic beauty up and running like a classic car. The hotel is well-loved.I absolutely loved this hotel!! We stayed on the top floor in one of the city view suites. The hotel lobby was swanky and the beds were extremely comfortable. I would strongly suggest staying here!!The room was ok.  Everything seemed a little worn out.  However, this is not why I am giving this hotel a two.  We were traveling and chose this hotel in big part because it is a ""pet friendly"" hotel.  We have two dogs one is boxer who is on the small side only 50 lbs and a miniature dachshund.  Both are extremely friendly and well behaved.  When we got there we found out their limit is 25 lbs for dogs.  The lady told me it is because dogs over 25 lbs are vicious!  I must have looked at her like she was crazy when she then asked me if my boxer was vicious!  I told her of course not then said she would have to meet my boxer before she would honor our reservation.  Of course when we brought in my ""vicious"" boxer she did nothing but wag her tale and shower her with kisses.  She begrudgingly agreed to let us stay.  But reiterated for my husbands benefit that they usually don't allow dogs over 25 lbs because they are vicious!  It took everything for me to bite my tongue as it was late and we had been on the road all day and I just wanted to sleep.  She then added in if my dogs caused any disturbance we could incur additional charges.  This was not feeling so pet friendly to me.  We travel very often with our dogs and have never encountered anything like this at any other hotel.  And how insanely uneducated to label any dog vicious just because of their size or their breed.  I think the meanest dog I have ever met was a tiny chihuahua.  So my suggestion is if you have dogs don't come to this hotel.  I know I never will.  And as far as the room it wasn't worth the price.  We have previously stayed at the Alexander in Indianapolis and they were extremely pet friendly they even give your dogs little goody bags.","The smallest things make such a difference! Omni has a turn down service in the evenings. I heard the ""turn down assistant"" knocking on doors as I left my room. I jokingly said ""I want two dark chocolate squares with raspberry filling"" as I walked away. We joked about how they used to do chocolates, etc. Nice enough that she (Brenda) was super nice and engaging, but she one up'd that. I was working in my room and a knock on the door ""turn down service"", I said it's all done. ""no sir, one more thing"" - Brenda had gone to get me a dark chocolate milkshake with the hotel's blessing!!! Awesome service and kudos to Omni for letting an employee make a guest day better!ScottWent here for Mother's Day Brunch. It's arguably one of the best places that serve very extensive themed brunch. Definitely worth the hefty price tag. They offer valet parking which is convenient and an on-site Starbucks.Home for Christmas, the girlfriend and I stayed at the Omni Severin Hotel.  The Omni Severin is ideally located in Downtown Indy a short walk from plenty of restaurants, bars, Victory Field, and Lucas Oil Stadium.  Given the time of year and the fact that the Colts were on the road on the Sunday we arrived in town, the hotel was pretty much empty...not the Overlook Hotel from The Shining empty...but empty nonetheless.  It's not the newest hotel in Indy, but it had lots of good qualities. Pros:  LocationPolite, professional hotel staff (front desk, housekeeping, etc.)Clean, fairly spacious standard roomComfortable bedNo motion sensors for items in/on the mini-barHowever, there was one thing that really detracted from our stay...the Omni's use of a holiday pine scent pumped into the main lobby and other common areas on the first floor.  While pleasant smelling, it was a bit overpowering and the only thing I could isolate as a possible cause behind my fits of sneezing and other allergy symptoms I experienced during our stay.  I've been in plenty of other hotels and casinos that have pumped in various scents into its air ventilation system without issue, so this was a first.  Thankfully, like most people that stay in a hotel, we were only in the room a small fraction of the time we were in town.  Nevertheless, the Omni was a decent hotel and likely doesn't use the pine scent year round. 3.5 stars.Clean. We wanted a king sized bed but they gave us two double beds. We are two slim people and we were scrunched.  why would they even have a double bed?  Not very comfy. We could hear all the noise outside...motorcycles, cars...and we were 10 stories up.  Shower is nice. They cleaned the room very well each night and gave us turn down service.Beautiful, clean hotel conveniently located in downtown Indy.  Easy walking distance to a great variety of restaurants, shops, and attractions.  All staff from front desk to housekeeping to valet were friendly and helpful.  Valet was prompt as well.  Pool is small, but our son loved it.  Rooms were clean and well-maintained.  We would absolutely return next time we're in town.I have stayed in many hotels in my business travels and this is definitely one of the best! The hotel itself is immaculate. Classy decor. Impeccable service and a staff that bends over backwards for you. Very professional. Front desk personnel were friendly and quick to help me out with directions and suggestions of the area. Found me a room even though I had arrived a bit earlier than check in time.My room is wonderful. Clean and well maintained. Super comfy bed, large flat screen TV, safe, mini bar, great AC, terrific bathroom and toiletries, and even a basket of snacks to purchase. The tempation to rip open that $3 can of Pringles and $3 bag of M&amp;M's is killing me!Nice clean pool and fitness room with a mix of cardio machines, weights, and resistance equipment. Not a lot but enough to get in a decent workout. Beautiful ballrooms on site for meetings and events. Coffee shop, lobby bar, restaurant, and even a martini cigar bar on the premises.The hotel is located perfectly and is convenient to everything - the Circle Centre Mall, restaurants and bars, the convention center, Lucas Oil Field, and more. The hotels in the area including the Omni are also connected to the mall by enclosed walkways. You never really need to walk outside too much which is great since it has been rainy  Even by the elevators in the main lobby they have two urns of water - one with cucumber slices and tthe other with lemons and limes in it - with cups for anyone who wants a drink.I really think I could live in this place!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PS - be sure to join their Select Guest rewards club before you check in as it's free. You receive complimentary in-room wifi, pressing service, shoe shine, morning beverage delivery, and bottled water on day of arrival.While I feel that I have traveled far and, somewhat, wide, I had never been to Indianapolis.So, planning three nights for a place to stay by the convention center, I did a little research, including Yelp, at settled on this hotel.From the time I got there, the staff was very friendly and helpful with good referrals.  The room was large enough and clean as was well attended to.  I never ate in the restaurants but I did appreciate having a nice hotel bar and a Starbucks downstairs.  The location was one block from the convention center, an indoor walk to the mall and near other downtown venues.  It would have been nice to have a little gift store for postcards and a candy bar, but that wouldn't deter me from staying here again.We stayed at the Omni in Indianapolis on a Colts game day. The service at the front desk looked miserable without smiles. The room was nice, with few amenities for being such an expensive place to stay. The worst part of our stay was the valet. It was about $7 more expensive than other hotel garages and it took nearly an hour to retrieve our car. No one friendly or helpful at all when dealing with this issue. The weather was cold and rainy and they had us all waiting on the curb. I would not recommend the Omni to anyone. Stay at the Sheraton or anywhere else for better value and service.We just finished up a three day stay at the Omni Severin and I was overall very pleased with the accommodations and staff. Everyone from the valet parking to the front desk to the engineers, bellhops, concierge, and housekeeping staff went out of their way to make us feel taken care of and at home. All of our requests were met with prompt and speedy replies and everyone tried their best to make us feel welcomed. I would especially like to thank employees Danielle Travis and William Perry for their excellent service.  Being an Omni select guest member also gave us additional perks of free wifi, free pressing of shirts, shoe shines, and coffee each morning from Starbucks. The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is because we had to pay $32 a day for valet parking. I know this is par for the course, but I still think that it's ridiculous to charge guests this much for parking.Stayed here for work. Wonderful staff!! Was having a rough day, when I got to the check in desk the staff noticed my day sucked and bought me a beer. Rooms are comfy, hotel is clean and in a great location. The bar tenders have great recommendations on eats and drinks.The Omni is in the ideal location for anyone visiting downtown Indy, especially conference-goers. Within 3 blocks there are more restaurants than any other town I've visited, except for mega cities. But Indy is much easier to get around in. The Cultural Trail is awesome, too. This hotel had a broken elevator, but otherwise, it was perfect.Great hotel,  staff and location... Park and walk to everything!! If you haven't been you need to check it outWine Thief is a must visit bar. They have the most authentic Manhattan ever made.  Located in the Omni Hotel Lobby, the Wine Thief offers true vintage cocktails, only fitting for a place that titles it's restaurant ""1913"" commemorating the year the building was built. After traveling to many locations and ""vintage"" themed bars (from Denver to Chicago to Baltimore) I will say this is the most authentic cocktail menu I have seen. Ask for Will. He is truly an asset to Omni. The bar was closed, but Will offered to make one more drink as I stepped up to the bar. The Manhattan he made was truly the most authentic I had ever tasted, well balanced with whisky and citrus. It was made with all natural ingredients, no corners cut, no store-bought mixes.  As I was finishing the drink there was more and more taste to the drink, unlike many cocktails that water down and warm up as they are finished. He took time while cleaning up the bar to engage me in conversation about his passion for wine and mixology. Apparently he had purchased a cocktail book published in 1927 with the original recipes for the prohibition style cocktails. He took the time to go above and beyond making simple drinks you can purchase at any other bar.  He did his job so well, I almost forgot this was a service and I had to pay for the cocktail. He was incredibly genuine, a simple pleasure just to make his acquaintance. Before taking off for the night he made sure to shake every patron's hand and personally thank them for stopping by.  I can't wait to see what he does after receiving his sommelier certification.We attended a friend's wedding this weekend and took advantage of their group rate to make it into a little staycation. We were bowled over by the level of service and professionalism that exuded from every employee we encountered, from bell hop, to wait staff, to the front desk. They anticipated our needs before we even realized they were needs, and answered our questions before we even asked them. Prior to arrival, we made a special request to get an extra refrigerator for our room and sure enough it was there, plugged in, and cold when we checked in. If you are considering a wedding here, please know that they are absolute professionals and your guests will be blown away by the white glove service. This place is absolute class and I will be recommending this hotel to my out of town visitors from now on.Had a really solid stay here for three nights while in town for a bachelor party. The location is great for walking distance to food, sights, the two local stadiums, and to access all of downtown. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and were very professional when one of our party members was a little lost in the hotel. The room itself was very clean, comfortable beds, good TV, only thing less than impressive was the bathroom, which was adequate but not as high quality as everything else there.They have a $100 weekend stay deal going on I believe the rest of the year, and for that price it's a place I would definitely recommend.Very average hotel experience. Lovely lobby and friendly staff, but room was really underwhelming.There's nothing that would absolutely make me want to stay away, but there also wasn't much to make me feel I have to stay here again.My husband &amp; I stayed here for a romantic weekend.  The location was wonderful - within walking distance of many attractions.Our room was clean, the bed was very comfortable, great water pressure (though the bathroom was one of the smallest I've ever seen) and it had a very nice gym.Our one sour note was a very loud drunk party next door to us on our second night.  Security took care of the problem and the next day the front office supervisor very graciously adjusted our bill.  Shanda was extremely nice about it - especially as it wasn't the hotel fault.  We have already made reservations to stay there again during the marathon.One final note the brunch was amazing!!  They locally source a lot of their produce and jams and it showed.  Everything was fresh and delicious.Checked in early for a wedding.  Happily waited while have lunch, we were assured they would prepare our room.  A couple hours pass, they've clearly forgotten about us.  We remind them, still patient, but that we need to prepare for a rehearsal dinner.  They assured us we would get our room within the next 30 minutes.  Another hour plus passes, still no room.  In total, we waited four hours to get into a room.  When i addressed my complaint with the 'manager' he was quick to remind me that 'check in wasn't technically until 3pm""... At this point it was 3:45 and we were just then getting our room, so, I'm not sure I follow this logic.  He was rude, unprofessional, unapologetic, he blamed their error on me somehow.  Amazing.  Seriously, who does that?  I've stayed in nice hotels from New York to Italy, and motel 6's in between. Never have I been treated like this.    On top of all this, they didn't even bring up all of our luggage and we had to call down to have it brought up hours later.  The room was loud, small, inadequate.  I will never stay at an Omni hotel ever again<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> rates this a 4 Star but I'd give it 3.  The Cons:Stained room carpet.Black grime on the bathroom tiles.Super weak shower/bath water flow.Poor quality towels.Severin Bar TV's too loud and not really an authentic classic cocktail barThe Pros:Great bartender at the Wine ThiefLocal, natural food and beer at the Severin BarLocationIn ranking order with best first, I would place Hyatt, Renaissance, Westin, Doubletree, Radisson, Hilton, Crowne Plaza, Marriott, OMNI then Holiday Inn, Marriott Courtyard, Sheraton, Best Western, Ramada Inn, Days Inn, Motel 6, then Travelodge.A nice, clean room with friendly staff and that's it. I don't stay in fancy hotels and after this, I will stick to the Holiday Inns of the world. Why do expensive hotels charge extra for internet and do not offer a free breakfast for guests? I honestly think it's outrageous you have to pay for internet in your hotel room that already costs $120 a night.The same goes for breakfast! For guests who are staying the night at the hotel, at least offer something small, bagels and muffins. Oh yeah, parking was an extra $40 bucks! The room was nice, the service was nice but overall just not worth the price tag.","Some friends and I stayed here after a long day of shopping and thought we could use some TLC the adventure starts when you pull up to the hotel and your vehicle is parked by one of the handsome and helpful vallet's. You then walk into the front lobby and are greeted by helpful staff and towers of fresh cucumber water while you check in!! The rooms were nice but small based on the price your paying. The downside however is the fact you have to wait 20 minutes or so for the vallet to finally bring your car around. I'll definitely stay here again!This review is in regards to the hotel and hospitality staff.  I have not actually stayed at the Omni but my sister and I decided to bring our grandmother here to have dinner in their 1913 restaurant for her 100th birthday since the Omni was also celebrating their 100th birthday.  My sister contacted the restaurant to make a dinner reservation and see if we could bring in balloons and possibly a cake, and was fortunate enough to speak with Stanton Jacobs, the Director of Sales and Marketing.  Stanton arranged what ended up being an unforgettable 100th Birthday dinner for our grandmother and family.  He asked for some ideas about the foods that Grandma would like and also asked for some pictures of her when she was younger.  We had no idea what was in store for us.  When we arrived, Stanton, plus the Omni GM and hotel staff were there to greet us at the door.  We also surprised Grandma by having our dad (her son) and his wife there.  The welcome to the hotel was the first of many tears from Grandma.  Then Stanton told us that he was going to give us a short tour of the hotel...he walked us around to the Ballroom/reception area where he presented us with a private table under the original, 1913 chandelier with our own private piano player.  The table was set with framed photos of Grandma and her husband.  Cry #2.  The table was beautifully set...pink (Grandma's favorite color) with more forks than most of my family had ever seen.  The wait staff all warmly introduced themselves and then the chef came out to talk with us.  He had prepared a special ""Ethel Lindsey's 100th Birthday Dinner"" menu and we were each presented with the leather bound menu signed by Chef Vinny (to keep).  The menu included grandma's favorite foods - deviled eggs, mustard greens, filet mignon, sugar cream pie, etc....all done gourmet style and served in courses (thus the numerous forks!).  They served us champagne and wine and catered to our every need.  Then, after all the courses had been served, they wheeled out a special 2-tier birthday cake.  Grandma said repeatedly that she had never had a nicer/fancier dinner in her life.  She felt like a queen.  Stanton has also arranged for the Mayor to be there but unfortunately he was called away last minute...but the mayor still sent over an official Congratulatory document for presentation.  They didn't rush us and allowed us to enjoy ourselves and the evening at our leisure.  The entire staff made Grandma feel like a queen...including Carla, our waitress.  We were there on May 10th which is Mother's Day in Mexico and also her day off...but she said when she heard about Grandma, she wanted to come in and be a part of the celebration.  To top all of this off, they took care of the entire bill.Grandma Lindsey was glowing that whole evening...I haven't seen her that happy in a long time.  Stanton and the Omni staff made Grandma feel as special and she really is...and we can't thank him enough.  We had no idea that they were going to do all of this for us and couldn't have imagined it on our own.  I would definitely use the Omni for any event I was scheduling in Indianapolis.  Bravo to Stanton and his team!!This place was absolutely beautiful.  I love staying in nice hotels when I travel though I rarely get to afford such a luxury.  My husband treated me to a nice anniversary weekend so it was nice to stay in a hotel so close to everything going on around town.I was a bit surprised they didn't offer a free breakfast or free internet.  If you are paying so much for a hotel room, you'd think there would be some sort of incentive.  It didn't really matter to us because we didn't need internet and we slept past breakfast time anyway, but I found it odd and felt the need to put that in my review.  We stayed in our room two nights but never had maid service the whole time.  Perhaps the maid came by at the exact time when our ""Private"" sign was on the door knob and just never came back by at the right time, but I would have really liked it if someone would have emptied our garbage cans, haha.  I can't fault anyone for this though because I'm sure it was simply a matter of bad timing.  Overall we had a great experience here.  I felt like the staff tried very hard to accommodate their guests, which is exactly what you want when you travel.  Given the amount of people in town for the FFA convention and Halloween, we weren't overwhelmed by hoards of people while inside the hotel.We stayed just one night for a wedding in downtown Indy. The hotel was nice. The room seemed kind of small overall with a sitting chair placed awkwardly between the bed and window. The bathroom was a good size though. One thing we found weird was the toilet was like an industrial toilet found at businesses with the flusher behind the lid if you were sitting down.Anywho, the hotel location is convenient to plenty of places to eat and enjoy including the mall and Lucas Oil Stadium. It was a 4 star based on the reasonable wedding group rate we paid.For the better part of last week, the Omni was my home away from home while in Indy. And not just me- I'm a high school debate coach and had 6 teenage boys with me, there to compete at Nationals. In fact, the whole hotel was taken over by debate (God bless the saintly patience of the staff and other patrons), but it was still a fabulous experience.The location of the Omni is wonderful! It's convenient to everything, but tucked away in a nice little quiet corner. I LOVED the old Union Station across the street- watching it light up in the sunset really was spectacularly beautiful. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, from the valet, to the concierge, to the front desk staff, everyone was wonderful. The room was lovely, VERY well appointed and comfortable.I feel like this is a terrible review, because I have nothing but praise to sing. . . but seriously! Stay at the Omni! It was great.We loved the hotel and the staff was amazing. Parking was a pain but the location was fantastic. We will stay here anytime we visit Indy.Very nice hotel.. I have been there twice and they always work to make your stay a pleasant one.. Make sure you become a member so you can get all the perks available... On the down side they don't have a parking lot however they have valet service.I can not say enough nice things about the Omni. As a local my wife and I have stayed there on a few occasions.This time we decided to do the whole thing and try as much of what they had to offer as possible.First, its location is perfect if you want to see a lot of downtown. As a bonus you do not even have to go OUTSIDE for a lot of it. The connection to Circle Center Mall makes shopping and getting to other areas in bad weather a snap.We used it to go see a movie at the mall and to do some window shopping. But its only a short walk to the Convention center and a host of other places downtown.The staff is GREAT, from the moment you arrive they greet you and want to make sure you are taken care of. We arrived very early on a Friday morning because I had a 9 AM meeting. The front desk made sure to get my wife into a room a soon as possible. The rooms are nice and vary in size. This time we got a smaller king room with a small bathroom, but we do not care as long as the bed is comfortable and the Omni has some of the best beds we have ever slept in, We had breakfast at the restaurant on Saturday morning and although it was a little pricey, ($40 for two) it was delicious and served with a smile. Later that night after dinner we returned to the Hotel to avoid the St. Patrick craziness and had a few drinks in the Severin Bar. The staff was great and treated us like old friends. They even let my wife try some new drinks they were making. The manager even stopped and spoke with us to make sure we were being well taken care of. All in all a great experience as are others have been. There are only a couple of things to keep in mind. 1. The elevators can run FAST when its quiet and VERY SLOW when they are busy. But DO NOT try the stairs as they do not go into the lobby !!2. This is a PET FRIENDLY hotel. But you would never notice until you see a cute dog in the lobby. 3. Valet parking is pricey, ask about where to park nearby like the Mall parking garages.4. Sign up for the Select Guest Program. You will not regret it !! Its FREE and if nothing else it gets you WiFi at no cost.5. There are NO MICROWAVES in the rooms. But there are way to may places to eat on the cheap nearby . Note we actually watched a couple carry a full size microwave OUT of the hotel ?!!6. Do not forget to tip, these folks work hard for you !I did not stay here, I came here for an event in the ballroom.  Although I did not pay for the event, I was an attendee here are my thoughts:1.  The food portions were very small and the food itself was not the best I have ever had.2.  The room was beautiful3.  The set up was amazing.  As well as the flow and layout of the event.  What I would mention is that the host should put up signage to direct people to the bar at the beginning of the event.  We did not know where our event was, we did not know that a full bar and appetizers were being served on the second floor of the ballroom until someone told us.  It was a little scattered and disorganized.  We had the chicken and the portion size and quality was mediocre at best.Overall I would really examine the food options before blindly booking your event here.Stayed here for a week for a work conference.  The staff was absolutely amazing!  They went above and beyond the call of duty.  Special shout out to Amanda (Meeting coordinator?) and ""Big"" Joe in Party/Events.  Joe and other staff members helped us carry many random, HEAVY, and awkward pieces of equipment up the stairs for our meeting.  I also think Omni has one of the best Rewards accounts.Bar/Restaurant - Surprisingly good food.  Had a burger and club sandwich.  Staff was great on both occasionsHotel - Facilities were great - nice looking, well maintained not once did I find anything not working properly during my week stay.  It's an old building, but it did not feel old to me.Room - Great!  Clean. Comfy robes. Great pillows and comfy bed.  nice furniture in the rooms.  Catering for our meetings was decent (I'm very picky)  Service was great!Not my best experience at the Omni but still better than most. I know it was game day but 2 hours to get my car from valet parking!?!This hotel in no way lives up to the expectations I have of the Omni chain, and will actually make me think twice before seeking out the chain again. I stayed here for two nights for work about 2 weeks ago. It had the look and feel of a cheesier chain like Embassy Suites, but that was the least of my concern when I found upon checking into my room that there was a pile of dirty, used towels behind the door in the bathroom. I can understand hotel housekeeping missing an errant hair every now and then, but a pile of dirty towels is unacceptable. The management moved me to another room, but as I didn't get in until late this just felt like an arduous, obnoxious process. The second room was fine. That's as far as I will go. The furniture is old and heavy, and while this is going to sound more snobby than I intend it, there was a boxy tube TV in the room. Yes, it functioned just fine, but you don't expect that at a luxury hotel chain. The internet is also expensive which is annoying when you're already paying more to stay at what you think is a nice hotel. Finally, the restaurant was decent but by no means memorable. The one highlight was the little cafe where it was easy to get breakfast to go, and I also got a great sandwich for dinner later.This is, by far, the WORST Omni I have ever stayed in! It's been 5 years since I've stayed at this particular Omni, and I don't believe they've updated, or cleaned the guest rooms since then either. Yuck!I was in town for the Colts game, and this was the ONLY hotel that had availability. Actually, I was told that the room we booked was the last King, non-smoking available. Who knows? Upon check-in, we changed clothes in our mini room, that would even be inferior in size to a pair of midgets---oh, sorry, ""little people."" Then, I washed my face in our tiny, dirty bathroom. I guess they were short of staff in the housekeeping department this past week.Now that wifey &amp; I were so amused by the filthy accommodations, what was our next course of action? Take a guess! Yep, you're right; we went straight to the bar! The Omni has two bars---one is a filthy lobby bar with an ignorant, dumbass female bartender that doesn't even look as though she's 21. The sign that is posted IN the Omni, clearly states, "" 16 ounce Miller Lite $3."" I asked for one. Dumb bartender {look of confusion} claimed that there was no sign that stated this? I offered to walk her over and point it out to her, but I didn't have the patience. I opted for the $5 Miller Lite bottle. Chug-a-lug, and I was outta there! When checking out the following morning, we gave the Valet a 20 minute notice to get our vehicle. When we walked into the insanely crowded lobby (Colts fans galore) and to the Valet counter, we were informed that it would be another 20 minutes, as there were clearly at least 12-15 car keys in front of our's. Another 45 minutes later, our car arrives. I have NEVER had to wait over an hour to get my car out of Valet! NO EXCUSE! On game days, the Omni needs to be fully staffed! Thankfully, we were able to make it to the game on time.2 STARS: 1 star for the convenient location + 1 star for the low rate$First off let's get the good out of the way: The Omni's location is a plus if you have any business downtown and is only a few short blocks from the Lucas Oil Dome.Now to the negatives:  This particular Omni is a joke. Be aware of the outrageous hidden fees they will charge. $27/night for valet parking, $25/night for a roll away bed, $13/night for internet and the worst charge ever...$25 receiving fee for packages sent to the hotel.  I travel as part of a professional racing team, and we usually stay at a Courtyard or Residence Inn, but our trip to Indy brought us to the Omni.  When you walk in you feel like royalty with how the lobby looks. That quickly goes away when you see how small and outdated the rooms are. The bathrooms are nice with the tiled marble, but very small.  The beds are comfortable, though.I wouldn't recommend this Omni unless it is your last resort. For the price you would expect way more than a glorified Ramada.Great service!  My reservation was accidentally canceled but they got me in then overbooked!  Wonderfully friendly staff. Four stars as the room is nice but not great. I'd definitely come back though.We stayed for one night and were very disappointed in the room and incidentals. The room air conditioning could not get the temperature under about 73 degrees, so sleeping was a problem. The TV remote worked only sporadically. Unlike just about any other hotel of any level, Internet WiFi was not included with the room. These days, for a hotel which presumes to accommodate business travelers, WiFi should be considered as integral a part of the room as towels, but they charge $10 per night. Amazing, especially when the reliability and speed of what is offered is very low end, not sufficient for efficient work tasks. We ordered room service, which was not too bad, but certainly below par. Don't expect to get your car from valet parking in under 20 to 30 minutes, even without a heavy load of requesters. Very disappointing, we won't be back, and we suggest looking and better options readily available in the area. If this hotel was once acceptable, things haver certainly taken a turn for the worse.The location is good to the mall and the downtown restaurants but the interior decor needs updating. I've stayed here 2-3 times over the last 2 years (employer hotel preference not mine) and each time it has been something else. On my most recent visit the shower / tub where in bad shape. I guess I expect more out of a hotel than continuously have problems or not the cleanest of rooms.Location is ideal for all thats happening in dwntwn Indy- the colts, pacers, shopping, dining, clubbing but the hotel leaves less then desired feeling even if the rooms are big. There is a cold feeling and the decor is ok. Not the grand feeling one is used to from the omni chainUpon sitting down to write this review, I originally planned on giving it 4 stars.  On the surface, everything at the Omni was great.  The room was pretty clean, we were able to check in right away, and the price was fairly decent, as we had a group rate for a wedding.  Then I remembered, our toilet was broken for 2 out of the 3 days we were there, and we had to use the toilet in the lobby.  We waited 20 minutes to have the car valet parked.  The bar in the lobby was less than inviting and was fairly expensive.  If you happen to be in Indy, you could probably do better.I met my family in Indy for a quick weekend last month.  My mom found the Omni on hotwire.  After reading the bad reviews, I considered staying somewhere else on my own.  I'm a huge fan of staying in hotels, and, well...whatever.  But my mom woulda been all pissed off at me for being a snob, so I sucked it up and stayed with them.  The hotel was beautiful!   And very clean, they are in the middle of renovating, so maybe the previous reviews were dated?  The hotel was great, very clean and we had a big bathtub.  There were fees for everything, like parking, but you expect that at all of the upscale hotels.  Nothing is free.  And my sister and I went to the bar across the street and washed up, drug addicted, 80's one hit wonder Henry Lee Summer was performing.  But that's a story for another time.","Omni, We need to talk. You swept me off my feet with your great location and reputation. I was so excited to have my friends and family meet you at the wedding reception. I know that an average sized wedding can be a little intimidating but I really don't feel how you acted was fair. I mean, the rooms were booked months in advance with a 3pm check in, and when we got there at 5pm they were still dirty. Your ""buddy"" at the front desk wasn't very helpful either. Granted he did finally offer a drink coupon for the inconvenience of waiting an extra 45 minutes for our room to be cleaned, but they way you talked up the staff, I just expected more. I can overlook my room not being ready, but when you messed up the room of the parents of the bride, my parents, my cousins and my friends from Chicago, I started to have second thoughts about us. Maybe we moved too fast.Were you upset because I chose to valet the car? I told you I am no good with directions and I do not regret paying to park because they couldn't tell us how to get to the back lot. Pointing at a building and saying ""thatta way"" doesn't count. No. It doesn't. And it most certainly is not a reason to give people faulty key cards so they can't get into their rooms. Listen, I am trying to be fair. I know there were things out of your control. I know you had no idea that there would be a million cheerleaders in town that weekend wreaking havoc on the elevators. Or that you would not have hot water on any floor above three for a good few hours... Take care of yourself Omni. I just don't think it's going to work. I've met someone who knows how to treat a girl. His name is Conrad.Great hotel. Reliable wireless internet, very spacious room, very good lighting. I spent five nights here for a convention and was very impressed. I'd definitely stay here again.The people I was working for reserved this hotel for Indy and made it sound to be one of the top places to stay in INDY. Perhaps that's why I was disappointed?The rooms were small to standard size. I felt crowded between my boyfriend and our stuff. Could of used a lil more room. The pillow cases and blankets looked but did not smell clean. YIKES.  Bathroom was a bit small for my taste with a tiny tub. Bummed because the long days at the track required baths to help my feet recover from being in heels all day.Room service charges were a lil much. Automatic 20% gratuity charge applied if you take the $4.00 bag of m&amp;ms.The tv was an average old school  tv with poor quality. I literally couldn't read some of the titles of the movies selections to rent-fortunately the movie/show quality was better.I'm happy it was quiet-last years stay was a nightmare because of noise. It was comfortable but nothing special. They try their best but sorry champagne in the lobby isn't gonna do anything to change the room which is the most important part.My stay at the Omni was death by a thousand cuts.  Stressed out staff, rooms not ready at 5pm, dirty laundry in the halls way past 5pm, small rooms, key cards not working, valet staff not helpful in directing us to self-parking (be forewarned, if you from out of town and don't know where to go for parking - valet parking is $25 a day)...  I think you're getting the picture.  On the plus side... beds were comfy and the location is downtown.  Never again, Omni.Recently attended a wedding here...5 stars for the wedding set up, the wedding, the atmosphere, the valet parking1 star for the bartender ""bill"" who carded me (which I left my id in my valet parked car) and was a complete asshole... let me start by saying, I hate children who under age drink, you are waste to society.. I am 24 years old and look older than that thanks to smoking and drinking. YOU don't have to be a prick about. I am in the industry, I understand carding people, no problem... no id no alcohol I was completely fine with that. I was not fine with him being a complete jerk, I made a joke about my mom was with me and I am sure she would vouch for me, he proceeded to let me know that he would take away my parties alcohol if that were to happen... ok buddy. But get this, he serves both of my YOUNGER sisters without carding them?So the bartender next to him was not carded, I got in his line, ordered a glass of wine and was served. x2. There you go Bill.Planning a conference trip is always an exercise in anxiety for me, knowing how much money I'm going to need to spend on conference registration, sub-par food, ridiculous hotel prices, and outrageous airfares. Since I was going to be chilling in downtown Indianapolis by myself, the conference $130-160 hotel rates were pretty steep. I decided to try <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> just for the heckuvit. Cha-ching! Four nights at the Omni Severin, one of the conference hotels, for $87/night!Upon arrival at the airport, I took the ""Indy Go"" (cute name) Green Line shuttle, which provides express service to downtown hotels for $7. The Omni was the shuttle's first stop. Prepared to get stuck in an $87 second-story closet over the boiler room/kitchen/bar, or next to a construction site, I was happily surprised to be placed on the 8th floor, in a room with a bit of a view, room to walk around, and a cozy king-size bed. A good friend stayed in the same hotel, had to pay the regular rates, and wasn't so lucky, getting a queen size bed in a much smaller room. If you find this piece of info helpful for upcoming reservations, #855 was the bigger room, and  #422 was the smaller one.The bathroom was immaculately clean, and my only peeve was leaky faucets, forcing me to relocate all my toiletries to keep them dry. I did report the faucet problem, so hopefully someone will fix them. I did not use the room service, but the typical $10 bagel and juice, among other expensive breakfast options, were advertised on the nightstand. Skip that, give yourself extra time in the morning, and walk 15 minutes to Cafe Patachou on, I think, Capitol and Washington. There was a tempting tray of goodies on the desk, but $3.50 for a Clif Nectar bar kept me away. Glad I stuffed some Trader Joe's dried fruit &amp; nuts in my bag before I left home. If you're looking for snack food, there's a CVS drugstore at 105 E. Ohio, about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. A coffee pot, along with caffeinated and decaf Wolfgang Puck coffee are in the room. A nice touch were the paper cups with lids, so I could take my beverage with me on my way out. Weekday copies of USA Today newspaper were also waiting outside my door every morning.The Omni also provides wi-fi service. Upon trying to go online, the default splash page provides three choices for access, one of which includes a $9.95 per day charge, and the other two read as if you need to pay for a membership to get the wi-fi. I called ""Blake"" at the front desk, and the good man told me if I selected the second option on the page, I wouldn't have to pay. I did select the second option, didn't pay, and wasn't billed. Staff were very friendly, and always had answers to my questions.Check-out was a breeze, and the Indy-Go Green Line airport shuttle stop was located across the street, past the valet service.I have stayed in other Omni's and by far this is the best. As an Elite member of the rewards club you expect certain thing to go without a which  at this chain of hotels and the Omni Severin exceeds the standard. Their staff is some of the best most attention to detail personnel I have ever been help by. Especially Carly who went above and beyond her work duties to ensure that all guest were well accommodated. If I am ever back in Indy I will defiantly be staying here again. My coworkers where just as impressed with the hotel despite the fact that they aren't even members of the rewards club. They will also be staying in Omni's in the future.They made it all easy - circle drive, the baggage handlers, the concierge, valets - even with our then four-month-old baby, we moved about with total ease.  The room was large and our older one had plenty of room to play on the floor and run around.  Great wi-fi service.  Nice pool.  And best of all, water pressure in the shower that beat us senseless.It's in an area with a lot of conference activity, so plenty of restaurants, shopping and entertainment a short walk away.Stayed here for 4 nights on a recent business trip. The location is right downtown, close to restaurants, the convention center, the new Colts stadium, the Capital building and more. Limo ride (shared) from the airport ran about $13 plus tip and took about 10-15 minutes.The room I stayed in was a nice size and very clean. King bed, work desk with lamp, tv (older tube type, not flat screen), chair with ottoman. The bathroom was nice sized and my faucet leaked on the cold water side whether on or off. I must have been in a basketball player's room because the tub was sunk about 6 inches in the floor and the shower head was on an extension rod and was about 6 inches above my head at 6-ft 1-in.I didn't eat at the restaurant, Hot Tuna. I did have a couple of drinks at the bar next to Hot Tuna and had breakfast daily at the 40 West coffee bar. Beware - it's pretty busy at 40 West with the breakfast rush between 8 and 9 AM.Our rate was $99/night.I stayed at this hotel for two nights 3/28-3/30 and had a great time. The linens were clean and the staff was friendly. I had meetings at the Hyatt down the street and didn't even have to walk outside to get there because of the indoor walk way system of downtown Indy. It's in a great location where there is quite a bit of nightlife and the bartenders at the hotel are really friendly and professional. I would stay at this establishment again. They are going through some renovations but I didn't feel as though it hindered my sleep at all. The work seemed to be done during the business day when you're most likely working.This hotel is in a great location and attached to the Circle Center Mall and all the other hotels and convention center downtown (I was here for a conference).Rooms are large and the bed is super cozy. If you join their member network, you receive complimentary hot beverages in the morning and free wireless internet, along with other rewards. Staff was friendly and accomodating and the hotel is in good shape, and very clean.My big issue was the food - it just was so sub-par. Room service should be a treat... not something that gives you indigestion.Despite my mixed feelings I do not believe I would stay here again.I had the pleasure of staying for about a week at the Omni, it just so happened that the NCAA finals were in town that week which made for a very cool experience.  From the onset the management and staff at the Omni made sure my stay was fantastic.  I received a nice welcome note from the manager as well as some snacks and aqua upon check in.  The staff were attentive in every respect for the entire stay.  The lobby offered a nice relaxing place to catch a game, cocktail and snack.  There is a martini bar across from the lobby bar as well, wish I had found that gem earlier as it offers a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of the lobby.  The rooms were well appointed, although my 19"" tv was a bit outdated and far from the bed, good thing I've got 20/20 ;-) Great place, GREAT location near lots of bars, restaurants and shopping.The Omni Severin in the heart of downtown Indy has a great location, friendly and helpful staff and is my home away from home when visiting Indy.  I enjoy getting out and walking around the center of this beautiful city and can do so easily from here. The rooms are clean and functional. The lobby is open, friendly, and functional. I'll be back the next time I'm up there for business or pleasureI had my out of town guests and wedding party stay here. My husband and I even reserved a room for our wedding night before we left for our honeymoon. They gave me a great rate for guests to reserve a room. They had a block of rooms set aside for people to reserve by a particular date. On my wedding day they held ours and our wedding parties luggage until we checked in after the wedding. As we arrived that night they all checked us in without a problem. However, I had a little prank pulled on me. Still not sure who set this up but they played along with it. When I got to our room, I saw it was a basic room. I was really sad and called downstairs to ask what happened. They said they gave away our room on accident but would clean one up quickly because someone checked out early. So I sat in this room for 15 mins, still confused as to what happened. I get a knock at the door and it was the women who checked us all in. She said, come on let me take you to your real room. When we arrived to the room it said presidential suite. She then said congratulations and enjoy your stay. I went into the room to find the entire wedding party in our room to continue with an after party. I screamed to see how awesome that room was AND to have my friends sharing that moment with me. Later I was informed they put me in the regular room to keep me occupied until my party got to the room to surprise me. The Omni upgraded us to the presidential suite from the suite we reserved because it was our wedding night. We all had great views from the balcony and enjoyed having a few drinks until I kicked everyone out. :o) lol. Fabulous hotel, friendly staff and great location downtown.I stayed here on a weekly basis for over 6 months.  The staff was wonderful and made every effort to make it feel like my home away from home.  You can't ask for better service.Gorgeous hotel. Connected to the mall so it's one of the more expensive hotels which wasn't a problem for me.  My back is killing me right now though.  The mattress felt hard as a rock. I didn't sleep well at all and when I lifted the sheets to look it looked cheap and old. I thought hotels were suppose to constantly update their mattresses.  I complained when I first checked in and nothing was done. No one even knew what brand the mattress was. I complained as I checked out this morning too and the gentleman at the front desk said he would send up housekeeping to check it out. What can housekeeping do?! As much as I would like to make this hotel my go to hotel when I visit Indy, I'll pass and unless you like horrible mattresses you should too!!!!My wife and I just returned from a New Year's Eve French Kiss package stay at the Omni Severin and it is safe to say they have the friendliest staff of any hotel we have ever visited. Although attentiveness is often the norm with this caliber of hotel, the Omni Severin was a standout for the overall sincerity of its staff. From management to front desk personnel to wait staff to the valet team, their genuine interest in feedback and the proactive way they sought it out made us feel truly welcome and valued. My wife and I felt so engaged and were given such special consideration, particularly by Massey, the Food and Beverage Manager that we can't wait to come back even if just for the good will that their evident standard of true service inspired.Of course the rooms were clean and comfortable in the four star tradition in terms of decor and crisp, white sheets on a king sized bed and all the toiletries in a sizeable bathroom. And my wife certainly appreciated the walk-in closet complete with robes for two, but the Severin proved to offer a lot more than simply an ideal, pristine space to sleep. When my wife and I arrived for New Year's Eve dinner in the gorgeously ornate Severin Lobby and Ballroom, we felt even more pampered than we could have anticipated after check in. Worthy of particular notice is the chef, Anthony Armstrong, for his delicious French cuisine that was spotlighted at our NYE celebration. There was a warm sense of community among all the patrons as the emceed event included a short speech by Anthony regarding his sojourn among the French countryside and palate which we all savored heartily in both liquid and solid form. My favorites were the brie pastries with jam, though the entire meal was a formidable treat. Although we all got a small bottle of champagne with the meal, one miniscule suggestion would be to have included at least one complimentary glass of red or white wine with the dinner as it was French themed in the package. We'd of course have been willing to have paid more if added to the package total up front so we wouldn't have to worry about additional transactions later, but this was such a comparatively minor issue compared to the overall experience which was nothing short of spectacular.Before and after the meal, we enjoyed music and an open bar in the ballroom which was an elegant, gorgeous venue for the traditional New Year's Eve countdown. Although the ambiance was thankfully a far cry from the cramped and noisy club and DJ scene we had already grown tired of, the Severin did add some trendy twists with a melange of Franco-American movies on widescreen accompanied by a musical guitar/bongo duo playing classic rock fare in offbeat lounge renditions. Occasionally, I'd hear the first half of a soulful acoustic ballad only to realize later we were listening to none other than Jimi Hendrix's All Along the Watchtower so the hotel entertainment staff deserves kudos for some courageous yet original choices that probably would have struck fear in the hearts of less dynamic hotels.So we counted down to the New Year with more complimentary champagne, more music, good company, party favors, even a garter belt lottery for a free trip to Vegas and by the time 2009 was in its early stages we were ready to head back to our comfy room. The next morning, also included, was a buffet breakfast in the Hot Tuna restaurant. I suppose the Severin could have settled for a standard buffet or continental breakfast with the package, but the spread was replete with fresh fruit, unimaginably light and sweet pastries, bagels, cereal, cheeses, cold cuts, and all the hot breakfast items including personalized omelets which you must absolutely try with the spiced, ground sausage if you are so prone. After being more than sated in the belly, the checkout was so fast and effortless with the pleasant last impressions rivaled only by the first, we started asking ourselves why in the heck we were leaving anyway. Well, we'll be back soon. They've got our email address for the next event. Hmmm, maybe Valentine's Day?Great location since it's connected to the mall with a LOT of shopping plus it's right down the street from 2 clubs (like 0.1 miles walking distance). Can't get better than that. The rooms are clean and the customer service desk is helpful. They will make it right if it is not right and even comped my room twice. There is also a bar downstairs, but I have never bothered to drink there since I go to Tiki Bob's or Have a nice day cafe instead. They have valet parking which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on your point of view. The fee for valet is about $20 a day though. Parking is a bish to find otherwise. The only downside is that the building is older and no lcd tv's.What a beautiful place.  Great service, comfortable room and beds.  And....I got it through Priceline.  My best deal yet.","['writing', 'perspective', 'planning', 'events', 'amp', 'booking', 'groups', 'colleague', 'often', 'book', 'incoming', 'training', 'groups', 'host', 'events', 'absolutely', 'love',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-indianapolis-indianapolis,The Westin Indianapolis,3.5,$$$,106,"The Westin Indianapolis is especially convenient and literally connected via a bridge to the Indianapolis Convention Center. The hotel is also convenient to the rest of downtown, so, if you are a convention-goer like I was, the Westin is a pricy, but worthy option. There isn't a hotel shuttle to/from the airport; however, when I called they recommended an inexpensive shared shuttle service that worked out ok. Once I arrived at the hotel check-in was a snap. In the lobby is plenty of space to meet, hangout or use a computer.My room was outstanding. It was the large wrap-around Directors Suite on the upper floor at the end of the hall with 3 huge windows offering a beautiful view of the city and Lucas Oil Stadium. Two TVs made it perfect for watching basketball on one screen and football on the other while the lounge area really made it easy to relax. The amenities in the bathroom were just ok. The king-size bed was fine, too.Without hesitation, I'd choose the Westin Indianapolis again when attending a show or conference thanks to its convenient and connection to the Convention Center and downtown Indy.Pros: Great location! Next to Convention Center, walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium (you can actually walk to it using the Convention Center skywalk and go through the convention center without ever going outside to get to the stadium), next to Capital building, walking distance to the Civil War memorial, and not too far from Bankers Life fieldhouse (where the Pacers play).Cons: Musty &amp; stale smelling room, windows can't be opened to let in fresh air, missing mirror in restroom, broken faucet handle. Sounded like there was a washing machine being run right above our room... THE ENTIRE NIGHT. So didn't get much sleep at all.Overall price we paid via HotelTonight was super cheap and location was really good. I think if we were shacked up in a better room my experience would have been a solid 4 star here for sure. Til next time!Summary: Location, Location, Location. This is a great hotel. It needs a few updates as the rooms are starting to feel a little bit worn out.  This isn't a huge concern yet, but within the next 12 - 24 months I predict it will start to show. This means that you can stay at a few other hotels in the city and have much newer rooms.Pros: Very comfortable and quiet.  Great location, you literally have a bridge connecting you to the convention center. Usually pretty good rates. Very large property. 24h access to executive lounge. Cons: Parking is EXPENSIVE. I'm talking $30+ a night. Rooms could use a moderate refresh, starting to feel a little old.Upscale, very nice place to stay, a lil expensive, but you get what you pay for. Valet parking is nice to use. Downtown and near everything, just a short walk away. Comfy beds, lots of pillows, good friendly service. All around nice place to stay when away from home.I was booked at the Westin for a trade show held here in Indy. Luckily for me, the trade show was literally a skywalk across from the hotel. But that's not a reason to give it 4.5 stars. As for anyone who reviews a hotel, there are 3 things that I'm sure everyone looks for that need to be on point: cleanliness, customer service/staff and their accommodability. That's why I'm giving it 4.5 stars.Cleanliness: 4 stars.Staff/Customer Service: 5 stars.Accomodability: 5 stars.The staff there is extremely welcoming and warm. They know how to treat their guests and always seem on their toes for service. My flight landed at 11 am and I was at the hotel by 12 pm. Although the check in wasn't until 3 pm, the front desk was kind enough to let me check in early without extra cost and gave me a $20 gift card to their Starbucks located inside the hotel. I had a wonderful experience and would totally recommend this hotel.Great because we got an awesome deal! Breakfast wasn't included but that was ok. Price seems to really fluctuate.Gym is huge! Pool area nice. A huge children's church function was going on here so that wasn't great. Kids swarmed the gym which I don't think is appropriate as well as the elevators. I waited for 3 cycles of elevators but all were full w/ kids so I took 11 flights of stairs instead!I treated my husband to a 24 hour trip to Indy for his birthday. I decided to stay at the Westin because of the positive reviews and reputation. We were pleased with our stay. When we checked in we only had to wait about 5 minutes. We parked in a garage adjacent to the hotel that cost $30/day. Once we got to our room we were pleased! Our room was on the 15th (top) floor so the views were beautiful and it was quiet. Our room was a king room although we both are convinced the bed size was only a queen. It was comfy though! Our room also had a couch, chair and ottomans along with a desk. Very spacious. The only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars was the communication. I booked the room through Visit Indy website because the price was better. I had to pre pay but that was fine. When I called their number one day prior to confirm I couldn't get in touch with the actual location but spoke with someone at a call center. He was nice and all but just couldn't answer all my questions. All and all we had a great visit. The hotel is in a great location and close to walk everywhere downtown. We would definitely return in the future!Stayed here for two nights last month. The hotel itself is very nice and modern, typical of any Westin. I arrived late at night and had no problem checking in immediately, which was a plus. However, during the early morning hours the water was completely shut off. I didn't raise the issue with management on the first night, but when it was still off on the second night I called the front desk to complain. The person I spoke with didn't seem surprised by the problem and offered the following solution: to switch rooms. It was about 2:30am. Obviously we didn't go this route. The following day I spoke with the front desk manager and she comped our 2 nights, which I felt was the right thing to do. We return home, and I see on my credit card statement that we were charged for 2 nights with the valet at $44 a night. We only used the valet one night. So I called to have this charge reversed, which they did promptly. Overall, without these issues, I would give this Westin 5 stars. However the problems we did experience made our stay less than stellar.I stayed Jan 2nd 2016. The staff was nice, check-in was a breeze. The room was clean. Nothing great about it. The bathroom was small but I liked the shower heads. The Westin is connected to almost everything worth doing in Downtown Indy by a walk way. Bring your walking shoes. The only ""thing"" I had was the parking!!! It was expensive for parking at a Hotel in Indy, $30 self park or $44 for valet. The walk with your clothes from the parking garage (self parking) to the room was weird for me.  We decided to stay only because it was for 1 night,  parking is $20ish for the Event we attended, we were with-in walking distance and I found a great deal for the room. So overall it was a very Nice stay. If I found the same great deal again, I'd stay again.We stayed here this past weekend for a bachelorette party. I'll say upfront, I hate downtown. Parking can be a nightmare, especially at hotels. We did miss the entrance which was a bit confusing and had to drive around the block. I had hubby drop me off, because, umm $30 for parking? No.The hotel is very nice however. The rooms were clean and newer, no nasty stuff going on. The bathroom had a cool rainfall shower head and the beds were super comfy. It's within walking distance of pretty much everything, which is really convenient. When we traipsed in past midnight with the wasted bride, the front desk staff didn't bat an eye thank god. I will say $250 a night is pretty steep though. We had a nice view in our room, but it wasn't a suite or anything crazy. A decent hotel experience, I'm just glad I didn't have to foot the bill!We booked a block here for our wedding Sept 2015. Everything went well- we had to ask our account/sales rep to increase the number of rooms a few times because guests couldn't book. The hotel staff is nice and the room was clean. My biggest problem was parking. $42/day to valet park in Indiana! Worst part was I wasn't aware it was so much for our guests until the week before the wedding. When I expressed how disappointed I was that I wasn't made aware before we reserved almost 40 rooms with them I was directed to their director of sales and marketing, Angie, who said that its ""on our website"" then told me, after I found that the Marriott (less than a mile away) could offer the same price for rooms and only $25/day for parking that she'd ""be happy to cancel my block as their was no contractual obligation"". Please tell more clearly that you don't want my business. I asked if vouchers were an option and I was told to call the garage. Terrible customer service and waste of time and frustration the week before my wedding. They didn't comp anything for all the frustration either. If it wasn't the week before I would have switched. Don't block rooms here unless you want your guests to pay an arm and a leg.Very comfortable beds, very clean rooms.The staff was very friendly and helpful.There's a Starbucks on level 1.The fitness center is nice, but the pool is small.The room itself was fine, nothing to really write about. What I struggle with is that this is a major convention destination hotel and the friggin Starbucks closes at 5pm?!?! WTF? Hundreds of people to give potential business and you close at 5? Moving on to the lack of a real bar. Shulas, the steakhouse on the 2nd floor, is their bar. A whopping 7 seats at the bar &amp; the rest are all tables. How about opening a real BAR on the 1st floor where everyone is currently hanging out doing NOTHING. THINK REVENUE people! Convention folks like to spend $$$ and you act like you don't want their money! Huge empty lobby waiting for a bar to pour some booze, make it happen and watch the $$$ ""pour"" in.I stayed in the hotel Friday night and will be checking out Monday morning. The hotel's location is perfect. The hotel connects to the Skywalk, which connects to the convention center, mall, Lucas oil stadium, Marriott and Hyatt. The room was clean, but did have a strange odor. The hotel has a Starbucks, a gift shop and is connected to Shula's. Overall it was a great stay.I've stayed at this hotel five times over the past two years for business.  The Westin is one of my favorite hotel chains. The front desk staff are always pleasant and very efficient. I've always been pleased with the rooms I've stayed in.Comparing the Westin to other downtown hotels, it is a few blocks further from area restaurants, but it's still so close it's not a big deal. The only dining options are a Starbucks in the lobby and a Shula's. For breakfast, if you don't want Starbucks, the Shula's is fairly expensive ($17) and I have never been impressed with their buffet. I've also been to the bar and to Shula's in the evening, and while I love the Westin, given the prices at Shula's I recommend dining elsewhere. For breakfast, Cafe Patachou is just down the block and they have amazing coffee and breakfast. For dinner, there are so many great restaurants nearby or a quick cab ride away. Keep in mind that at Shula's the price you pay is just for the steak an doesn't include any sides. However, if you are traveling for business and get to expense all of your meals, it is convenient to eat there.The Westin is located in a great location, close to wherever you need to go in downtown Indy, very awesome for a girl who prefers walking everywhere like myself.The staff is fairly accommodating here (however if you need directions to a local place you are better off using your smartphone). Concierge is very friendly, they had to hold my bags for me because unfortunately there was no late checkout option. This, by the way, was very inconvenient for conference goers because checkout was at noon and the conference was not over until 2. Better planning for this is in order.The beds are comfortable, conference areas are large which was nice. This is a good place for an event or if you are visiting Indianapolis.From the moment we arrived, greeted by beautiful architecture i knew we'd chosen the right location. I forgot his name, but the gentleman who checked us in at the front desk was extremely courteous and helpful, not only with the hotel matters but also with directions to get around the city. He was an excellent example of how all hotel staff should treat a guest. Also, the gentleman who brought the room service we had ordered to us was very friendly and polite. I appreciated his warm personality. Our server at the Shula Steakhouse was helpful and efficient. We were in a rush to make it to our movie, yet the service was fast and we made it on time. The location of the hotel was phenomenal as we could walk to every restaurant and entertainment venture. We had an incredible stay and I cannot wait for the opportunity to stay here once again.So far a mirror was missing, there were towels for only 1 person, and the safe was left locked. We usually have good experiences at Westin hotels so we're hoping things go uphill. They seem to be responding to the problems promptly.You know what to expect when you stay at the Westin. I stayed here for a couple months for business and was pretty much always satisfied. The beds truly are heavenly as at any Westin. Super comfy. Once you lay down you'll be asleep almost instantly. The gym is good, there were always enough treadmills and ellipticals. There are a couple of weights and machines. The structure for dips and pullups is somehwat stupidly placed so there's no way to do pullups due to the height of machine and being just below the fire extinguisher (hurt my head on it).The downsides are the pillows which are totally flat and there's nothing to them. Honestly, I sometimes just slept on the bed with no pillows.A lot of people think the overhead rainfall shower is nice, but I'm not  such a fan. There's never enough water pressure and I just don't feel I get as good a shower as with conventional shower heads.The breakfast options are also somewhat minimal. The Sheraton has a much better breakfast spread for SPG members.Nevertheless, I'll be staying at the Westin when I'm back in Indy for work.I came here for the weekend for the Brickyard 400. Extremely convenient location. I was a 15 minute drive to the track and a 15 minute drive to the airport. Walking distance (two blocks) to the downtown area - mall, restaurants, bars and more. In terms of location, you can't get any better. I had a great stay as well. My room was clean and the AC worked fine. However, I did request for extra bottles of water to be left in my room and they took my tip and left me one extra bottle...nothing that couldn't be resolved by me asking the front desk. Everyone was super accommodating, the rooms were extremely clean and all in all I had a great experience. Would definitely stay here again.","I was impressed with the hotel when I first arrived &amp; the security of the elevators. At first glance, the room was exceptionally clean &amp; plush pillows, comforts, etc. I saw one thing that made me question everything...the free Disani water bottle. It must've been there from the previous customers because the seal was broken &amp; it was half empty/full, but had the tag still around the cap. The one that tells u it's complementary. After that, I didn't want to touch anything. Good thing I wasn't a drunken mess...yet. I probably would have gulped it down &amp; been the beginning of a zombie apocalypse.Other than that, I liked the location &amp; it's attached to the convention center, that's attached to the mall &amp; other hotels. It's only $10 to get to &amp; from the airport using the GOShuttle.A huge king suite overlooking the Capital right in the middle of Naptown.  We wavered a bit on the hotels in Indy and went with the Westin.  No regrets at all.  We'd gladly stay here again if we were back in the area.  SPG club for afternoon snacks and brekkie and coffee.  Big gym and pool.  Remodeled hotel where we had a big corner suite.  Room included a huge lounge area with pullout couch and a great view.  The only modern touch they were missing was an radio where you could hook up your ipod and rock out, though they did have a few dedicated cell phone charging docks in the room.  Smack in the middle of town where we easily walked to the restaurants, bars and Lucas Oil Stadium to see Chelsea FC beat up on Inter.  Go you Blues!Great location. Disapointing customer service. Our room was 81 degrees because the air conditioning was broke. They tried to fix it 3 times when it couldn't be fixed they only offered Starbucks coupons.  Also our water was not working for like 2 hours very annoying to try to get ready with no running water. I will never recommend this hotel and will not stay here again. I get it things happen but for someone to take control of the situation is lazy costumer service.I've stayed at this Westin four or five times, and I like it. 1) It's clean and the staff is friendly. 2) the on-site steakhouse is a little overpriced for what it is, but there's some good food options within walking distance. 3) pretty good price for a centrally located Westin although 4) the valet parking cost is BS for Indianapolis. 5) the corner rooms have totally baller views of the Indiana state house, if you can get the upgrade.This is not the best Westin in the US or anything, but if you're in Indianapolis this is your best option by far. (Although there's a new Le Meridien opening later this year, and so that opinion is subject to revision.)Great location; great beds, great pool/fitness area, expensive parking and expensive wifi/wired.  This Westin is centrally located and within a couple of blocks to the mall, canal and restaurants.  If you know your way around the connected walkways, you probably do not even have to go out into the elements to reach any of the spots.  The beds are as they say: heavenly!!!  Our room was quite plain and average sized.  The pool, hot tub and fitness area are the best I have seen in many hotels.  The gym equipment is up to date and plentiful.  They also provide towels and water.  The pool and hot tub are clean and not overly chlorinated like they can be at some other hotels. The parking was expensive:  $35 to valet; $28 to self park.  Luckily the garage is directly underneath the hotel so we self parked with ease.  And yes, they charge for wire as well as wifi, except in the common areas.  We would return here if we found a great rate.Typical Westin.  That's not a bad thing, I will say that their parking garage situation is akin to highway robbery.  It's cheaper to park in Manhattan.  Rooms were nice, and the Shula's steakhouse looks quite appealing as well.  Overall, not a bad place to stay and the Hotwire rate was too good to pass up.The Indianapolis Westin is a great option for business people and tourists alike. They've recently redone all of the guest rooms, so most of the pictures you'll see for this business are actually outdated. All new carpet, wall paper, doors, locks, furniture, etc. The hotel has a modern feel, but the furnishings aren't so modern that it'll be outdated in a year. Of course, the beds are to die for, the rainfall shower heads are nice, and it's an overall nice place to stay. Then there's the fact that it's close to downtown and is connected via skywalks to the convention center and Circle Center mall. Many hotels are, so this isn't unique to the Westin, but is an added perk if you are deciding between here and the newer JW Marriott. I haven't been in a JW room, so I can't compare, but with the Westin renovation, I'm sure the room quality is close to equivalent. If you can handle the pricey rooms, this is definitely a great place to stay.I stayed here one night on a work trip, and all I can say is this place is not worth the money. It is in a great location, but there are plenty of other nicer hotels within a stone's throw. First, the room itself was pretty nice, but there were subtle problems throughout. This was not limited to a poorly draining bathroom sink, poor water pressure in the shower, and insufficient (meaning not ONE) plug-ins at the desk (where one would assume a computer, phone, etc. would need to be powered).Second, customer service was lacking. When I called down to find out where the gym was located (since the in-room guide failed to mention it) no one answered on multiple attempts to reach the front desk. Luckily the location was listed in the surprisingly slow elevators.Finally, the pricing of in-room dining was astronomical. I am fully aware that room service never comes on the cheap, but my dinner was over $60 (a salad and salmon entree), and breakfast hit $40 (for a typical two egg, toast, hashbrown deal). You can get higher quality just down the street at the Marriott, and their prices are more reasonable.Stayed here this past weekend during my visit to Indianapolis for the Colts vs Broncos game.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I was able to check into my hotel room three hours earlier than the check in time. The lobby is nice and so were the rooms - honestly I didn't pay too much attention to detail because I was only there for one night.  So, I didn't check out any of the hotel amenities either.  What I absolutely loved about this hotel was the location!!! Right in the middle of downtown and about a block away from Lucas Oil Stadium.  It was perfect. I was able to walk everywhere I wanted. The airport shuttle drops off and picks up right across the hotel. (GoExpress Shuttle $10 each way)I wouldn't mind staying here again during my next visit to Indy for a football game!Stayed here for two nights.  First, the good - extremely convenient location to convention center.  No need to go outside, there's a walkway to the convention center.  The hotel is very nice and there's a top notch Shula's steakhouse on site.  I was on the 13th floor, and had a nice view.  Convenient proximity to several great restaurants.  Wonderful staff.  Complimentary Dasani water in my room.  This room had the best damn shower head I've ever used in any hotel room anywhere.  Now, the bad.  For $230 a night, I expected complimentary WiFi or at least wired internet.  Nope.  They charge for local calls!  Seriously?  It's a nice hotel.  They shouldn't nickel and dime people for stuff like that.  My room had both a mini bar and a mini fridge.  Neither worked.  The air conditioner cycled on and off every 30 seconds. Although there was complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathroom, it was not replenished the second night.  The bathroom is a tad small for a hotel room this nice/pricey.  I'd give it 5 stars, but they need to fix the maintenance issues with the room.  Even with the minor issues, I'd stay here again.It is really annoying when regular maintenance items are not taken care of/monitored the ac is not cooling properly and refrigerator is broken. The room was a lemon at every turn.The hotel was very inviting, centrally located, very clean and the hotel employees were all helpful and friendly. I was SO impressed with the service they provide for workout clothes/sneakers! If you forget them, or don't want to pack them, they will provide you with workout clothes and a pair of sneakers for use. I have never seen that offered before. The room was clean and inviting and the bed was incredibly comfortable. So much so, that my husband and I will probably end up purchasing one. The linens were perfect weight and I liked the bathrobe! My only very slight complaint was that there was only 1 robe. It would have been nice to have 2, but certainly not a deal breaker. I would recommend this hotel to any family member or friend staying in Indianapolis. We really enjoyed every moment of our stay!Great location, central to the mall, stores and restaurants downtown, the canal walk and Lucas Oil. The place is lovely. One of the more comfortable beds I have ever slept in at a hotel (and certainly best pillows).Valet parking is more expensive that I expected, but they also totally washed my windshield before returning my car to me (so many bug guts...).The gift shop/necessities store had things I needed but had forgotten.There is a Starbucks on the first floor. And Shula's Steakshouse on the second floor provided good drinks and a nice breakfast buffet.I was baffled by a sign on the mirror in the bathroom advertising their service for, I guess, basically ""renting"" work out clothing and shoes. That's kind of cool....and kind of strange?My parents are Starwood Preferred members. In previous years for DCI finals, my dad and I stayed at the Sheraton. It isn't much further away, but I like the Westin much more.Nice room, comfy bed.  It would have been 4 stars, but they put us in a room next to the elevator on the 5th floor..  So all night long we could hear the elevator running- which made it impossible to sleep the first night- even with our white noise machine on. :( free breakfast was nice.This hotel if a winner. The staff is very nice and helpful. The location is wonderful and it has a covered pedestrian walkway to the convention center, which is convenient. I had a minor problem with the TV in my room. The engineer who came up was polite and knowledgable. Not only did he explain what was happening with the TV, he set my clock radio which had been blinking since I checked in. AND, because of the inconvenience, he sent me a handwritten note with a $40 room service credit plus $10 to spend at Starbucks in the lobby. Very generous and first class customer service.The room is large and the bed is super comfy. They leave a free bottle of water every day.I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again.I don't know what is/was wrong with this place but the rooms are at issue. Including our janky toilet that you had to wiggle the handle to get it to stop from making that draining sound all night. Don't worry the story gets better...as in better for you to laugh at (our experience) because it starts off Creepy and it's not even Halloween. Service ok. The food service was above parLayout Functional but exiting from the elevator to go to your room or find a banquet/meeting room can be confusing like heck. Key card needed for all rooms above 3rd floor. Pictures posted for your viewing pleasure... muah :*Will write more later.I had a great experience at the Westin Indianapolis while attending the NTEA show.  First of all - great view with the corner room facing south and east. Second - the mgmt turned what could have been a downer into an overwhelming positive!  We had stopped by a winery on the way to Indianapolis and bought a couple wine glasses that looked much like the hotels (except ours had the winery name on them).  Housekeeping took one by mistake and it vanished into the depths of the unknown.  When the staff was unable to find the glass, they apparently drove to the winery and bought two more glasses AND a bottle of wine, placed the. On a silver platter with a very nice hand-written note from the mgmt.  Wow.  I didn't know that kind of attention to detail was available anymore!   Thanks Westin!I worked for a performance company during this past weekends NFL Scouting Combine, where our headquarters was located in this wonderful hotel. The staff was very friendly and highly accommodating. Regularly came by to make sure everything was okay and if we needed anything. Based on their hospitality alone, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to do a conference in downtown Indianapolis. It's connection to the Convention Center makes it very convenient, and there are plenty opportunities for dinning and entertainment within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.We couldn't be happier with this hotel!  The staff are very friendly and any request we have is handled very quickly.  The beds are very comfy and after an evening swim in the beautiful pool we both slept like rocks.  We also enjoyed the newly renovated bathrooms!  Very close to everything downtown.  Love it!Great customer service, spacious rooms, in room dining was reasonably priced except for the high gratuity that is automatically included. I asked for a wake up call and received 2 automated calls plus a personal call to make sure I was awake. Love the linens!","The night I checked in I actually had to have the concierge desk gentleman go find an employee after several minutes waiting at the front desk.  The reservation was a day off after I called to confirm the date prior as the actual check in night. Three nights in a row, my room thermostat has been broken. 78 degrees with humidity.  I have called several times and management has sent engineering to ""fix it"". Actually, they finally sent them the second day and after the second time I called back more than 30 minutes after the first call to figure out the hold up.  Engineering replaced a ridiculously dirty filter absolutely covered in dust and not locked or secured in any way. I had found the filter the day before, asked about it, and was blown off.   For a moment, cooler air blew for maybe an hour. After that the night was spent at 78 degrees with insane humidity. By night three they actually moved my room after I complained for a third time.  This was done without a single offer of a discount or other amenity typically offered when a hotel does not respond to a guest complaint after the first or even the second day.  The only positive was the gentleman from the concierge desk that was willing to go the extra mile for me in finding someone to check me in AND in changing my room.  I don't ever complain or write reviews on yelp, but this experience demanded it. I understand a mix up, but to ignore someone with thermostat issues for more than an acceptable time frame without changing the temp or arranging another option? Inexcusable.A very clean, business friendly hotel! I stayed at the Westin for a few days for the FDIC Fire Conference and man, did they treat us well! Hotel was conveniently located (and attached) to the Indianapolis Convention Center.  A cool overpass on the second floor brought you right to it. Beds were so comfy and rooms very spacious.  The bathroom could have been bigger and I wish it came with a fan, but oh well.. The shower head was strange and didn't have great pressure, but that isn't really important.  What's important is that the hotel was clean, friendly, and convenient.  I was able to print my boarding passes in the lobby, so that was a nice plus.  It was also nice that they accommodated a late checkout for me at no extra charge.  The indoor pool and hot tub/fitness area were also very nice! Elevator was very fast and kinda made me dizzy, but maybe that's just me. Overall a nice experience and I will be sure to return the next time I'm in Indy.I felt a little bit like Beyonce when the nice front desk manager awarded me a free upgrade to a suite...so on my way to the elevators at The Westin I was pop &amp; lockin' to Upgrade U in my head. Too much info? Maybe. Maybe not. I bet you would pop and lock to the room I entered into. That being said, the suites at this Westin are sweet - incredibly spacious with a full front room, complete with a flat screen LG TV, couch, chair, desk, etc. The bedroom was euqally as nice with the famed heavenly bed, nice view of Lucas Oil Stadium and another desk and LG TV. More than enough space for me and adequate layout to get plenty of work done...or veg out and watch TV on either of the screens.The bathroom leaves a lot to be desired, though. While I dig the dual shower heads, the tub was quite small, the water lever finicky and the toilet ran for quite some time after each use. Not a huge deal, but a few things to nitpick over. One other item worth noting about the suite - limited outlets! There were few, if any, near the desks, and no accessible outlets near the nightstands. But, lo and behold, there's one by the couch in the sitting. Well, riddle me that.Other items of note:Room Service: The staff is super friendly and efficient...and they let me order off the kids' menu every time. Why pay $10+ for a Caesar salad from the main menu when the kids' version costs just $4?! As always, prepare yourself for a steep 22% delivery/gratuity. Gym: Decently sized with a fair number of cardio machines and free weights. The pool is connected to it, too. Parking: Is $32 per day. Seems pretty pricey...! WiFi: ""Nominal"" daily fee of $9.95 per day in your room. Again, seems a little pricey, but I had a wireless card, so I didn't experience it firsthand.Starbucks: In the lobby! Talk about convenient. And this particular Starbucks is staffed by some of the sweetest, most friendly baristas I've ever encountered. Extras: For each day you choose not to have your room cleaned/serviced, you earn a $5 food voucher to a participating restaurant within the hotel. And that includes the above Starbucks! Just put the ""green"" tag on your door.I stayed here while attending a work related conference.  It was great because they were connected via skywalk to the convention center, Circle Center mall and other hotels.  I absolutely LOVED this aspect of the hotel since I had my 18 month old with me as well as my husband.  If it got too cold, we were able to walk over to dinner or the mall via skywalk. The service at the hotel was awesome.  Everyone was so helpful.  They also have a Starbucks in the hotel lobby which in my opinion closed a little too early since I like to grab my ice teas during all hours of the day.  They also have a FedEx facility which was so helpful when I had to ship a few personal items back home.  Would definitely stay at this hotel again if I'm in the area for a conference.I was very happy with my stay at the Westin.  I was travelling with my dog and they were very accomodating for him.  The hotel floor we were on was very quiet and had a great view overlooking the government buildings.  There is a nicely manicured lawn area in front of it and the Simon building that was nice to walk around as well.I stayed here this last fall and it was very nice.  I enjoyed the flavored water they offered you as soon as you walked in the entrance. The service at the front desk was quick and the staff were very knowledgeable on the restaurants/attractions in the downtown area.  They could give us very clear instructions to the mall.My only complaint about the hotel was that the toilet kept running.  I called the front desk and was told they were not sure when a staff person could come to address the issue.  I went to the gift shop and looked around and when I came back the issue was resolved.I would stay at this hotel again!By far the nicest hotel we've ever stayed in. The room was immaculately cleaned &amp; the service was amazing! The concierge was extremely helpful when we asked questions as well.  I would say the only flaw was the inability to go up the stairs. There is no key pad in the stairwell to let u on your floor. So if you go up the stairs you can't get to your room.My hubby and I decided very last minute yesterday that we wanted to make it a night out downtown to visit Super Bowl Village and take in 14 West for our upcoming anniversary. Scored the Westin for $80 on hotwire same day. Very good deal considering this is where the NFL is headquartered for the 10 days of Super Bowl.  Fun!  It was all decked out with NFL decor, photos and memorabilia.  The staff was well-prepared, polite and welcoming.  The valets are a bit backed up and I can see them running out of space, but overall, a good experience.Our room has been noticeably updated.  They cannot change the size unfortunately but the flat screens are obviously new and they have purchased nice modern IKEA lamps to warm up the room.   This definitely worth the $80 and we had a nice view of downtown, walking distance to the Village and Convention Center, Monument Circle and the mall.  Overall, a great location for all the events and we were very happy with our room and the staff.  I would not spend $250 or anything b/c there are MUCH nicer hotels overall but for $80 - definitely a great option.There are still some last minute deals to be had; although I'm sure as the big game approaches, it may be a bit harder to get a Hotwire deal like that!Either way, I think it's noticeable that the Westin has made significant improvements recently which I'm always happy to see - especially with the likes of JW Marriott and Conrad less than a block in either direction!  It's about time they stepped up their game.  I'd stay here again for that price for sure.This hotel is way nice!I paid a little bit more during a special event but it was very much worth it.I love the fact that the pool is on the 3rd floorDISCLOSURE: I made money modelling for the Westin brand's launch of ""heavenly bed, who is he sleeping with campaign""The hotel is a nice feng shui to it. I am asian and automatically an expert in all things asio right?! Seriously, the energy of the place is nice. The second floor 5 star restaurant is great. Guys like Mark Cuban pay to eat there even though he is comped at other placesThis place is definitely not my first choice. They call their beds ""heavenly"" but I don't agree. They are very uncomfortable and the pillows are terrible. The bathroom was small and the mirror was cracked. Definitely could use some updates,  especially the 1980s mirrors on the walls. Parking is outrageously expensive.  Will not stay here next time. Oh, and $5 for a bag of m&amp;ms in the mini bar fridge,  are you serious?Located in the heart of downtown Indy, the Westin is a nice hotel option. Clean rooms, nice amenities and a friendly staff make this a good selection for those not looking to break the bank. Walking distance from Lucas Oil Stadium and Bankers Life Fieldhouse as well as the Red Garter and Chick-fil-a.Well not even sure where to start after reading some of the negative comments. I travel all off with being a businessman and professional fashion photographer. The reservations were not made by me and the Westin was not my first choice. However that has changed.Mr Dale McCarthy GM at the Westin, you have assembled one amazing team. From the valet parking staff all the way to the front desk. I honestly do not have a negative comment to share. Yes you have to pay for parking, same in any big city. I seen that was a gripe of a few people, but not much can be done with that. Try staying in NYC It's 5 times as much. I'm sitting in the lounge and felt I needed to write this and express my experience. I travel at least 2-3 times per month. I'm hoping to get more time back to visit Indy and this is where I'll stay. Westin has made me a believer! O'yah Dave in the lounge was a excellent  bar tender and very helpful.The girlfriend and I were in town for a family function and the Colts game.  We stayed at the Westin Indianapolis based on its prime location and walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium.  Having stayed at other Westin properties, I had reasonable expectations for our stay.  Check-in was a breeze.  The front desk staff was friendly and very welcoming.  The Westin Indianapolis has some nice features, a decent fitness center, a small pool and Jacuzzi, a Shula's Steakhouse, Starbucks, and best of all, walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium all under cover which was a real plus since it was a very rainy Sunday before the Colts-Steelers game.  However, all is not rosy with the Westin Indianapolis as it's showing a lot of wear and tear.  The hallway on our floor was poorly lit and dingy looking with worn, stained carpeting, and painted walls with lots of scuffmarks.  Our room, a standard room, had a comfortable bed but the comforter had a terrible, moldy odor, which thankfully was changed out by housekeeping.  The bathroom was cramped and poorly lit.  The shower had an over designed two head system which was pretty ineffective but for wasting water.  In the end, the Westin Indianapolis is certainly not a ""no-tell motel"" with rooms by the hour.  It just needs a refresh.  Call it a 2.25-star stay, rounded down to 2-stars.This was my first time at the Westin. I paid at higher amount than I usually would thinking I would get better service. How disappointing. I had to sign up up into one of there program in order to get free internet. Which meant that I could only use one device to while in my room (I have three, laptop, tablet and phone). The few times I watched TV the program flickered to a point that I couldn't even watch a program. They wanted you to conserve and only provided one bottle of water. Staff was nice but not friendly. It doesn't take much to say hello when you see a customer. The prices for simple things like a water bottle was very high and again staff was not friendly. I would think for the amount of money I spent service would be better.Great hotel for business travel. It is conveniently located next to the convention center (easy covered skywalk has you there in just a couple minutes), there is also a Fedex/Kinkos and Starbucks in the building (phew). They have a nice gym and an indoor pool area.  The staff is great especially Sarah and the front desk who went above and beyond to help us get a few more nights at the hotel during a busy week and clean up our complicated reservations.One night stay on the club level.Check-in: Decent staff. Nothing too alarming or too pleasant that's worth mentioning.Room: I had a corner room. It was smaller than expected. Nothing special- you still have to pay for internet even on the club level. The view isn't anything spectacular and the room didn't have any special amenities.Club lounge in the evening: There were a few cans of soda in the refrigerator, coffee, tea, and water. I had gotten to the lounge at around 8 PM and the food they had out was almost gone. I think it was chips and spinach dip. It was very clean and well-kept. I wish it had some beer or wine in there...Club lounge in the morning: Breakfast was delightful and the male staff member in charge of the lounge was very friendly and nice. He is probably the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3. I was expcecting some muffins and cereal.. I was surprised when I saw hot breakfast with waffles, eggs, bacon and the works.This was the worst hotel experience I can remember. If I could give them zero stars, I would. 1. The contents in the mini bar had been opened before I arrived.2. The refrigerated part of the minibar did not work (not normally a problem, but this time,  I was in the middle of a juice fast and I needed to store some juices which went bad). 3. When I checked in, I opted for the ""no service, and get $5 towards dinner"" program. The front desk assured me they had it noted, and it would be respected. The next day, all the linens had been replaced, and no $5 was ever produced.4. On Monday, I dropped my laundry for same-day service, as I had an important meeting the next day. I was 15 minutes before the published cutoff time. That night, only after I called, they told me the laundry had not gone out after all. Only after lots of arguing did they agree to wash the clothes in an on-site washer-dryer (no ironing, it turned out).5. The next morning, when I went to pick up the laundry (they didn't deliver it), they only gave me half of it. When I pointed this out, they said the had lost the rest.So, now, here I sit, without any underwear, in a wrinkled shirt.I highly recommend not using this hotel.I stayed here for one night &amp; it was an ok hotel at best. Nothing fancy....nothing exciting. For the price I was expecting more really. The beds were semi comfortable but not great, smaller rooms. The shower head was nice, but it leaked &amp; you could never get full pressure because of it. The water never really got hot either. There was mold in the shower as well. &amp; a big wad of hair in the floor behind the toilet. There are definitely nicer hotels for WAY better prices. &amp; the view was awful. I will not be staying here again for sure. If you want a great hotel....try the Crown Plaza just a few blocks away!!Didn't like much about this location.Sharing the cost of a room here with others helps the bite in the wallet.  I don't mind spending a pretty penny on a place if it's worth it, which The Westin was not worth it for me.  On a side note, the best money I have ever spent on accommodations has been The Gaylord Opryland Resort in Nashville.The lobby at this Westin was nice and the front desk staff was friendly, courteous and cooperative except the younger gal in concierge was pretty much useless and unhelpful.  She was clearly just eye candy for the older business gentleman making their way in and obviously not the brightest tool in the shed.My roomie got sick and I was looking for the nearest drug store, and this woman sent me on an adventure to a pharmacy that ended up being closed!  On my return back to the hotel, I expressed my dissatisfaction and she acted like she couldn't understand why they would be closed because she thought all drug stores were 24 hours..grr.  Which by the way, is one thing that sucks about this town is that almost everything is either closed or closes early....I was here Sun-Wed if someone can provide a rational explanation for this observation.The rooms were ok and decent I suppose but a bit dated in terms of decor, plumbing/fixtures, furniture, and paint.The view was ok, I always like big windows for maximum natural lighting.  From my window  could see down toward the hotel's entrance and the water had a murky brown possibly dark peach glow at best.  It had rained my first day so I'm not sure if the water was dirty or was intentionally supposed to look like that.The gym was adequate for my short stay and I did not use the pool.My sheets weren't exactly clean..I will post a photo of what a pillow looked like, somewhat blood stained in a corner...luckily, I only needed one pillow.","My wife and I stayed here while in town to see a Colts game and a Pacers game. You cannot beat this location. Our room overlooked the State Capitol and the hotel is connected to the Convention Center, a mall and Lucas Oil Field by skywalks. Considering it was cold out this was a huge plus. It also has great access to many restaurants and bars that are easily within walking distance. As for the room, the bed was amazing. Definitely will stay here next time I'm in Indianapolis.I LOVE THE WESTINIt always smells like a poolside in the lobby, the beds are ludicrously comfortable, Shula's Steakhouse has a pretty good breakfast buffet for a somewhat reasonable price (compared tot he room service menu -_-).I come here yearly for Gen Con and we have received nothing but the best in hospitality and care. I have no worries leaving my stuff in the room. The hotel is connected by skyway to what seems like damn near the rest of the city: You virtually never have to walk outside in downtown Indy, as everything is connected by tunnel or skyway. It's really quite ingenious and fun to travel as a workout.The workout area in this hotel is also nice with complementary towels and headphones. The pool is nice for laps. Just...everything here is great. I can't like this place enough, especially with the history I have with it from a few years ago...when a water main broke in the main lobby banquet rooms and I was the only one around to report it!!! Great times lolI've stayed at the Westin several times for work travel (and while I was in the process of moving to Indy), and I've enjoyed every stay. The first time I walked through the lobby, i was a little freaked out by how friendly everyone was.  I was greeted cheerily by what seemed like every Westin employee who was working that day.  I've since learned that this friendliness thing is a bit of a Hoosier trait... but it was certainly striking during my first couple of stays. The rooms are nice, although nothing too spectacular. The beds are the typical Heavenly Bed, and they really are great.  The bathrooms were a little grim:  clean, definitely, but pretty worn. Everything was perfectly serviceable, though.  And the views are generally pretty nice, which is always a plus.  The No-Name bar, while pricey, was a great place to catch a drink and a late-night snack.  And the bartenders were really attentive.  In fact, they were very protective when they noticed a guy who had been creepily staring at me from down the bar.  I was oblivious, and was about to leave a couple of minutes after the creeper.  The bartenders stopped me  and had me wait while one of them checked to ensure that the creepy guy wasn't lurking by the elevators.  It definitely added to my overall impression that the hotel is staffed by genuinely nice people.You can't beat a Westin. They are consistent and I LOVE that Heavenly Bed.  Everyone at this hotel was very friendly and the service is always good.  The concierge lounge is very nice and they are very accommodating.  It is a great place to hang for breakfast or an evening cocktail before going to dinner.  The front desk is responsive and the hotel is nice and clean.  I am a slave to Hilton so I can't say I would stay here again, but if you want a nice hotel in Indy and don't have loyalty commitments elsewhere, you should definitely look at the Westin.  It is convenient walking to anything downtown. Great hotel and I have nothing bad to say about it.  Join the Starwood Rewards program and you can get free wi-fi!Very unhappy about service. Confirmed a King bed, showed up at 7pm and they only had doubles. Booked this specifically to spend this night with my wife in Indy, and this was just an unacceptable policy. I would have booked a different hotel, if they would have said unavailable online. No recourse, no one could do anything. I guess they don't think this is important. I do.After a lot of traveling I can say this hotel is one of the BEST I have stayed in.  The Suites are Spectacular and any shower that has not one but two shower heads is A-Ok in my book.  The staff is friendly and courteous, the hotel is beautiful and right next door to the Indianapolis capitol building which is a site in and of itself. It's also connected to a magnificent four story Mall. The only critique that I have is that the elevators require  a room key to access your floor at all hours of the day. Now I know most hotels have this but most of them also don't start requiring this until at least 11:00pm  so that can be a pain if you have a hand full of luggage and food to get your card out just to get the elevator to move. If you ever come to Indianapolis I highly recommend staying at the WestinI want to be kind here for 3 reasons:1. Someone else paid for our stay2. It is a nice hotel3. The staff are extremely nice and helpful.My main complaint? It is so dang frustrating to try to find this place - and it is my second time here! I literally drove in circles for 30 minutes and my GPS kept telling me: ""You have reachedy your destination"" ....and I hadn't! A call to their 800 number was fruitless; they were of no help. Finally I called 411 (a very desperate measure for a man!) and got the hotel phone number (the 800 number was all that I had) and they must deal with this problem a lot. If you press ""#5"" you are given a recorded message telling you to enter a different address into your GPS and a nearby landmark. You people seriously need to fix this - I wasn't the only one that had this problem in our group!Again, a nice place to stay. I'll leave it at that.Great rooms and suites. The service at the front desk is always very helpful. The people at Starbucks here work their asses off fast to help everyone.The gym is small, but the pool area is great. The pool is nice and big, you can do laps , swim, or just relax.Prices are typical of downtown anywhere...but its close to the convention center, the football field, mall...nice location.They ruined their view of Indy with the office building built in their front yard.For the price I paid via priceline, I can't really complain ($126 total w/ taxes for 2 nights).  However, had I not been able to find street parking for free, I'd have been annoyed, even at that low price.Check-in at 10pm was 10 people deep, with only one person working the counter.  Annoyingly, all of us in line got to see 3 other employees peek out from the back room to survey the line length, but apparently 10 separate parties needing to check in was not long enough to warrant a break ending.The hotel's location is GREAT.  However, the main drawback here is the INSANE amount of noise.  I can usually sleep fairly well with moderate noise but the doors and walls do NOTHING to keep the noise out.  Certainly a lot of the blame goes to the rude and disrespectful patrons sharing the Westin that night, but the staff or security should have done something as we were awake both nights from 2-5am on as people apparently stumbled back from the bars.I loved this place! It was gorgeous and clean and everything looked updated and perfect. This is exactly how you want a hotel room to be when you book it. And we completely lucked out and snagged it for $90 on Hotwire! The room was great and I will without a doubt stay here the next time I wind up in Indy. My only complaint is the guy that came to our room at 9am on Sunday saying 'mini bar attendant, mini bar attendant' -Seriously? Waking me up on Sunday? Get the *%$# out of here, I went out last night!Not a bad hotel, great downtown location, but the brown-speckled  probable fecal matter on the toilet when I checked in was kind of a turn off. Plus, wi-fi isn't free. Come on now!So this is a Westin thus the standards are high. For the most part it upholds the standards of a 5 star hotel. amenities are top notch. Decor is modern and very well designed. It has great restaurants although extremely pricey and all other amenities are superb. The rooms are wonderful although the ceilings could be an inch higher I felt a bit claustrophobic vertically. The beds are extremely comfortable. So this is a Westin and as that, everything is extremely expensive, parking expensive, internet not free etc... But this is expected. What is not expected however, is the rude staff for the price you are paying. The front desk crew is dismissive at best lacking the fundamental social skills but that is not even the problem its the bell hop and valet dudes outside. As soon as they understood that we are not paying for parking all bet were off and they turned a cold shoulder to us. My sister actually had to tell one of the to load the trunk with our luggage. This is simply unacceptable behavior for a Westin. The young kid helping us out in the evening was nice though, although he was confused why we came from California to such a dump as Indianapolis. If you are to charge as much as Westin does, make sure you make me feel like I'm getting my moneys worth.It is a great location for any conventions. Love walking downstairs to Starbucks. My biggest problem is probably the room / hallway carpets so gross. I think somebody much have tracked gum throughout our room and hallway. If you walk in our room it is sticky......Stayed here about 3 weeks a month for the past year. Honestly, the Westin is the best lodging deal going on in Indy. This coming from someone who tried Homewood Suites, the Sheraton and random other places before wising up to the Westin. On a per diem, this is the way to go. Yes I am sure the Conrad is nice but my company wasn't about to spring for such luxury on their dime. The Westin has the best staff (Travis and Soraya in particular) and the best gym I have seen at any hotel in Indy. There is also a Starbucks onsite...nothing I'd ever be excited about except in Indy, Starbucks is really the best thing going on in terms of caffeine injections. Skip the onsite steakhouse (Shula's) as it's all about grease though if you must, go there for dinner and order shrimp cocktail with a side of steamed broccoli. Their free hotel buffet breakfast is a greasy joke but for just a few dollars more, you can go right next door to Patachou (yum). So all in all, I'd wholeheartedly suggest the Westin. A great deal in Indy!PS - Got stuck at the Westin during the Indy ice storm of 2011. They gave my colleagues and I a boardroom to work in for three straight days and found some office supplies for us. Amazing customer service, worth 4 stars alone!Didn't pay attention to the fact that this was a category 3 property even though it has the Westin name.  With SPG gold status, was upgraded to a suite but my stay was still disappointing.First off, the towels don't appear ""fresh"".  They're in major need of some bleach and seem really dingy.  The property needs some major upgrades.   There was rust on the bathroom door frame, the shower heads had some major calcium / rust deposits.  During my stay, they were undergoing renovations in the lobby but there was never any indication of is until I arrived.  The elevators were severely backed up and had to wait 10 mins to go up to the room after the conference.Property is probably prepping for the superbowl.Limited food options, the gym is upgraded with new equipment but still a small facility.I'm going to go with a 3 star on this one, I'm a little torn on it because the location, a Starbucks in the lobby and Shula's on site make this Westin a nice place to stay.Questionable: Front desk service, on two different stays I could have had better service.Insanely busy, yet everyone was so nice and welcoming. The manager was genuinely kind and chatty as we waited in line for check-in; the valets were on top of things and efficient. And yes, the beds were every bit as great as I had heard.The only down side was the price of wifi. Good thing I had a mifi with me and saved that cost. Otherwise, a really great experience!I've stayed at this Westin a few of times.  It definitely does not seem as big as it is and the convention people aren't as noticeable as you would think they would be.  It might help that the hotel lobby is in one area and the meeting/convention space is at the end of the building.  Our rooms have always been good quality with the Westin Heavenly beds. The location is also great as most of downtown is walkable from the hotel.Not so impressed sadly.  There was a Colts game getting ready to start while we checked in so the city and lobby were busy.  We got to our first room and stayed a mere 10 minutes when it became obvious that we were so close to the elevator that we were going to hear every Colts fan-happy or sad. I called down and they couldn't have been nicer about switching us to a room on the same floor but farther away from the elevator.  The new room appeared great until we ordered room service.  We had a caprese sandwich and a chicken sandwich, which had some very odd grill marks that were blue???  Then we got into bed-the sheets were clean but there were really weird streaks/stains on them.  It's a Heavenly bed so there are a couple of sheets in the layers and they all had it.  Burning from the steam irons??  They weren't dirty so we went to sleep frustrated and cleared out in the AM.  I should have complained, but just wanted to go and didn't want to sound like a ""princess"".  Won't stay here again.  Bad vibe!The hotel was clean and close to everything downtown.  The price is high if you don't have a discount but eveything in downtown Indy is priced high.  The parking stunned me at $32 a night if I wanted ""in and out"" access to it.  Keep in mind that street parking is free on Sunday if you are in the area on a weekend.  For a fancy hotel I thought they missed a few things.  For one, there is no fan in the bathroom which could have been helpful when people are taking showers back to back.  The second, there was no refrigerator in the room.  We had leftovers our first night and had gotten a case of water to last the week so we wouldn't have to buy it every day.  Would have liked to have that service available.  Third, you get charged for the internet or to use the business center in the hotel for printing/faxing needs.  Of course, these are only problems if you plan on using them frequently.  At least they offered one hour of internet access free every day before charging.  The king sized room was very accommodating and roomy for 2 people.  Did not get the chance to check out the pool or fitness center so read the other reviews for that info.  All in all I would stay here again but now I know what to expect.","I stay at the Westin about once a year for work.  It is among the better ""conference"" hotels I have stayed at.  The staff is friendly and helpful and must have a low turnover rate as I recognize the same concierge, bellhop, and room service attendant every year.The room is spacious but minimal - beware the weight sensory mini bar (and the surprise knock on the door that comes at 8am to replace the gummi bears you must have swiped some time after returning from the bars at 2am).  No spectacular views, but the king size dream bed is as comfortable as can be and the heavenly dual shower is a nice taste of luxury.  Usually I bring my power industrial strength hair dryer with me on trips, even if I know the hotel will have a hair dryer in the room. When I pack for a stay at the Westin, I leave my hair dryer at home.  The hair dryer in the room is a ""real"" one, with normal strength and settings - not one of those weak tiny wall ones that take about six hours to dry your hair.  Room service is adequate but expensive - however the staff could not be more pleasant, quietly bringing in the meal if you are on a business call and not wanting the party on the other end of the phone to know that you are in the midst of having room service delivered, or, bless their hearts, offering to bring even more water and fresh coffee in the early morning after a little too much wine at St. Elmo's. (They also come to quickly and quietly dispose of your tray before your boss can figure out you ordered room service so you don't have to push your tray three doors down in front of someone else's door.)This is a wonderful downtown Indy location, within walking distance to local hot spots such as Ruth Chris, St. Elmo's, the Ram, Lucas Oil Stadium, the Chick-Fil-A in the mall, and hey even Hooters.  I have not eaten dinner at this particular Shula's, just appetizers and drinks at the bar, but it is a nice hotel bar scene.Although I have yet to run into Peyton Manning, I do enjoy my stay at the Westin each year.Just OK. I would expect more from a Westin even if it's just in Indianapolis. The accommodations were fine, but the level of service was not always up to par. Irregular help opening doors, getting taxis, assistance with forgotten toiletries, etc. Most other Westins I've stayed at have super fresh air, but it seemed stale here.i would like to personally call out Becky from Service Express and Thomas from front services.  They are both representative of 5* service!  Becky helped me schedule a much-needed in-room massage upon my arrival and Thomas got me to and from an out of the way destination safely through a contact of his.  I am in the hospitality industry and am very grateful for outstanding service![ Visited in November, 2010 ]I stayed here as part of a a convention going on next door at the Indiana Convention Center. This Westin certainly is convenient to that location (as well as other downtown Indy locations), but I've certainly experienced better Westin locations. The room (as spacious as  it was) could use a good update, and the lighting in the bathroom updated. Cleaning staff is also skimpy on soaps and other amenities. The hotel bar is within Shula's restaurant. It's decent, even if a bit too ""midwestern"".All in all, I preferred the Hilton two blocks away.p.s. Don't park here. Park in one of the city lots (there's one on Capitol) and save a few bucks.I won't stay here again unless my clients insist on meeting at their office.  I think this is the worst Westin I've ever stayed at- and I've stayed at plenty.First of all, why are there only two but usually one person at the front desk? It's a huge hotel! Why don't they have more people?!  Also, why does the phone ring and ring and ring and then you get to a recording that tells you to hold and then rings and rings and rings again. I'm inside the damn building!  How can you not pick up the phone when your guests called!But the worst part? Some girl who apparently wasn't ""feeling"" well, THREW UP all over my floor.  The stench was disgusting.  What did the hotel staff do?  They wiped it up.  Sure enough, the next morning, I could barely even walk out of my room.  I complained and complained and they finally did some sort of carpet steaming. But trust me, they're gonna have to replace that carpet.3 stars for the hotel , would have been a 4 stars had it not been my negative experience with parking.Yup, give us a little more info please.  Misleading information about the parking rate had me - I had to pay TWICE people I parked by myself. THey have no system to check that you have paid and have left and rentering the hotel.  You had to choose valet parking to get multiple entrances and exits. Gosh darn it, then TELL me then. Give me clear expectations and do not post misleading signs on the darn parking structure.yeah yeah yeah- hotel was great. My visit in Indy was really nice. I loveeee the people. Super nice!!!!!!!!!!!!! great service!!!!!! easy check in and check out!!!!!!!!!!But the city owns the darn parking service, and it sucks!!!!!!!!! big time!!!!!!ok i said it.The good:+ The bed. I slept like a rock both nights I was there.+ The rates - if you go on Hotwire. We scored our room for $75/night.+ Starbucks in the lobby. I can't say enough about how convenient and wonderful this was. I live 25 miles from the closest Starbucks, so this was a dream come true for me.+ The staff. They were all very nice without being overbearing.+ The proximity to everything else.The bad:- The walls are extremely thin. We were not all that close to the elevator, but you could hear it dinging its arrival every time it came to our floor. On Saturday night, our very excited, very drunk neighbors were continuing their evening's revelry in their rooms and we could hear pretty much everything.- The ""weight-activated"" mini fridge. First off, you couldn't put anything of your own in the fridge, and if you even so much as moved one of the items, the refrigerator recorded the weight change and you were charged. This would have been all fine and good if they hadn't put a price tag of THREE DOLLARS on the candy bars and EIGHT FREAKING BUCKS FOR A TIN OF SMOKED ALMONDS. At least the front desk guy warned us about picking up the items when we checked in.- $9.95 a day for wireless Internet service? Ridiculous.- The parking garage is somewhat confusing.Barring the negatives (which weren't really a huge deal), I was very impressed with the Westin and would stay there again.Nice hotel, but good luck finding it with a GPS! You can't get to it using the South Capitol address. You have to enter from Washington St, and being unfamiliar with that part of Indy we had to have them talk us in by phone as we circled the block. Got upgraded to a small suite, which is certainly roomy. Dog friendly, with grass right outside the front door. The staff was friendly and efficient. Only stayed one night, but would recommend this as a good business hotel. Only drawback was you only get an hour of free wifi.I was in the process of moving to Indianapolis so me and a friend got a hotel here while I was looking for a place to live. We got the room, 2 phones in the room and neither worked, which sucked cause we wanted a fridge (which you had to call for) we asked for one at 2:00PM and after calling 3 times throughout the day we finally got one at 12:30AM, too damn late, now that is what you call service! This place is pretty damn ghetto, you got to use your effing keycard to get ice, or take a shit in the lobby, ridiculous. I have stayed here and the Marriott downtown, for reals the Marriott is 10X better and is like $10 more a night. Go with them, seriously. Parking here is also ridiculous, if you park then want to go out to the suburbs to get a bite to eat it will cost you $20 more dollars = ridiculous, save yourself the bullshit and stay at the Marriott, I will never stay here again.The room &amp; location are fine but if  you need Internet forget it. They offer enhanced for about $10 a day but good luck getting it to work. You get an hour of the slow speed for free but it's really  slow. Basically if u need Internet you may want to choose a different hotel otherwise it's not bad.I stayed here for 3 nights and it was OK.  Wasn't the best hotel experience and it certainly wasn't the worst.  I was disappointed when we checked in and got to our room though.  They had given us a room with two doubles and not one king (like my reservation confirmation said).  I called down and the front desk manager said that they were extremely busy and he would call me back.  Guess what he never called back....I wasn't surprised.  So my wife and I just dealt with it.  They need to really work on their customer service and follow through.  The rooms were clean and modern however the bathrooms were on small side.The next thing that you should be informed of is that the walls are THIN!!!  You can hear EVERYTHING your neighbors talking about or doing.  People talking in normal indoor voices carry though the hallway and is very loud.  Anyone walking in the hallway and talking will seem very loud to you.The only good thing I have to say about this Westin is that its centrally located and is walking distance to all the local attraction in down town.I would consider the Marriott, Hyatt or the Omni before staying here.I gave this hotels second  chance and had a recent over night stay at Westin. Not much had changed in the years since I last stayed, though I am sure they put some improvements in for Superbowl. Hall ways are dark and creepy especially for a girl by herself. Checked in on a Tuesdays night room book through price line, so i was on the 5th floor and I am not sure how packed they were but i had a lovely view of the roof and construction, so i am sure that others had downtown views. the room still has the super sensitive fridge, but this time they had signs up telling you about the charges. big downer to stay was that the pool and hot tub where closed for floor relations and the roof was being worked on 8am-5pm. so not only did i miss out on the hot tub i got to wake early by the banging.. its a great place to stay if you just want to be convenient to downtown but seems that they are to many chefs in their preverbal kitchen.  bed was hard, liked the key card elevator access and shower was too complicated. :)The beds here are amazing.  They call them the ""Heavenly Bed.""  They definitely live up to the name.  Some very good sleeping.But, I was also here for a convention... and the way they set that up and another thing knocked them down from 5 stars to 3 stars.First star lost for not having enough outlets in enough places w/in the banquet halls where the convention was held.  This is the laptop age and every convention space should have ample outlets.  I would say a good rule of thumb is one outlet for every 3 people attending, especially as this was an online marketing conference.  Other technical conferences I've been to ran extension cords ending in surge protectors under the tables so that everybody who needed electricity had it readily available.Second star lost for having horrible rough scratchy toilet paper, both in the rooms and in the public restrooms.  This is not a cheap hotel.  I would think they could afford decent TP for my nether region.  This is just one of the unforgivable hotel gaffes like dirty sheets or lipstick on the drinking glasses.  Westin, cough up the dough for a ""Heavenly Bathroom"" with ""Heavenly Toilet Paper"" instead of that hellish stuff I had to use last week.So, if you're traveling and you want a good night's sleep, the Westin is probably a good place to go, just bring your own TP for now.ps.  I just docked them another star.  I forgot that they now started charging for internet use.  I'm pretty sure the year before that they did not.  Boo!This Westin has the green choice door card that declines room service for the next day and in return gives you a $5.00 voucher towards food vendors in the hotel.  So it paid for my espresso and oatmeal every morning.  The showers take a long time to adjust temperature and we did find a cockroach in the lobby.  Maybe he was here for one of the dozens of conventions going on.  He sure ain't in town for the food!Not a bad place to stay. Am here for a conference, and it is the smoothest conference I have ever attended. The hotel has everything he attendees need. Rooms are clean, halls are easy to get to, etc. The beds are VERY comfy. The location is great - can easily walk to bars and restaurants. Not too far from the airport. The bathrooms need fans. I did not eat at the Sula's the onsite restaurant, so can't comment on that. I tend to avoid hotel restaurants as we all know the prices are typically inflated. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area.I have stayed at this hotel many times while visiting downtown Indianapolis, and I enjoy it every time. The bed's are great, I just may like them more than my own at home. They say they use some sort of ionization process or something to clean the air in the rooms, I don't know, but whatever it is, it seems to work great. The place always seems to just smell clean. Being attached to the convention center is a huge plus. I can go from my room, through the massive convention center, and into the several other hotels, the mall or even the beautiful Lucas Oil Stadium without having to go outside. This is a huge plus, especially if you've ever been to Indianapolis during February. After the work day is done, I can hit up Schula's Steak house for a great steak and conversation with the bartender's Troy or Dave. Later on, there is a great little local bar next door called Loughmiller's, where Todd the bartender pours em stiff and can talk golf, or just about anything until it's time to make it back to my room.OK. my husband and i stayed here just a random saturday night, after dinner and drinks in downtown indy. i'm not sure if we're just spoiled by our amazing bed at home... but the bed was very uncomfortable. and the sheets were crunchy. and, by accident, the bottom sheet came untucked and there was blood stain on the mattress! uck! paint was peeling off the vanity in the bathroom. room was small. view was nothing spectacular. honestly, we recently stayed at the sheraton in downtown indy and it was a much comfy-ier experience. rooms are more updated at the sheraton (and much better view of downtown indy). with all of that being said, the service at the westin was attentive and friendly. but save the money. stay at a different hotel in downtown indy.nice place very clean. the parking in down town indy is not good when there is a game!Staff is very courteous!!  The rooms and overall appearance of the hotel is comparable to a holiday inn. Not westin standards.I stayed at this hotel for a week due to work and found the access to the Convention Center (where I was everyday) very convenient.  Having Starbucks downstairs in the lobby was also a very key factor! On the 3rd floor they have a good sized gym with modern machines and the pool is attached which made fitting a workout &amp; a swim into my schedule really easy and nice.  The room I had was a good size with a flat screen tv and a nice view....pretty basic hotel room.  However, the real perk to staying at the Westin was their ""Heavenly""  bed which made being away from home bearable.  A quick tip is that they sell all the bedding in a catalog (look in the desk drawer) so you could aways bring the Westin bed home too ;)","['especially', 'convenient', 'literally', 'connected', 'via',
