http://www.yelp.com/biz/motel-six-memphis,Motel Six,1.5,$,11,"Convenient 5-minute checkin. Got the key and dashed to the room. TV could have been a little bigger but other than that, met most of my expectations. Free coffee in the mornings!I am here and I am terrified! Cockroaches and a smell a horrible smell. Like death rising to choke me to death with bed bugs.Pros: friendly helpful staffCons: damp floors, pubic hair in the towels, NO hot water, terrible smells, panhandlers, woke up the next morning with some sort of bites on my legs, that I developed hives from...possible bed bugs but we saw spiders too.This motel 6 is terrible. It smells. Outside smells like pee. The elevator smells like pee. The room smelled like musty feet and wet ashtray. The ac looked like it was dropped in a pool and it barely worked. The furniture was warped from being damp. Also, the rooms haven't been updated since the 90's. And they charge extra for internet. Everything about the experience sucked.Holy crap, you guys...this place.  We were on a cross country trip and stayed in a Motel 6 in Nashville and had a great experience.  This place couldn't have been more different.  We got in the elevator URINE SMELL!  Got into the outdoor hallway URINE SMELL!  Got into the room STRANGE ODOR COMPRISED OF FEET AND CIGARETTES.  The front desk called to see how the room was.  We told them that it smelled weird and she offered to come up and spray some Glade around.  The carpet was generally damp and the television was from the early '90s.   We didn't feel like looking for another place, so we burned some incense and sprayed some bed bug spray around just in case.  All I  all, the lesson I learned from this was to listen to Yelp reviews.  Yeesh.Wi-Fi? No, Clean? No, Appearance? no. Location? nope. Safety? No. All these factors make this a terrible hotel to stay at. You first notice when you walk up to check in in the middle of the day that look like prostitutes individuals that look like they use drugs, transgender men and women, and possibly homeless or street people. All of this at check-in which took about 30 minutes. Coming in n out of the front office door, after receiving the room she a quick check was made. In the room really didn't appear as though it has been maintainin up cap for. Of time. The carpet was dirty, the desk the tables were in disrepair, which means they had stains and other markings on them. The air conditioner or heater, didn't work very well and it had an odor. The bedspread was probably filthy if David on during ultraviolet light the sheets were slightly dingy. and you get the bare minimum wash cloth towels and toiletries. The room smelled of I still older, and the door locks didn't appear to be as accurate as they could. Located behind a gas station with lots of traffic, and really no privacy, as stated earlier the street had a lot of different types of individuals. Not a good look not a good hotel not a good stay for any price. if this app could give 0 stars this one would get a negative one.BED BUGS!!! Stayed here for one night and the next morning my girlfriend and I discovered that we were covered in bed bug bites. I would definitely not recommend staying at this property. Very dirty and disgusting. When my girlfriend called the office the next day, the lady who answered the phone just brushed off our complaint telling us not to worry and that they were probably just mosquito bites.Just spoke with Teresa at the Motel 6 corporate office and she said that there is an investigation going on right now. I will update with results.I've stayed here numerous of times for Memphis in May festivities.  I never felt unsafe and this location is nowhere comparable to the ghetto.  Everytime I stayed here it was an all girl have fun kind of trip. I wouldn't recommend this as a family place to bring kids.  It's Motel 6 , what do you expect??? The location is about a 5 min drive to Beale St.  The location and cheap price is what always brings me back.  The rooms were always clean but I always spray everything down with a bottle of Antibacterial Lysol.Stayed here for 3 nights. Didn't have high expectations, just a clean room and a bed. The first day, no one cleaned our room. We came back in the evening and the bed was still un-made, everything was as we left it. I thought maybe it was because it was a holiday. The second day, they did clean our room, but did not replace our towels. Just took dirty ones. We realized this after my husband got out of the shower and had no towel. I called the front desk to get some more, and they told me they ""didn't have any down there"" and would have the housekeeping staff bring some up when they got there. Never happened. The tub was dirty, room was tiny, and tv was from 1990. Stay away.Rooms not great... I've been in a lot better, bugs on the floor... Got a non smoking room and still smells like smoke &amp;&amp; in the ghetto very disappointedUnderstanding what a Motel 6 is, helps, so does understanding you're in downtown Memphis. It's a good place to lay your head and it's close to all the good spots. While the area is kinda shady, I've stayed here a bunch of times and I've never had a problem. Remember, it's Motel 6 not the ritz Carlton.",,,,,"['convenient', 'minute', 'key', 'dashed', 'room', 'little', 'bigger', 'met', 'expectations', 'free', 'coffee', 'mornings', 'terrified',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-memphis-poplar-memphis,Hampton Inn Memphis-Poplar,3.0,$$,13,"Fast and efficient check in. We arrived close to 10 p.m. on Christmas evening. The person at the front desk had a list of restaurants and pubs that were open. Very valuable as we were hungry and most places were closed.The room was cean and updated. Breakfast was great. Anything from eggs and sausage to waffles to fruit &amp; yogurt to cereal. We would stay again if ever in the area.Rooms are small and tight. The hotel is located off a busy street ( popular)so noise is a factor, however the front desk service is great! The gals here are amazingly friendlier than any location I've stayed at and I stay at a lot......Service is everything!This is what you expect from a Hampton Inn. We skipped the breakfast because they were exceptionally busy on a Saturday morning. The room was clean and comfortable. The area of town is fine to stay in.I stayed here for a total of ten minutes. Not through the fault of anyone, but an act of the Big Guy upstairs. I pulled up after long day of travel and inspections to find a very bad thunderstorm had knocked out the power. I noticed this very fast when the firetrucks in the parking lot and the majority of the staff standing outside.The one counter person I did speak with was very polite and took the time to speak with me when I asked what my options were when I figured that I would not be staying here for the evening.""The Good""- The staff interaction I had was polite and cordial given the situation.""The Meh""- I would have liked to have stayed here but next time :)""The Bad""- Nothing bad that I could comment onFilthy room. Killed lots of bugs. Will never stay here again. Bathroom was not cleaned well either.We stayed here Memorial Day weekend 2011 and it was a great stay. The stay was top-notch, the accommodations were exactly what we needed and expected, and we were close enough to the touristy areas to make the drive fairly short.Two quick gripes: I don't know why the pool was closed. It was hot outside and I could have used a nice dip in the pool. The free continental breakfast was a bit of a mess and they couldn't keep up with the demand of the patrons.We would definitely stay here again. It was an above-average experience.Its ok, but I am a frequent visitor to Memphis.  the staff is fine, but it simply lacks some amenities I desire (frig, microwave, etc).  also, many of the rooms have bad elec. outlet schemes.  The shower curtains are too short for the showers, this is dumb.  So, the staff seems fine, but the managers made some poor decisions.  The restaurant across the street (Newts, whatever) has good soups.Oh yeah, Wifi is unpredictable and very slowWow. I'm REALLY surprised at all the negative reviews! This is our sixth road trip between Texas and Massachusetts, and we're always looking to shave dollars off our quick, nine-hour stays. This Hampton's $89 rate is on the higher side of what we usually pay for a highway layover, but I still think it's a pretty good deal. And we loved the accommodations: everything was very clean, staff was professional, no odd smells, very quiet, comfy beds, etc. The free breakfast had some nice touches as compared to the usual chain hotel fare, including a choice of light or dark roast coffee.Anyway, I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before staying here, because I wouldn't have done it, and we would have missed out on a decent deal!I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hampton.  The location is central to numerous restaurants and shopping choices.  My room was clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was typical Hampton.  I was concerned when I checked in about the very limited fitness center (just a bike, treadmill, and eliptical) but that was quelled quickly.  The hotel has an association with a full service gym (Dac Fitness) just down the road - all I had to do was show my room key in order to use the gym every day of my stay.  The staff was friendly and provided excellent customer service - something lacking in many locations today.  This will be my hotel if I return to Memphis in the future.The rooms were decent, but I didn't like how it was just a shower (no tub). Given there are other options in the area that are not much more expensive, I would go with one of those over this place.Awful! After 50+ years of extensive traveling, i should have been more concerned when i saw the complimentry ear plugs on the night table. A first for me.  Enough said??? Trains nearly shake you out of bed often and loud throughout the night. Not up to the standards of  most hampton inns. Very very small room. Old. Few outlets in room. Small desk pushed half into wall. No other chair in room.If you recently lost a lot of your pubes send me an email.  I found them...they're in the bathtub of room 425.I am a huge fan of Hampton Inn because I have stayed at so many that each one is better than the last.  This one is no different. Room was clean and didn't smell bad. Plenty of towels in the room.Breakfast is free. I love the waffles.",,,,,"['fast', 'efficient', 'check', 'arrived', 'close', 'evening', 'person', 'front', 'desk', 'list', 'restaurants', 'pubs', 'open', 'valuable', 'hungry', 'places', 'closed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-memphis-airport-conf-ctr-memphis,Holiday Inn Memphis Airport - Conf Ctr,2.0,$$,13,"Nice hotel, room was clean and comfy, staff very nice. Probably one of the prettier HI I have been to recently. The walls seem really thin, though, as this is the first HI I have stayed at where I woke up to my neighbor's alarm, and left the TV on while working in the evening so that i wouldn't hear the neighbor on the phone...Loud slamming doors throughout day and night, low water pressure, barely any hot water, several members of our large group became sick from eating at their restaurant. Started to get a sinus infection/allergy reaction from their AC system. House keeping made it seem like it was a privilege to have our room cleaned and made minimal effort at the process.  They were probably the source of most of the doors slamming.Without going into details, our group had to stay there. If it were my choice, I'd never go back again.Attended a conference at this hotel. Recent renovations which were nice but the staff was awful. The conference rooms were hot &amp; the air was not working; the manager took forever to try and assist and still did nothing when found. The maintenance guy was amazing and found fans for the grand ballroom to comfort us a little. The bedrooms were nice but some of the other conference rooms had ants crawling on the floor and a large container of trash was left at the end of the hallway for almost 2 days until the manager finally came to move it after all of our complaints. Lastly, it rained while there and the entry way and conf room #9 or 10 the ceiling dang near fell in (see pics).  Upon booking our conference at this hotel, we were promised none of these situations would happen and everything crashed once we arrived. I wouldn't advise this hotel for any conference and only an overnight stay if stuck in Memphis for a day or 2.  2 stars goes to the maintenance guy and the upgrades to the guest rooms.I have stayed in Holiday Inn hotels all over the US and other countries, they are one of my favorites. However, after staying at this location for SEVERAL days,  not sure I want to stay with Holiday Inn again. Convenient to the airport, YES but services and cleanliness.... Not so much! Not to mention the NOISE and no I'm not talking about planes, I'm talking about the slamming of doors constantly, the ""questionable "" people coming in and out of the lower floors, the LOUD music of ""somebody "" dropping off or picking up ""people""....... I am not usually afraid at a hotel but this one, sure do wish I had some protection.Really outdated for the price. I took a cold shower and the front desk girls were more interested in talking about where they had their ""nails did"" then to correct the issue. I was only letting them know so the next person didn't have to take a cold shower on a chilly morning. It was really noisy come 3:00am with people slamming doors and hanging out in the main lobby. I arrived around 12:00am and it was pretty scary out in the parking lot. I did see a security guard that was smoking out front but he didn't seem very concerned about my safety. I also had to roll up a towel as there was a really big gap under the main door to my room. Anyone could have looked under it.  I will say I did get a free breakfast coupon from a lady behind the counter that saw that my complaints went unnoticed. It was very convenient from the airport. The bed was really pretty comfortable once you get past all the late night debauchery.This is by far the worst Holiday Inn do not expect to be able to load a webpage because the wifi is so slow and if you're hungry I would think about eating somewhere else do not expect to get what you ordered or a correct meal.   And make sure you lock up your personal items if you leave your room we had one of our coworkers have his wedding ring stolen out of his room also on two different occasions I noticed that they had gone through my bags while I was out.  We stayed here for over three weeks for work.  After enough complaints our company finally moved us out of there.This hotel was good enough if you're unexpectedly stuck in Memphis. The hotel needs updates in general; it is old and outdated.  My the bathtub was so filthy that I didn't even consider taking a shower.  Even if I wanted to shower hot water was not an option.  The water was ice cold!  The room was either freezing cold or sweltering.  The blinds in the room did not close so I was awake with the sun. The breakfast was less than appetizing so I kept my $11 and waited to find some food at the airport. If it weren't for the extremely nice staff, this place would be a zero. The people who work here absolutely save this place. They are helpful, attentive and friendly. The management better hang on to each and every one of them!  Take the airport shuttle! The driver, Brian, will having you laughing the whole way!I chose this hotel because the pictures online looked promising. Boy was I wrong. Right when you arrive, there is a security guard with a badge who is waiving off many homeless people (this is a rough neighborhood). I walked in regardless because I had to fly out the next morning and this is close to the airport (it's one virtue). The concierge and reception has three incompetent and lazy people. Two were chatting with maintenance people and feigning busy demeanors. The third was gossiping with a friend on her cell phone and rudely told me ""I'm busy. Wait ten minutes.""  When I finally got a key, the door was jammed and would not open. A maintenance man used his right shoulder to force it open with serious force. He then said ""it is not budged"" in slurred words as he stumbled. Given his glazed and blood shot eyes, I have to assume he was drunk or on something. Moreover, he was staring at my luggage, as if to steal it. Given that I arrived around 9pm and was too tired after two flights to switch hotels, I decided to suck it up. I will never go back. Stay in downtown, the 15 minute uber ride is worth your time and money.Wow what a beautiful place. It was not looking so good a few years ago. But now this place looks amazing.  The food is top notch. And in a hotel. Wow. Simply amazy.Terrible! Will NOT be going back! Service is nearly non-existent. Stayed for 2 days. Asked for clean towels at the end of the first day, because the room came with 3 and we're a 4 person family. Was told sure, no problem. Towels were never brought. Called again in the morning around 7:30, was told I have to wait for housekeeping to come in at 8:30. Ok. Towels still never brought.  Walk down to the desk to ask about the pool and ask for towels. She said the pool was closed and she'd have towels brought to our room. No sign anywhere in the hotel about the pool being closed. And STILL NO TOWELS. ""Recent remodel."" Our bathroom faucet was so loose, you had to hold it in place with one hand and turn it on with the other. Otherwise it just moved the whole thing. There was no ventilation in the bathroom, so if you took a hot shower, it steamed up the whole room. The door didn't line up, so if you wanted to lock the dead bolt, you had to push it in with a shoulder while you turned it. On the plus side, it was relatively clean. We were on the first floor, so didn't hear any planes from the airport. Lots of parking lot cameras and security patrolling, so it didn't feel terribly unsafe, even though it wasn't the best neighborhood. And the staff was polite and tried to be helpful. Just didn't seem terribly confident. Do yourself a favor, pick another hotel.Old hotel. Tried a renovation but still feels old. My door won't close when I leave unless I put the key in to unlock the door then shut. The faucet in my room only exhausts hot water. It's an odd hotel. Feels musty. Wouldn't suggest.Nice new hotel. Rooms are modern. Gym was awesome. It's got a huge space in the basement with stationary bikes, spin bikes, treadmills, weight equip, and free weights. While the equipment was very new, some were not working properly but overall it's a great space. Had a quick dinner at the restaurant/bar. Had great veggie quesilldias and was served quickly. Rooms aren't fully sound proof and being next to the airport is a bit loud, but if you're here for convenience of being close to the airport, it's fine. There's an on demand shuttle to the airport 24 hours a day, which is super convenient. I'd totally stay here again if I were traveling for business.Hotel itself is nice but the food at the restaurant is ghastly and overpriced. The breakfast buffet is over 10 dollars and everything is over cooked. I also had dinner there I had the salmon it was grey and rubbery. Soda from the fountain is flat and 2.50. I wouldn't stay here unless you have a car to drive to get some food.",,,,,"['nice', 'hotel', 'room', 'clean', 'comfy', 'staff', 'nice', 'probably', 'prettier', 'recently', 'walls', 'seem', 'really',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-memphis-i-240-and-perkins-memphis-4,Fairfield Inn & Suites Memphis I-240 & Perkins,3.0,$$,15,"Stayed here for one night during my road trip... check-in was easy... friendly staff... things that needs to be worked on...- water pressure in the shower and the sink- elevator - was scary riding the elevator, it was shaking as it stopped as if it was about to drop- exercise room - granted it was small, but it was dirty- wifi is slower then turtleOverall, I would stay here again, but I hope they will spend some time and money for some improvements.  The beds were very soft, but good enough to spend the night.This is a nice hotel with a very friendly staff. I believe her name is Jasmine she was very great. When I was stupid multiple days in a row and could not get on the Wi-Fi she helped me.Overall the facility is clean and the rooms are nice and comfortable. They have a great breakfast spread in the morning. I've seen bigger spread that other Marriott but this was a small hotel and they had a nice amount for their population.  Their gym on site is tiny. But they have a coupon for you to go to another gym for a week pass. Someone else's review said the gym was in walking distance. I have no idea where the gym was because when I looked on the computer it would like it was 10 miles away. I'm not driving 10 miles to go to the gym. So that would have been nice to actually use but oh well. Depending on what you're doing their location is great. Super close to the airport and easy to get to. And really not too far from the heart of Memphis and lots of the touristy things to do. Nice job overallConsidered a rough neighborhood in Memphis, but seemed safe enough to me -- and I've traveled nationwide. Everything was fine. But you can tell it used to be a lesser brand property -- their cosmetic and management changes can't conceal the fact that the walls and floors/ceilings are thin and that the hallways are narrow. But, hey, the price is right, the location is good, and it's true to the quality of a Marriot Fairfield. I would stay here again.We're staying here during vacation. They don't have enough towels, the non-smoking rooms smell like smoke, the pool is disgusting and our room wasn't cleaned until almost 4pm. I was told there aren't enough towels because they keep being stolen, maintenance doesn't work weekends so the pool is untreated and no one knew why housekeeping didn't come after being called 3 times. The positive, the breakfast isn't bad and there is plenty of parking.I complained to Marriott about the poor service. The hotel manager took $10 off our bill.I stay over 75 nights out per year and this is by far the nastiest marriott I have been to in a long time. The positive is the staff were very kind. The negative is that this hotel has not been updated since Bill Clinton was in the White House!  The ac unit only partially worked and there was mildew in the bathroom. An overall tell tale is that the two front doors are hard to open. I'm surprised Marriott allows this hotel to be in this condition!Staying one night to catch an early flight in Memphis.  Terrible wifi, poor toilet pluming, worst fitness center ever.  The room is comfortable and clean.  That's all.It has the comfort and cleanliness that you would expect from a budget Marriott. I have stayed here twice.. Reason: Business TripPros:Good location if you are conducting business lat one of the many DC locations in OBranchShares a partnership with a neighboring gym, in walkable distanceRestrooms and beds are clean, and staff is friendlyFree breakfastCons:Decor and aestheticsBeds feel cheap (but clean)Parking can be tough if the hotel is at capacity and the neighboring gym is busy..Traveling across states for work... Decent value for the rate (used Hotwire). They also had pretty decent breakfast. Even had walnuts as condiment to accompany cereals.Stayed here twice during my recent road trip, on the way to PA and on the way back.The only issue I saw was that parking could get tight if they get really busy.Service by the staff was great.  The room (yes, I had the same room twice) was clean, quiet (even though next to the elevator) and comfy.I'll be back on my next trip through Memphis.This place is a dump. the rooms appear to be nice and clean but they are very damp and dingy. Upon check in I had to get my room switched twice until I finally found a room that I  could get into and once I was able to get into the room that the air conditioning worked. The bathrooms are pretty well used and not taken care of and there isn't much near the hotel as far as food options. The area is actually pretty unsafe and I would bet you can find a better deal in safer area.1. The gym is full of gnats. I HAD to run after a day of tough work and it was the worst (short) run ever. 2. It took me ten minutes to get the shower on. Plus five minutes to figure out the temperature because the knob is broken. 3. I can't turn the shower off. I called and they don't seem concerned and I'm still waiting. 4. I would like to sleep at some point tonight and I am not pleased!!40 bucks off Priceline name your own price. Clean, with pool and gym, free parking, free breakfast, free wifi! Great bang for your buckVery clean, manager was VERY accommodating and the staff was very friendly.As usual the Fairfield didn't disappoint!! The room was clean, the staff was friendly, the breakfast was satisfying and the shower head pressure was wonderful after being on the road all day and most of the night.Do not stay here!!! We were robbed traveling through to Florida and they did nothing to help but shrug there shoulders!!!",,,,,"['night', 'road', 'trip', 'check', 'easy', 'friendly', 'staff', 'things', 'needs', 'worked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-memphis-east-sycamore-view-memphis,La Quinta Inn & Suites Memphis East-Sycamore View,3.0,$$,18,"I've never had bad luck so far with La Quinta's before. Their pet policy is perfect as I was traveling across country with two cats and this was the last night before a 10 hour drive I had to make the next day. Rooms were clean and safe for pets. I even had a personal note from the lady who set up the room for me! I'd stay with this hotel chain again. Especially with their outstanding pet policy.The price was reasonable, the location worked for my travels and the staff is very nice -- but I found a live cockroach in the bathroom. I mentioned it quietly to the front desk clerk and he was apologetic, saying the manager would probably contact me and adjust my rate. I didn't hear from anyone at the hotel, so when I checked out I mentioned to the front desk clerk on duty that day. She too was apologetic and said she'd let their maintenance person know.This was my second stay at the property, but will probably be the last.If I could give it no stars, I would. This had to be the worst customer service I've ever experienced. After waking up to find our car missing from the lot, the young girl at the counter was completed unapologetic and even laughed at us a few times. She also proceeded to keep switching up her story as to why it was towed away. We asked her several questions out of liability and she refused to tell us her name (we got it anyways).As my wife and I approached the hotel, she had a sense of deja vu. It turns out that she had stayed here before with family a long time ago although the lobby pool she recalled was replaced by a breakfast area. This hotel was conveniently located less than a mile from I-40 on a strip of other budget-to-moderate level hotels. The immediate surroundings weren't very attractive but I did not feel unsafe.Our accessible room looked good but there were some issues getting on the very high mattress. We called the front desk who seemed to know this was an chronic problem as they had a stepstool on standby for guests to use. The hotel staff did bring up the stepstool promptly.The free breakfast had a nice variety. I was very disappointed in the fitness center, a tiny box with maybe two pieces of old cardio equipment. I would recommend this property to people with long legs who are not intimidated by typical urban surroundings. The staff may not be able to help the location but they need to lower the height of the bed and mattress.I checked out early in the morning and wrote the following review 5 hours ago, within minutes after i left the hotel.  The guy at the front just called to ask us to return the pillow we took otherwise he would charge $15 for it.  He said the hpusekeeper couldnt locate 6th pillow in the room.  Well, this one did it.  I moved a star from the review.  Also, we moved the 6th pillow into the closet.  I guess they dont clean the closets!--- original review written at 8 am ----Staying here made me sad.  Really dirty and very unpleasant.  First the hotel called me in the morning and asked when we were coming in.  I told them at 5 but we ended up coming in at 3.  She told us since i said i wad coming in late they didnt clean the room yet and that they were taking time to do so.  That was pretty bizzarre.As far as ratings go - It had a good rating on trip advisor when i  booked it.  I only checked reviews on yelp when i was checking in.  That was a mistake, yelp was right. The lobby was a bit outdated when i was checking in but cleanish.  The staff was friendly so i thought was ok until i went in the room.  Everything was outdated dusty and dirty.  The only thing they seem to do is pick up trash and change bed with old bedsheets.  Pretty bad.  The bedsheet made me itchy all night.  I scratched my feet until they bled.  The bed sheet got blood on it which made me realize what brown stains on bedsheet were.  Shower curtain smelled musty.  They prob dont wash that as often as they should.Breakfast was ready at 6.  They had waffles cereal pastry etc made me think oh at least one thing look decent.  I couldnt b more wrong.  Sausage tasted freezer burn n cold.  Waffle smelled and tasted a bit old. Boiled egg was soaked in vinegar.  The only things edible were banana, pastry and cereal.This hotel was pretty bad.  We paid over $100here which only deserved to be a $60 motel.  This place seemed to be family owned.. or i could be being a racist.  I would say stay away from this hotel but it looks like many motels in memphis are like this.  All mearby motels looked outdated and sad like this one.On my way back to Texas, after a long 15+ hour drive from NYC, I needed a place to stay. It was important the hotel I stayed at accepted pets with a reasonable fee. My feline traveling companion was tired and edgy too-- carrier fever. This La Quinta was perfect!! It was non-smoking, clean and affordable. A big plus, No pet fee! Which proved a clean-pet-accepting hotel doesn't need a huge non-refundable fee. In my opinion kids can be worse in destruction of property and noise than pets.Kudos to the front desk person, Pratima. She is warm and friendly. My only complaint is the bed is too high. I had to be careful getting off it when nature called in the middle of the night (I know TMI). However, it was very comfortable once resting on it. Hope this helps!Really good experience. Everything's clean And organized. Staff was very helpful and accommodating. Who else would run out and greet us to show us where to park our Uhaul?! Breakfast was pretty good and not messy. They had biscuits and gravy and sausage. Waffles. Cereal. Yummy pastries. Fresh fruit. This hotel had the best shower ever plus a high quality shower head with multiple settings. Bed was pretty comfortable. TV had all the channels and picture was good.We are on a 6 week trip and stay in LaQuinta Inns all across the nation. This is the worst. I reserved a handicapped king and was told the reservation came into their system as a double. We are celebrating our wedding anniversary!!! Why would I reserve a double room (which I have never done!). The room smells. I am handicapped and they put us on the 2nd floor, a great inconvenience even with an elevator. There was a blood stain found on my sheet.They would do nothing when I voiced my complaints. I couldn't breathe this morning because of the wet dog smell, due to allergies.This will make me rethink our next hotel stay. I am appalled! Can't wait for the survey.Stayed here for two nights while in town. Probably the best customer service I've ever had at a hotel. Staff was friendly and attentive. After I checked in the front desk called a little while later just to check to see if everything was satisfactory. Additionally, during breakfast there was an employee walking from table to table welcoming people and checking that everything was ok again. No issues, everything was great. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that the neighborhood is a little iffy, but not that bad...I'm glad to see some people still care about the customer experience!Other bonus to the hotel is that there's no extra pet fee (I travel all over North America with my dog and this is rare).Traveling from Kentucky from Texas we chose to stay at LaQuinta Suites. We love their pet policy. After staying in this one off of 12C Sycamore we have never been more disgusted. Upon arriving to the room I showered and was preparing to get into my bed when I noticed hairs and a reddish color stain in my bed. Not just any hair but what appears to be pubic hair. I do not have any idea what the reddish colored stain was. They offered another room which when the beds were inspected I found another stain on one of the beds. It was obvious the sheets had not been washed since my husband took the key card and some of the stain started scraping off. The final room was ok. If I had not have taken my sleep  medication my family and I would have left immediately. I am very disappointed with this establishment. The attempt to redo the hotel are lacking in the upstairs rooms considerably. The downstairs is ok but it is obvious the job was rushed and you can see the chipped tables. I give one star because I did think the fireplace area minus the chipped tables was nice and modern not like the rooms. I should also mention that the hallway smelled of urine. The rooms however smelled fine.Holy cow this place is disgusting. Lipstick on a pig, they've tried to cover up problems with some redecorating  but the awful smell, the stained and broken ceiling tiles, the old AC, the endless and stupid rules (no entry through side doors, $250 fine if you leave your pup while you go out to dinner...) I would never, ever, ever stay here again. There is plenty more to say but I'm too frustrated to say so right now. Avoid this disgusting hotel...Recently remodeled, very clean.  Exceeded my expectations. Very comfy bed. Parking very tight, no room for anything with a trailer, no truck or RV parking. You'll have to find a spot in the street or somewhere else. But the hotel is very nice. Had one issue with the room AC unit. 3 am the fan started making a squealing noise. But that my only issue with the place. I'd stay there again.While traveling across country with pets, especially cats, it is often difficult to find decent hotels to accommodate your needs. La Quinta, with the exception of a few properties, are generally very happy to accommodate pets and, they do so without charge.After traveling across country for five days, this was the last night of our five day trip. We seriously needed a good bed in a secure room that was clean, comfortable and affordable. The La Quinta in Memphis East-Sycamore View was just the ticket.Our room was large, modern, clean and comfortable. It was furnished with a large wide screen TV, a microwave, coffee bar and refrigerator. Everything was fresh, smelled clean and looked brand new. And the beds were better than some I have slept in at hotels charging $200 or more a night! In fact, over the years, I have come to experience some of the best beds in the hotel industry at La Quintas.But the best thing about the stay is this: they accepted my kitty, and we all know that a happy kitty means a happy trip the following day.Thank you La Quinta ... you continue to be at the top of my travel list.Nice stay. Clean. Staff nice. Remote for tv was chewed by a dog who had previously stayed there. No real complaints tho. I'd stay again.Stayed here overnight while on a road trip.  I like La Quinta since they are dog friendly and have comfy beds.  This location also had great reviews on Tripadvisor. Maybe I got a bad room, but it had an overwhelming smell of mildew that really grossed me out.  The smell even bothered me while sleeping.  The entire room was visibly unlevel.  The floor/wall carpet trim was all completely pulled away from the wall.  Reviews said this location was having renovations, I didn't notice any, but my room clearly needed it.  It was an ADA room and I'm guessing it has been possibly flooded before.  The shower didn't drain completely due to being unlevel and I could hear large amounts of water draining in the wall, from 2nd floor, but it didn't sound like it was going thru the pipes.  Not worth $80 for the night.  In hindsight I wish I had asked to switch rooms.I stayed 3 nights here Oct.12-15. I was on the 4th floor. It was very quiet and clean. The front desk clerk and managers were very friendly and concerned about me having a good stay. It is close to the interstate.The housekeeping staff was also nice.. I will return next time I am in town.very clean room, super friendly and helpful staff, wonderful beds and tv. our first room had a broken door lock so we called the staff and they came immediately and helped us switch rooms. we had difficulty accessing the wifi and again a staff member promptly came to the room and helped us get on wifi. not a huge area to walk the dog, but adequate near parking lot in the rear. we did not use the pool but it is indoors and looked nice. the breakfast provided was plentiful (better than other La Quintas) and the area in which to eat was pretty. somewhat out of the way for us but from reviews it was a better choice than other La Quintas in Memphis.For pet friendly places I dont think you can beat La Quintas!I think it was good. Everything worked and the pool as well. It wa very quite.",,,,,"['never', 'bad', 'luck', 'far', 'pet', 'policy', 'perfect', 'traveling', 'across', 'country', 'cats', 'last', 'night', 'hour', 'drive', 'make', 'next', 'day', 'rooms', 'clean',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-memphis-medical-center-midtown-memphis,Holiday Inn Express Memphis Medical Center Midtown,2.5,$$,16,"Located in Midtown, this hotel is a good value, however the rooms are outdated. My room in particular had a very musty smell when I first enters it. The staff however was fabulous and very helpful. Breakfast is hot and complimentary in the morning so make sure to take advantage of that. Overall, a good hotel if you're staying for one night on business like I was. If you're coming for a vacation, I would recommend staying downtown.I am truly, truly shocked at the one and two star reviews on here.  We had an outstanding visit, stayed in a quiet room, non-smoking, with a microwave, fridge and coffee machine (requested prior to the stay).The room was spotless.  No smelly anything - however, we did ask them not to use air freshener only because it didn't need freshening.  It was very, very clean.  Got professional front desk service from Darren who is an asset to the Holiday Inn organization.  Good interpersonal skills and very professional person.  I hope the brass at the Holiday Inn appreciate his professionalism and ability to make everyone feel welcome.Breakfast was varied:   had healthy choices, low-fat milk, bran flakes, good quality Greek yoghurts and fruit. Pancakes, bacon for those not on a diet.  Lots of options - we ate well here in the mornings, no doubt about it.I am still baffled by the poor reviews for this property.  We have stayed all over the world, and this location was without a doubt one of the best ever.  Clean, quiet, no ""smell"" ... and the most comfortable bed imaginable.  Loved it.What can I say.  When we got there, we were informed that they had a water leak which caused some of the rooms to flood so they only had smoking rooms.  I had tried to book at other hotels with no luck for some time so I already knew there were no vacancies. The room smelled horrible and was filthy. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.Will not come back staff was rude... Our check in time was 3pm didn't get our rooms until after 5 (due to a housekeeping shortage) the 4 people standing behind the desk didn't seem to mind they where to busy joking with one another and playing on. There phones.. When we did get our rooms the beds where awful the AC UNIT was extremely noisy. Awful experience!Spartan accommodations.   Requested two double beds.   Got a room with one full size bed.  Bed is very uncomfortable.   Light switches don't work. Lobby was clean and relatively well appointed though.Poor wifi connection, smelly room, not as clean as the Holiday Inn Express we stayed in the previous night. Breakfast was exactly like all the other hotels. The carpet baseboard was stapled on, like you would use your office stapler...... nuff said.I don't understand the bad reviews for this place.  Our group stayed here at the end of September for Gonerfest, and I am giving this place 5 stars because while it was exactly what we needed, they actually exceeded our expectations.  The staff was friendly, hospitable, and really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.  There was free, fresh coffee in the lobby every morning, including breakfast (we only made it early enough once!) that included fresh fruit, yogurt, sausage, eggs, and waffles.  The first day, I arrived extremely early, and they stored my baggage for me so I could go and take the trolley (which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel) into Downtown to explore.  As a side note, if you are staying here, I highly recommend doing this!!!  It's a great way to explore the town.Our room was spotlessly clean, and I know this because I always check everywhere in the room before I even put my clothes away.  We were able to walk barefoot on the carpets in our room, and our feet were clean.  The beds were comfortable, with quality linens and several comfortable pillows.  The AC was on and healthily kicking out cold air... almost too much, we had to turn it down so we wouldn't freeze -- I consider that a very good thing, especially in humid Memphis weather.All in all, this is going to be our go-to place for Gonerfest every year.  The friendly staff, cleanliness, price, and proximity to everything made this the perfect spot to rest our heads between all the craziness.Stayed here for one night. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom had Bath &amp; Body Works products! The bed was really comfortable with nice pillows. The room was kind of small, but it worked. The wifi sucked. They give free cookies and popcorn around 4 each day which was nice! The lobby was very nice! The breakfast had a large variety! Overall, it was a good hotel. But the wifi could've been better.Nice room, clean plenty of pillows, coffee maker in room. Musty odor on arrival. Staff friendly helpful. Good breakfast included with pancakes eggs etc. free wi fi!Go somewhere else.We were in Memphis for two nights. As we pulled up I knew then, I should have gone elsewhere. The Elvis Presley convention was in town!! Hotels were full. This is an outdated hotel.  Two stars were for the nice and attentive staff.  Small rooms, dirt in cracks! Love Beal St! But I we will never stay here again!I stayed at this hotel in mid-May. Between 7:00 and 9:30 at night both my car and my brother-in-law's cars were broken into while parked in the hotel parking lot. It cost me almost $900 in damages. No apology or offer of reimbursement from anyone connected with hotel. The police that came told me they were frequently called to the hotel parking lot...burglary was a common occurrence. As I was checking out, a couple were distraught as they said someone broke into their room and stole her gold earrings. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.When we were looking for something with a decent price and near the downtown area, we found this hotel. Being on Union Street, in midtown, it is centrally located for a night on Beale Street or dining around uptown.The staff was very helpful and the morning buffet breakfast was substantial for an ""express"" hotel. As Jenna mentioned, the breakfast is carb heavy, but if you stick to eggs and bacon/sausage along with your carbs, you'll be fine. Consider the oatmeal or cereal &amp; skim milk instead of the cinnamon rolls! Over all, my trip here was pleasant and offered a nice bed at a decent price. The free wifi made evenings tolerable. If you're staying here to be close to someone in the nearby hospitals, be sure to let them know. They give discounts for those types of situations.Dirty room. Tiny bathroom had very little counter space. Mold in bath tub. Air conditioner never cooled the room down. Would not stay here again. They were also supposed to use my club points and didn't/ wouldn't. Very small room.Pretty bad experience so far.  Currently sitting in the lobby.  Got here and went to my room.  Heat didn't work.  I came down to the lobby an hour ago because they said they could move me to a different room.  1 hour later, here I sit.  ""The computer system crashed.""   Nice staff but not a great Holiday Inn on any other level.Very impressed. My bed reminded me of Marriott -- down comforter, plenty of feather pillows, firm but soft mattress, crisp white sheets, and completely fresh. Free wifi and expanded (free) continental breakfast, including the usual carbs (cereal, bagels, pastries, bread, muffins) as well as scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, yogurt, and hard-boiled eggs. Since these three things (bed, internet, breakfast) matter the most to me, Holiday Inn Express was perfect in these respects and earned a loyal customer here.Other Pros:  1)  Housekeeping and front desk staff were friendly. 2)  The hotel is on Union Ave, where you are surrounded by restaurants, businesses, and stores, and you are in close proximity to Downtown. 3) If you need the medical center, it is literally across the street.Cons:  1) Patients being released (ie, mental health) wander around the area and sometimes go into the hotel asking for stuff from the front desk. They are promptly kicked out, but they are still present. I asked why this happened, and apparently the hospital calls rides for patients being discharged, but then they won't let the patients wait for those rides in the hospital. So the patients just walk across the street to the hotel. Interesting.  2) The homeless are abundant here and approach your car anytime you go through drive-thrus. 3) My hotel room was crammed with stuff: couch, coffee table, work table, TV center, stand-alone closet, bench to sit on, and the bed. Further, the TV center and closet's doors swung out into the room, so that the 2 feet of walking space between ends of the room was completely taken up. In other words, it was difficult to maneuver through the room because there was just no walking space. 4) My reservation rate stated that I would receive a microwave and refrigerator, but neither was in my room.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-memphis-memphis-2,Fairfield Inn & Suites Memphis,3.0,$$,15,"Stayed here on a Saturday night. The hotel is very nice very clean. The staff is very friendly and are eager to help you. We really enjoyed the indoor pool and indoor whirlpool. It was nice that there was just us in the pool section. The breakfast didn't start until 7:00 but they had it out at around 6:30. So the lady in the front desk told us we could go ahead and eat if we'd like to. Breakfast was delicious. Waffle maker is good as well.  It's not a big selection, but what they do have is good.Very nice hotel just a little outside of Memphis right off the freeway. The neighborhood seemed to be a little iffy at first, but where the hotel is at its safe. The high end cars in the parking lot helped me realize this was ok.Staff is very friendly, even though I booked the wrong date, the staff corrected my mess up and gave us a very nice room.I recommend this hotel!!!!!Fairfield Inn is located off of I-40, several miles east of the city. It's great if you're just driving through (as we were), but not ideal for those staying to explore Memphis. They've got a large parking lot that has plenty of room for trucks and RVs. It's odd that the fron entrance is facing the highway instead of where the street entrance is located.When we checked in late (around 8 or 9pm) there was only one person working the front desk. There were several people in front of me, and a few who made it known they weren't happy. The girl working the desk kept her cool and handled everyone as quickly as possible and maintained a smile the whole time. There's no way I could have pulled that off if I were in her shoes.Our twin full-bed room (no double queens here) was small and no-frills. No mini-fridge or microwave, just the basic stuff like a dresser, desk and TV. Not bad if you just need a place to crash for the night and you're on a budget.Staff was super friendly.  Room was great.  Doesn't seem busy and doing some construction so the upgraded our room.  Signs said construction to be complete Feb 2015.  Hopefully the renovations include the elevator to match the quality of the new rooms.  Also Breakfast lobby area was kind of small.This place was AMAZING! Everything was remodeled just recently!!! Friendly staff too. We ran late and missed breakfast but the staff let us get some food and was very thoughtful. On our road trip, we stayed at over 6 different hotels and this place was by far our favorite. It is extremely clean and quiet. At first we were a bit put off by the entrance of the hotel because it goes through the back. We automatically assumed it would be a shabby place but once we got into the lobby and our room, we were ecstatic! The room was spacious and bright and nicely decorated. The front desk is so sweet. We purposefully planned our trip so that we would be able to stop by here again. If you're ever in Memphis, please check this place out. The price is amazing for this kind of service and room. $109 (As of late July) The other places were more expensive and was a disappointment after staying here.Really bottom end of the Marriott chain!!! As another reviewer stated ""this place really gives Marriott a black eye!!"" and I certainly agree!!The hotel is filthy and smells like pool Chlorine as soon as you walk in the door! My room on the second floor was suppose to be non-smoking but reeked of cigarettes.The office style room chair at the desk was incredibly stained by God knows what and should have been pulled from service I'm guessing years ago.Our company went to CLC to save on hotel expense and I have stayed a some very nice properties but this sure isn't one of them.I posted a few pictures to bolster my review.Note: The Office Manager on duty was very nice.Man this place is sooooooo hit and miss...i have one good stay at this location and two bad ones...including this one....so here goes...i show up and get my reservation...the young lady who checks me in doesn't even bother to check my platinum elite membership...and she doesnt tell me about my reward points until i ask about them and all she says is yeah they are there and doesn't give me an option on what i would like to do with them... she doesn't give me the platinum key cards she give me the regular one and puts me on the first floor...so i think to myself whatever...we go to check in the room and it smells like somebody has been train smoking in there...then we come back out and ask for a different room where she says no problem again not checking what my status is....so i ask her do you not give out the platinum key cards any more and she thats when she looks at the status and says we do...then gives the excuse...its about that time for me to go...so i guess that constitutes bad customer service....so i also asked for late night restaurants and she procedes to tell me about fast food places...which are not restaurants...if i wanted fast food places thats what i would have asked for....so we go to our room change and come back down and i asked her about a cab and she says they usually take 10 mins if they are in the area then goes back to what she was doing...usually i get offered to call a cab...so whoever she was does not need to be at the front desk...maybe cleaning is more her alley where she dont have to interact with customers and or provide customer service!!!This place was one of our stops on our road trip back to Cali... Using my Marriot Points 10,000 to be exact I secured us a King Suite, on arrival we found that the staff had upgrade all the King Suites away to other guests... Not worried about that and not acting a fool like some might... The Hotel Manager offered me the Jacuzzi Suite instead... Cool right??? Yeah the fact that My Platinum status probably factored into that doesn't bother me at all so we accepted...So the rest of the night is spent in a nicely cleaned Jacuzzi with Beer &amp; My Baby :)Room: Very CleanJacuzzi: SpotlessStaff: FriendlyCheck In &amp; Out: PainlessIn all fairness, this was a clean, comfortable hotel. It's also not a Fairfield by Marriott although it appears that the management is making efforts to bring it up. It appears that this hotel started life as a Sleep Inn or similar andwas bought by Marriott.  My room appeared to have improved linens as well as the tub and surround.  The sink had not been done yet, nor had the bedroom furnishings.  The lobby has been upgraded. If you're looking for a Sleep Inn/Days Inn experience with a nice breakfast in a not-so-nice part of town, this is your place. If you're looking for a Fairfield by Marriott, this isn't it, not quite yet. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the property will lend itself to fully reaching what I'd expect from a Fairfield. Regarding someone reporting bars on the windows of the motel next door: those are decorative diamond-shaped dividers from the '80's when that was in.  Nothing more.   Yep, there's a huge dark parking lot behind the hotel. And yep, there's a large freeway right next to the hotel. I was treated to the sound of a semi blowing a tire at 6:00 AM. The windows are not well soundproofed, so it's going to be loud if you're on that side. And the ""freshening"" scented spray. Oh my. Disgusting. Don't bring your allergies. One of our group had a ripping sinus headache the next morning because of it.Bought a room on priceline and was thoroughly pleased. Room was clean, breakfast had a nice mix or hot/cold foods available. A little out of the way from downtown but not too far. Only downside was when we tried to locate the hotel on google maps, it directed us to a location that was 30 mins away on Macon Road, not Macon Cove...but have since rectified it. Would stay again.This place isn't great, but it isn't all that terrible.Location is not the best, with a gigantic, empty parking lot in front of it - we thought the place was closed when we first arrived! Pretty far from some parts of Memphis, but you'd have to pay more for a closer location.Room wasn't bad- fairly clean (except for stains all over the desk chair - yuck!). Our friends were across the hall and they had a mini fridge in their room, whereas we did not; but we booked the same style of room.The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful when we went to get towels and then toilet paper - still unsure where housekeeping was and why they never visited our room!!Ugh. We stay at Fairfield Inns a lot. This is the worse one by far. It gives Marriot a black eye. The entrance of the hotel was . . . in back? Our room smell like someone used an entire spray can of Febreeze. The grout in the bathroom tile didn't exist in spots--not fun with bare feet.And the breakfast was a joke. How do you mess up cereal? Well, you keep the milk in a mini fridge that doesn't work. Yum yum . . . Raisin Bran with luke warm milk!When I was in college, I stayed at a hotel worse than this one because I forgot to book a reservation. However, as an adult, we booked a reservation at a reputable hotel, and this literally stunk. I personally would go another few exits before stopping for the night. Honestly all the hotels at this exit looked a little slummy--this is probably the best of the bunch. That was the *only* reason I gave this two stars.I seriously have no clue where these 4 and 5 star ratings are coming from with the other guests. That is crazy.I stay almost exclusively at Marriott brand hotels and enjoy staying at them but this one is so nasty I will be sure to avoid it in the futureI stayed here for one night last week.  I chose this hotel because of the poor ratings for the Courtyard the next exit up.  I was also told by a friend that the Courtyard was only fair and that there were not many restaurants nearby.  I agree with Doug, the previous reviewer, the location is awful. So much so that when I pulled up to the hotel I almost called and canceled my reservation from the parking lot.   I decided that it was only one night and I would give it a try.  Once inside it was comparable to many other properties.  It was clean, relatively new and the staff was nice and professional.  The free breakfast idea was nice but the eating area was so small and crowded that I had to take my breakfast back to my room to eat. The location is a little menacing but other than that it was OK.  On my next trip to Memphis I'll stay at the Courtyard.Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites Memphis is a hotel on the low end of the Marriott spectrum of brands. I stayed here two nights in August for a business meeting. I am a loyal Marriott customer, and I belong to the Marriott affinity program. I usually avoid Fairfield hotels, but I had few choices because I booked at the last minute during the anniversary of the death of Elvis. This event, attended by people from all over the world, never made my radar as I was getting ready to go to Memphis for the first time.OMG, this hotel was bad. I suppose it would be okay if you drove up, went into the hotel and never went out. That way you could pretend away it's failings.It is located off the freeway on a dead-end street at the end of a huge asphalt parking lot populated by big rig trucks. So much for a beautiful setting. The slum motel next door has bars on the windows, which was a little scary.  More scary was the rat that rushed me one morning while I walked around the property. Also, I returned to the hotel one afternoon to find that the coffee maker had not been cleaned. Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?The only plus is that they serve Jimmy Dean sausage biscuits for breakfast, which they advertise on their website. Apparently the rats like the Jimmy Dean biscuits as much as I do.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-memphis-walnut-grove-baptist-hospital-east-memphis,Hampton Inn Memphis/Walnut Grove/Baptist Hospital East,3.0,$$,12,"We came to Memphis to see the city.  We didn't realize the hotel would be far removed from the areas we were wanting to visit,  so if you think it's a hop,  skip  and jump downtown, find somewhere else to stay. The traffic will frustrate you. The hotel itself was quiet.  We started on the 4th floor and never heard a peep, even on New years eve.  The room was adequate. No refrigerator. The air unit had been changed out, but the carpet had not and there was a large gap of exposed flooring in the room.  Again,  not a major concern but shows a lack of attention to detail.  The hotel could use a little basic maintenance and updating.  Otherwise,  it worked for our needs.Good solid Hampton inn clean and friendly all the usual Hampton Inn amenities excellent stay I recommend this great prices tooI've stayed here three times so far. No bad experience yet. Fly he front desk staff has always been very nice, professional, helpful, and friendly. The rooms have always been clean and neat.  This hotel is usually pretty quiet. The prices are reasonable. There is a gas station and Wendy's restaurant in walking distance. Most places for food will require you to drive. A lot of people stop here due to its location by the hospital. It's the perfect spot if you are going to Baptist hospital or the West Clinic.I stayed at the Hampton Inn on a business trip to Memphis, and this place was great. The location was a mere 10 minutes from the cool downtown district and it was right off the highway so it was very easy getting to. It was located right near an office park, so there was a good amount of restaurants across the street for me to grab a bit. I love Hampton Inns because they have fruit and water available when I first walk in, and this one was no exception. It's the little things that make a stay much easier and more comfortable, especially on a business trip. Hampton Inn has earned my loyalty. This room was clean and quiet. Everything I needed. They had a good breakfast in the morning, and a workout room, which I always try to hit up when I'm on the road. They were pretty busy when I arrived, and often I expect it to be loud and rowdy when groups or conventions are staying at the same place, but I couldn't have been less disturbed. I've stayed in Memphis a number of times, and I'll say I felt much more comfortable staying in this area. It's really only a few minutes further drive, but feeling like I was in a more secure area was totally worth it to me. I'll definitely stay here again.After driving all day from New Mexico, my husband and I stopped here for the night and we were not impressed. If you're looking for luxury (or even comfort)  I wouldn't recommend this hotel. The lobby looked nice and re-done but the first negative thing we noticed was that the elevator smelled awful (my husband described it as the smell of a mortuary or the inside of a vacuum). Once we got to our room I decided to take a shower and the water pressure was terrible (as my husband said, it felt like someone was peeing on him), one of the folded towels in our bathroom had a huge stain on it and our t.v. was constantly freezing and at one point stopped working all together. Aside from all the negatives, the lady at the front desk was friendly and they had fresh brewed coffee in the lobby. BUT it definitely wasn't worth the price.Tony at the Front Desk is always very upbeat and welcoming. However, this place needs. some work!  the water upon turning on is a brown rusty color!!! the picture was taken after it had been running a minute so it's much lighter than originally experienced. No shampoo!!!! AGAIN!!!! what is the deal???and this is so convenient to my client but will be rethinking my stay next time!!Lobby is remodeled but rooms are dingy and dirty and haven't been remodeled. Mattresses are horrible. Carpet is sticky from age and dirt. Avoided this hotel on 2nd trip thru this area even though I am a loyal Hilton member.My friends had horrible experiences checking in and dirty rooms. It is sad how this can ruin a hotel experience. The front desk staff was not the friendliest. And to top it off, the parking lot is windy and difficult. If you have to stay in Memphis, there are plenty of other options.A recommendable place to stay if you are in the area. Room service were very nice, they wouldn't complain if you ask them for something. The rooms were cleaned very well, smells fresh. The bedsheets and other clothes are all new. The bathroom was cleaned well, didn't had any bad experience.Glad to say that I stayed for 5 times now and I am having a great time.Upon arrival the front desk attendants, Tony and DeNae, greeted us with a warm welcome. They recommend restaurants in the area, accommodated our late check out request, and saved one cookie for us. The rooms are clean, old but clean. Would definitely stay again.I am a Hilton Diamond member and this year alone I have already stayed 93 nights in a Hilton brand hotel. That being said this was not my favorite place. It was not bad, in fact the rooms were very satisfactory. The service is why I would say I have experienced better. The women who works the breakfast in morning was kind enough in greeting guests, but was often very loud, yelling/chatting with other hotel staff. There was also 2 occasions in which she was asked to refill something on the breakfast line and she responded with no, stating that breakfast is wrapping up even though there was still 30 minutes left on the stated time. Overall, I would stay at this hotel as the rooms are satisfactory and the location worked for us.Very friendly and helpful staff. However, the quality of their hotel room did not live up to the Hilton standard. Mattress was very lumpy and creaky. Internet reception was very poor and I kept getting booted offline. This has never been an issue at other Hilton hotels that I've stayed at.  When I turned on the shower faucet, the toilet began running. In fact, the toilet ran throughout the night. Also, construction began outside our hotel at 6 am on a Sunday morning. Again, staff was great but the hotel left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't stay here again. Next time I'd pay the extra money and stay closer to Downtown.",,,,,"['came', 'see', 'city', 'realize', 'hotel', 'far', 'removed', 'areas', 'wanting', 'visit', 'think', 'hop', 'skip', 'jump',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-memphis-univ-of-memphis-memphis,Holiday Inn Memphis-Univ Of Memphis,3.0,$$,15,"I ate here the 2nd day of the 2015 MidSouth Hiv and Aids conference. We had buffet style. The food included a stuff cod, salad, rolls, a chicken pasta, a beef pasta, green beans, peach and Apple pie. It was really nice. It's nothing I would willing say let's go and eat there. It was good for it being free.Have never stayed at the hotel but have been to a few sit down dinners at events. The service has been done but the food is absolutely horrible. Really bad.Never stayed in the this hotel but I came for the Mothers Day Brunch. It was great. Plenty of food and drinks. For 34 dollars. Great place to take your mom for a brunch.I was with a group from work staying at this Holiday Inn on Central.  We unloaded our bags, went in to check in but only to find out that we were actually across the street at The Fogleman.  What???  We did't notice that there was a hotel across the street because the building across the street is an office building. Long story short, Holiday Inn Memphis-Univ of Memphis overbooked their hotel and sent us to a dormitory to stay.  jeremy at the front desk kept saying the "" The Fogelman"" was their ""sister"" property.  A dormitory.I will never deal with Holiday Inn especially at this location.But, I may say that I did have breakfast and lunch in the dining room.  It was very good and reasonable.  At $9.95 buffet breakfast, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, eggs made to order and omelets, bacon, grits, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy..... all was very good.For lunch, we had lasagne, chicken cordon blue, scalloped potatoes, potato soup, catfish, blackberry cobbler and red velvet cake.  No, I didn't get all I could but I did get all I could eat.And, the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the a.m. was very good.One star because I booked Holiday Inn and got holiday overbooked.Dirty. Walls were filthy, the tv screen looked like something had been spilled on it and never cleaned, mold was growing in the caulking in the shower, broken toilet seat, cheetos were left under the pull out couch, stained carpet and couch cushions. The kitchenette had no supplies: no soap for the sink, no dishes, no napkins or paper towels. There was a layer of dust on the ice bucket and the in room coffee maker. No pool and no free breakfast. The only positives were the friendly employees, complimentary coffee downstairs, and the beds were comfortable although they were small (doubles instead of queens). Definitely an older holiday inn in need of some TLC. Won't stay here again.Very convenient location. The rooms are very neat and comfortable. Hey free parking and WiFi!Very outdated and a/c isn't worth a damn. Lady took forever took check us in.Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks!!!!!The title of this review is ""Dr. Switcheroo or How I Learned to Always Get it in Writing"".On my first night there, a roach flew out of the lamp on my bedside table. I killed it and left it on the floor--in part as a warning to its friends, and in part because I had a feeling I was going to need to have proof for any complaints. I called the front desk to let them know; nothing happened. The next morning, at the two-stars-out-of-five breakfast, there was another roach on the wall behind the omelet station. I pointed it out to the (very nice) woman cooking my omelet and told her it looked a lot like the one that was in my room last night. She let the restaurant manager know and he actually came out to talk to me. Mgr: I'm very sorry about that. You won't need to pay for your meal. Me: ThanksMgr: And I understand there was also one in your room?Me: YesMgr: Have you Paid for your room?Me: NoMgr: Good. Don't. And we'll get the exterminator in here and up in your room today.Now, if we're honest, I thought this might have been a bit Too generous; my stay was for five nights. I had been considering checking out that day, but I was attending and speaking at a conference across the street, and who is going to turn down a free hotel? So I thanked him and went to my room. The front desk called and we scheduled when the exterminator could come to my room (I'd have to be gone). Then I went over to the conference. I was so pleased with the hotel's response that I called my wife to tell her about it. Not only had they comped my stay, but they sent an exterminator as soon as they knew about it. (Then I remembered that the front desk had been aware of the roach in my room for half a day, so at least the management is responsive, right?)It almost wasn't worth it. Every night when I got up to pee, I worried that my next step would crunch. But I got through, and finally it came time to check out. I was billed for all five nights. It was 6:30am so there were no managers on duty. I called the hotel when I got back to my apartment, and I got a completely different story. The hotel manager said the restaurant manager told her there was no mention of my room, and he was offering to pay for my food bill instead. I said he offered both. She said no way.After some discussion, she offered a refund for one night, and stated that her offer was exceedingly generous. I disagreed. I said that all five nights was very generous, and that at a bare minimum I didn't want to pay for either of the days I encountered a roach either next to my bed or next to my food. I made it clear that I wasn't concerned that there were two roaches in her hotel, but rather that there were SO MANY ROACHES THAT I COULDN'T GO A DAY WITHOUT BEING WITHIN SIX FEET OF ONE--and I was only in two places in the hotel!She responded about like you'd expect, and I took the one night refund. But after you expect five, and have a reasonable request for two, one doesn't feel like much. And I have to say, worrying constantly that I'd have a six-legged bedmate (or dinner date) while I was there made it completely not worth my time; if I had known it would be anything but free, I would have checked out and stayed truly anywhere else. In conclusion: If you have to pay any more than zero dollars a night for this hotel, it isn't worth it. And if you do find yourself going through something that makes your stay zero dollars a night, GET IT IN WRITING.This is a pretty nice place to stay, if you want to be close to campus. All rooms are suites and the staff was helpful and friendly. They also offer a free local shuttle. The bed, the most important thing, was very comfortable. On the downside, the property is worn. I wouldn't avoid it if you want to be close to campus, but you might consider driving in if you are picky about cleanliness or having an elegant room.Awesome service. Nice hotel. All rooms have fridge, microwave, 2 tvs, suite area. Huge shower heads. Great beds. Hotel is ran by U of M students. They take government rates.  They are in a great location close to downtown.  I would stay here every time I'm in Memphis. The rooms, service, and restaurant are great.I stayed here for four days earlier this spring and it was great! The room was like an Embassy Suites room--sitting area, then a bathroom and then the bedroom behind that. It was very spacious, had nice TVs in both rooms, and a refrigerator. The facility was really clean and the staff was very friendly. I liked the location next to the University of Memphis and it's a straight shot into downtown.Good breakfast buffet, nice meeting room &amp; service.I am reviewing this for their Sunday brunch, but let me explain that it is a Holiday Inn Hotel located across the street from the University of Memphis. It is a training site for students from the Kemmons Wilson School of Hospitality at the University of Memphis, but it is an all suite hotel that is open to the public and also has a public restaurant, meeting rooms and banquet facilities. It's one of the best brunches in town and now that I am a mom with three children and an extended family this has become my brunch location of choice over the past few years. They have Sunday brunch from 11-2:30 and it's $19.95 for adults and $10.95 for children. It's a brunch buffet with an omelet bar, a waffle bar, meats, veggies and salads. It's basic brunch type food, nothing spectacular but good. I'm a fan of their special occasion brunches where they feature more items. They are held for Mother's Day, Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving and sometimes Father's Day. It's served in the banquet facilities so you don't have to wait long- which is a bonus with children. The special occasion brunch also features a kids only area with special kiddie food- chicken tenders, mini pancakes, mac and cheese etc. It's fun because it's also served on a lower bar area where the kids can actually reach it themselves. It's definitely worth a try for brunch.Um, so I was surprised to find my name on this greeting placard at the registration desk on the lobby. Apparently, it's a way to welcome Holiday Inn Club Members. First of all, I didn't know I was one! And second, the others wouldn't stop making fun of me.But that has nothing to do with my review.The room and hotel were really nice! It was a King suite so we had a gigantic king sized bed that was super comfortable and another ""living room"" area with a fridge, sink, TV, and couch. Everything was super clean. The front desk was nice and wake up calls came on time. No complaints!Recently had the buffet at the Holiday Inn.  The food was fine, pretty good variety.  The seafood choices were pretty slim ... catfish and little else.  Service was good and cleanliness was also good.  Overall ambiance was adequet as the room is dark w/out any windows more befitting an evening dinner.  The prices for this selection at $20 each was a little high in Memphis, especially since you can have a stunning breakfast down the road at the Beauty Shop in Cooper / Young.  You won't be unhappy, but you could be really happy elsewhere",,,,,"['ate', '2nd', 'day', '2015', 'aids', 'conference', 'buffet', 'style', 'food', 'included', 'stuff', 'cod', 'salad', 'rolls',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-downtown-memphis-2,Comfort Inn Downtown,4.0,$$,15,"We checked in Wednesday around 3 pm after driving around 540 miles.  Great location on the 10th floor in downtown Memphis facing the Mississippi River.  You can see Arkansas on the other side of the river.  We are walking distance to everything downtown.  Neat clean hotel, very helpful nice desk clerks, but lousy wifi connection.  Breakfast is included with underground parking for $10/day with in and out privileges.  The top floors 10-12 &amp; 14-15 are hotel rooms.  I just found out they don't use the 13th floor (superstitious)This is a hard one to write a review for as I had mixed feelings. But I think after everything, I would probably recommend it with a couple of caveats. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful which is always a good start. The included breakfast was basic but still good. It should be noted that the first 10 levels or so of the hotel is actually public parking but it didn't seem to have an impact. The hotel charges $10 for self parking which was reasonable and very handy. The location isn't bad either and you can walk or catch the trolley service easily to Beale St. We had a double room with partial views of the Mississippi which was good. I should mention that the walls seemed very thin and it was easy to hear a TV in the next room which is pretty rubbish if you want to get to sleep. The room was extremely spacious though which was great for our 3 night stay in Memphis however the bathroom was very small. And to top that off the toilet was small. Weird right? I'm not just talking small, small... I'm talking SMALL, SMALL!!! Like an 8 inch bowl small. Put it this way... unless you were a bombardier in the war... you gonna have trouble dropping it in easily. ;)At the end of the day though... it's worth staying at and I would stay there again.Holy smokes - GREAT hotel. I was a little worried about safety in Memphis but NEVER here. Would recommend 10/10 for the price. 6 or so blocks from Beale. Our very clean &amp; spacious hotel room had a view of the Mississippi &amp; the island. Staff was friendly &amp; were graciously giving us suggestions on where to go.$10 daily parking ( I believe) &amp; they offer a AAA discount. Free wifi. Outdoor pool.We only stayed here one night. It is very easy to walk to Beale Street from here and the trolley runs just around the corner from the hotel. Staff were super nice, and they serve a full breakfast. Rooms were clean and we had a great view of the Mississippi River.Traveling on a budget? This is your place!We wanted something downtown and close to Beale Street and got the best rate here, well best rate with the best reviews.  We booked a two night stay with two beds and a rollaway bed.  The room was decent size, clean, and the staff were friendly.  As others mentioned, the breakfast was decent and different on both mornings we went down for it.  It was more than just coffee and danishes.  Parking was $8/night - I saw free parking advertised some place and it's added onto your total bill when you check out.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.The room was clean, and the beds were comfortable.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating when we asked to stay another night and didn't move us to another room.  The rooftop pool was nice since the temps were in the high 90's, the view from the pool was relaxing.  The location of the hotel was within walking distance to many restaurants and attractions.  Our room was on the first floor, facing traffic, but it was still relatively quiet.  I'd definitely stay here again.An older hotel but they have updated it. We got a corner room with 2 queen beds and it is very spacious.  Parking garage on the premises which is nice. Right across from Mud Island park. Within walking durance of Beale Street.The hotel was super clean and the staff super friendly!  We really enjoyed the roof top view of the bridge and the river, complete with self made cocktails and gorgeous sunsets!We don't expect alot from the free breakfast in places like this but we were pleasantly surprised at the selection and quality the buffet.What a great location..blocks from Beale Street  and easy highway access. Would stay here again no doubt!The location of this hotel is ideal and we had a very good price (granted, it's the middle of January). Our room had a view of the Mississippi and the pyramid. It was clean and large.The bathroom was maybe slightly small and because it didn't have a fan, it ended up as a sauna.The choice for breakfast was extensive (eggs, bacon, biscuits &amp; gravy, danishes, waffles, muffins) but the quality was barely average. We enjoyed it anyways and were able to be on the road early in the morning.#sbroadtrip2013We got the room for $109 and got a beautiful view of the Mississippi River from the 11th floor! And parking is in their own garage for $10 with in/out priviliges. Only a 15 minute walk to Beale stOverall pretty darn good. The room is clean, spacious, and laid out nice. The service downstairs is friendly and fast. They can call a taxi for you real quick. The breakfast is actually pretty good. They have waffles, cereal, eggs; ham, toast, yogurt and other things. My only complaint is the elevator is a little slow and the parking is a little much but from what I hear we are still paying ""ok"" prices compared to other parking prices Id stay here again.Good location, surprisingly good breakfast, very comfortable beds. Elevator was a tad unreliable and we didn't have towels in the room when we first arrived. However, we received them as soon as we enquired after them. It's not luxurious, but we were happy with it and would be happy to stay again if we are ever back in town.I have traveled to Memphis a lot for work and pleasure. The Comfort Inn may not be the Peabody Hotel but for a hotel at this price point and location this one is hard to beat. The staff has always been above and beyond. The rooms have always always always been comfortable and welcoming. They have actually upgraded me to business suites several times without me even asking! Also this is the hotel where I was given a sample package of Wilkinson Sword shaving cream which I love and now order from the UK. There are some fantastic restaurants between here and Beale Street and an easy walk or taxi ride if you want to go directly into the drunk tank.Have been to Memphis a couple times and found Comfort Inn to be friendly, clean and reasonable for a downtown hotel. Rooms are a good size and no additional charge for parking.Very large and clean rooms. The parking is a little weird but it's in their own garage so it's secure. The staff was very nice and the breakfast was great (free with room).",,,,,"['checked', 'around', 'driving', 'around', '540', 'miles', 'great', 'location', '10th', 'floor', 'downtown', 'facing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-memphis-airport-memphis,Courtyard Memphis Airport,3.5,$$,19,"The hotel was clean and very convenient to catch a flight in the AM. I was able to drop off my rental car at the airport before checking in, take the free hotel shuttle to the hotel, and grab the shuttle again to my flight in the morning.The hotel has a ""Bistro"", but is not close to any restaurants. But Keith at the front desk called a local BBQ restaurant to come pick up my coworkers for dinner. He also called me a taxi to go downtown to Beale Street for better food and live Blues music. Keith was a good man and hooked us up. A cab downtown costs about $20, but it was easy to catch one for the return trip. The complaint I had was that the building is a big square around the ""Courtyard"", but there is only one elevator as far as you can get from the lobby. I felt like I walked blocks with my bags to the vator, and just as far on my floor. I also think it is tacky for a hotel not to offer free hot coffee in the lobby. That is a homey comfort I expect. Marriott properties have been trending toward selling Starbucks in their Bistro and not having complimentary coffee in the lobby. I don't think Starbucks is special, and don't want a hotel to Nickel and Dime me for a cup of joe. This is why Marriott is not my go-to brand anymore. That's just bad customer service for a business in the hospitality business. Marriott should rethink that idea at the corporate level.My boyfriend and I were here for one night fairly recently.  I'm glad we stayed here.  Why?  Glad you asked!Let's start with check-in.  I have not seen customer service THIS GOOD in a very long time.  The staff were very professional, friendly and made us feel welcome.  We asked for a room facing the courtyard and got it, no hassles.  The property has obviously been remodeled as the lobby and restaurant were very nicely decorated.  The parking lot is VERY secure, you need a room key to get in.The room was extremely comfortable, and spacious.  It was more than functional; it was livable.  The bathroom was a nice size, although the sink was located outside of the actual bathroom.  (Not a big deal.)  The shower had constant pressure and temperature, which is an absolute MUST.I couldn't find one thing wrong with this property, but I found a lot of things that were right.  This is my new go-to property when I'm in Memphis.The lobby was very clean and the front desk attendant was friendly. We were told there wasn't a AAA discount for ""that room."" We had called ahead for a room for five - two queen beds and a pullout sofa. The room wasn't prepared for five. There was towel service for only three. There were no bed linens/pillow for the pullout. After calling the front desk, it would be ~25 minutes to have them delivered to wait for the driver to return. Being 10:30 pm and not wanting to wait, I called back and said I would come get them. Was told by the front desk clerk that she didn't have access and would have to wait. The pullout couch was not comfortable - but that's nothing new for a pullout. The room was very humid and warm; however, it was clean. The thermostat did not control the temp of the room making for a hot night.Stayed here for 3 nights while in Memphis for a celebration. I always stay at Marriott hotels because the beds are super comfortable! The beds did not disappoint. Check in was easy and the agent was very friendly and helpful on suggestions for getting around town. Room was clean. We had a few rooms and one of the rooms had AC issues and the drain would not close. Also needed a few extras and when brought to the room, the employee did not acknowledge us or speak a work when thanked. The main reason I wanted to write this review is to let people know that it is in the middle of nothing! There are no close restaurants, coffee shops, etc. There's a Subway across the street, but it is closed on weekends. You will have to drive everywhere and really the majority of the eating establishments that are the closest driving distance are fast food restaurants. No problems with the wifi, it is free! Lobby area was freezing cold! No luggage rack in room. Bathrooms don't have a vent which made for a moist room. Shuttle to the airport was fine. The Do Not Disturb signs were a nuisance...seems minor but constantly had to pick them up as they fell off the door every time the door was opened/closed. It's a fine choice if passing through town for a night or two or if you need to be close to the airport. Next time, I will get closer to downtown.Rooms fine. Walked a mile to elevator. Restaurant doesn't open until 6:30 am...,seems a bit late for a hotel. Staff nice enough but this place needs work.I stayed here 5 months ago and it was a little ran down. This is the closest Marriott property to the airport so I was dreading my return. TOTALLY REMODELED!!!I had a great surprise to walk into the current generation Courtyard lobby and an even better surprise to find a full renovated room! Sounds kind of funny, but the circular couch in my room would be going home with me if I could fit it in my carry on.Jeff was the agent checking me in on 10-9-2015 and checked me out the next day. He was amazing, friendly, helpful, and very customer service oriented. He deserves recognition for his work and should train others on how to treat guests. Room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Slept like a baby. on a mini business trip/vacation and needed the rest. Would stay again just because of Jeff. He Rocks!I have to admit I came here with kind of a bad attitude, we could not get a room at the Peabody, or any downtown hotel, until Friday night.  We were glad to get a room but quite frankly as a back up, this was barely adequate and kindof expensive.Great thing was that even though there was no luggage rack in the room, they offered to bring me one.  When the gentleman came to the room with it, he asked me if I would like two.  I said I would love it so he returned with another.  When I went to tip him, he originally didn't want to take it and said, you don't have to do that.  So I gave him even more, he was great.The room was big enough and the ac worked great.  Bed was super soft, oh my aching back!  Bathroom was divided into two parts which was handy in the morning but the room with shower and facilities was a bit icky.  The tub ran a bit all night, no matter what I did.  And to get everything to flush, you had to hold it down for over 30 seconds.  There were 3 of each very thin towel so you needed twice as many.No breakfast but parking was free.  The wi fii was free and good.   Meh, not much value for 165.00 with all the taxes, fees, etc.My week started in the local area of Memphis. I found the people very pleasing and friendly until the moment I needed a hotel by the airport.The difficulty of getting thru the phone system is far the worst experience I ever had trying to call the hotel. After 8+ attempt I finally got thru and was transferred to reservation. I was told by reservation that she will call for the shuttle (648pm) and I was told it will depart at 7pm. The hotel is 2.2 miles away and so I thought it would be sooner than later. After 734pm I call the hotel and it took me 6 attempts to get thru and ask about the shuttle and I get an attitude from the lady when I asked on the delay (I was very friendly when I asked) and this obviously wasn't good enough.Eventually I was picked up and it certainly didn't feel welcoming.I travel for a living and hold a platinum status or diamond in all the hotels I stay. Can't talk to a customer in a manner of a condescending way for its plain unprofessional. Won't stay here again.The driver was very nice but the rest of the experience was not pleasant.I have been staying at this hotel on average 3-4 days a week for the past month. It has a modern lobby and updated rooms, 24 hour shuttle service and the staff is always friendly. You are not going to find a nicer hotel this close to the airport. Not only will I continue using this location until permanently relocated but will recommend to all my visiting associates once I am established in the area.This hotel is very nice.  The lobby is modern and well kept.  The rooms are extremely spacious with comfortable beds and soft towels/linens.  The gym is exceptionally great - each treadmill has its own tv.  The parking lot is gated and secure.My only complaint about this facility is the front desk staff.  When checking in to a hotel I always assume there will be a hold on my debit/credit card for ""incidentals.""  However, the gentleman at the front desk did NOT mention this or tell me how much it would be - and it was a lot more than I expected, which was a huge inconvenience while traveling.  (When I noticed this in my bank account the next day and called the hotel to inquire, the gentleman at the front desk - same one that checked me in - was VERY short and snippy with me, basically saying I should have known better.)  When checking out I advised the woman at the front desk that we needed to utilize the airport shuttle and she immediately called the driver.  When he came to the front desk to grab our bags, he asked how many were in our party.  Two of us were ready, the other two were right behind us - bringing their bags to the lobby.  The employee immediately cut off our conversation and said ""Because we have to accommodate so many guests, we can only run the shuttle at certain times - so if you aren't all here right now, you'll have to wait for the next one.""  Normally, this would make sense.. however, the lobby was EMPTY.  We were the ONLY people waiting on a shuttle.  I told her we could start loading our bags and the other 2 would be down in less than 2 minutes.  She said no.  The driver, who looked as confused as me, simply said ""well, she's my boss.. so.. sorry.""  We waited another 20 mins for the next shuttle, which was no big deal, but completely unnecessary.  We were the ONLY people waiting, the ONLY people on the next shuttle and the ONLY people that would have left 2 minutes late.  Ridiculous.  (Sidenote: the driver was awesome! He was friendly, helpful and very nice.)All in all, it's a very nice property with great features.  A free continental breakfast would have given it a perfect score - and friendly employees would be the icing on the cake.  Just make sure you ask lots of detailed questions about your billing - and make sure everyone in your party is together if waiting for an airport shuttle.""I can't so that"" should be their motto. No free continental breakfast or even coffee. Twenty minutes to buy a cup of coffee and no pastries. Rooms are okay but only two kid friendly channels since MTV no longer counts.  Grumpy front desk. Only bright spot: great, friendly housekeeping staff. Too bad can't do zero stars.Staff was excellent, hotel is under renovation (in lobby) with rooms to follow.  High and obvious security.  As you expect at an airport hotel, high noise levels from aircraft.Room was ok, as expected at a hotel in this price range.Ok, I was stranded in Memphis due to some, um, mix up by my airline.I stayed here and was simply amazed by the service.  The woman who took care of me many times that night was fantastic! The hotel is very nice, with a nice courtyard to look at from your balcony. The parking lot is fenced in and you have to get buzzed in, which is a little intimidating, but it is in an Corporate Park area, with a surrounding area that is not the best to be alone in at night. I only say that because when I was driving to walmart to buy some clothes ( thanks to my luggage being at my destination).. I witnessed a police raid on an apartment building not far from my hotel.Anyways, I digress- it is very close to the hotel, and even had hotel shuttle service every 30 minutes -24 hours a day.Can't say enough... the service was impeccable!!Please someone take my Dukedom. I guess you don't have to stay much to be the Duke of The Dump.  Major fail! Second worst Marriott property I'd ever stayed at. Should consider becoming a Days Inn or an Econolodge. Better suited for that. How can they consider charging $130 for a hotel worth $50? And $9.95 for an awful breakfast. They should be ashamed of themselves..  Just hope that Bill Marriott never visits this location.Hotel did its job, but not much more. Every staff except for the concierge was rude and unhelpful, shuttle was 10min late, breakfast closes at 9:30 (which you pay for), and make sure you put the do not disturb sign up- housekeeping tried to get in while I was still sleeping from jetlag at 8:30-9:00am! However, the beds are comfortable, and the concierge staff were lovely. Food is adequate if you end up choosing to get it. They also have free shuttles to the airport, which is close. Meh, it worked-but not a first choice.All I can say is wow and I don't mean that in a good way. First waited over a hour for the shuttle at the airport then got to the hotel to find the hot tub not working. The front staff was very nice and polite but as they say in business it's the small things that matter. It is in a good location very close to the airport and highways. This is a older hotel that's going through renovations. I would stay there again but not my first choice. This hotel does not live up to the Marriott standard at all.First, I should mention that I am a Marriott Platinum Elite member.  I stay at a lot of Marriott properties and I don't expect Courtyard to be a 5 star hotel -- it's not and never will be.  This property does have a few things that are different than every other Courtyard I've stayed at.  First, the place has security gates to get in and out and I'm ok with that.  Second, they have remodeled the lobby and it now has some kind of combination food/drink bar/starbucks in place of the normal breafast lobby area.  We had breakfast here the first morning of our stay and the coffee was reasonably good, the food was ok, but the service was really s-l-o-w and the place wasn't busy.  I can't imagine on a typical travel day morning with 30 people eatting in that they would have any hope of keeping up.  On the second morning, the breakfast bar/starbucks wasn't even open on time.  I went down at 6:30 to get a latte and there were 5 people waiting for someone to open the place.  Other than that, there is still construction/painting going on here so it's kind of inconvenient, but otherwise it's a typical Courtyard close to the airport.Omg.. I really loved my 1 week stay here. It was so peaceful &amp; comfortable. The staff were wonderfully pleasant. There chicken wings are to die for... I'm still thinking about them..lol.. Parking is gated in which was great. Nice balcony view in my room. Barthroom was nice/ nice shower. Good &amp; safe place to stay. Just a little far from downtown but close to the airport.",,,,,"['hotel', 'clean', 'convenient', 'catch', 'flight', 'able', 'drop', 'rental', 'car', 'airport', 'checking', 'take', 'free', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-memphis-poplar-ave-east-memphis,Staybridge Suites Memphis-Poplar Ave East,5.0,$$,20,"We had a very nice stay at the Poplar East Staybridge Suites in Memphis. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Free WiFi is available and the prices are reasonable.We had a one bedroom suite which was nicely appointed. As is the case with many extended stay hotels, our room was equipped with a refrigerator and stove. The hotel provides a complementary buffet breakfast. Waffles, eggs, bacon/sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy were among the hot items available. Cereal, yogurt and fruit were also available along with juices and coffee.I liked everything about the room but one thing. I wished the bathroom were open to a hallway between the living area and bedroom rather than opening into just the bedroom. That's simply my personal preference and doesn't detract from my rating of this hotel.great staff, very friendly.convenient to the office park and shopping center nearbyroom and sheets were spotless clean and comfortableairport shuttle and mall shuttle were a huge plusPet friendly.  Awesome hotel, staff, and price. Memphis can be know for having some rough areas, but rest assured this hotel is in a great area.  I checked in about an hour before their social hour ended.  So I ran to the room and dropped my bags.  Social hour is hosted in the lobby and offered soup, salad, and bread (all very good).  They also have free wine and beer.  I stayed for about 35 min and enjoyed a nice lil meal.When I arrived with my pet the guy at the front desk said there was a $75 pet deposit.  I mentioned to him that I just stayed at two other Staybridge locations and they only charged $50, he immediately changed it $50.  When you check-in on yelp you get 10% off your entire stay, I showed him this, but unfortunately it was not reflected on my final bill :\Overall my stay here was very pleasant, great hotel and staff.  Comes with all the amenities.I love this place. I'm here in this spacious room,  watching Hector and the search for happiness (movie is great) on the DVD player in the comfy bed with fluffy pillows. The staff,  shout outs to Lois and Hayes, are genial,  helpful,  genuine,  etc. The room is way bigger than I expected,  bigger than a room I had at a resort. It didn't feel like they tried to fit in all the suite furniture in a space too small to accommodate it like in some other hotels. I am so glad the Hilton was full.  The prices are better and I could entertain in here!I was waiting on a package and Lois called me to let me know it arrived before UPS informed me via text. The breakfast buffet is generous and appealing and vast. Ripe cut and whole fruit, many types of yogurt, French toast,  etc. And they are so clever there are to-go bags for those who need them (you may have to ask for utensils). The selections of meat and breakfast breads change daily. You don't quite have to play chicken getting across the street to the Hilton,  but be careful.  Restaurants (local and chain), Target, a public library branch, Whole Foods and Kroger, and cheaper gas are within 10 minutes drive.   You can walk to Benihana and a movie theater/restaurant where you can see the latest independent films. The only cons I can think of are that smokers congregate outside the entrance and this is a pet friendly chain.  However,  even with my serious allergies, the room feels dander-free.I haven't been to happy hour and I wish I could.  Food,  drink and fun are promised.I love this place, probably the best hotel in Memphis in terms of price and features.The staff here are GREAT. I've stayed here a few times, including one time for an extended period so I'm definitely familiar with this place. There are so many perks, I can't even think of them all.Laundry facilities in house, and they're totally free. Seriously, any time you can just walk down (there's even a laundry basket in each room) and do your laundry, for free. Washer and dryer. There's free breakfast. During the week they have dinner/reception and that's free too. Of course there's other amenities like free WiFi, parking, pool.The rooms are huge. It's basically a one-bedroom apartment. You have a living room, separate dining area (yep, there's a table in there), full kitchen, bedroom, bathroom...everything.There's also loads to do right nearby. There's a Benihana just next door, a movie theater really close by (seriously, go check it out, it's a fantastic theater), and about a block away is a pretty big strip mall: Target, several chain restaurants. Another block away is even more places to eat, such as PF Chang's and Five Guys. Oh and there's a complimentary shuttle, so if you're in town on business and don't have a car, you can still get to all of these places without having to rely on a taxi.Bottom line, if you gotta get a hotel in Memphis, this is the place to stay.Outstanding.  Best hotel experience ever.  Check in was fast, the attendant even called to see if we needed anything after we were settled in.  Really great accommodations and even better if you have (well behaved) pets.I've stayed in a lot of 4 and 5 star hotels, but this one has most of those beat.  The balance of customer service and privacy is great, and everyone was very helpful and friendly.The bed was amazingly comfortable.The breakfast was just enough.  I wish they served bacon though. The lady manning the breakfast (a.k.a. Annie Lennox) was a sweetheart. She even offered to take my children!  :)Very clean room.  Got a text about 2 hours out from check-in welcoming me to the area.  Staff at check in was very friendly.  Room was very clean and well appointed.  Quiet, pet and family friendly. Would definitely stay here again if I am in the area.My hubby, daughter, myself, and our adorable Wheaten Terrier are on a cross-country trip moving from East to West and we have to look up a pet-friendly hotel every night. Despite our desired budget of $100 or less, we couldn't find another hotel in Memphis and decided to stay here (it was suggested by the barbecue store manager where we had dinner). Well, the hotel was rated very highly here on Yelp and being concerned about safety in Memphis, we came here. It turned out to be extremely nice experience. The room was a suite (first in our life), consisting of a living room with kitchenette and a separate bedroom with two double beds. Much needed free WiFi was excellent and a relief from a joke of WiFi we had endured previous two nights at 2-star hotels. Pantry on the first floor was stuffed with drinks and some important necessities (we bought cotton swabs and a small comb). And this morning's hot breakfast with its absolutely charming chef woman was a pleasure to have before hitting Graceland. Overall, very pleasant stay. Oh and I was given a special discount on a pet fee which of course didn't bring the fee down to $100 but was still much appreciated. Highly recommended!From the time I checked in with my family to the time we checked out the staff at Staybridge Suites made our stay all worth it! They have thought of everything at Staybridge Suites. My family and I stayed in the double queen bed suite and it was more than enough room for us. The room was clean and homey. Breakfast every morning was delicious and just enough to get the day started right. There is a free laundry facility on site and the hotel pantry is full of goodies for when the late night snack attacks hit! Lois (Front Desk) was EXCELLENT every step of the way. Her attention and care in providing exceptional customer service was on point and never wavered! Every evening the hotel hosts a social. It is completely free and includes delicious eats and drinks (non-alcoholic and alcoholic). The event is a great opportunity to unwind after a busy day. Debra is the woman in charge of the evening socials and she is WONDERFUL! She was always engaging and welcoming. The pool was always clean and my children had great fun there. I can't say enough great things about this hotel. My family and I had a really great time. The hotel is only a 20 minute drive from downtown Memphis, but the surrounding area/neighborhood the hotel is in is packed full of everything that one would need (Target, fast food, movie theaters, etc.). Wish I could go back to Memphis just to stay at this great hotel again!Great place to stay in Memphis! Highly highly recommend. The front desk employee Hayes went above and beyond his job when I checked in. Asked him if there were places close by to eat, he immediately gave me some menus and also suggestions for places that would deliver since it was raining outside. Later I had issues with my wireless which he immediately took care of. Clean room, great service, well priced, free breakfast and cocktail hour with appetizers - what more could you ask for??We absolutely loved this place! It's a perfect mini home with kitchen, living room and private bedroom. We highly recomend! Also, they are pet friendly! We were on a crosscountry moving from Boston to Austin and is was really nice to be able to afford a place like this to relax! Clean, nice staff, close to a lots of shops( whole foods, Corky's BBQ, Target, Petsmart and more..) Totally worth it! :)Very nice hotel.  Friendly staff.  Easy to find.  Convenient location.They were pet-friendly, well-furnished, friendly and comfortable. No complaints!Stayed for 5 nights for work in Memphis and we used a meeting room. Loved that the room was like a small apartment with a kitchen area, tv area with couch and separate bedroom. Furniture and decor was modern and comfortable. Staff was excellent. Mike &amp; Penelope on the front desk were very professional. Eric, staff member, helped get silverware and plates when our caterer forget them. Theresa, staff member, got additional drinks and coffee when asked. There were a handful of other staff members whose names I don't have who also assisted to make our stay comfortable. Thanks Staybridge for a lovely trip.Cost/night decreases the longer one stays. Across the street from the Hilton.Right off the freeway.Clean, safe, neat facility.Nice pool.Free laundry/drier.Excellent breakfasts (better than similar places) , but some snack time on weekday afternoon  ran out of food during the week.My husband and I stayed here on a cross-country trip. We had our two dogs with us and were delighted to find a place that was not only dog-friendly but dog welcoming! They gave us a little magnet to put on our door notifying staff of a dog in our room. They cut us a break on the price for the dog to $25. They were in the middle of a remodel while we were there. The room was really spacious with high ceilings. The bathroom was a little disappointing, but it wasn't dirty, so no big deal. The furnishings and the carpet were a little worn, but I felt even more comfortable having my dogs there because of it. I feel like most hotels say they are pet friendly, but they really aren't. This hotel was actually pet friendly. The price was average - about $100 plus the pet fee and all the hotel taxes. Internet was free, and the complimentary hot breakfast in the morning was great - eggs, bacon, sausage, make your own waffles, etc. and good coffee. I would stay here again if we are ever in the area. I was actually so impressed with this Staybridge that I sought out another one when we stopped again in Albuquerque!Of the twenty or so IHG hotels that I have stayed in over the past two years, this one is the absolute best.  A little hard to find, but well worth it.  The front desk staff made me feel very welcome on arrival.  After asking for the location of local restaurants so I could determine if we could park there with a trailer, they happily declined to give me a map and instead offered a shuttle to where we needed to go.  Now that's service!  The rooms were well insulated, which was nice for us and others - preventing my daughters noise from going out while at the same time keeping outside noise from coming in.  Truely the definition of Southern Hospitality.I have nothing negative to say about this property. Extremely friendly staff. Damon at the front desk was accommodating, helpful, and so kind. After learning about my rough day, he tried to expedite the process, made good conversation, and gave me a cold bottle of water which goes a long way in the Memphis heat. It was my first taste of southern hospitality. The room was HUGE, clean, and comfortable. I wish I could've taken the bed linens and mattress home. The shower was hot with good water pressure. Free laundry!!!  The fully equipped kitchen would be nice if I was there longer. The suites even come with dishwashers and soap unlike Extended Stays!! HIGHLY recommended!I'm a frequent business traveler and recently relocated to Memphis. I resided at this hotel for close to two months (with a few absences for business travel). The staff and management are very courteous and professional. The rooms (stayed in a couple) are clean and well-appointed (for this class of hotel). The area is geographically-centric to many restaurants along Memphis' main retail and restaurant strip...Poplar Avenue. Convenient to Germantown. Twenty minutes from downtown. Twenty minutes to the airport. Any time of day, easy to get a good rest (quiet!). Relocation is highly stressful, but this facility and the staff made it easier. They even provided me with a storage locker during my absences.",,,,,"['nice', 'poplar', 'east', 'suites', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'free', 'available', 'prices', 'reasonable', 'bedroom',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-memphis-2,Homewood Suites,4.0,$$,19,"A truly comfortable and clean hotel to stay at for any visitor to Memphis.  The suite allows two to room together with each roomie getting their own space.Breakfast has been great and the ladies working in the breakfast area are very friendly!The bed is incredible ... So comfortable!!!Only issue is location.  Traffic in this part of Memphis is a headache and you need to get to the downtown to do anything but it's like going home at night.Great place! It is very clean, very convenient,  and close to all the places I needed including food. The suites are nice and spacey.  Love the heater!!!!! Usually it's a heater system that doesn't allow the heater to work well in most hotels. Very cool that the windows open, makes a nice cool breeze vs cold a/c. Kroger is like 5 mins away and u can get some groceries for a weekly stay. My friends family is staying here also and they got a 2 room suite,  which is perfect for 2 couples or a separate room for the kids. Highly recommend! !This is the second time that my family stayed here whilst visiting their favorite child/sibling (me, obviously). I don't remember anything particularly disconcerting about the first stay, everything seemed ok. They serve dinner on select nights, where they offer food that looks pretty gross and cheap beer. As the lettuce offered as salad is the only vegan thing, I haven't actually tried the food, so maybe it tastes better than it looks. During their most recent stay... Hahaha. It's not funny, but I had a good laugh about it... Upon their arrival, the shower had someone's hair stuck to the wall and a used bar soap on the ledge (gross, right?), so they informed the cleaning woman of the problem when she arrived at their room. In retaliation, she did not clean the shower and then pooped in their toilet and left it for them. Needless to say, management was called. Additionally, it specifically states on the mirrors in the room that during a stay, a ""light clean"" will be conducted daily, including collecting trash from the room. This did not happen, all take-out boxes and other trash items piled up until my mother complained to the front desk. The rooms are large and decorated nicely. They are poorly lit, and the plates and silverware provided are not adequate. Additionally, the ""light clean"" supposedly includes staff running the dishwasher for you, which didn't happen. This was the last stay at the Homewood Suites for my family. For as much as they charge, the service should not be so disgusting.Nice extended stay lodging. The suites are spacious with many amenities. The kitchenette has it all. Very comfortable bed. Full self-serve breakfast included. Good location with many businesses close by.Hotel was recently renovated. Rooms were large and modern however a little dark. This was probably due to the dark wood cabinets but they still looked nice. The stainless steal appliances were a great touch.  The bed was very comfortable but the pillows too soft.  The staff were all very nice. I'd recommend itI have never stayed at a Homewood Suites before, but was very pleased. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast and coffee was delicious! Large breakfast buffet not just toast. Will stay again.There's really nothing about the place that's great, but on the same hand, there's nothing that bad either.  It definitely could use some updating and some general maintenance.  The lobby has been updated and is pretty nice.  The breakfast is your standard hotel breakfast fare.  The bed, for me at least, leaves something to be desired.   It can be a bit tricky getting here in heavy traffic as well.  Almost learned that the hard way!Nice place. Sits on hwy island. Tricky to get to. From 240 exit 15a, then as you merge off exit move all the way to left and take immediate left exit ( not marked) . It's only about 100 yards after merging. This swings you around .going back towards 240 is on yor left right away. If you can't get over quick enough, take your first right and turn around.There were remodeling and workers left door wide open 2 nights in a row. I informed them after the first day. Complained to manager about the security concern. He was very nice. He assured me they will resolve  the issue as safety of everyone is top of the list.I will stay here again.Mister is staying there as I type this while we wait on approval for a residence. I came this past weekend to find us a place and stayed 5 days with him. I personally loved the place. Our suite opened to a hallway and not outside. The suite is clean. Nothing in poor condition and nothing appeared dated. Housekeeping was consistent and accomodating. The full breakfast was decent. Not a fan of powdered or liquid eggs so I didn't eat them. There were decent options to choose from. It's located near plenty of restaurants and places to shop. The pool, gym and laundry room were clean. The Wi-fi signal is strong in the rooms and computers (Windows and Mac) are available in the lobby.The desk staff is friendly. I would come back again.Fantastic friendly staff!!!!  Very helpful in every way.  My room was extremely clean and maintained, I even received a nice note from my housekeeper daily.  The hotel was so very nice at accomodating to my group with shuttle runs.  They even made a few extra runs for us when needed.  The food was good, and the property very nice and maintained.  I highly recommend this property.This place was great. The staff was charming and helpful. The room was spacious with everything we needed for our stay. Loved the breakfast every night and the weekday dinners - thanks Lucky! (Or as we know him - L U see kee) We would definitely stay here again.  Paul at the front desk can solve any issues you have. He is a true professional. My 4-star rating was due to our being designated a king room after making reservations 6 months in advance for 2 beds.This place was a dump, it really was.  The rooms were funky and dirty.  The pool water was pea soup green.  Everything seemed to break down and they were so cavalier about it.  My air condition was broken for three days and they did nothing in spite of twice a day requests to look into it.  Staff seem more interested in twerking around the lobby instead of taking care of clients.  I can't even bring myself to waste time writing about this place.  It is the worst Homewood Suites in the Hilton chain.  I'm never coming back.My standard rating for Hampton / Homewood / Hilton Garden / Double Tree / etc. is 3 stars, but I found this one lacking a bit compared to the rooms in which I typically stay.  Pros: suite was very large, WiFi signal was strong, breakfast was above average (for a Homewood) and the morning staff were friendlyCons: everything was worn and kind of dingy, cleanliness seemed somewhat suspect, suite door opened directly outside like a motel, and the evening staff were moderately rudeI have stayed at several Homewood Suites and this is the only instance that I've encountered where my room door opened directly to the outside parking lot.  While I realize that any ax-murderer worth his salt would not be hindered by an entrance into a hotel hallway, it does provide more of a sense of security to have that buffer.  Regarding the worn and dingy comment, everything worked properly, but the suite needed some maintenance.  Most of the furniture had some sort of staining on it, the carpet looked old and worn and needed replaced, one of the closet door mirrors had a small crack across the bottom, and the bathroom fixtures were dated compared to most hotels I've stayed in recently.  Mostly because of the dingy carpet, this overall gave the impression that the room was dirtier than it likely was; however, there were a few cleanliness issues, especially around the air intakes and outlets for the air conditioning.On a positive note, the common area near the main desk seems to have been updated recently and was clean and modern.  The breakfast area was also nice and the food was a bit better than in similar hotels.Although this hotel may be a bit tricky to get in and out, it's definitely worth it. I stayed for two nights ($123/night) in a suite that was more like an apartment - separate bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, and fireplace. I do wish the fireplace had worked though. Guessing by the cobwebs, it hadn't worked in a while. There was some construction when I stayed, so there was no lobby. I was confused when I wanted to check in because initially the door to ""registration"" was stuck. According to a letter, renovations are scheduled to end this month.The free breakfast could use improvement. I realize it's free, but even Hampton Inns (another Hilton chain hotel) or other Homewood Suites have better breakfasts. The first morning I stayed, the only hot breakfast items were biscuits and fried chicken. There's a waffle maker, so making a chicken and waffles breakfast is a no-brainer to a southerner, but my manager from Washington, DC was a bit confused at first. The second morning there were eggs and ham, but the ham in reality was hot cold cuts. Nevertheless, I think I would stay here again because of the location for where I need to be for work. In addition, there's a Starbucks, Corky's, and other restaurant options down the street. I definitely like the living room setup; as much as I travel, it really feels like a home away from home.This was a nice place to stop for the night. The property is large and has unusual amenities for a homewood suites. Basketball court, picnic tables  and gas grills dot the property. The people above us were very loud in the morning but that's not the hotel's fault. Breakfast was good and the staff was on top of keeping the breakfast area clean. The staff was very friendly. I would stay here again.I don't recommend this hotel.  We had reserved a King suite room and chose this hotel based on this room.  There were several of us traveling and we like staying all in a suite so we can visit.  We arrived at the hotel around noon to make sure we knew where it was, checked with the front desk to see what time our room would be ready. They told us around three. We came back at three and was told our room wasn't ready, so we sat in the lobby. At about 430 I went back to the front desk to ask about our room and it was then we were told the room we booked was not available, the people in it decided to extend their stay.I've asked to do that at other hotels and been told no, because the room was booked.  apparently this doesn't matter.We were given a different room for the night, and it was disgusting. It was clearly a neglected room.  The AC did not work, when I opened the closet panel it was filthy. We were extremely hot all night because it didn't work right and was very noisy.The dishwasher didn't work right. When I went to get a cup out of it, the dishes in it, were caked with food. The dishwasher had been run because the dishes were warm.Also the towel rack in the bathroom was rusted and pitted and should have been replaced ages ago. The GFCI faceplate in the kitchen had no screw and fell off.  If maintenance is this lacking, It made us wonder what else isn't being done at this property.The next morning, I gave the front desk a list of what was wrong with the room and they did send a maintenance man the next day to start working on the room, so I give them credit for that.  This first room I would give a one star, actually a negative one star.We were told we'd be switched to our room the next morning  I was given keys to a King suite, but when I moved all our luggage over and entered the room, it was clear we were assigned a smoking room.  So back to the front desk I went, and when I told them, they said that room wasn't a smoking room, but they would see what was going on - the room was clearly a smoking room the room did not have a no smoking sign on the door.We finally got keys to our other room and it was good.  There was a small amount of rusting on the towel rack but not like the other room.  This room I would give a 3, so I averaged that together to come up with the overall 2The breakfast at this hotel was nice with an assortment of hot and cold cereal, pastries, waffles, fruit and yogurt.  Coffee is available all day which was nice.  Vickie,  who worked at breakfast was very lovely and nice and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing her in the mornings and she put a smile on our faces.  The young ladies working the front desk were nice as well.A light dinner is available at night, nothing spectacular, a small salad bar and entree and veg.  This was nice because you didn't have to go out for dinner.  I think a good marketing idea would be to bring food in from local restaurants, a cross promotion type thing.This hotel is near nothing touristy, so if you stay here you have to drive to everything.  also getting to the hotel is very tricky because of how it is situated.  I had a co-pilot and we still missed the entrance at least once.  If you are by yourself, boot up the directions on your phone or hope your car has a GPS.We were compensated for the first night, but we wanted the room we booked, not to be stuck in a room that nobody should have stayed in.  I'd be reluctant to book at any Hilton hotel if they give away rooms. I wrote to corporate, and management at this hotel it took several days for a response, when I did get one it said they had 3 days to investigate it, and I didn't get a response for a week.  What I would have liked would have been an apology, saying they are looking into maintenance issues to make sure there hotels are well maintained and keeping guests happy.  I'm being sent a coupon for a free night's stay.  Big whoop.We traveled with four Tweens from up north. This place had mixed reviews and we were unsure. The pool was clean and the front lobby welcoming. They had a candy corner that we liked. Also fluffy bedding. NO bugs. None and we looked.  The grill area was clean and overall we enjoyed our one night stay. Starbucks and Olive Garden a short ride away.Nice people who work here. One lady has been there for 20 years. They are like a family away from your family. Free breakfast and dinner if you choose. The dinner is free Monday - Thursday and breakfast is free daily.  If you are away from home and need a home to stay, give them a chance to be your second family. It is tricky to get in and out, but it is nice. They are also planning to remodel their rooms soon.If you have to spend more than a few days in Memphis and would like a nice place to stay with a cozy feeling, I highly recommend staying at the Homewood Suites.  I've stayed here 2 out of the 3 times I've been to Memphis and it has never failed.  It definitely knows how to please its guests! Nice lobby area with a charming fireplace surrounded by cushy couches. A dining area next to the lobby provides hot, toasty complimentary breakfast complete with pastries, cereal, fresh fruits, bagels, waffles, coffee, orange juice, water, etc...Best of all, the complimentary ""light"" dinner from Monday - Thursday that changes daily. A menu is found on the fridge in your room that serves as advance notice of what dishes will be served each night for the whole month. There's always fresh salad with a variety of dressings to choose from in addition to the main dishes. Oh, but I love the salad here! I love it so much that I once opted for three huge plates of salad instead of the dinner being offered.AND there's free beer on tap from 5-7:30pm as well! I believe the two beers on tap were Bud Light and Amber Bock the last time I stayed here.Besides the free food and beer, service is just as stellar! The guys that work here are always willing to answer all the questions ranging from check-out process to best BBQ restaurant to the best gentlemen clubs around Memphis. Not that I've been to any of the clubs here, but I've heard stories. ;)Free shuttle service is provided to and from the airport, as well as any destination within a 5-mile radius of the hotel. Since the hotel is on an island - surrounded by freeways, this was a very good idea! Imagine trying to beat the cars whizzing by at 60mph while you try to get across the freeway to get some dinner and accidentally get hit. Yeah, not so fun, huh?  If you do use the shuttle service, be nice and tip the drivers! =)  They'll be nice to you and show you awesome BBQ joints you'd never hear about.The rooms come equipped with a kitchenette, pots, pans, dishes, dishwasher, refrigerator, etc.  Other amenities include a pool (for those humid, sultry summer days and nights), basketball court, free high-speed internet, a small gym, and a business center.This place is definitely a home away from home!!",,,,,"['truly', 'comfortable', 'clean', 'hotel', 'visitor', 'suite', 'allows', 'room', 'together', 'getting', 'space', 'breakfast', 'great',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-points-by-sheraton-memphis-east-memphis,Four Points by Sheraton Memphis East,3.0,$$,19,"Rooms are good, comfortable and clean.  Friendly staff.  Unfortunately, it's located in between really heavy traffic roads, which makes it a bit stressful to access.I want to rate this higher because the front desk was so friendly to me when I arrived pretty late at night. He was wonderful. I'm rating it lower based on the age and cleanliness of the room. I was too tired to switch rooms and was just there to crash a few hours before an early morning meeting so tried my best to look past a toilet seat that was broke loose from the toilet, a dirty headboard, and a older sunk in mattress. I quickly wiped down the headboard and tried to focus on sleep. As other reviews online note, the bathroom is tiny! You have to angle in to shut the door that nearly grazes the toilet. The area is convenient and safe. The rate was affordable. I chose this room over the Hyatt Place which I had stayed at for similar rate last trip because I am a SPG member and wanted to take advantage of building points on my loyalty account. I'd like to see a remodel to the building before it would be my first choice in the future.I tried to order room service, but even though all of the printed literature in the room said that their kitchen was supposed to close at 10p, when I tried to order at 9.15pm, I was told on the phone that the kitchen had already closed at 9pm. The sink in the bathroom is blocked because the plug is stuck in the down position.The door to the bathroom doesn't actually have space to close if the toilet seat is down, so you can only close the door by opening the toilet, squeezing into the bathroom, then putting the seat down afterwards.The tiling in the shower is cracked, and (more worryingly) the tiling on the wall doesn't actually reach the end of the shower, so there is a 1.5"" vertical line of exposed interior wall structure (!)The bed is ridiculously soft (and I generally like a soft bed).Showtime is programmed into the television, but is not available and there is no signal on that channel.When it rained, the cable went out entirely. Luckily it only rained for 15 minutes or so.The air conditioner is surprisingly loud, difficult to hear anything over it, very difficult to sleep through it, like a car engine level of noise. And the thermostat is completely dysfunctional, so you just have to manually turn on and off the a/c.I would be perfectly happy with no frills, but this is just a mess. Very uncomfortable and stressfull (which is not what you want from any hotel). There are too many dilapidated, broken, non-functional details. They need to spend less money on the clunky furniture and pay your maintenance staff to repair the amenities.Why is there so much hate here? Our room was clean, the hotel was clean, and we took advantage of the gym. There also is free parking and wifi. This hotel is close to Beale Street and other attractions. The only reason why it isn't a 4-star is because the breakfast is $10pp. Lame.I had the delight of having a room by the elevator with a view of a giant loud air conditioning unit. The bed was comfortable but makes this weird squeaking noise that is so loud that you can hear it through walls. I paid $10 for eggs and fruit for breakfast. The fruit was inedible because it had already started to ferment. The staff was lovely and the room was clean. As a newly minted traveling salesgirl, I'm on the lookout for a hotel chain to meet my needs. 4 Points may not be it.Perfect for business travelers.  I had no problems.  This seems like a much safer option than some other hotels closer to the airport.  Free shuttle which they booked ahead of time to ensure timely departure, newly renovated everything, comfy bed, complimentary bottled water in the rooms, free breakfast.  Chris helped me sign up with their rewards program.  I was here for work and conducted several interviews in the lobby undisturbed.  I will definitely stay here again.I would give 3.5 stars but, I could only choose a whole number. The hotel is clean and the front desk staff are very friendly. The buffet breakfast is good but, be sure to get in by 9am for the best selection. The room is standard and clean. As another reviewer stated, the HVAC unit is loud. The bathroom is sized okay for one person (at a time ) to do what they need to do. You will need to maneuver yourself to get the door closed past the commode (maybe they should have a non-swinging door instead). The hotel is close to shopping, dining or whatever you want to do in a urban city. I look forward to coming back.Got a room here through Hotwire. Showed up and there had been a bus load of people dropped off. Although there were at least 20 people checking in in front of us, we were through the line and up to our room in 15 minutes. John W. Checked us in. Super nice, very informative and ensured we had a single king instead of two fulls. The hotel just finished a large renovation and was very comfortable in the lobby. Our room was on the fourth floor corner with great views. Went up to the indoor pool with a couple of drinks and enjoyed the water before we headed to dinner. The bed was very comfortable and the room temp was perfect. Only downside was the cheap toiletries and valet cost. Used to seeing high end toiletries and.most people have a car to the hotel. Valet should be complimentary to guests.UPDATED- Read Below. Location wise: This hotel is in a bad spot. You only have access to one restaurant that is rather pricey. The shuttle will take you to other nearby places, but keep in mind that this hotel only has one shuttle that is expected to run to the airport and take customers to local shopping and restaurants. MOST IMPORTANTLY, this hotel has awful management. I am a loyal Starwood Platinum member for the last five years and I have never experienced the lack of management skill this hotel exhibits. I waited 55 mins at the airport for the complimentary shuttle service, even though the hotel is only 15 mins away. When I first called, the front desk said it would be 20-25 mins bc they were out- I ended up waiting nearly an hour.When I arrived at the hotel, I made a customer suggestion to a manager that the hotel should consider having two shuttles available, so no customer would ever have to wait such a long time. The manager on duty said that I should've called earlier in the day and told them my flight schedule. I have never within the last five years of being a high level Starwood member been asked to make prior complimentary shuttle reservations. The management was nothing short of arrogant and blew off my suggestion. The driver, Cornelius, had way more customer service skills than anyone working the front desk, or on the management team. Kudos to him and his professionalism.UPDATE: Before my departure, a front desk clerk pulled me aside and told me that the team met to better determine what they could've done better and decided to compensate me by supplying some Starwood points for the inconveniences. The amenity gift and their recognition of the situation was certainly appreciated for waiting outside for nearly an hour on a shuttle, when I would've have been at the hotel in half the time using a taxi service already at the airport.Second time staying at this hotel. I find it very reasonably priced, always very clean and the beds are plenty comfortable.This is the typical airport hotel that I don't like, except that it isn't an airport hotel.  The lobby and common areas aren't too bad, but the rooms need to be updated.  We were told that our room price included a free breakfast, but that was a lie.  There were three separate parties in the restaurant who told the waitress that we were told our breakfast was free, but she said that someone was mistaken.  Room service begins around 8:30 on the weekends, which is way too early.  I put the card that read ""Later please"" on the door handle.  We received a note under our door that said that we would have to request room service, since we left the note on the door.  What does ""Later please"" mean then?  The lighting in the room was terrible.  The bathroom was very small.  Apparently, the bathroom tiles were newly installed, since there were penciled measurement markings on the tiles.The best thing about the hotel was the free parking, free internet and the bed.Okay so I finally got my towels I requested and now I'm in the lobby and apparently there's this big white cooler filled with bottled drinks which you were supposed to help yourself with but the check in girl never mentioned. In addition, I forgot to mention that upon arrival, I was standing at the podium waiting my turn while a line formed behind me. She approached the podium and yells ""who's next?""  Duh? I'm next I say.   ...( who else would be next? The guy behind me? And besides am I in line at a Mc'Ds ? No, good evening, may I help you or Welcome to Four Pts?) what a difference from the Four Pts in Nashville.   The next morning we came down at 9:30 am for the $10/pp bkfast and found that they stopped serving at 9!  It wasn't even free . So I decided to get some free coffee, and guess what? The thermos was empty.  Not to be swayed, I asked the front desk for coffee and she asked the mgr who instead of filling the thermos, directed me into the kitchen to get some coffee.  It seems the managers here don't take ownership of anything here.Acceptable. Clean, free wifi and parking. Beds are terribly uncomfortable and are doubles, which is just too small. Stayed there over a week ago and the $50 incidental hasn't been released yet, which indicates lazy management since I know my bank always releases those asap. $10 breakfast was terrible. Woman who checked me in was incredibly rude.We loved our stay here. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even gave us breakfast because it was our wedding weekend. The room was clean and comfortable with great rates.  The only complication we had was the location because we weren't used to the area and it was hard to get in and back out again. But we  will definitely stay here again.We stayed at the one on Stansell a couple months ago and it was awesome. So we thought this one would be too but apparently the one on Stansell is newer and the suites location. The Poplar is an older hotel that they gave a facelift to because it's obvious the elevators are ancient (and not very clean). Beds are ok if you like a firm bed but they don't have queen beds, only King or two doubles (was expecting queen).  When I asked for the St Jude discount, the reservations line said there was not one but gave us some sort of alternative deal that was $10 more overall. Breakfast is $10 a person for what other hotels in the area give for free. The staff was very nice, one lady at the front desk was extremely helpful and did all she could to get us the lower rate but was not able to change it in the system so she gave me 2 free breakfasts so it worked out.Convenient location with decent rates. The room I stayed in has carpet on the floor that needs some remodeling. Air conditioning is constantly running if kept at 70 degrees. The shower head in the bathroom does not work properly.They had barbecue one day. It is also kind of complicated to get to the hotel, if you are not used to the area.Four Points Sheraton Memphis East just barely gets an A-Okay. Free shuttle from airport and free wi-fi, are nice, but I didn't need to use either. A shuttle to Beale Street might be nice! I found service on the phone and in person to vary widely, as some front desk clerks were awesome, and some scattered and unhelpful. There's no restaurant or bar, but they do serve a breakfast for $9 (didn't use, just head to the Blue Plate Cafe, nearby). I found the room to be adequate, with need for improvements. The bathroom door in my room got jammed at the toilet, needing brute force otherwise. The parking lot is policed by nice security guards, so your ride is safe and secure.This is 17 minutes from Beale, via a circuitous drive on I240. The location is kind of nice, though, as it's near Germantown, and nicer shops on Poplar Avenue. So your savings from staying on Beale can be spent elsewhere. I would probably stay in this area of Memphis again, but choose another hotel over Four Points Sheraton.I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was expecting from a three-star hotel, but my wife and I stayed here New Year's Eve night and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is well-kept, clean, has a classy (not-over-the-top) decor (main lobby, hallways, and rooms - ours at least), offers free wifi, has a very large fitness center with modern, fully-operational equipment, and every member of the staff we came across was friendly and acknowledging.  The location is convenient to Beale Street and the downtown Memphis area, and yields no worries about safety when coming and going during the late hours of the night.  The hotel didn't seem too incredibly busy, so no concerns about finding a good parking space; but I'd imagine if it were at full capacity, there might be some.  We ended up making a last minute reservation for a single night, so the rate wasn't the best ($119); but for the experience and the limited notice, I'd say it was worth it.  We didn't get a chance to try breakfast since we usually stay out way too late, and wake up way too late the following morning/afternoon, so I can't speak on how good a value the $9 meal is; however, maybe it's just us, but it's like people make or break hotels in reviews based on continental breakfast, and that in itself seems silly.  But again, maybe it's just us...Bottom line, next time we're in Memphis for more than a few hours, Four Points will be on our list for convenient and confident places to call temporary home.  I think if given the chance, assuming you're not a crazed breakfast tyrant, you just might enjoy it as well.Is not in centrum but for was a good location because I had the car. Good price and good breakfast.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-by-marriott-memphis-2,Residence Inn By Marriott,3.5,$$,26,"Could the folks that work here possibly be any nicer?  From valet to check-in they treat you so very well and you can really tell that they enjoy their jobs.....The location is right in the center of it all so it's a great place to use as your hub.  I stayed at the newer Courtyard during my last visit, but wanted to be more in the center during this trip.  It's older than the Courtyard, but very clean and my suite is simply huge.Great peeps...phenomenal location....great price.  You can't go wrong.This might have been the most disappointing hotel stay I've ever had. The only saving grace was the staff, which had wonderful (albeit poorly trained) people.If you expect the Marriott or Residence Inn brands to ensure quality, you will be sorely disappointed. People who left positive reviews haven't stayed in many hotels. PROS- Hotel staff was nice, but they took their time doing anythingCONS- Hotel is ancient- Beds were uncomfortable and lumpy- Carpet smelled musty in public areas and the rooms- Breakfast was inedible- Elevators are slow- Rooms have little to no sound insulation, especially the bathrooms- Value (over $200 including tax) was poor - I've spent half as much and gotten better roomsTIPAvoid at all costs. There's nothing of note nearby.Spent thanksgiving out in Memphis and stayed here. The hotel is downtown, so yes, expect to pay $20 for valet parking daily (can come and go as you please), or $8 for self parking (which you pay everything you leave). The hotel itself was lovely. Check in process was breeze. We were helped up to our room by the bellhop and given some tourist pointers as to where and what's cracking around downtown. The room was big and spacious. A separate living/sleeping area which was perfect since we were traveling with my dad. (Nice roomy pullout couch bed). A nice sized kitchen area with fridge, micro and stove. Separate dinning area for 2. The room was immaculate. No dust, no fly away hairs from the previous tenants and it smelled fresh. Not to mention, they welcome dogs. Plenty of room for my 2 Bostons and their crate. However, the ""potty area"" is where they lose a star. When a hotel welcomes dogs, you assume that they have a designated potty area on site. Not the case here! You need to leave the hotel entirely, walk down a shady looking ally way.. Go up 2 blocks where they have this this square/park area for your pups to release. My poor Bella couldn't even make it the first go around. She peed in the ally! Lol Definitely something I wanted to mention if you're traveling with dogs. (Be sure to have a buddy embark down there with you at night.) But it was clean and provided potty bags. Also, be sure to check out the roof top terrace. Take your camera because there's opportunities for an awesome sunset shoot! This place is super close to Beal St.. Not even a 10 minute walk. And because we had such a great experience with the hotel itself and staff, we will definitely stay again! Minus the dogs.. LolI was greeted with a grunt and a frown from Elmo, the valet guy.  He was so rude, nasty and unwelcoming that even though, I was booked for six nights, I cancelled my stay and moved to the Westin hotel instead.  The rooms were also small and weirdly laid out.  Everything felt old.  I suggest you stay elsewhere.Good location, nice big suite, separate bed room, kitchen. Nice lobby and room.Stay here, it's good.This was actually one of,if not, the nicest marriotts I have ever stayed in. As soon as you walk in you feel the true vintage vibes of Memphis surround you I was expecting the room to be small,as most old buildings have small rooms,but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was very clean, spacious,and nice. All of the employees were very nice and accommodating,there's nothing but good things to say about them. The maids are up and cleaning constantly starting from  the morning. The hotel serves a great breakfast with many choices and options, you can even make your own Belgian waffles! (Yummm)  There's a whole little waffle bar set up with at least 5 different types of syrups and a bunch of toppings. The only issue with the hotel is there is next to none parking,but the valets are very good at their job and get your car to you quickly.Some Good, Some BadResidence Inn Memphis TN.  On balance good, but not all good.We are fans of the Residence Inn brand hotels by Marriott. We have stayed in them from coast to coast. We really like the amenities including the space, full kitchen (even though we never cook), WiFi, included breakfast (not ""free"", just included in the price). The staff is almost always on the ball and accommodating. First, let me give you the ""Some Bad"" part of the story. I arrived by taxi in the mid afternoon. I was alone - my wife would arrive later. The cab driver unloaded me with five pieces of luggage on the sidewalk. High end hotels would have doormen. At Residence Inn we don't expect doormen. This senior citizen (me, the old guy) drags all five pieces through the door and into the lobby. I see the desk way over there, across the lobby and in three trips manage to get all the luggage over there. I check in, get a luggage cart and load it up. At this point a guy shows up and asks, ""Can I help you with that?"" !!!! I declined the offer of the person I took to be a bellhop. I could be wrong. Maybe he was not a bellhop. He could have been another guest just trying to help me out. But over the next couple of days I saw someone who looked just like him doing employee-like tasks in the lobby.We (my wife &amp; I) like king size beds. For this trip in mid April, 2015, at first we booked our room for a Saturday and Sunday night. No problem. Then we had a change in plan and wanted to start on Friday night. Ooops. No king size bed rooms available on Friday. I tried the internet. I tried calling the national number. I tried calling the hotel itself. No king size bed rooms available on Friday. Okay. Booked a queen size bed room for Friday. ""Don't you want to have the same room for the whole stay?""  ""NO.""  The pictures of the room with a queen size bed shown on the web site look interesting. They say how wonderful the room is. It was not wonderful for us. The room had all the usual amenities of a Residence Inn like a full kitchen and a sofa and a desk and a table. But the arrangement of space was awkward. Then, on Saturday night we got our room with a king size bed. WOW. It was on the top floor and was the biggest suite we have ever stayed in. It seemed like 1,000 square feet. It had two huge rooms and closets and a room with a vanity/sink and a room with a toilet/shower. We believe they may have only two rooms with king size beds, both on the top floor. (Don't know - just a guess.)But the staff was super accommodating. They went well above and beyond to give us good service. This is the most mixed experience I have had at a Residence Inn. Would I go back? Only if I could get the room with the king size bed.Dude! Have I not reviewed Marriott Residence Inn?Hubby, my 2 sons &amp; sometimes one of their GFs, have stayed here on at least 3 trips.Twice, we have gotten a 2 br/2 ba suite with kitchenette and living room. 2 queen beds and a couch bed. Comfy beds &amp; Lots of room for a family even at $300 a night, Solid value due to great location (walk to restaurants, bars, River Walk, TomLee riverside park, Peabody Hotel, Starbucks at 3d &amp; Beale area, I-40 &amp; 55, trolley, YMCA, FedEx Forum, Redbird StadiumFelt very safe, good service &amp; valet parking is reasonable (drawback - no dedicated parking &amp; street parking is tough)Recently renovated, formerly historic Memphis apartment building, decent breakfast 7am - 10am (they start pulling items at about 945 so do not be late!). It is an older building so lower your expectations and enjoy the space &amp; location and don't look for luxury or style here. Good value, friendly &amp; helpful service.Landon was very pleasant towards everyone, and provided outstanding customer service!  My friends really enjoyed his sangria concoction too.I just left Memphis after a two day stay for Memphis in May. This is my preferred hotel when in Memphis for pleasure.   I have stayed in this hotel in the past and have enjoyed the hospitality of the staff.  Likewise,  during this stay, the staff were friendly and went out of the way to make our stay pleasant.  My friend and I stayed in a two bedroom suite The bedrooms were spacious enough for our brief stay and the views were great.  The only drawback was the noise from the street, especially the noise from the trolley.The employees at this hotel are amazing. We had a wonderful experience. They were so accommodating. The hotel is older but it has been renovated to a beautiful hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed are conversations with James. Thank you all.   We would stay here again.This particular Residence Inn is quite close to everything in Memphis, Downtown. Walking distance to Mud Island, Beale Street, and the trolly is only a block away. When I visited here, April 2013, the place was under renovation and the suite we stayed at was worn and tired, but clean. Some issues with how they maintain the place, one of the two toilets were broken and not flushing, and even after telling the desk, nothing came of it. It's a good location, the staff was very nice, but unless you get one of the new rooms/suites, I'd avoid it. Be sure to ask what the vintage of the room is.We really enjoyed our stay here.  The room was large and very comfortable.  The location was convenient and the staff very friendly.  We highly recommend this hotel.Residence Inns are my favorite Marriott hotels. I'm mostly giving this one 3 stars because of the parking situation. I honestly can not stand it when hotels don't provide parking. We were able to nab a spot on the street, but almost had to park in the garage which only takes cash. The hotel does not have an ATM. It's located nicely and the breakfast is great.This hotel exceeded my expectations. I booked it because it had the lowest rates compared to other hotels in the area. I was amazed at how large the room was and even more amazed by the incredible customer service provided by the hotel staff. It was also a short walk to Beale Street.Always enjoy our stay here.  This is an excellent location for downtown Memphis and the staff is excellent. Like the layout of the suites.  Undergoing renovation for an even better experience.Great hotel. Great location. Clean, spacious rooms with semi-unusual layouts. I avoided the whole valet parking mess by parking around the corner and ended up only paying $5, yes $5 bones for the weekend. Gotta love those automated parking lots. Anyways, the big bonus with this hotel is the nice hot tub on the roof. I really enjoyed soaking away the muscle pain from all the walking I did in this little city. I would stay there again and recommend it to others. The location is perfect for exploring Memphis' highlights.Very nice experience. Staff was great. Location excellent.  Room clean and comfortable.  And quiet.Could not sleep all night. Fans and A/C units outside the room extremely loud, avoid the 2nd floor at all cost!I really love this hotel and often advise out of town visitors to check it out before making final reservations anywhere else. It's right in the middle of downtown Memphis, just blocks from Beale Street, AutoZone Park, Court Square and the trolley line. They just renovated a few years ago, and the hotel looks fresh and modern on the inside. Notice I said modern and not contemporary. The rooms are spacious and the one that I stayed in had a little kitchenette. No need to use the kitchen to cook breakfast though as Residence Inn offers a free (and yummy) breakfast buffet for all guests. The lobbies are nice, and there are many conference rooms for business meetings and conventions. The staff is also very friendly, and there is valet service available.","We absolutely loved staying in this hotel for marathon weekend, and we'll probably return to it the next time we're staying in Memphis. In the past, we have always stayed at the Peabody or the Marriott, and the quiet, restful environment of this hotel was really welcomed for all of us runners! We also appreciated the valet parking and the WONDERFUL effort the hotel made to accommodate all of us leaving early for the starting line: While typically they didn't serve breakfast on weekends until later, they had a lot of popular runner foods out early, like bananas, bagels and, of course, coffee. Very thoughtful! I also called the desk to ask if I could buy some tea varieties in their store because what I found in the room seemed to be only caffeinated choices, and we wanted some before going to bed the night before the race. The woman at the desk told me to just come down to the breakfast area  and help myself to whatever varieties I wanted there. Again, very thoughtful!We loved our room! We had what I think is categorized as a ""one bedroom,"" and has the bed/bath area separated and slightly raised from the living/kitching/dining area. It was very relaxing and comfy. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and utensils for us. The Internet is not wireless, but wires are provided, and it's FREE. Two small things: The remote for the living room television didn't work at all, except to turn it on, and the phone in the living area didn't dial the pre-programmed numbers, so there was not way to call the desk from that phone. I didn't tell them about these issues, so I didn't give them an opportunity to fix them.This hotel is very well located for many downtown restaurants and activities, as it is super close to (but blessedly off of) Beale Street and very close to AutoZone Park, the Orpheum Theater, etc. There are also great restaurants nearby, including two of my favorites, McEwen's on Monroe and Automatic Slim's on 2nd. Rendezvous Barbecue is also very close. This is a GREAT place to stay in downtown Memphis. We loved it. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and we were quite pleased with our stay!I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The building looks a little old/dated from the outside, but that image changes as soon as you walk in the door. The lobby and mezzanine where breakfast is served and where the gym is are nicely decorated and comfortable.The rooms are even better. I love the funky layout and the full kitchen is a definate plus. The bed is SO COMFY and there is plenty of storage space. The bathroom shows a little wear and tear if you look closely, but in the grand scheme of things even that is just fine.I was happy to see dumbells in the gym - most hotels seem to just have cardio machines. The machines themselves are just fine - not the latest and greatest but certainly better than some hotel gyms I've stayed at. I love that there are two treadmills - more of a chance to get one! Looking forward to staying here again in November!Great location!!! Only 3ish blocks to Beale, close enough to walk and far enough away to sleep :-) There is valet service so you can just pull up in front of the hotel. The kind valet also helped us to our rooms with luggage etc. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful in getting us the best rate possible ($129 per night). Breakfast, happy hour, and wifi included.The rooms have a small kitchen which was really helpful for us. It makes such a difference to not have to eat out every meal. The shower is ok, but not the best in terms of luxury and water pressure. I would definitely stay here again.PET fee: $100 non-refundable one time fee for your stay. Ouch, this hurt. But, I could not find another hotel that would allow a dog in the room so I went for it since we were staying two nights. There is a park two blocks north and there is another that looks over the water about three blocks away. The down side is that the closest park has a small group of homeless and didn't feel quite as clean or safe as others I've been too. Still, it got the job done. There are tons of squirrels so if this makes your pet crazy go to the park closer to the water on Front St.Great location, clean comfortable rooms (like all Residence Inns I've been to), great front desk.  There's a $16 valet parking fee per day but you get unlimited ins and outs.  AAA discount (10%, I think).  Breakfast buffet included.  Easy walking distance to Beale street, Rendevous, Gus, and the Mississippi River.  The guy at the front desk was hilarious!  Made us laugh every time we entered or exited the hotel.  Price was not bad either (about $127/night for 3 people with AAA discount).  Free in-room high-speed internet.  One odd thing we noticed--the windows in our 10th floor room did not have any screens or anything on them, so if you opened them up all the way, someone could fall out, if they were being careless.  Dangerous for small children!I'd never stayed in a Residence Inn, and wow did it outdo my expectations. 4 blocks from Beale St. In an art deco building that was recently inducted into the historical society. The room was adorable!! If it were a studio apartment for rent, I'd be in heaven. The complimentary breakfast was way more than expected- eggs, yogurt, bagels, english muffins, toast, cereal, waffle maker.. not just your average crap complimentary breakfast. The staff was accomodating and really into making guests happy. The southern charm of a ""yes, maam"" always does the trick, too. If in Memphis, I'd recommend this hotel.This hotel has a great location, right next to Beale Street.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and since it's a residence inn you get all the typical features (free breakfast, free happy hour during the week, a kitchenette in your room, etc.).  It is clean and looks well maintained.I stay in a lot of marriotts and sometimes the residence inn is nicer than the mainline marriott in a given city -- this is the case in Memphis.  If you are deciding which marriott to book, I would pick this one over any of the others because of location + quality of the hotel.",,,,"['folks', 'work', 'possibly', 'nicer', 'valet', 'check',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-memphis-downtown-memphis,Holiday Inn Memphis-Downtown,3.5,$$,29,"Started off with valet which was super friendly and took care of us quickly. The guest services was great, check in not till 4 but we got our rooms at noon and placed us on the 10th floor with an excellent view. The beds were very comfy and pillows were fluff. I usually pick doubletree when I stay downtown but this will be my spot from here on out. Great place to stayKeeping with the Holiday Inn theme on our travels, my sister and I wanted to find a spot that was downtown that'd we'd be able to leave the car at and walk around at night without having to drive. For a Sunday night, a non-smoking, king-size bed room was $160 + valet that was $22/day. You are able to take your car in and out if you wanted to, but we chose not to considering where we were. The Holiday Inn is really centrally located and is easy to get to great bars and restaurants in the area. We did hit up the pool for a hot second. Not sure if you're allowed to smoke out there, but a guy was. The shadows caught up to us pretty quickly at 6:15pm which is a bummer since that seems like the time one would enjoy lounging in the sun. This location would do swell with a jacuzzi, in my opinion. On our floor there was an obnoxiously loud ice maker that sounded like someone vacuuming in the hallway, but we couldn't really hear it in our room. The view from our room was meh, but the bed was uber comfy, and (not sure if we were just a little tipsy or tired) but the sheets smelled amazingly fresh. I can quote my sister having said, ""I need to ask the maid what they wash the sheets in..."" before slipping into a good night's sleep. I would definitely recommend this location if you're looking to hit up Memphis downtown at a good rate to split with someone! Head out to the pool early if you want to catch some rays, and avoid a room by the ice machine!I recently stayed here during a business trip, I normally stay at the Peabody across the street but it was all booked and the Holiday Inn is very centrally located right downtown (its big selling point). Its only a few blocks to Beal street or the trolly line. The hotel staff are very friendly and generally helpful, my room was clean enough, the linens and such worn to the degree you might expect from an urban holiday Inn. My stay was not terrible, but this place does not offer anything especially terrific either. For the record, I did use the valet parking and they did not damage my car.It is a Holiday Inn, but the location is top notch. Heart of downtown with access to everything. I never really noticed this hotel until this weekend. Perfect place if you plan on having a late night of weird.There are many issues with this hotel though I will say it's location is very nice. Close to the Mississippi River and the restaurants nearby are great. However:1. check-in is 4PM... I was told NOT ONE room would be available until 4PM.... until I complained to the manager and was able to get in a room at 2PM. I have to mention... their concern for my well-being was discounted by the manager and the receptionist at the desk. Abhorrent customer service.2. The guest bathroom on the 1st floor had a piece of toilet paper between the stall doors b/c otherwise you could see through it while someone was using the restroom. This isn't fixable?3. The shower never got hot... I took a cold shower the evening of my check-in and a tepid shower the morning after.4. Turned the air conditioner on... and it made such a loud noise... I had to turn it off to sleep.5. Choose the Hilllllllttttooooonnn (IHG won't allow me to use the correct name and submit this review) down the street. You're likely to get better services and a newer hotel.Went here for a conference, and I would not recommend it. I'll be brief:(1) Yes, it is in the downtown area so that is convenient.(2) Yes, there is parking and valet. But, it is ridiculously expensive but I guess you pay for the safety of your vehicle in a less than safe downtown (comparatively to the rest of the US)(3) The conference rooms are nothing to write home about, not even the ""grand ballroom"" which isn't really so grand.Overall, I just don't know that I would stay here if it wasn't for conferences or business trips. You can find some place nicer for your personal vacations.I would love to give this hotel 4 stars. The location is great, the staff is very polite and helpful and the rooms are clean and nice, but.... After driving away from hotel about 25 miles or so my car told me I had low tire pressure. I pulled into gas station to air it up and noticed the sidewall of the tire was ripped and the wheel scratched, it was ruined. I had to replace the tire $150. This positively happened with the valet service at the holiday inn. If you stay here inspect your vehicle before leaving.I'm forced to stay here frequently due to business. The location is good as there are many different food options. The rooms have nice TVs but they are not hooked up to HD. The pillows were not cleaned. I could smell the hair product of whoever stayed the previous night on the pillows. But my biggest complaint of all, which led me to writing this review is the hot water situation here. The past 3 times I've stayed here, the hot water has been lukewarm at best. The worst part is that the front desk is fully aware of the problem and it has yet to be fixed. Completely unacceptable and I would never recommend anyone ever staying here.Pros: Comfy room, proximity to Beale, affordable,Cons: View from our room was terrible (a parking garage and the broke down Benchmark), no pool/whirlpoolOverall I have to say I was pleased with my stay.  I usually like to stay in the Peabody across the street, but it was booked the weekend I visited Memphis.  However, you can't beat the location of this Holiday Inn.  It was a quick 3 minute walk to Beale, and had tons of restaurant and bar choices close by.The room was clean and comfortable.  My room appeared to have been recently remodeled, and it was a good room for the price.  No breakfast, pool or hot tub though.  I was disappointed with that.After a long day of travel we arrived! The staff was super sweet and hospitable.  Our room was nothing special but suited us just fine. We had a view of the Peabody and were given lots of great recommendations of where to grab some food! We will be traveling back to Memphis soon and look forward to staying again.Can't recommend highly enough the staff here, they were so friendly and helpful wish we could have stayed longer. Felt so welcome at all times. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Would have been nice to have a fridge. Or a kettle for tea drinkers.But really they were great.Hotel was great ....clean, comfortable and close proximity downtown attractions, restaurants, etcetera as well as within walking distance to Beale St.   Note that valet parking is $20 and there I'd no self parking available at hotelI was on a business trip to Memphis which made me choose this hotel as it was close to my client location. The location of the hotel itself gets high points. The two things that scored top points besides the location are the staff and the room service. I would give them 5 stars for their friendly staff (they were really good i must say) and great room service. But here are a few things i noticed about this place which made me give it a 3 star rating.1. Expensive parking. $20 a night2. I had 6 issues during my one week stay which are as follows:              a. Noisy room on my first night stay here. I was later shifted to a different room which was calm and silent. I appreciate the fact that they were quick in changing my room.              b. The lamps in my room were flickering when i moved in. I had to call the front desk to have them replaced               c. The chair in my room was already broke. Again another service request to have it replaced. All the time the front desk was quick to have them replaced               d. It was impossible for me to control the temperature in the room. The Air Conditioners and the thermostats were old and hard to regulate. I had to switch off the AC to get a good night's sleep.               e. The coffee machine in my room was broke. I noticed it on my 5th day of stay but they did not replace it. Not sure why.                f. The computers next to reception area for guest use are outdated. One of it had a bad display and super slow. The other computer they had worked well but the printers weren't functional when I tried to print to them. 3. I didn't like the fact that some signs in this hotel were taped to the wall using a duct tape. Really?? Why would you even do that. Also, it wouldn't be fair for me to not mention that i saw signs ""Renovation in progress"" signs posted in this hotel. I hope they fix atleast some of these issues. I sure plan to stay here on my next trip to Memphis. BTW, there are no refrigerators in the room or even a microwave. And, the TVs need an upgrade as well.We stayed here this past weekend and had a great experience. Staff was friendly. The lobby was festively decorated for the holiday (I'm a sucker for Christmas decorations). Parking was only $12 a night. Our room was clean. Sheets were immaculate and the beds were comfortable. Bath and Body Works toiletries = yay!  I slept like a rock, I didn't hear any of the noise from the street.  Excellent location, my dude was able to walk to Beale Street and back to pick up some Dyers take out in less than 10 minutes. Rendezvous is right behind the hotel. Lots of good eats to be had in the area! The only bad: the parking lot elevators are incredibly slow. Take the stairs.From the minute I walked through the doors, I was treated with  kindness, friendliness and excellent service. I had booked two nights, but because of bad weather one of my flights were canceled and I was forced to spend the night at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. When I arrived in the morning, I told them what happened, and they didn't charge me for that night. Even better when I got there very early in the morning--hours before the official check in time--they found a room for me. In short, they truly babied me. Especially Stephanie at the front desk. Later, I had lunch in their understated restaurant and it was top notch. The chicken cooked impeccable and the ice coffee strong and perfect . The room was large, the bathroom, while small, was impeccably clean. But again, it all comes down the the service. I have rarely been treated so well, and I travel quite a lot for business.I was tied to the gov't rate so I had to stay here. It didn't have the niceties I've come to expect. No refrigerator or microwave, there was a coffee pot but no coffee (got some from front desk), no breakfast included, $12 parking. This was a bad choice for a business trip. Room is dated, I checked the sheets and they were clean but hadn't seen bleach in years, bathroom is ok, big tv, great location. The ears plugs had me worried but so far only slight noise. I won't be taking my shoes off to walk on this carpet - ugh! Internet ?This hotel was awesome! Super impressed with the quality of the hotel and the hospitality I have received here. Shout out to my home girl Trina who works at the front desk for being so wonderful to our big group!Great hotel. There was some construction noise when we first got there, but nothing unbearable. Stayed in one of the remodeled rooms, and it was pretty nice. Served it's purpose as a place to crash at the end of the night. Would stay here again.Just okay. Nothing special. Parking lot was full, so I had to park across the street. Think it's a little cheaper than the daily rate here, so I guess I'm okay with that. The rooms look &amp; feel outdated because of the chosen decor. Very convenient to everything downtown.Overpriced breakfast. $10.95 for full and $7.95 for continental.This was our home away from home during our stay in Memphis.  It is an older downtown hotel, right across Union Avenue from the famous Peabody Hotel.  Like all older hotels, it has its quirks and charm.  The quirk was the elevators.  They are old, they are in the process of being replaced, and the service elevator to the parking garage was most fun.The hotel is walking distance from Beale Street, many good restaurants, the Gibson Guitar Factory and the Memphis Rock and Blues Museum.The food in the restaurant, at least for breakfast was good.  The coffee was good.The staff was helpful, friendly and made our stay enjoyable.  I would recommend staying here if in Memphis, and would go back to this particular Holiday Inn Select in the future.","I *love* this place. In fact, if I could move in (or afford to stay for like a month) I totally would, no question. The staff is very helpful and oh-so-friendly. I've now stayed three times in the past four years (every time I've road tripped through the area) and won't stay anywhere else. Walking distance to Beale, easy parking (a bit pricey, but... I've paid more) and easy to get to Graceland or where ever else you want to go.Room service is great - quick and tasty.It's a bit older, but it's clean and the beds are super comfy. I can't wait to come back!!Ask for a real pillow not a throw pillow also the iron was damaged and messed up my shirtThe only good thing is it is close to Beale Street.  The room is poorly appointed, over priced, and small. The TV isn't HD, parking is inconvenient,  and the place just feels old. On top of all that, a jackhammer was working right above us until after 6pm.This was a good hotel. Beds were clean, carpet vacuumed, and bathroom clean. Looked like our room was renovated recently but there were so many scuffs on the walls though. The beds were to my liking and pillows. The bathroom could have used a fan. It got so steamy and hot in the bathroom when shower was on and really made the rest of the hotel room humid. The staff were very nice in the lobby and each day when we wanted towels from the housekeeper, she was very accommodating too! In the guest service book in the room, it had said the room service was open until 10:30. We called at 9:50pm and no one answered. We waited a few more minutes and called again. No answer. We then called the front desk. The front desk person went back to the kitchen and apparently the chef left. There wasn't an apology or anything. We are at the restaurant for a lunch and breakfast - on diff days. We had a nice server. Decent food on the menu. And decently priced food. The elevators were working ok but not the service elevator. It had gotten stuck a few times, luckily when I wasn't in there. I would come back again. It was a good price, safe and so close to everything - Beale St (3 blocks), FedEx Forum (4 blocks), downtown (1 block), Civil Rights Museum (15 minute walk - I walk fast).If you are an out of towner not too familiar with the Memphis area and worried that you will not be close to it all or in the ghetto, stop your search.  The hotel is located perfectly on the corner of Union and 2nd.  A safe and close walk to the ever popular Beale Street, numerous bars, and some really good restaurants.  You can even walk to the trolley which makes getting around even easier and super cheap.  The location is the greatest asset to this place.  The hotel itself is a little bit older, but not in any means rundown or shabby.  It has everything you need in your room, except an exhaust fan, and is more than comfortable.  The elevators are really fast and the parking garage is extremely convenient in a city with not a lot of parking (be prepared to pay $15 a night for parking).  We didn't check out the restaurant/bar downstairs, but it looked like it wouldn't be a bad stop at all.Be aware that there is no free breakfast to guests.  I know most hotels offer this, but not here.   I believe the breakfast buffeff was $13 in the morning, but as I mentioned previously, you are so close to so many great stops don't be afraid to adventure. Overall, this is a great hotel that is reasonably priced.  Great location and a very helpful staff.  If you are looking to spend a weekend or any amount of time in Memphis, make sure you include this hotel as part of your choices.  As an aside, we drove to Rhodes College several times and the driving time was less than 10 minutes.  Other than that we stayed parked and walked most everywhere else.We stayed at this hotel for one night. It's definitely an older hotel so our room and bathroom were small, but we didn't mind since we were not planning on spending a lot of time in the room. It was still a nice room that was clean and had a comfy bed. We requested a room on a higher floor with a nice view and they were able to accommodate us. The desk staff was friendly. The location was perfect! It's a great hotel for a quick trip to Memphis.Let's start with location - perfect!  Right down within walking distance of everything, and close to tons of recommended dining and bars.  Noise however... let's just say when you find two pairs of earplugs in little baggies next to a picture of a motorcycle on your nightstand, you get worried.  The first night wasn't too bad actually, but night 2 was horrible - very loud traffic from the street and we could hear our neighbors up and about quite a bit!  Other downside for them - is that I thought breakfast was included, and it is not.  But there is a restaurant downstairs (we didn't eat there though).  Go to the Rendezvous behind in the alley for super-yummy ribs and pulled pork!  Don't let the alley entrance scare you!  Fairly clean and comfy otherwise.  I've never stayed in Memphis before, so don't have anything in the area to compare it too.  Not sure the price was that great for a no-frills loud hotel, even with great location: $87/nt with $12/nt parking.When we made our first trip to Memphis to look for potential places to live when we relocated, we neglected to book a hotel before hand.  We rolled into town after an 8 hour drive (it was 5am) and had a hard time deciding where to stay.  We stumbled upon The Holiday Inn on Union, pulled in, and within 10 minutes I got a King room for $100 bucks per night.  This hotel is everything it needs to be- clean, quiet and in the perfect location.  The staff was friendly and we utilized the free internet room next to the check-in desk for much more than our allotted time (out of courtesy I think there's like a 30 minute limit) printing out MapQuest directions and Googling apartment locations. There's free coffee in the lobby and either cookies or donuts (some sweet breakfast-y treat in a basket) which is good enough for me!  Every time anyone from back home comes to town to visit we make them stay here.  The Peabody is simply fabulous, but if you aren't a big spender this is the best option downtown.Such an improvement!!: After escaping the America's Best Inn farther down on Union, I had this hotel as my last/only option. I had to pay twice as much, but it was worth it. The room was clean, the bed VERY comfortable. The bathroom was small, but inviting. Tons of mirrors, good lighting. Great view. The parking was a bit pricy, but I felt like my car was safe - worth it. didn't have a chance to try the restaraunt, but it looked great. Sushi place RIGHT next door. The Denny's on the other side was even tolerable. Being within walking distance to everything downtown was a plus, too. CD player/clock radio was a nice touch. Wolfgang Puck coffee in the room was good, too. It would have been nice if they offered military discounts every day of the week, though. All of the staff I encountered were extremely helpful and friendly. They offered a late check-out, if you made arrangements with the front desk. I don't know if I could afford to stay here every time, but if I could I would.",,,,"['started', 'valet', 'super', 'friendly', 'took', 'care', 'quickly', 'guest', 'services', 'great', 'check', 'till',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-memphis-primacy-parkway-memphis,La Quinta Inn & Suites Memphis Primacy Parkway,3.5,$$,24,"I stayed here for two evenings over a weekend earlier this month with my wife.  We arrived at the hotel shortly before the check in time and had no problem checking into our room. The hotel seemed nice enough with a bright well lit lobby and a nice looking breakfast area.  We ended upgetting a room on the fourth floor and as we got out of the elevator I was immediately hit by the distinct smell of weed.  That smell would linger in the hallway the rest of the night but would be gone the next day.Whenever we stepped into our room I ended up being quite pleased.  It was set up nicely with our king sized bed against one wall facing the TV and a long set of desks on the other side under the TV.  The bed ended up being super comfortable and both my wife and I enjoyed a couple of good nights of sleep.  The only real problem that we had with this la quinta was the gym.  While I myself did not go to it my wife described to me a number of broken machines with the only working one being a treadmill.  That was disappointing as the rest of the hotel seemed rather nice.The bottom line for me is that I would stay here again in the future. While it certainly wouldn't be confused with a luxury hotel, it was clean and comfortable and I enjoyed my stay.This LaQuinta stay has been on par with other La Quinta stays. I wouldn't stay here if my in-laws weren't rewards members, but who argues with the in-laws on a trip?!  It's easier just to go with the flow, so here we go!Hotel still offers smoking rooms, which you can smell from the hallway. It's pretty unpleasant and the smell seeps into the non-smoking rooms.  Minus 1 star!I didn't experience the hot tub, heated pool, or use the WiFi mentioned by the front desk. So, I can't comment on those.The elevator nearest to breakfast is pretty terrifying; it felt like being on a theme park ride. Continental breakfast was okay. They have waffle makers, cereal, bagels, toast, and apples. There is also biscuits and gravy, but they're cold on purpose. There's a microwave, but, no thanks.  I would have liked to see some bacon or eggs, or something else hearty.Shower had hot water; toilet and sink worked fine.  Plenty of seemingly clean towels available. There's a star. The bathroom is half of the hotel room, and a pretty important part of the stay. Room feels dirty. It looks dirty. There's a pretty large dark stain in the carpet at the foot of the bed (picture included).  Everything that was once white (smoke detector, telephone, light switches, lamp shades, AC, caulk all over) is now dingy and yellow. The bathroom is updated but the rest of the room could use a refresh. There are dirty corners and damaged walls. Put it this way- you wouldn't feel comfortable walking around barefoot in this room.  Minus 2 stars. The room, after all, is the most important part of the hotel.No USB charging ports, but there is a 32"" flat panel TV, and it actually has HD channels.  In my experience, most hotels just slap a flat-panel in the room and expect it to be an improvement over an older CRT TV.  That's usually not the case when they pump standard digital, (or even analog, yuck) signals into these nice TVs. It doesn't work like that; you need HD!  They've done it right, so that's a plus.  Sadly for me, that's only the 2nd star. I can't go any higher than that.This is a review that I wish I could give three and a half stars.  The lobby and the exterior are lovely.  There is a swimming pool, hot tub and laundry room.  Our room for one night was $99, which is very reasonable for the location.  The rooms are large and very comfortable.  There is a nice long desk spanning across the window area of the room.  There is plenty of storage and light and the bed is very comfortable.  The room itself seems very clean.  Our bathroom is in a bit of disrepair.  There are cracks in the ceiling and the bathtub needs to be replaced.  There is a huge hole in the middle of the bathtub.  The toilet is so low to the ground that it is extremely uncomfortable.  Also the water level is very close to the toilet seat, which can present problems, especially for men.  Know what I'm talking about?  My boyfriend knows.The temperature in the room can be set to either hot or cold.  There is no in between.  The temperature was 90 degrees outside, so we chose cold.  It is so hot and humid at a temperature higher than 68, which was the temperature the thermostat was set at when we entered the room.  We both thought it was too cold, so we set the thermostat to 72.  Within five minutes the room was humid and uncomfortably warm.We are only staying at this hotel for one night and overall we are very happy with our visit.In contrast to the somewhat gritty neighborhood of the last La Quinta in Memphis that my wife and I patronized, this property appeared to be located in an upscale city neighborhood. We knew we picked the right place for us and our dachshund when we saw the ad on their front door advertising how pet-friendly they were.  The gentleman at the front desk person was pleasant and seemed genuinely interested in our travels.Our accessible room was the most spacious of the four Tennessee hotels we stayed in during our road trip. The room did have an unique shape with an almost circular foyer and interestingly provided two mini-fridges. The one minor ding I would give is that there was no ice machine on our floor. We did not have the opportunity to partake in the free breakfast, fitness center or the pool but the latter two looked enticing to me. If you don't need to be in the heart of town, this hotel makes for a comfortable, welcoming stay.This is by far one of the worst hotels I have ever visited. The room smells heavily of mold and mildew, the staff is not helpful at all! When my husband made the reservation, he requested a crib. When we got there it was not in the room so he asked again. Long story short, they didn't bring the crib until after midnight! I had to stay up with my little one to make sure he didn't roll off of the bed, which he would definitely do. He's a squirmy little guy.My husband, aka Save a Penny Jenny, only chose it for the price and location. We will pay extra next time and stay downtown.Decent hotel for a decent price and it's in a good location. The front desk people were friendly and knowledgeable about the area which I really appreciated. We were told what streets to avoid if we were going drinking on beale because of dui traps. THAT WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED lol eateries near by typical fast food fare, not that far of a drive to tunica mississippi. The rooms were a little dated, but clean and no sign of insects. It's worth staying one night.If you are traveling with dogs and you are a non-smoker, this hotel doesn't care. The hotel is very clean compared to most the La Quinta chain hotels, but their breakfast is horrible.Not fancy, but good, clean place for a decent price. If visiting St Francis hospital, it's just a walk across the street. I always get a nice welcome when I visit. Breakfast area could use some more choices, but it is a continental breakfast style. Pet friendly too. Yes, whoever cleans, needs to address the public hallways, and the garbage cans in the hallway.For the price of $65 a night, this place is just perfect.  On our way from Dallas to Cincinnati we needed someplace to stay in the middle.  For the price and the amount of time, this seemed to be just what we needed.  The bed was comfy (and clean) the bathroom was big (and clean) and the room was big enough (and clean) with a large TV, desk, bed and bench, that we could relax for the whole 9 hours we were spending here (mostly sleeping). The front desk staff was very friendly and surprisingly the continental breakfast the next morning was better than I expected.  Belgian waffle maker, bagels and muffins, cereal, eggs (hard boiled...but still), yogurt and fruit.  Juice and Coffee.  Perfect. It's a quiet hotel even though it's right across from a hospital.  So if you ended up getting sick or accidentally incur a fatal wound, no worries help is close.The staff very friendly, room very clean, pet friendly. Nice courtyard with smoking permitted, gazebo, pool, hot tub. Breakfast typical cereal, hard boiled eggs, etc. The grounds are so well kept, enjoyed our stay...The hotel staff was excellent. The room was average but very clean. The walls are thin and if you're there on a busy weekend bring ear plugs! The hallways were dirty and stayed that way all weekend. There was a pizza box next to a trash can in our corridor when we checked in Friday night and it was STILL there Monday morning. The grounds were very pretty and serene. There too they could have used a scrub brush. It could be a very nice place with a little work.I Hotwire'd this hotel after a bad experience at an Extended Stay in the area. I was disturbed by the Extended Stay (for which I had a free night voucher), and decided to leave. The room was unique and modern, and the bathroom was clean with new fixtures. I would gladly pay for a room at this hotel rather than get the crappy Extended Stay room for free.Im really torn on how to rate the hotel.  Here is why:The rooms were nice,  big comfy beds, nice view good size flat screens...the doors to the bathroom were flimsy closet doors that lacked privacy or any sort... and the elevators were SLOW.   The breakfast was good in the mornings, and the woman service was quick and attentive. The hotel its self is in a great location.My big displeasure....We arrive Saturday,  that night we are heading out to go to the casinos and we hear a new born kitten mewing. we look high and low and finally discover the poor baby is trapped in the column outside the hotel. immediately we go in and tell the woman on shift,  who tells us yep- someone told them about it - YESTERDAY- We ask why is it still in there, and she tells us she doesn't know what the manager has plans to do...  The next morning sure enough the pool little baby is still trapped and mewing, we get the manager of the hotel who tells us they are not going to destroy the column to rescue the kitten, tried to explain how it is a support structure and it would not happen, we explained that no it is not a support structure, the bottom was obviously hollow, we could remove a panel at the bottom and let the lil baby out, he said no. we told him he was heartless and went on to call the Shelby county animal control, the aspca, the non emergency  help line and 2 other numbers we found and no one seemed to give a damn...  Which is unacceptable...  heaven forbid you take a couple nails out of the wood and make an escape route for this lil baby... instead it gets to suffer and bake inside this column in 85+ degrees until it dies....   Nice heartless people.... Whats a better welcome to a hotel then the smell of decaying kittens... :(Me, my husband, and 2 Boston Terriers shared a room with a king sized bed. The room was huge, clean, modern. Dogs loved  it bc there was room to run around. I loved the bed. Dogs stay free. Free Breakfast.Spacious room, great bedding, very clean overall....no complaints!We found this room deal on Travelocity and stayed here for only 60.00 during Mother's Day Weekend....can't beat that!The parking was well lit and this seemed to be a very nice area.Decent room for a reasonable price in a nice area of East Memphis. The hotel room cost us ~$90 and was quiet, spacious, and clean. Nearby were several good places to eat, like Ruth's Chris and P. F. Changs. The surrounding area seemed safe, comprised mostly of medical buildings, strip malls, and restaraunts.The room had recently been renovated and featured laminate ""wood"" flooring in the entry and bathroom. Flat screen HDTV mounted to the wall. Plenty of lighting. The bathroom was large and the water pressure good (and HOT!). The bed was fairly comfortable for a hotel bed, but it had a weird faux suede blanket on it that was warm but not really comfy because it was thin and heavy. Free breakfast in the morning was standard fare: bagels, muffins, cereal, Belgian waffles, juice, coffee, you know. The OJ was gross and the coffee tasted like gas station coffee, but whatever. It's free. The eating area was large and they had Sportscenter on, so no complaints there.We stayed here because it was across the street from the hospital and we were in the middle of a newborn adoption. We came at the last minute &amp; we had to get a smoking room. Jasima was the clerk &amp; she was so helpful. She told us to have the person in the morning switch us to a nonsmoking room in the morning when one comes available. The next day we spoke to Laleita and let her know what was going on. She told us to check back with her later to see if we could switch. When we came back from the hospital she had switched it without us even having to ask. We were so grateful for the staff's care and concern for us while we were staying there and making things so easy while we were going through a challenging time. We are telling everyone to stay at La Quinta!The hotel room itself was fine. LCD/LED tv, fridge, king size bed. The problem was the area. Two cars, including mine were broken into! They got a whole $3 out of my dash. $175 to replace the window and 2 hours later I was back on the road. I parked on the side of the hotel. Not the back. Apparently, this was not the first time it had happened either! Beware with this one.Pretty nice hotel, we were having a nice day enjoying the room until two hours after we decided to go the car to go out, and found the driver side  window broken and my $300 gps and the $250 speed radar detector where gone...   Everything happened between 7:00 pm and 9:00pm.... And yeah front desk forgot to tell us that memphis in general is a dangerous city, and also to take your valuable with you....But besides that, the hotel try to help us everywayThe hotel room was so lovely! It looked like a much more expensive hotel, but we did have some little issues. First of all, the pet floor was the second floor. We had to take both of our big dogs up and down the elevator to go outside, that was a little rough for them. The only other issue we had isn't the hotel's fault, we had terribly loud neighbors who seemed to be having a party all night. This is an ok place to stay overnight, but if I were going to stay a few days I might find someplace else.","There were several problems with our room: bathroom sink leaked on floor, drain in tub broken, no toilet paper in room, along with a slew if housekeeping issues. M&amp;M melting behind toilet, empty water bottle under AC unit, Gatorade bottle left on floor next to garbage can, used paper cup on floor by the bed, weird dried liquid on the bathroom door and the mirror in the room, weird dirt/stain on the bed spread, used toothpick on the night stand. For the price per night at La Quinta, the house keeping should be on point. The only saving grace of this stay was we brought all of this up at checkout and they comped one of our nights.Great room &amp; very affordable. Perfect for our purposes of staying a night on our road trip across the states.We had lots of problems with our room- not the least of which was that the electric blinds would not shut.  The major issue was cleanliness.   Lots of grime left around and when we went to make coffee we found that the coffee grounds from the previous occupant were still there.The front desk was ""sorry"".For the first time, La Quinta has failed me!$105/night for a spacious, modern suite with hardwood floors and two TVs (one 42"" flat screen plasma in the living room), and a bed so comfortable you'll forget you're in a hotel room.I would NEVER have expected such plush surroundings at a La Quinta Inn. I'd read that the hotel had just been remodeled, but didn't expect to walk into an HGTV makeover! Incredible. I also experienced wonderful service upon check-in, and the host recommended fantastic bbq in the area.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/vista-inn-and-suites-memphis-memphis,Vista Inn & Suites Memphis,3.0,$$,31,"place is great! hidden little spot right around the corner from beale street, i called and made a reservation and asked them how far beale street was and they answered with just a 3 minute walk around the corner!, well dang they wernt kidding!, see that some folks say the location is seedy but everyone that comes to this location is here for one thing! beale street, so not sure why they say that hotel is perfectly fine, sandra front desk/ breakfast attendant was very helpful and made fresh scrambled eggs and waffles, parking was free and the lot was spacious and was safe. rooms were nice and clean/ staff was excellent nothing i didnt like about the place, everything was greatFirst time in Memphis means you definitely want a convenient location to check out Beale St. and downtown. While looking for a spot, my friend and I were surprised at how pricy some of the accommodation was in this city. With a little more research, we ran into Vista Inn &amp; Suites and chose this place since it was affordable.The verdict? Clean. Decent. You get what you paid for (YEP!)Your basic motel stay is really what you can expect from Vista Inn &amp; Suites. There is complimentary parking available and a nice reception desk which friendly staff. The motel consists of two separate buildings, which some rooms being smoke-friendly. Be sure to specify in your reservation which you want. We ended up in a smoking room and our clothes definitely smelled like such.Complimentary breakfast in the morning with pastries, cereal, and egg/waffles made to order. Rooms were decent and freezing when we entered, but crank up the heat and that problem is fixed in no time. The Wi-Fi here works okay but can go off sometimes. Be patient and it'll come back on eventually! For the TV selection, there were limited channels, but you'd be able to find at least a news station to relax to before going to bed.The real key is that it's two blocks from the southern end of Beale Street and downtown. No need to drive over/find a DD. The area is a bit sketch, so be sure to walk in groups to the area and have a good time. You'll appreciate its proximity which really makes Vista Inn shine.We went for this place given it was pet friendly and downtown. The price was good for the location, but as other say in the reviews, you get what you pay for. If you have a pet, you will be forced into the smoking rooms. They will also charge you a fee for you having the pet (which is pretty standard, just surprised we were forced into a smoking room and charged extra for it). Upon getting into the room, I realized we probably should have went with a different place. It was dirty, the heater was loud, the remodel they had done looked to be half-assed, missing fixtures covering the vent in the bathroom.. the list just goes on and on. There was a dead roach on the bathroom floor along with cigarette ashes. I wasn't brave enough to sleep under the covers either given the condition of the place. I noticed a hard item poking me in the back when sleeping that night, and after pulling back the sheets noticed it was a lighter... yes.. a lighter. How a lighter managed to get between the sheets was beyond me. That just makes me think they probably didn't change them from the previous guest. I will state the staff was really nice. The location was awesome as we were able to walk over to Beale St. Parking was free, and they offered breakfast the next morning. Out of all honesty though, you might be better off sleeping in your car. Chances are that it'll be a lot cleaner. Don't make the mistake we did, spend an extra $30 for a place down the street. You'll be a lot happier.Having caught wind that there was a very real possibility that our trip to Memphis may be cut short (if not canceled altogether) and with the usual no-refund-for-last-minute-cancellations hotel policy in mind, we opted to look for a budget hotel located as near to downtown as possible. With these criteria, Vista Inn was where we ended up staying.First thing that needs to be addressed is that the area seems to be rather seedy, especially when you arrive late at night. I can say, however, that while it did not seem like Pleasantville, we never felt unsafe during our stay. It is conveniently located close to AutoZone Park, Beale Street, and other attractions in downtown, and this is a major plus.The beds were not the most comfortable, the sheets and towels were a bit scratchy, but the refrigerator in the room was very much welcome. We were not unrealistically hoping for a luxe experience, but we were not hoping to wake up to a spider inches within our faces, either. I would give Vista Inn two stars, but the budget prices, free parking and convenient location are urging me to give them three stars. Do not automatically count them out if you are looking for a hotel downtown, unless you want five-star accommodations and/or are arachnophobic.Great location !! Right downtown memphis.. next to Beale street and near sun studios... and all restaurants and all are just around the corner. Free parking, free wifi,  free hot continental breakfast from 6 till 9 am.. real nice helpful staff.. I'm really glad we stayed here. The rooms are ok... that's why I don't give it the 5 stars... the price was ok.. not too cheap not too expensive.. half of the tv canals weren't working so that was kind of bad since we were staying 4 nights and we like to relax and watch some tv at night so... other then the somewhat dated room we were very satisfied with all! If i would come back to memphis wouldn't mind staying here again !I decided to come to Memphis for New Years festivities and the Liberty Bowl. This was the only hotel still available.  You can hear all outside noises... I mean full conversations. My nonsmoking room reeked of smoke when I first entered it. The room is tiny. It did seem to be ""clean"".This hotel was very dirty. They charged me extra for a nonsmoking room claiming that nonsmoking rooms by definition were nicer. I'm  glad i didn't  look closely at the smoking room - just a whiff was enough to make one feel ill. So, this nicer room included a half used bottle of shampoo, an air conditioner that hardly worked (really a bad thing when it is in the 90's), tv didn't work, free cockroach and an attempt at a modern style in the bathroom where the sink is missing a leg. I will not stay here again. I could find similar lousy ammenities for a fraction of the price.Decided to take a girls trip and didn't want to spend too much on a hotel. Wow, that was a mistake. Not a good place to stay. Especially if you are a female and unfamiliar with the area. When we first checked in to the room, we were told our room will be ready at 3pm despite check in time being at 2pm.We finally get to our room and the door doesn't close. How do you give someone a room knowing that the door is broken???Management came and fixed it but my experience already ruined. Didn't think stay could get any worse. Wrong. Heard people next door getting intimate, people blasting music at 2am, people above us having a frat party, seedy looking guest, trash left outside of door, renting out parking lot to game goers and no spaces left for actual guest, etc.But it's close to Beale st and the baseball stadium!!My first annoyance was the $12 upgrade fee they charge for a nonsmoking room. I don't know why you would charge someone extra for a fresher space but whatever. Not a huge deal. But I definitely could have done without the dirty sheets and towels, bed bugs, and lizards. Not even joking. I saw something scamper across the floor and thought it was a mouse until I saw it moving much slower. Got up a bit closer and realized it was a lizard. I'm from NYC and a true city girl to the fullest. So, I wasn't feeling nature making itself at home in my room. I booked here despite the reviews and against my better judgement only because it was last minute and really didn't seem all that bad from the pictures. But I won't be staying here again. Next time, I'll invest in something a little nicer for cleanliness and comfort's sake.The place is not all together horrible but, not the nicest. They give you shampoo and soap from other hotels, I  wonder why they have these. The shower curtain was moldy and the bathtub was dirty. The office person was nice. About 4 blocks away from Beal street and 2 blocks from the Peabody, that is the best part about the hotel. If you can afford to stay somewhere more expensive, you should do it.Five stars not because it is a five star hotel but because it's top notch for what it is. Upon checking in I met the nicest gentleman. We talked about food, health and how much we both dislike Walmart and he mentioned a great place to eat, but unfortunately the Blues City Cafe was undergoing renovations and was currently in another building with a very limited menu. Moving on to the room, walked into a very clean smelling room. Furniture was new, bed was just right, linens were clean, NO bed bugs, carpet appeared clean, bathroom was clean, water pressure was amazing in the shower. Room was 210.Location was great (only a few short blocks) especially for the price of the room ($60ish). I felt safe and didn't see any derelicts around. Ample parking on site. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend. There is no reason to pay $150+ to stay on or nearer to Beale St.You get what you pay for and for me being from Chicago and staying in a Comfort Inn near Springfield IL, this was absolutely nice. The reason for 3 stars you're probably wondering?As I was leaving @ 9:35 AM today (Room 273) (August 13th, 2015). I went to the bathroom to place the ice bucket back into its spot and lifted the tray that was on the counter and was greeted by a nice little brown cockroach running about. I looked at it for a while and tested its ability to run and survive, swatting it various times with the wash cloth, trying to smash it with my hand. Boy those suckers are fast and resilient. When you thought they're dead, they're not. They're the O'Possum of the insect world. The point here is it's not a surprise for me to see a cockroach in a hotel / motel of this price range, it does genuinely mean there is something wrong but what can you do when hundreds of thousands of people of all regions stay there yearly with a price like that? You get what you pay for so lower your expectations.Upon arrival, the room was very tidy, smelled good (some people complained of a cigarette smell, my wife and I are both cigarette smokers, so if there was one we didn't notice and they claim to be 100% smoke free enviroment?). Looks semi updated inside the rooms with a fresh coat of paint in both the bathroom and the outside area where the bed is. Our room was very clean, carpet was very clean, bed sheets, pillow sheets and blankets were fresh and clean.The pool was green, but while we were there I did see someone come by and start cleaning and treating the pool and refilling it with water and all that pool stuff you'd normally do. But by the time it actually looked half way decent to go swimming it was my time to leave. The select of channels on the TV was very basic maybe around 20 - 25 channels at most? Wi-Fi was spotty and slow and would drop connection most of the time. Girl at the service desk was very nice and joked around with us about our northern accents. All in all, this place is classic case of you get what you pay for. Don't expect top notch but don't expect it to be a complete dump. It's just that happy median it's ALRIGHT. It's close to Beale St, AutoZone, Sun Studios, Graceland, Gus's chicken and there is plenty of parking during the weekdays, I had not a single issue as some have said in reviews with the parking lot being loaded with cars (maybe the weekends sure but weekdays expect no issues unless its some special occassion)Don't be turned off by the reviews please. I was at first but I took a chance and was happy with what I got, with an exception of the cockroach but if you're going to be out all the time on Beale ST, this is just an alright place to sleep, you want high quality then go look in the 250 - 300 dollar price range elseware, if you just want a place to crash and freshen up with no bullshit, this is it.Old motel in the middle of town.  Close to everything, so not planning on staying in the room, just wanted a place to lay my head. For that it is great.  Clean room cold a/c hot water.  If you want luxury stay at the Peabody and pay $200 per night!Room stunk of cigarette even though it was a non smoking room, wifi dropped in and out, shower curtain had mould on it, and our toilet didn't seem to be attached to the wall properly. The only plus to this  hotel was its location and cheap price and that's just the thing you get what you pay for I guess. We literally were only there to shower and to sleep so thankfully weren't there too long to have it totally bother us.This place is a dump!!! Not joking bugs remote broke then got a different one had to walk back down there to get it and it was broke tv was junk door lock broke no dead bolt no fire alarm no covers on outlets bathroom yuck tube/ shower black asked for my money back and the guy refused to give me my money back but we still left it was to yuck to stay here please don't go there just keep driving I give this no stars because it was so gross and dirty I would never stay there I would rather sleep in my carWOW, what a dump!!  I have honestly never stayed in a hotel where I basically cried myself to sleep because I felt so disgusting just being in the room.  There was mold (of the black and green varieties) on the ceiling, huge (blood?) stains on the carpets and hairs on the bed and in the bathroom towels.  There were drunk people screaming in the middle of the night... I heard ""B**TCH, GET THE F*** UP"" and then tried to fall asleep as quickly as possible so as to pretend that I really wasn't lying there in filth listening to these hillbillies fighting with each other.  The location is good; however, I would seriously blow my budget and pay to stay in the Peabody or somewhere next time.  I DREADED going back to this hotel room even when I was drunk.  Would recommend staying as far away from this craphole as possible.If you want 5 stars go to another place. If you want affordable yet clean stay here.  Jessica was on duty and very sweet.  I asked to see a room prior to paying and she gladly showed me a room. That room had a large stain on the comforter and the tub was very stained. She could tell by my face I was not real happy so she showed me another room. Much better.  I checked for bed bugs did not find any.. was walking distance to beale st. I would stay again. I am a total hotel snob and for me to say I'd stay here is something. ..This place is terrible! Room was dirty, carpet disgusting, missing light bulbs, clogged sink, bath tub plug didn't work, holes in walls with tape over them, tv was too dark to watch even after adjusting it, pillows were old and stained, bed broken on one side, wifi is very weak, no security locks, no fire alarm, my dog found rodent bones in the parking lot twice. I did ask for a refund and was refused.Not the nicest by any means, room smells like crap and deadbolt was busted, burn marks everywhere, but it's cheap and close to Beale street.This place is ok for what we needed it for.  A one night stay while we stopped in Memphis on our way to Georgia.  It's definitely a no frills hotel.  Some pros and cons:Pros:-great location-private off street parking- staff is super friendly and helpful - lots of pillows on your bed, makes for a good nights sleep- the room is overall pretty clean - the black out blinds are bomb - they offer pastries and such for breakfast (I didn't get to try it  as we slept past 9am that day)- room did come with a small microwave and fridge Cons:-the sheets are clean, but ours had a cigarette burn on the top sheet- towels are clean, but super dingy and cheap quality - WiFi is free, but spotty and slooowwwww - bath tub was super dirty and should probably be replaced because there is no coming back from how it looks. - they don't supply many toiletries, there was no conditioner and no wash cloths. - isn't a very modern hotelOverall, for what I paid (close to $100 for a king size bed) I expected a littler nicer quality of room.  I might stay here again if its just a one nighter b/c even tho it was close to $100 it was the cheapest rate to stay close to downtown.  If I was staying longer, I will probably fork over more money and stay someplace a little nicer.   Oh and they accept pets for a $30 additional fee.","Not at all bad for the price.  We paid for the ""hostel"" room for 4, expecting bunk-beds, but actually got 2 double beds. The room was fairly clean, but I had to do a bit of tidying - trash on the floor (under table &amp; cabinets) from the previous guests and the counter wasn't wiped clean.  The beds were clean and bug FREE, which is the most important part!  The room has a mini-fridge, microwave, and TV.  The hot water was difficult to find and took a while to get started.  The WiFi did not work, which was a bit irritating.The location was ideal.  It was right in between Downtown and Beale Street.  The hotel looks a bit sketchy, but I felt perfectly safe.  The walls are a bit thin though and despite the fact that Beale Street was only a few blocks away, people were partying on the breezeway all night long.  Overall - for 25$ per person per night, it was well worth the money.I'm usually pretty sketch about motels, I don't like staying in them as they're usually dirty, with mouldy furniture and creepy people hanging outside your room (well that's what I imagine when I think of motels) but as we were only passing through memphis we didn't want to fork out a lot for accommodation and so decided to risk it and stay here. I have to say I was pleasantly suprised. Instead of a creepy pimp like person and the front desk, we were met by what seemed to be a college kid working there for the summer. Well dressed and spoken and was very welcoming. The room itself was tidy and the bathroom was a lot fancier than I expected. The bed was much larger than I expected and aside from the mouldy throws motels insist on using, it was v clean. I'd give it 4 stars out of 5 for a motel (maybe 2/5 if I was comparing it to say a hilton). We also walked to everywhere we wanted to see (Lorraine motel, gus' fried chicken and Beale st) in about 15-20 mins of the motel so we were pretty happy with that. All in all we were really happy with our stay!My family and I were late booking a room downtown for the first weekend in December (St. Jude Marathon weekend). Rooms book up a year in advance for that weekend. I looked everywhere and everything was booked. I happened upon the Vista Inn and they two rooms open due to a cancellation. I  booked them immediately. I was a little nervous because I had never heard of the place. Let me just say that our experience was wonderful! We have already booked our rooms at the Vista Inn for the 2013 marathon weekend. We have stayed at the Westin downtown, the Peabody and the Holiday Inn downtown. We had a better time here than any of those places! No it isn't as fancy, but it has a small town feel that the others don't have. It was very clean and the rooms were more spacious than the Peabody rooms. We were literally steps from the start/finish lines of the marathon. We could sit comfortably in the lobby of the Vista Inn and see the runners finish. The doors to the rooms face outside, not a hallway, so street noise could be an issue. If you are like most people and are a part of the street noise it won't be an issue though. Beale St is one street over, so the location is perfect! Great location but without the parking or valet fees (free wifi too)! The rooms have recently been updated and are nice. The outside is pretty plain, but it's what's inside that counts, right?One major highlight was the young lady who worked at the front desk. Her name was Jessica and she made each guest feel like a VIP. When we arrived she told us she gave us rooms right next to each other because she noticed they were booked under the same last name. She really went above and beyond to take care of us. She even indulged our need for hot tea and hot chocolate by repeatedly supplying us with a thermos of hot water. The place was booked solid and there were a ton of people coming in off the street asking to use the restroom or for other stuff. The staff was patient and polite to each person, guest or not. We plan to book the Vista Inn for every trip to Memphis. Hopefully Jessica will be there, and if she is I am sure she will remember us, because it is just that kind of place.The short version: we were eaten alive by bedbugs. I survived to tell the tale. Barely.The long version:Once upon a time, four of us went to a conference in Memphis.We (Meff, Jax, Cari, and I -- names have been obviously changed to protect the innocent) booked a room at the Vista Inn and Suites about a couple months in advance at a fairly low nightly rate (~$90/night), considering the prices at the other hotels in the area. The motel was close to Beale St. and cheap, so we weren't terribly miffed when the amenities it claimed to have -- business services, WiFi, a continental breakfast -- were less than impressive.Our first night was uneventful. Maybe the bedbug scouts hadn't returned with news of our arrival, or  maybe they were just patiently biding their time until they decided to attack. Either way, blood was not shed that night. It wasn't until the next afternoon after I returned to the room that I realized I'd been bitten by something.... What that ""something"" was, I couldn't quite tell, but I assumed they were from mosquitoes.  Right? There's no WAY our room could have bedbugs. ... Right? ... !After a night out, Cari and I slept on one of the beds, and Meff was asleep on the other. Jax, who had slept on the floor the previous night (don't ... ask.... just don't), slept on the floor again. It was good for his back, he said. It felt good, he said. Well, he was probably not feeling so good after he woke up covered in bites. The bedbugs had decided to strike.We spent the next evening at B.B. King's Restaurant and Blues Club and walked over to Rendezvous afterwards.  Meff and Jax, after comparing bites (again, don't ask), realized our hotel room was infested with bedbugs. I finally caved in to the realization that I, too, had been bitten by bed bugs. Meff didn't want to talk to the woman at the manager's office because he was certain she hated him (well, the feeling was rather mutual), so after securing back up (i.e., Jax and Cari), they stormed off to the office to rectify the problem. I couldn't do much more than roll around in bed (a bed that was infested with bedbugs, mind you) because BBQ beans, while really, really tasty, can cause great gastric distress that I really wasn't prepared to deal with at that moment. One of the motel employees came to the room to look for the bedbugs, stating that ""We haven't had an outbreak in, like, two years."" He wasn't able to find any, and went back to the office. Fueled by rage (and, no doubt, by the itchy bites on his legs), Jax pulled the bed away from the wall and threw up the bed sheets. Tiny, tiny little bloodsuckers were everywhere. Jax picked up a tiny plastic bag and started collecting them to provide indubitable, scientific, empirical evidence that bedbugs WERE responsible for sucking the life out of our bodies. He ran out of the room to show the motel manager.Meanwhile, I was still uselessly curled up in a ball on the infested bed. Stupid bedbugs. Stupid, tasty BBQ beans.Finally, the other three obtained a solution from the office: they would move us to another one of their properties. A van came by to pick us up several minutes later and drove us to the other motel, which was about five miles away from the convention center where our conference was being held. However, they promised they would schlepp us back and forth between the hotel and the convention center at no change. When we arrived, we found that they arranged two rooms for us instead of one (although the thought occurred to me that they may have put the boys and the girls in separate rooms for propriety's sake, not for comfort -- but hey! I'm not going to complain).The rest of our time in Memphis was relatively uneventful. They kept their word about schlepping us back and forth between the convention center and the hotel. We were even shuttled to the airport at the end of our stay free of charge. The woman at the counter whom Meff and Jax hated still charged us when we asked if they could hold our bags -- $5 a head. She obviously did not care that our blood was being drained while we slept in one of their rooms. Meff and Jax remain mortal enemies with that woman to this day. Oh, yeah, and during our entire stay, we were always short on towels. Four people, but three towels. Jax dried himself with the blow dryer. It was a hard life for poor Jax.To sum up my Yelp review:Pros: Cheap. Most of the staff tried really, really hard to rectify the situation, and I admire them for that. Cons: Motherf'narkin' bedbugs. Forgivable cons: Poor WiFi. Nonexistent business center. Continental breakfast of ""meh"" quality. But I can forgive all that, given that we were in a pretty cheap motel.The end.This is an honest, down-to-earth inn, and it must be the best-kept secret anywhere near Beale Street.As anyone knows who has visited Beale, or Memphis for that matter, knows that the hotels there are ridiculously overpriced, even in the offseason  - even three days before Christmas! - and for a single-bed, no-frills room. When Erstwhile Helpmeet and i travel, we tend to forego luxuries in favor of spending our money on souvenirs and such, but even the zero-luxury options on Beale were ludicrous to our reasonable budget. Vista Inn looks like your typical walkup strip motel, to the casual passerby. But it is staffed by awesomely friendly, welcoming, and very knowledgeable people; it is two blocks from Beale, an easy and interesting walk; it has secure offstreet parking at no extra cost. It is very nearly literally across the street from the stadium; if you are a reasonably hardy foot-tourist, you can walk to Mud Island with ease, or to the downtown streetcar even more easily. Our room, with two doubles, came complete with fridge and microwave at no extra charge, and was so clean you could practically *hear* it glittering. The beds were remarkably comfortable and the linens and towels both ample and high-quality; everything provided was of much higher quality than anyone would suspect - it really felt much more like staying in a hands-off B&amp;B than anything else. All this for under $100/night. No lie. We will absolutely stay here if we ever happen to visit Memphis again, and recommend it to everyone we know who might do likewise.found blood sucking bugs crawling in bed. left this x*# at 1am without a place to stay for the night.  we would rather sleep in our car instead.GREAT location and you probably won't find cheaper for the area - the motel is located SAFE walking distance to beale st, and right next to the greyhound station. Easy access to sun studios which offers a free shuttle to graceland. cost per night is not the cheapest for your typical motel room but still cheaper than your average hotel. the front desk workers were very nice and helpful.Overall no complaints and I would easily stay there again.Great value for its location! Only 5 mins from Beale street and 10 mins from downtown.  I had trouble with bug bites the first night.  I'm allergic so it wasn't pleasant at ALL! The staff were polite and helpful.  The room was clean and comfortable.  I recommend this to anybody who wants a no frills but decent room.  I was in room 213 and we didn't get any wifi.  NOT COOL!Not horrible, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Great price if you're looking to stay near Beale Street and Sun Studio.  The staff were very friendly and we also lucked out that our bunkmate was a nice dude traveling on business.  Two bunkbeds and a tiny bathroom were all we really needed while traveling anyway.  Beale street is a nice area, but heading the other direction Memphis gets very shady and ghetto.  I was able to rent a locker for less than $2 to store some items while we walked around.  The razor wire and local panhandlers were a clue that this wasn't the best area, but still we met some nice people who were traveling.I will admit that I was skeptical. I will also admit when I'm wrong.  Great staff, basic coffee and pastries in the morning, incredible location being only two blocks off beale street and surprisingly fairly priced.  The security guy was drinking beers in the parking lot and the bed could've been softer, but overall it was a great little spot to crash for a night!We were a little hesitant because of some of the reviews, and because we don't know the area well and were afraid it was too far out on the fringes of the downtown/Beale street area. But, at $60 per night, it easily beat out any other downtown hotel, so we took a chance on it - and I'm so glad we did. It's very clean and the service can't be beat, and it's within walking distance of everything.OK, some brief cons:-No coffeemaker in the room. However, there is free coffee in the front lobby.-Hot water took a little while to get started - shower was fine, but the sink tap didn't seem to heat up.-Wireless was spotty, kind of went in and out. Still free, though.Pros:-Very close to downtown, just a short walk. We were looking for dinner at 8:30 on a Wednesday, and the woman at the front desk assured us that we'd be safe walking toward downtown - she said she did it every night alone, and that there are cops everywhere downtown anyway. Sure, we got harassed for money, but that happened everywhere that tourists were, and not especially near the hotel.-The front desk people are super friendly and accommodating. In the morning, we were preparing to check out at 11 when we realized that the ducks would be marching at the Peabody hotel just two blocks away. The woman at the front desk was kind enough to allow us to continue storing our stuff in the room for an extra hour, just so that we could go see them. (Alternatively, they let you store stuff in the office for five dollars.)I'm really glad we took a chance. We will definitely stay there again the next time we're in Memphis...and hey, if ambience is what you're looking for in a hotel, just walk down to the Peabody, get a drink and watch those ducks

http://www.yelp.com/biz/marriott-memphis-east-memphis,Marriott Memphis East,3.5,$$,23,"For the price, I really expected a microwave. I went down the hall to vending. The sign on the door to 'Ice and Beverages' only contained an ice machine. So, I had to pay $3 for my soda downstairs. You have to pay for the Internet, too, which is kind of strange. Even cheap motels have free Wi-Fi. There isn't a tub in our room. I haven't seen that in a long time. And th continental breakfast consists of pastries, juice and coffee. Sigh. This is the first night of three, and I'm already disappointed. Maybe I should wait to write this review...I spend about 250 nights staying in Marriott hotels with my business. The room in this hotel was very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The waitress at the restaurant Tiffany was absolutely the highlight of this stay. She was very friendly and extremely accommodating. She should be training everyone else on staff. I'm not sure if it's a Memphis thing, but out of the two Marriott properties that we have stayed in, neither one had staff that was as friendly or hospitable as they are in other cities. I felt like I was in the way. Bottom line, it's a fine property. You will be in a very clean room and sleep on a very comfortable bed. Just don't expect to get the warm and fuzzier from any of the staff. Unless you have Tiffany. Tiffany is awesome! There is no charge for parking which was very nice.Clean, comfortable, and just a little weird getting into the parking lot!Siri got us here, sorry other drivers behind me!Clean hotel, quiet, safe location with good service. This was a Priceline hotel and was a real bargain. Good service and a large comfortable room made for a good stay.We got a great deal on this hotel, but didn't really realize how great a deal until we got there- this hotel is very nice!!  It's clean, modern, and has great amenities like a bar and a small restaurant.  The hotel rooms are sleek and a good size.  The bathroom has this lotion that I am now obsessed with, this citrus woodsy lotion that is incredible.  I looked up the brand and the junt is like $40 for a little bottle!  The only detractor for this hotel is that it's one way all the way around it, so if you miss the entrance (and it's easy to miss) you get to loop all the way around again.   ""Look kids! Big Ben! Parliament!"" ran through my mind a few times trying to get into this place.  Be careful, Memphians are terrible drivers and you might get rear-ended trying to figure this place out.  And I write that with love as I am an ex-Memphian.Horrible experience during judicial conference, had to move to 4different rooms, old section is terrible, had to move to newer section. Girl who said she was manager (evening) was no more than front desk clerk. Spoke to front desk manager he was worse. Never saw GM to complain. I have stayed all over the country and this was the worst hotel experience I ever had. Tried to complain to corporate and they didn't care as less. Gave me a confirmation complaint number that did absolutely nothing. Surprised Marriot has their name on this building. Corporate office was only concerned about money and no customer service. When I asked front desk staff name of GM they didn't even know. I will never stay at another Marriott again.The other night (or shall I say early morning), I was cruising down Poplar, and I saw a Marriott.  I knew there was a Marriott off of 240, but maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Apparently there are 2 of them off of 240.  Long story short, a few months back, I got a reward certificate for a free night at any Marriott, to be used by 4/29/13.  Well, I guess I either forgot about it, or pushed it back, but I noticed that I should probably use it or lose it!  So I called up the Marriott line (Sunday afternoon), told em what I wanted, and they put in the reservation.  That simple.  They even told me it was a new property.  So that was exciting.Yes, I spent the night in a hotel in a city where I stay in.  Shit happens.  It gave me an excuse to write another review.  So I packed my bag (my laptop, and my work clothes) and off I went.  I decided to kidnap my roomie, as we had nowhere to be until later Monday.  As we approached Poplar, I noticed you have to take kind of a Uie to get there, as Poplar splits.  So keep that in mind, its the last entrance on the left before 240.Parking is free, and was easy to get a spot.  I could tell, it really was new!  The lobby is spacious, with white brushed tile and looks like walnut for wood.  I would like to say it is pretty close to ""chic'"" but still knowing it is a Marriott.  It looked like they were having some lobby party, but we wanted to check out the room.  So I got to check in, and ride it on up.  As we got up to the room, I noticed the key entry was like a magnetic circle thingy (like they have on the doors @ the Peabody)- I have know idea what in the hell the technology is called.  The room was overlooking 240, towards the city, and the room was a nice size, and clean.  To say the least, it wasn't bad for free, and I am actually kind of surprised it was only listed as a category 3 (out of 7) hotel!  The only downside is having to pay for internet (even though I am a silver elite member), but it was $10 for 24H (idk, maybe I will get reimbursed?).  Can't complain about the bandwidth, as I am STILL waiting on mine to get fixed at the apt.The TV was a decent size, about a 37' or a 42'.  The beds were comfy, along with these really bright ass reading lights.  That was cool.  There was also an iPhone radio alarm clock.The bathroom had a single sink, lined with marble and the same type of wood in the lobby (ok, now I think about it, maybe its cherry?).  The sinks and tub were made of Kohler nozzles, and had pleasant streams of water to cleanse the mind, body and soul.  Did I really just say that?When I woke up the next day, I was shocked to see that the parking lot was empty with the exception of 2 cars, and then I realized everyone else probably works 9-5s...This is a new, solid choice in East Memphis that if you use Marriott a lot, you would not be disappointed.  And only having to pay for internet, you can't beat that!  I will surely tell my friends and family about this place if they do not want to stay downtown...I have stayed at 140 different marriott properties this year.  By far the worst front desk service I have experienced.  Changed my rate because I changed cards.  I was told the front desk supv had no authority to help a customer - the GM made that rule.  Rooms are much smaller than normal full service Marriott.  Other great hotels in the area!!!The hotel is nice as are the rooms, BUT I can't believe they have the nerve to charge for Wifi here. I'd be willing to not stay here again and go somewhere cheaper for free wifi. That's just not something I expect to have to pay for at a decent hotel in 2014.Pros: new, clean, and comfortable.  Staff was friendly and location was convenient for our stay.  The bedding was comfortable, the TV and electronics were up to date, the bathroom was nice and shower was decent. free parking and no resort fees mandated.Fair price point. (there for a wedding, so may have gotten a better rate than others)cons:  -no room safe, but you can get a box at the front desk-breakfast (at least on weekend) was 7 to 9 am.  ends too early for a relaxing weekend and starts to late for a business person.  food was OK-bar was good but it closed 1130 on a sat night..really?, the place was busy!-wifi was not freei would probably stay there again.Free parkingFree WiFiNice staff although we had to get our own luggage out the car and look for one if those baggage carriers.The lounge is niceThis could very easy be a 5 star hotel but I did have a few issues but nothing that will keep me from staying again and I will be in town again this weekend and I will stay hear.  My shower didn't drain well or maybe it did because the water rain out on the floor because the slope was off. Secondly, my key had to get reset twice.The service was GREAT and the room was also GREAT! Everything was in top notch and I will stay hear again as I stated earlier when in town for another meeting and I have three brother that live close by. I may even stay hear on personally visits also. LOL! Nothing like having your own space!Pros-Check in was quick and friendly.  Room was set at 66 degrees - this is good for my radiating husband, AC unit kept up overnight so it stayed cool.  Room and bed was clean, spacious and aside from lacking a fridge, was great.Shower pressure was also good (important for hubby!)Room service was quoted as going to take 40 minutes, it took 20.  The lady who delivered it was very friendly and the food was hot, tasty and reasonably priced for hotel food.  We ordered the fried chicken salad (with grilled chicken) and the cheddar, bacon burger.Cons -No free wifi - inexcusable in today's society!While breakfast selection was pretty generic and tasted ok, I ended up biting into a piece of plastic that was amid my chopped pineapple.  Not cool! We heard nothing but running water - all freakin' night!! like someone above us had a shower, all night.  UGH.This was the wedding hotel we stayed at when we got to town. This place is a but confusing to get to. Ignore google (gasp!) and keep going east on Poplar till you are able to u-turn after the 240 exit. Entrance is the third in your left.  When I went to checkin, the receptionist knew right away who I was and because I had tried to check in via mobile phone, but didn't quite finish the process because I rejected some option. She said she figured it out and had me squared away already. Service bonus points!!The rooms are updated and all the fixtures are really nice and the toiletries they provide are really nice (Bath and Body Works). My only complaint is that there is no safe and all the bedside plugs are on one side. If you're a bathtub kind if person, maybe this hotel is not for you. We loved the large shower. The bathroom door slides open to reveal a closet, so you can't have the closet, and the bathroom door open at the same time. We left the privacy tag on our door both nights, so we didn't experience the housekeeping. But one housekeeper did ask how we were doing when we were leaving. More service bonus points!The parking lot is a bit confusing because you exit a different way from the entrance, but at night, they block off the exit. The hotel bar closes at 11, but still a nice place to hang out with some friends. I know there is breakfast and a menu available, but we didn't get to experience it. Also, there is no free wifi. Overall, a nice hotel, but an extra star for the great service.Great hotel! I normally don't writeReviews but this hotel surprised me. Great staff, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel, clean, updated, breakfast and dinner were great. All good things. Great place to stay in MemphisNice facility.  Horrific &amp; insulting service - primarily @ front desk.  Walked out &amp; cancelled reservation after a bit.  No response from Manager OR Marriott Customer Service.  61 nights so far this year @ Marriott hotels.   I won't EVER return to this one......The Wifi is $9.95 a day. This is unacceptable. I spent $209 to stay here for one night and they can't comp wifi? Many Marriott properties still charge for this. When I stay at IHG hotels they don't charge for wifi. It seems silly to me.Marriott, this is 2014. The days of charging for wifi are over.The hotel is comfortable and the staff is friendly.I won't stay here again due to the wifi issue. Sorry.From the minute I walked into this hotel the customer service was outstanding. The staff was friendly and gracious and took care of everything I needed. The room was very nice  and housekeeping was some of the best I've seen. The location. Is central to everything in Memphis. Easy access to shops, restaurants and entertainment. I will definitely stay here again when I am back in Memphis. I have already recommended it to my friends and family.Got in around 6:30 pm for a meeting tomorrow morning. Hadn't been to Memphis in a few years, and couldn't remember this property. Turns out it had been a Holiday Inn and had been shut down, gutted, and reopened as a Marriott!Nice property and friendly staff - also found good rates (AAA can be your friend!) for a regular room. Thought the bathrooms were nice. Walk in shower in mine, no tub. Liked the look overall. Also liked the free parking (I get free internet because I'm top tier status with Marriott, so that's not a biggie for me.) And internet is free in the lobby, I think.But biggest shout out would be for the young woman working behind the bar. I opted for doing dinner there, and she was just social enough. Good personality, not too clingy, if you know what I mean. Had Fried Oysters and Blackened Catfish with cheese grits. Was very good!To my mind, it's what a full-service Marriott property should be. Nice place, good location, good staff, good food, fresh clean rooms.The room:  clean, updated and comfy!  Nice coffee set up and the refrigerator is a plus!  Got our room on a priceline deal.  The lobby was crowded and busy, bar was hopping!  Our floor (3rd) made me realize I should have asked about the tour bus in the parking lot and the fact everyone seemed to know each other.  And, it was loud- hallway conversations,  doors slamming- not very quiet.  If guests aren't with a group... Separate them!!!  Put them on a different floor!  And I agree.... Free wifi is everywhere except here!  For a quick overnight it's not worth it but would have liked to use my iPad)-:  this would be nice if it was quiet but I am glad we didn't pay more)-:Absolutely worst internet service, after months and months of excuses that the Internet would be fixed it's still the worst internet I have ever experienced. On average the speed is 50-100k per second, bellsouth dial up 15 years ago was much better.  Very disappointed that this property cannot fix this problem.","Excellent stay, we ended up in a corner room -- huge &amp; spacious.   Front desk staff was great, all around excellent stay!  Kudos to Marriott!I was so impressed with this place until i realized they're garbage. We told the front desk our names and they congratulated us and sent us up with the bellhop. there was a bottle of wine and a jacket that apparently someone had brought up here for themselves and had checked in earlier. There was a note the wine was from the front desk staff so we didn't question it. So the bellhop took the jacket. So it was fine until someone came up to the door trying to get in at 7:15 am. He acted apologetic and walked away from my husband. Finally they called up and said ""no one is booked in that room,"" which i doubt because someone had checked in, brought wine and a jacket, and there was a cheese tray here. My husband had to give them our info over the phone at 7:30 when they called. That is not a reasonable hour ever, but especially after a wedding! It rained and the view with the rain is lovely.Other than that, the room doesn't have a fridge but it is nice. The bed is too soft for me and there are no extra blankets already in the closets. The couch is a nice place to relax. Regardless, I won't be back.Updated feel for the whole property. Real nice people. Good bar and restaurant (only had dinner). Rooms were as expected. Concierge lounge fine. Hotel killed me though when I put the tag on my door for breakfast, and it never shows up. Called front desk- while getting absolutely no apology the receptionist told me that other guests had the same problem and that the kitchen received no room service requests and that they are trying to find out where the tags went. Clearly they realized they messed up. No apology. No call back. Not cool.",,,,"['price', 'really', 'expected', 'microwave', 'went', 'hall', 'vending', 'sign', 'door', 'ice', 'beverages', 'contained', 'ice', 'machine', 'pay', 'soda', 'downstairs', 'pay', 'kind',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-memphis-airport-graceland-memphis,La Quinta Inn & Suites Memphis Airport Graceland,3.0,$$,36,"This place is too expensive to be in the middle of nothing. The shuttle service is non existing. Only goes to the airport and graceland. Not to Walmart or anywhere else. U can't get food cuz ain't nothing around. Will not be back. The rooms are clean thoWhen we checked in a sign said ""Please don't mind our dust"" or words to that effect.  Well I did not realize they were going to be using a needle gun or a chipping hammer above our room.  Either they should discount the rooms or warn the customers.  I called the desk to get move to another room and the reply was ""we here the noise all over the hotel"".  Then how about this. Close the Hotel, finished the remolded fast, then reopen.  My wife and I are truck drivers an decided to stop her to catch up on some well needed rest of being on the road.   As for Breakfast, the eggs had more water in them than eggs, bisquits were wet.  Coffee was good. Final thought, if you want some rest at least during the day, you might look elsewhere.First, the good. Our room was ready early so we were allowed to check in about 2 hours early. Thank you! This was very helpful.  Beds, restroom, and room were clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was above average with hot, fresh make-your-own waffles, coffee, pastries, eggs, biscuits, bananas, yogurt, etc. When leaving for the airport, the shuttle was right on time at 4:30 am (!!) and the front desk clerk even made me coffee early although the continental breakfast didn't officially open for another 90 minutes. Thanks!!! Your efforts and politeness were very appreciated.Now the not so good. Upon arrival at the airport, the shuttle never came despite several phone calls to the hotel and repeated assurances it was ""almost there."" We finally had to take a taxi - $17 from airport to hotel less than a mile away. The neighborhood is not one for walking as it's mostly industrial. The hotel was undergoing renovations so there was hammering and paint fumes. The ""Hi Def TV"" was not. Other guests I spoke to had problems including getting locked out of the hotel at night and having to bang on the doors to get back in. And when friends who were leaving early one morning pushed open the door and it came off its track, they were threatened with having to pay for damages.My previous experience with La Quintas in general was positive, which is why I chose this location. But all in all, I think I'd try somewhere else next time.2 Stars for a 2 star hotel. I'd pick this place over a motel or something similar, but you can definitely do better for the $.Check the date of my post before you stay, as we speak they are undergoing major renovations and it is LOUD. Constant drills, saws, hammers, etc. every morning.Neighborhood sucks! What a lame location. Semi ghetto semi industrial. Nowhere near pretty or nice to look at. Liquor store, gas station, pawn shop, liquor store, strip mall, loading docks, etc. This week can't be over soon enough.WIFI IS AWFULWell now... where do i start...  Not only are you secluded in a sketchy neighborhood and the parking is locked behind gates but the there's no real food for miles and the rooms aren't very nice.... the bed wasn't great at all. I checked in and the computer wasn't working well... I'm tired and it's been hundreds of miles... I get keys and end up opening a room that's occupied. Why? because when they went to check in the computer wasn't working either and nobody bothered to make a note. I get checked in and try to take the pup for a walk.. um... where is the grass? They have one strip of grass in the parking area that is used and abused. Now I usually love La Quinta and stay there BECAUSE it's pet friendly... but no grass is not pet friendly. It's just in a very poor location and some of the rooms need some work.Visiting Memphis for the first time. As soon as we landed at Memphis we went to get our car rental. Turns out they ALL close between 11pm-midnight. Therefore leaving us stranded at the airport with no car to get to hotel. The good thing is it offers shuttle service to and from hotel to airport. Only thing is it ends at 11pm. Mind you its past midnight, we are exhausted from flying ALL day and wanting to go to our hotel. We decided to call the hotel and see if they can pick us up even though it was well past their service hours. Somehow they managed to get their shuttle driver to pick us up at 12:45 am and bring us to their hotel. This was a blessing in the skies! Soon as we got here the front desk service was great!! She greeted us and made us feel extremely welcomed. The room itself was clean and comfortable. Our room had a mini fridge which was a big help because we stored our water throughout the week. Not to mention, it also has a microwave. TV is a flat screen Insignia brand. Very spacious for two people to stay in. Housekeeping kept our room clean. When we asked for extra towels they didn't hesitate and gladly handed them over. They do offer free continental breakfast: cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, coffee/tea, orange juice, eggs, sausage, biscuit &amp; sausage. They do have two waffle makers but there's always a line to make some. Overall this hotel is a great place to stay at!I made a reservation online for a suite with two double beds.  Even though the reservation was made almost two months in advance, there was no such room available when my family arrived.  We were given a suite with one king bed, along with two rollaway beds, with the explanation that they ""try to honor room requests.""  There is one little strip of grass for pets, and there was an obvious issue with people not bothering to clean up after their pets.  The breakfast was fine; it was pretty typical.  I would not recommend this hotel, and we will not be staying here again.The associate at front desk Nikita was friendly and very helpful.  On the treadmill and the elliptical in the Fitness Room the power did not work even though they were plugged in.There were no decent restaurants for miles.  The parking lot has an iron fence with electronic gate.  The Non Smoking room had had a smoker in it.  The mattress and bed were good.  Breakfast was good.  I felt stuck here.  I had bid on Priceline.  I had no warning that there no restaurants for many miles and that the neighborhood was sketchy.  I do not recommend staying here.I did NOT want to get out of bed...it was that comfortable.  Huge shower head in the walk in accessible shower.  Very quick check in, friendly staff. Iron security fence around parking lot.  Fourth floor room lifted us above the traffic noise.  We will be back.If you plan on using a shuttle from this hotel understand it will not be available.   Dirty, unclean, toilets that don't work.  Do yourself a favor and stay anywhere but here.DO NOT BRING YOUR PETS HERE!!My stay here would have been fine if I would not have brought my dog. My friend and I went out Saturday night for a total of about 4 hours, when we got back to the hotel we went to the front desk and asked for a new do not disturb sign because ours mysteriously disappeared. We were told that my dog was being hysterical. When we got back to the room there was a towel in front of the door (fine) and A BOWL OF BEER on the floor for my dog to drink. Now I was hysterical. We took the night to calm down and went to talk to the hotel staff in the morning. A very pleasant staff member told us that it was a regular guest that constantly complains and that it wasn't that big of a deal. She was very concerned that someone had entered our room and especially concerned that there was beer left for her. My dog is less than 10lbs and alcohol is considered toxic to dogs. She called a staff member down who looked us in the face (hardly) and told us they were talking about putting water in the room. Luckily, my dog doesn't like beer so we had evidence to show him that it was clearly NOT water.La Quinta apparently has absolutely no process in place for dealing with these situations which I have an extremely hard time believing. Especially considering that it is a pet friendly (supposedly) hotel and I saw over 5 other dogs at least while walking mine throughout the trip. I was also called and told that the hotel tried to call me, but I had my phone on me all night, it was in my hand, fully charged, with service and received no calls or voice mails. I was 10 minutes away all night and gladly would have came back to calm my dog down. I was also told that another dog on the floor was barking, which could have been what caused my dog to bark in the first place.Although I was comped one day, which I had to ask for, it doesn't change the fact that great harm could have been done to my dog and I am worried for anyone else that plans on staying here.Upon arrival, I knew immediately the location was to be a huge problem.  This hotel is across the street from a shipping/loading facility for tractor trailers, and the amount of racket was almost intolerable. The whole hotel smelled like there had been some sort of plumbing disaster, it smelled like feces.  The smell persisted through our whole 3 night stay.  If I hadn't paid in advance, I would have left and found somewhere else to stay.The woman at the front desk took 20 minutes checking us in because she was venting about the terrible night she was having, and checking her cell phone every two seconds.  She was covering the shift for a no-show, and apparently many of the rooms had to be turned over last minute just to accommodate their reservations.When we arrived in our room, I was overwhelmed with a smell of smoke.  I had requested a non-smoking room because I'm sensitive to the smell, but my fellow traveler was a smoker, so I just decided to let it be, especially since the front desk lady had already informed us that they were totally booked up. When we got ready for bed, I noticed that the sheets and pillows appeared soiled. In addition to brown stains, there were numerous pieces of hair all the same length and color (not matching either of our hair) stuck to the various pieces of bedding, obviously this bed had already been slept in.  Not wanting to further upset the guest services woman (she was very nice) I simply called down and said that I needed clean linens.  Obviously shift change had occurred, because this new woman at guest services was quite dismissive.  She told me that when her driver got back, she would send him up with clean linens.  The linens never came, so finally I went got them myself.  The ""driver"" who was supposed to bring the linens was kicked back in a chair in the lounge playing on his cell phone.  All he gave me was two sheets, no blanket, no pillow cases... Luckily I had packed one pillow and a blanket of my own.When I went to shower, I had a couple problems with the sanitation.  The nonskid mat on the floor of the tub was lifting off, and the underside was not clean.  The clear knob on the shower had lots of black mold on the inside.  The shower was odd-shaped, so by the time I was finished bathing, the floor was soaked.  The vent in the bathroom didn't work, so the whole place fogged up.  I had to use several of our clean towels to sop up the water in the bathroom floor, so the next day I asked the rude front desk lady for clean towels.  Same excuse - ""When my driver gets back I'll send him up with clean towels"".  Though I reminded her twice throughout the day, we never saw any clean towels.   I finally used my own $ in the guest laundry to wash towels so we could bathe. Next time I use a 3rd party to book sight unseen, I will do THOROUGH research.  For the price I paid, I expected much better.I took the redeye from San Francisco last night and Twana checked me in at 10:30 this morning even though check in time is not until 3 PM technically. you've got to love the southern hospitality. The hotel is very nice the rooms are clean and comfortable and I'm looking forward to staying hereI wish I could give this place zero stars.  The airport shuttle took an HOUR to pick me up.  Don't bother.The rooms are ok the bathroom could be a little bigger and the towels could be a little more fresherIt's pretty ""meh"".  Locked gate, gravel piles next door.  I've stayed in better places but also worse.  Beds are comfortable, air conditioning works.  For some reason I can never get the WiFi to connect.  Best part: pet friendly, although not much of a yard for the dog.  When I come to Memphis again, without my dog, I'll give this location a pass.This is a perfectly good la Quinta. Staff is professional, kind, courteous, efficient &amp; helpful. Hotel was Very clean. Rooms were spacious, well appointed. Amenities were good. Laundry, exercise &amp; a nice breakfast, lobby lounge area. They also had a snack concession area to purchase mw meals, drinks etc. There wasn't much of an area to walk your dog just a grassy outline perimeter around the 8 ft secure fence around the hotel. And it was in a big industrial area so no real parks for your dog to exercise. It's right off of the split onto 240 E &amp; W so convenient to the highways. But not much else in the area. It was a perfectly nice stay but I wasn't crazy about the location. I would rather stay downtown or East Memphis where there's more of a community feel with lots of restaurants, &amp; conveniences around.The free breakfast is the only reason for the additional star.  This place is really really crappy.  Black mold behind the toilet tank, the bathtub faucet dripping at a rapid pace, sink faucet is broken and scalds your hands, TV reception is awful, carpet feels grimy, elevator doors shut on you.  Hospitality is so so.  Don't stay here.From the outside, this hotel was a bit scary -- right off the highway, not inviting, and the parking lot was gated and locked -- but it was very near the airport and just where we needed to be for an early morning flight out.  However, once inside, the staff was friendly, inviting and warm.  The room was very clean and spacious.  The price was very good.  This hotel fit our bill to a ""T"".During a cross country trip from CA to TN, I stayed in 5 different La Quintas. THIS was by far the nicest one! Starting with the front desk, the employee was VERY friendly and even got us a quieter room, after I told him that I was a light sleeper and our room was initially by the elevators and lobby. La Quintas are pet friendly, which was a MUST, since we were traveling with my large dog. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, TV worked, internet worked, room was quiet, parking lot had a gate with a code, and there was hot breakfast in the morning (although don't get too excited, it's just powdered eggs and sausage- but still, a step up from the other La Quintas!). We stopped at Graceland the next morning, which was close by. They offer military and government discounts, which was great. While it may not be a Hilton or Sheraton, it was definitely the nicest La Quinta of them all!","Front desk staff were uninterested in being helpful in any way. Parking was gated which was good all things considered.  Had to change rooms due to broken fridge and dirty bathtub. If you can, keep driving. This La Quinta is not representative of their brand. It's like once you're east of Oklahoma their hotels get worse and worse.Clean room, gated parking lot, and friendly staff! I only took one star off because it was a little pricey and breakfast was not fully stocked; however, to their defense, it was really busy and they may have been having trouble keeping up. We went swimming, the pool was nice, but they did run out of towels at the pool; the staff did quickly run and grab a couple out of the dryer for us, which was nice. Overall, we would stay again, if we were in the area.Clean!! ...and so nice and accommodating.  Great pool. Gated parking.  Right by an industrial cement plant, so close your curtains before you change lol.This hotel was super nice. Coming off the interstate it is right there and is very well lit up! Which is a plus considering the area. I drove up a few miles to find something to eat &amp; felt very nervous! But the hotel itself was awesome! After a 12.5 hour day of driving it was perfect! My only complaint was the area/neighborhood &amp; the sound of planes. I was thinking I was hearing thunder, when it dawned on me that I was next to an airport. ha! Oh and the walls were paper thin. I was woke up at 1:30am and 3:42am from the sounds of other guests coming off the elevators and loudly making their way to their rooms.What a horrible stay. My first room smelled like a cigarette filled old bar. The next morning I went down stairs to get coffee, and got denied. The sad thing was she just finished brewing the coffee, and I was told ""I am doing something else."" There is no restaurants in the area.  Don't stay here!Overall this place is just your average hotel. I've been driving out west on I40 and I decided to spend a night in Memphis. My goal was to find a hotel in a relatively safe area at an affordable price.. After a long hassle while trying to get food I decided to go with La Quinta off of Millbranch because I just wanted a place to crash.. Glad I chose this place.The hotel isn't too far from I40 and the major pro about the hotel was that they had a gated parking lot. The hotel staff was nice and accommodating and the room itself was clean and quiet. This place is also about 5-10 minutes (or even less) from Graceland, although I had no interest in going..Overall I had to pay $93 (roughly w/taxes included). A little more than I wanted to pay, but it was worth the good nights rest in a clean room with the safe feeling that your car won't be broken into. Check-in time is 3pm, and check-out time is 11am (you can ask for a later time)The No Fun Motel. $250 fines for everything! If you leave your dog in the the room unattended- $250. Smoking- $250. Then there's the al a carte menu of lesser fines for missing towels, wash cloths and bath mats. There is also no AC unless you request it. Tried to call the front desk to get the air conditioning turned on but the cord is broken on the phone- so no land line phone either. No, no, no, NO everything here. Oh and the rooms still have low definition TV's.Price and room amenities give this hotel my four star rating.  The location is by one of the states biggest attractions the home of Elvis Graceland.  It's about a 6 minute drive into downtown.  For me location is key and this hotels location suits those who are visiting the city for only specific reasons.  Aka airport overnights and GracelandHotel needs a face lift in the rooms. The staff was friendly. The breakfast offered was pretty poorI rarely write a bad reveiw about any place, but this place took the cake. The tub was gross, housekeeping did not change the sheets ( I know because I had make-up stains from the night before still on the pillow, that housekeeping just simply turned over), 1 face cloth, 2 hand towels and 3 body towles, WTF, La Quinta. Key cards not working, no cups. room not cleaned at 5pm. Terrence, the person at the front desk tried, but he could only do so much. 2 thumbs down. one good thing free breakfast that had bacon, biscuits and gravy, coffee, tea, make-your-own waffles, cereal, muffins, eggs. Because of the food I will give you 2 stars, instead of one. GET IT TOGETHER LA QUINTA INN &amp; SUITES!!!!!!!!!This hotel allowed us to bring our dog in, which was great.  The room was huge, open, and clean.  It smelled faintly of bleach on the sheets and on surfaces, which I like in a hotel room.  The bed was soft and comfortable, nothing too fancy, but it did the trick and I didn't wake up with an aching back the next day.  Cable was in the room on a decent television.The bathroom was completely clean, with little toiletries set out for our use, as well as a clean white grout/tile shower and bathtub.  We were comfortable, the walls were thick, and we didn't hear our neighbors at all.  Bonus -- the curtains blacked out the light very well.  All in all, a good experience at a reasonable price.I was pleasantly suprised by this place.  It was very clean and the room was very up to date, not shabby at all.  Most importantly the staff that greeted me at 11:30pm were very helpful and nice.  I would stay there again. My only complaint is that it was hard to find at first.Great staff, very clean, decent price, &amp; shuttle service to Beale Street during select hours...only a $15 cab ride to Beale....located in an industrial area by the airport...restaurant in parking lot......I'd stay there again.La Quinta is a great chain. We used our rewards points for an impromtu trip to Memphis. The hotel is near the airport, but we only heard 3 planes the entire stay. The area is a little sketchy, but they have a secured parking area. As always with the chain, free hot breakfast, clean rooms and good service!Very clean, hot breakfast, and really excellent service from the people at the front desk (even when we rolled up at midnight). We kept our car here during a short trip, and for a very small fee, $5, they allowed us to keep it in their secure parking lot with a keycode, which made me feel good about the security of the car. The only thing that I thought was a little weird is when we returned from our trip, I guess their driver wasn't available, so they sent the handyman (in his painting overalls) to come get us... a little strange.I was forced to make an unplanned stay at Memphis thanks to Delta.  Needless to say I was not in a very good mood and was not happy about having to find a hotel last minute by the airport.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by La Quinta.  I have not stayed with them before but they certainly exceeded my expectations.The staff was very friendly and helpful.  When the shuttle driver found out we had missed our connections and would be spending the night in Memphis he drove us around the hotel area to find something to eat so that we wouldn't have to walk.  The woman who checked me in searched for every rate and discount possible and loaded me up with free toiletries.  For $65 a night the room was more than adequate.  It was fairly new and very clean.  Despite the proximity to the airport it was very quiet.  The free breakfast was pretty much on par with a Hampton Inn.  The hotel location was not a great area and there was not much open in terms of restaurants or stores but since it was only a 5 minute drive to the airport it worked.",,,,"['place', 'expensive',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-hotel-memphis,Embassy Suites Hotel,3.0,$$,34,"Very professional and clean hotel. Great for business trips as they provide all of the amenities you need to be able to work from your home. It doesn't hurt that fine dining is right below your room at Frank Grisanti's.Shana was extremely helpful in resolving a error on my bill.I would definitely stay here again.This was a very nice hotel for a decent price on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>. Being that i am a Quadriplegic wheelchair user, i have a few complaints. The so-called ""wheelchair accessible"" rooms are actually regular rooms that were sorta adapted to accommodate wheelchair/elderly occupants. Rm 220 has a tub with safety bars. Rm 224 has a roll in shower with a sitting area. The problem with Rm 224's bathroom is that it was poorly made to be accessible. If you are a non walking wheelchair user like myself, i advise you to not stay in this room alone. There is a significant ramp up into the roll-in shower &amp; the shower bench is up too high. So i had to take a running start to get up the ramp &amp; into the shower. I then had to ask my partner to remove my chair. Im 6'1 &amp; my feet barely touched the ground. The water runs out of the shower into the rest of the bathroom floor because there is not enough of a drainage ditch &amp; there is no divider to catch the water. The shower bench does not let up at all because the shower rail is restricting it from doing so. The bed is up a little high &amp; should be lowered to accommodate wheelchair users that are unable to transfer to higher beds. All in all this is a great hotel that i would suggest to others in my condition, just not alone.Two-room suite- complimentary drinks- complimentary made to order breakfast  and coffee++ awesome cocktail hourAs others have said, this place is dirty, old and nobody seems to give a darned.  Mildew in the shower, closet door unable to close and... get this... no toilet paper in the room and it took them 25 minutes to get it to me after I called.  Good thing that Mother Nature didn't call.I've stayed at the Hampton Inn right next door and it's nice, for a Hampton Inn.  Much better value, clean and well-appointed.   Everything the Embassy is not.The hotel is currently under renovation, so several of the nicer amenities weren't available during our stay - but, the suite was very clean and well furnished. Happy traveler - will be better next time with the full made to order breakfast :)The hotel Is great--construction is complete and the result is very sleek and modern. The breakfast/reception area is not as upscale as other Embassy's but I have no complaints about the room, breakfast or manager's reception--all of it was really great. The hotel is accommodating and inviting and I would highly recommend it!! The attached Italian restaurant is a bit pricy but also delicious. They have Peroni beer, Italian wine, and four beers on tap. How can you go wrong when a hotel has that? If you are in Memphis and looking for a suite   hotel you can't go wrong here. Enjoy your stay ~~Decent Hotel for what it was. The room was nicer than what I expected. My issue was with house staff. My wife, kids and I stayed there for 3 days. In town for a family reunion. For the entire time we were there no one came to clean our or bring clean towels. I had to go find the maid and grab clean towels off her cart. I also had to take my own trash down stairs to throw it away. Nice rooms, but very subpar service. Will we be coming back? Thats a negative ghostriderwe stayed here while meeting a long lost family member.... the hotel staff did everything within their power to accommodate the reunion and make our stay comfortable. .? will stay here again.Worst hotel in the world. Dishonest. Greedy. Do not stay at this property .The owners should be ashamed.Entire first floor and central atrium is under construction until April 2015.  No awesome made-to-order or hot breakfast, swimming pool, gym, and construction noise after 7am.  Driving in from Oklahoma, my family was more than bummed. Great opportunity for discounted rates? Not a chance. Not even a free cookie. Although the front desk was nice enough, she had no frontline authority and the hotel management was making decisions based on something other than customer satisfaction.  Highly unusual for Hilton Embassy Suites.This is a nice hotel. A great place to stay for a long hotel stay when you are in town on business!  I am pleased with the accommodations except for a few things. One night we found ants in our room, eating the cookies on the counter by the microwave. We called the front desk, who then sent up a maintenance man to spray for the ants.  He told me that they usually come up from under where the refrigerator is located.  In all honesty, although I appreciated the prompt response to spray for the ants, in most hotels they would have sprayed, moved me to a hotel suite, or discounted the price of my room and provided me with some type of complimentary voucher to a restaurant. After all, seeing ants eat your food in a hotel is very gross. I agree with one reviewer that the walls are paper thin and I noticed that my bedroom wall shakes every time a guest in the room next door closes the door.  I can hear the conversations next door, and let's just say, that's not all that I've heard. The air conditioning system is also hit and miss.  Sometimes the room seems cooler than on other nights.  I think that the thermostat is there to make you feel as though you are in control of room temperature when you are not. The complimentary breakfast is not bad, but the area that it is served in is more low class cafeteria than for a hotel like the Embassy Suites. The area is basically the lobby of the hotel and makes the hotel sound loud and chaotic, particularly during breakfast and their complimentary happy hour in the evening. I also noticed that sometimes their dishwasher does not thoroughly clean off the food particles from their silverware. Frank Grisantis restaurant is okay only if you are really hungry.  So far I have ordered a salad, entree, and dessert and it all tasted uninspired and something that I would have done better cooking myself, especially for the price. One of the best things about this hotel  is that it is in a great location.  There are restaurants and places to shop everywhere.  One last thing that I have to add is that in my personal experience, the bellman was not helpful.  The bellman watched me pull up with my vehicle, take out a lot of luggage for my entire family (for a long hotel stay), and then simply walked off without speaking or providing me with a cart to load my luggage. I saw him a second time in the lobby as I was checking in, where he did not speak or offer to assist me in anyway.  I would still recommend this hotel, but it's just not 4 or 5 stars. I almost gave it 2 stars, but I hear that renovations are coming in July.The hotel is under major renovation despite them only mentioning that the breakfast would be limited.   Hammers &amp; jackhammers by 8 am daily.   Fitness center closed.  Pool closed.   Breakfast area closed.   Breakfast was a paper bag with prepackaged muffin, granola bar, &amp; apple; no other choices &amp; nothing hot.   The room was fine, but construction noise unpleasant.We had to book here at the last minute on a long trip that we were running behind on and were pleasantly surprised with how nice it turned out.I am guessing this hotel is about 20-25 years old but it seems like it has been well taken care of. The staff was super nice and our whole family loved the made-to-order complimentary breakfast.We managed to squeeze two adults and 6 kids into the room without any issue. There were two Double beds (I don't think they were Queens, they definitely could have been a bit bigger) a pull out couch and a little collapsable crib for our youngest, and still it didn't even seem cramped.Its got a cute decor with the atrium inside and the pond with the fish and the ducks doesn't come off as tacky. All in all I would definitely stay here again.Great location and very comfortable rooms. I only gave it four stars because of fitness center being unavailable due to renovation but once that opens it will be perfect!This hotel in undergoing renovations so a lot of the usual niceties weren't available.  What should be noted however is how nice and accommodating the staff here was.  They were pleasant and all smiles despite all the chaos going on. Made us feel welcome and helped out in any way they could.  Usually I would avoid hotels with construction, but you shouldn't have that concern here!  If the staff were this warm and nice during construction, I can't imagine how nice they would be otherwise!I was worried with the reviews but I had a very nice stay.  Bed was comfortable, down pillows, and linens were very soft.  Standard ES layout, a true suite so you can shut living area door from bedroom.  Bathroom had tub/shower combo and plenty hot water.   There are rooms with shower only so ask if you want one.  Mini fridge has small freezer area and There is a microwave.  Comfortable desk space.  Indoor pool and jacuzzi, gift shop, business center, fitness center all on ground floor.  Depending on which room you get the noise level changes.  I think the rooms closer to the front are quiter.  The breakfast area in back, gets noisy in the morning.  The restaurant is Italian in the hotel.  There are lots of nearby restaurant you could walk or drive too.  Corky's BBQ is close and the best in town.  This is my go to Memphis hotel.Nice hotel as another Embassy Suites offers spacious rooms and an amazing hot breakfast, specially omelettes.I have traveled around the country and I've been to a lot of Embassy hotels, and this hotel let me down a little bit. The breakfast was a bit lacking and one day we did not have our beds done, however we let the front desk know and they were really attentive sending someone to tidy our room.In conclusion, the hotel is OK even though there are better Embassy Suites, this one is fine to stay a short time. The hotel is well-located in Memphis near a mall.I am a regular business traveler and this the worst embassy suites I have stayed at. The furnishing and carpet are tired, the temperature controls non-functioning, poor plumbing, and very thin walls. Make sure not to get a room along the entrance side as the signage lights shine directly into the room.Terrible! This hilton honors member will not return. Opened our sofa bed for our daughter to sleep on and the whole thing fell apart. Called the front desk to report for maintenance. His repair work was to use zip ties to hold the mattress in place. That repair lasted about 20 minutes until it broke again. HBO was out for all 3 nights of our stay. Only one elevator worked. Hair in my breakfast pancake. That's just the highlights.I highly recommend you never set foot on this property.  I am a Diamond member of Hilton Honors and in my opinion, this property should be deflagged meaning no longer allowed to be attached to the Hilton family of brands.  Why?  On Thursday night I rented two adjoining suites on the 3rd floor for 4 adults and 5 children.  The kids were having a blast as they always do at Embassy Suites swimming, jumping on beds, etc.  That night about 8 PM one of the members of my party noticed that a bedroom door was closed.  She opened the door and then sceamed.  Her 3 year old was literally hanging out of the area where the window would be.  I say would be because the complete window was lying on the floor of the room.  Yes, the entire window.  After grabbing the child and saying a few prayers, the front desk was called who sent maintenance to the room about 20 minutes later.  They braced the window so it would not come loose again during our stay.  Amazing part?  Not one word from anyone at the hotel.  Not a peep that night, no apology, no manager showing up at the room, no well anything.  At about 9:30 AM, I headed down to the front desk and the manager on duty was not even aware that this had happened.  When I told her she responded that this must have been very scary for you.  That's it.  No apology, no we will check every window in the hotel, no escalation to GM.  I followed this conversation up with a call to Hilton customer service who was very helpful to the point of calling the hotel and saying the GM, Heather would call me that AM on my cell.  Well never heard a peep from Heather.  I am a Diamond member.  A child could have easily died or been seriously injured that night.  I am literally in shock about this incident.  Half of Hilton's operations are based in memphis not a mile from this property.  Until a few years ago that included the Embassy Suites brand.  This of all your properties should be in tune with customers.  Other things happened during our stay as well.  In the middle of the night a large panel came off the wall and crashed onto the floor.  At 10 AM with sunny skies the power went out for an hour.  Bottom line is avoid this property.  Read my other reviews, I do not say things like this, it's not my MO.  Well it wasn't  AVOID this property.","I am Hilton Diamond Status (as high as a loyalist can go)  for over 5 years now and you would have thought I walked in from off the street. The front desk was almost annoyed at the fact that I had the audacity to check in at 4:40 PM.Pros - better part of Memphis (if that is possible), convenient to the indefinitely under-construction I-240.Cons - dated, musty, in house restaurant was insanely expensive for Mama Celeste/Stouffer-esque lasagna.In summary, the Embassy Suites hotel is very good, the hotel staff is even better, and I definitely recommend staying here.The Good:Rooms:  The rooms are suites (given the name of the hotel) and provide spacious and comfortable accommodations.  The bed was comfortable, there were plenty of TV channels, I felt right at home.Food:  I didn't try the room service, but the continental breakfast in the morning was always very delicious with many tasty and health options.  I never tried the cook-to-order meals, but they looked very good too.Staff:  The first night I stayed at the Embassy Suites, my heater was broken and it was pretty cold all night.  I told this to the front desk staff on my way to work the next morning and they had it fixed by the time I returned that day.  This is excellent service, which I expect, but a lot of other hotels would offer to move me to a different room instead of fixing the issue immediately.The Bad:Parking:  There are very few parking spots near the front door of the hotel and it is hard to find a good one.  Most times I was stuck with a parking spot in the very back corner of the parking lot which required a little bit longer of a walk to get into the hotel.Wifi:  The wireless internet, while easy to connect to, was extremely slow and I had trouble doing basic online tasks like checking my email and the news.Love the Atrium and peaceful setting. The rooms are suites. The layout is nice. The beds are COMFORTABLE. Good free Internet. Nice flat screen TV's. We Loved the Atrium, the DUCKS and Koi in the little creek. It was a peaceful setting. We really enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. Breakfast  on the weekends were wonderful. Made to order  Fried eggs,Omelettes,&amp; pancakes with grits and bacon or buffet style  scrambled eggs, sausage links,oatmeal  and  French Toast. In the evening there's a drink reception each day. If that's not enough there's a nice restuarant  in the hotel.A very nice heated pool and exercise/work out room. Helpful , friendly staff. It was a great location. We will stay there again.A very pleasant hotel, with plenty of room for our family of four.  The rooms are arranged around an atrium, attractively decorated with plants and a flowing ""stream,"" with koi and several ducks (so take that, Peabody!).  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the service was excellent.  On the theory that free food and drink make people happy, there is a free breakfast with cereal, fruit, yogurt, sausages, eggs, etc. and a cooked-to-order omelette and pancake station (go early if you don't like waiting in line).  There is also a ""Manager's reception"" from 5:30 to 7:30 every night with complimentary booze and snacks.  It was like an Elite event without the fun.A nice fitness center with Precor machines, a pool, and free parking were nice amenities.  There are so many other hotels in spitting distance that the room price was very reasonable.  The only downside is that this is a popular hotel for traveling school sports teams, so prepare for some noise on the weekends.Not a bad place to sleep when traveling for business.Every time I'm in Memphis for work and need to be near the Germaintown area, I stay here. It's your typical Embassy Suites with lots of families and the like just getting away. The breakfast in the morning and cocktail hour in the evening makes it worthwhile.Skip even trying to use the internet here. It's $9.95-12.95/day and doesn't work worth a shit. In the last 5 years it's never worked once when I've been there. Luckily AT&amp;T 3G internet works in the room, so I can still use that internet to connect in for work.No complaints, definitely a professional establishment with southern hospitality.This place was clean and the bed was comfortable. At one point I had trouble with the TV in the living room area, but they came by and fixed it while I was gone. They also have a pretty good breakfast spread. The worst part was the Internet connection. There is a free connection that is crap and even the one you pay for is terrible. It became very frustrating when I was trying to work at night.The Embassy Suites is just average.  It's overpriced for what it is.  Yes, the rooms are technically ""suites"" but the layouts are strange so the room did not feel spacious.  The furniture was definitely worn in.  There was also a shower instead of a tub, which was a little odd.  Free hot breakfast in the morning was nice.  The omelettes were great.  Pancakes were so-so.  I also liked the ""manager's reception"".  I say that in quotation marks because the manager never came to his or her own reception.  Order ""The Freddy"" it's the bartender's special drink.  Fruity and delicious. Wi-fi is not free.  It's $10 a day which seemed steep.  Printing and internet in the business center are free, however, which was nice.   Housekeeping did not come on one day.  The hotel seems overwhelmed when they are busy and unable to accomodate a full house.Another so-so Embassy Suites, but overpriced for its location. Exceptionally nice staff. Long line for the omelettes, and the buffet food is reminiscent of the high school cafeteria. The worst thing about ES is that the bedrooms have the windows and the ""living rooms"" with the desk face out onto the walkway and atrium, so if you want to work in there it is either very dark or you have people walking by 15 inches away and looking into your window.They do have a free shuttle, but it stops at 10 pm so I couldn't use it to get there from the airport. For other trips it can be 0 - 30 minutes wait. The very nice driver gave me a good rundown of all the nearby BBQ places.The wifi is insufficient for any individual to stay online for more than a couple of minutes. Each night that we were here, one or more high school groups have been here, with kids hanging out in the atrium loudly until late. Our nonsmoking room reeks of stale smoke covered with air freshener. Twice housekeeping has neglected to leave us washcloths.  The fire alarm was tripped as a prank tonight, and an hour later it still sounds like bourbon street on Marci gras out there.  We will check out in the morning and complete our stay at another hotel. This place has been awful.The hotel is clean and even smells good. The staff is extremely friendly (especially the breakfast staff). The only things that were kind of a problem were paper thin walls (we heard our neighbors showering, closing their door, and at times even talking), lukewarm coffee at breakfast, and the shower didn't drain fast enough so we took showers in a puddle. The ice machine is literally on the other side of the hotel. that's just a bit annoying. We would stay here again because of the staff and the cleanliness.I usually stay at this hotel for business, and I always enjoy my stay.  The staff is exceptionally friendly, professional, and accommodating.  The 24 hour fitness room is quite nice and is equipped with two treadmills, two ellipticals, one bike, and two weight benches.  They also have a dumbbell set with weights from 5 lbs to 50 lbs, medicine balls, and yoga mats.  The swimming pool area is nice as well.  They have a game/arcade room for children.  I never went in, but it looked like the kids were enjoying it.  The cooked-to-order breakfast in the morning was very nice and the manager's reception in the evening was great, and usually needed after a long day of work.  Freddie is typically the bartender in the evening and he has his own special cocktail that is a must try.  The hotel is a bit old and could use some renovations, but overall I've never been disappointed.I'm trying to chalk my experience up to a bad week at the hotel.  I stayed here for business for six nights.  The continental breakfast is pretty great and they have a happy hour every night which is also awesome as it is free.  Things that were bad for me were no hot water in my room on three occassions for showers - a MASSIVE outbreak of dozens and dozens of children running all over the hotel.  I work nights so I sleep during the day and you could hear kids screaming all day running past your room.  You couldn't use the pool or hot tub because about 30 kids would be crowded into the area.  I'm hoping that is was just week I landed on coming here and not a constant every weekend thing because I probably will have to use this hotel again for work.  The room cleaning is sketchy - my first day I was sleeping during the day and the lady knocked persistently until she woke me up and when I told her through the door I was sleeping and didn't need cleaning right now she forced me to get dressed and sign some paperwork AFTER I told her I was sleeping - it was really rude - she kept knocking even after she woke me up.  Apparently it was a paper that if you signed they didn't have to clean your room at all - so that was annoying as well to fix.  The rooms are nice - suites - two hd televisions - but mine at least was a little worn out.  My room was also two floors directly above the pool and sometimes had a chlorine smell.  The room service is from the hotel restaurant frank grissoti - they were prompt but the food from the restaurant is pretty bad and its a very expensive restaurant.  I kind of wish they had a different selection.  Most of the bad things were in details - overall my experience was decent.  They make up for some bad things with the free breakfast and happy hour.  But some things were not so easy to forget...like the overnight front desk clerk being less than helpful and filled with disdain for anyone who approached his counter and the fact that they didn't have several umbrellas to loan out to guests for the constant memphis rain storms.The hotel is ok, but for an Embassy Suites it could have been better.  Upturned tables and such laying in hallways.  Room was clean but not sparkling either.  Several glasses had fingerprints and spots all over them.  Furniture was old and cheap, looked thrown together from a yard sale.  Internet access is not free of course.  Lots of hot water available. Staff is friendly and helpful.  Nice breakfast server downstairs in morning.",,,,"['professional', 'clean', 'hotel', 'great', 'business', 'trips', 'provide', 'amenities', 'need', 'able', 'work', 'home', 'hurt', 'fine', 'dining',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/pilgrim-house-memphis,Pilgrim House,4.0,$,25,"As far as hostels go, this one is pretty good! It's a church with a big parking lot, very safe part of town, too. The doors had security codes, which were changed regularly. I never felt unsafe there alone. Lots of cute restaurants nearby. The beds were OK. If this is your primary concern, I recommend the co-ed dorm, which had double beds that looked more comfy than the twin ones. If you're a neat freak, this place probably isn't for you. It's not the cleanest, but it's certainly not the dirtiest either. For the price and location, it's a pretty good place.The Pilgrim House in Mid Town, Memphis is an awesome place to stay for a week! This past week my friend Chris and I were finishing mixing a record at Ardent Studios and this was the best place to lay our heads, and meet some really awesome people! The Hostel is quite large and with plenty of rooms, both private and shared!  We shared a room with 6 bunks in it!  We always had roomates! There are lockers in your rooms if you want to lock your stuff up, but I never really thought it was a big deal! The Staff at Pilgrim House was great!  Super helpful and for 20 bucks a person, it's a very nice cheap place to stay!  Lots of parking and a block a way from multiple places to eat, drink, and be merry! You are assigned 1 chore a day while staying at the Hostel and I thought well this will probably be a hassle but it was actually really easy and takes about 2 minutes to complete every morning! It also makes you feel more at home and helpful! I loved it.. It also keeps the place very clean! They have both private and shared bathrooms and a huge kitchen with supplies for cooking! They have free coffee as well! All and all this was a perfect stay for us! Cheap, Fun, and we met people from all around the world!I loved staying here. Very home-y. The women in my dorm were all courteous. The staff is very friendly and I got a great run down of the facilities. $27 got me a cool bed (it was scorching last night), fresh shower, wifi, comfy couch to work on. They also offer a free pancake breakfast but I stuck with my protein shake, which I was able to mix up in their fully stocked kitchen. Each person needs to help out with a chore before they leave, but I was happy to take out the recycling. I would definitely stay here again.We actually booked this place thinking it would be a creepy church experience, and it would add to our southern experience. It did add, but not because it was creepy. It was totally awesome. The staff was SO nice. There is no indoctination like I expected as it's attached to a church. It's really sweet and large and nicely run. The whole 'daily chores' thing made us worry but it was actually really fine, the chores were something like refill the ice trays to throw out one of the recycling bins to wipe the kitchen stools. It takes between 30 seconds to 2 minutes, max. There's a lot of rooms, bathrooms, living room space. We got a private room and one space in the dorm, my only complaint is the private room, which is for three, had a bunkbed, with the bottom a double, so three of us didn't fit well, so the third just slept happily on one of the couches and we all ended up having a great night's sleep both nights. Totally worth staying at. I think it was way better than a hotel would have been.Awesome place to stay.  Clean very nice staff free breakfast and very nice dorms. Would stay there once again for sureWe had a lovely stay. (We being my husband, 5 year old, 19mo old and me). Neighborhood was beautiful and friendly. Quiet, clean, and bright. Beds were not the most comfy but the private room was more comfy than expected. If you're an early riser prepare in advance to go somewhere else until at least 9. We went to Brother Junipers for a fabulous breakfast until we could check out at 9.Wonderful place, friendly staff, and you can't beat the price.  I paid $40 for the private room, which was small but cozy.  The hostel is right in the middle of one of Memphis' most walkable neighborhood, and is close to everything.  Would stay there again.It's entirely possible to stay in a clean, safe, friendly place in the heart of Memphis for $15 a night. That is, if you don't mind sharing and cleaning up after yourself.The place is Pilgrim House, Memphis' only hostel.The Pilgrim house is located inside First Congregational Church in Cooper Young. It's a little more cozy than the average hotel. When I stopped by, a college student was working in the library, the RAs were checking people in, and a man who had walked to Memphis from California was talking about his adventures with a small pack of Australians in the hostel's sunny kitchen.It's only $15 per person to stay in one of the shared dorms at the Pilgrim House. There are two single-sex dorms and one co-ed dorm, each with several sets of bunk beds. There are also a handful of private rooms, which are are $30 for one person (plus $15 for each additional person). There is a private bathroom, as well as dorm-style bathrooms.Guests are allowed to use the kitchen and the library, take whatever they want from the free food stash, and rent bicycles for the day through Revolutions Community Bike Shop (which is located in the same building).There's just one catch - because Pilgrim House is a hostel, they ask that everyone who stays there pitch in by doing a small chore. Most of the chores are things like unloading the dishwasher, taking the recycling out or sweeping the kitchen -  they're light and take about five minutes.I loved this place. Very quiet. In a great neighborhood. Spacious. You can't find it on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHostels.com&amp;s=3991a3c8e714fb16cfb292a2d080f6a77d2a7821537491ff734329ea9bb29fc8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hostels.com</a> though, which is kind of frustrating. It was recommended to me by some people in Nashville who had stayed there. Cool lounge, big kitchen.My husband and I stopped in here for a night on a road trip through the South, paying just $30 for the two of us. They didn't have a private room available when we booked earlier in the week, so they placed us in a co-ed dorm with no other people. There were a couple of full-size beds, too, so we were able to sleep together. There was a door to a private room in the co-ed room, so there was still traffic in and out. The bed itself was pretty uncomfortable, but you really can't complain for $15 a night. My only genuine complaint is that it was very, very hot in our room. There was a window a/c unit, but it didn't seem to be able to cool such a big room.Compared to other hostels, it's very clean and has a lot of common areas. There is a big kitchen and a library, as well as a couple other sitting rooms with couches and funny-shaped pillows. The staff was friendly and gave us advice on where to eat and drink in midtown. The hostel uses entry codes on a few doors to get in, so it was nice not having to use a key. There was a handful of other people staying. I could definitely see myself spending a week here if I had time.Overall OK as far as staffing and organization, but I do have to question security because one of the guests staying in our room who failed to respect curfew managed to ""break in"" at 3am and had the nerve to wake me up by putting his chihuahua on my pillow. It sort of means pretty much anyone can get in any time they want. Watch your stuff and your security if you're sharing a room.When I returned here in 2012 it had been taken over by young students and did not have the good age and nationality mix it had previous year.  Consequently, perhaps, it was radically less clean, the bathrooms in particular, and 'staff' was very unprofessional.  I may give it one more chance but not more if it is not as it was in 2011.My sister and I stayed here for two nights while we were in town, and this hostel (along with the city in general) made me wish I could stay for much longer. Clean, friendly, and unbelievably cozy. Each day each guest has one small chore to complete, but it's hard to argue with that when you are staying in a safe and homey place for as low as $15 a night. I sprung for a bit more to get a private room, since I didn't know the place and was traveling with my young sister and some expensive photography equipment, but after seeing how friendly and safe the place is, I would go for the shared dorm rooms.Other charming bits:-- Common areas with comfortable couches and tons of books that people can read, share, swap, leave behind.-- Mordecai the cat, who lives in the hostel.-- Bicycle co-op in the building where you can rent bikes.-- Very friendly staff - R.A.'s who live in the building in exchange for covering shifts.-- Right around the corner from the Cooper neighborhood, with cafes, restaurants, bookstores, etc.A great place to stay in a great city. Try it out.I have literally lived in hostels for 12 of the past 18 months, and this is the most pleasant, comfortable place I've ever set foot in. It's so nice that it's confusing. Seriously. I was convinced for 5 minutes I was in the wrong place. Then I saw the giant kitchen, talked to the super-friendly people, checked out the rad and big beds in the equally rad rooms, and grabbed a good old Bloom County cartoon collection (starting with Penguin Dreams and I'll work my way up from there) from their well-stocked library, and I was at home. Scratch that. If I had a home it still wouldn't be this nice. I'll update if I find a flaw later, but right now after 4 days of 12-hour drives across the US, this is a slice of heaven with habanero on top. (did I mention it's $15 per night? total. no fees. no nothing. hell, it cost me $35 for a patch of dirt 10 feet from the 101 in California just to set up my tent in a puddle. Memphis gets much respect from me for this.)Great Place!Very clean very cozy. If you are staying in Memphis this is the place to be. They have full size beds in the dorm rooms, and they have private and public bathrooms. And for $15 a night, that's cheaper than staying home.It's a little far from downtown, but driving is easy, and the neighborhood is pretty hip.   You have to do one chore each day wile you are there, but they are easy, and it only takes like 5 minutes.I've been too allot of hostels around the world and this one actually ranks fairly high. Everything is super clean and safe, and just nice. The major con is it's a bit out of the city, but one bus will take you directly downtown. if your coming from the south via Amtrak you'll have to get a cab cause it's just too late for most buses and if your going south via Amtrak just get a cab cause it's too early for most buses.You have to do some chore while your here, which really isn't too bad, otherwise that's it. Just a nice simple clean hostel on the backside of a church.Not very cooperative, I wasn't able to stay here because I could not check in until 4pm, I had to be somewhere during check in hours, and no special arrangements would be made. I ended up walking 7 miles to the river through the parks and woods, and ghettos and historical districts and found a more accommodating place in town.Definitely worth the insanely cheap cost to stay here. I've resided in co-op housing and traveled through hostels, and this place is much cleaner than the former and less institutionalized than the hostels I've stayed in. I stopped here for a night on a long drive from MI to TX, and the chore I got was wiping down the dining room tables, which took 5 minutes. Most people working and visiting the hostel were in their 20s, and everyone was very friendly. There were lots of maps and brochures sitting around for tourists' easy access, as well as local menus organized by geographical distance. The hostel itself is in the hip Cooper-Young neighborhood. Even if it weren't a safe neighborhood, the hostel sits on the third level of a building next to a church, and door codes are needed to get in. Probably the most cost-effective part of my trip.When we finally arrived at the Pilgrim House, it was like a breath of fresh air. That was when we finally got there. Prior to our arrival, we tried calling but found out that there phone lines were not working and that's why we were unable to contact anyone and make a reservation. My friend that I was traveling with also was a little apprehensive about staying there because the Pilgrim House is located at the back of a church and we weren't really looking to stay in a Christian youth hostel. Anyway, a person from the church finally let us into the building after nearly dehydrating outside in the fierce Memphis heat and the Pilgrim House felt like we had arrived at home. The set up seemed like a real house in that bedrooms were set up around living spaces. It is a co-op style establishment in that everyone who stays at the Pilgrim is expected to pitch in and clean up and that way it was maintained rather well. Remember to do your chores or no key deposit back!In hindsight, the only drawback to staying at the Pilgrim House was that a lot of the staff that works there also lives there. I didn't feel completely welcome because I knew I was on their turf. Otherwise, The Pilgrim House was a positive experience and I would stay there again. It is not a Christian retreat which we feared and I think it was 15 bucks a night for a shared room. It is located in a cool part of Memphis and right down the street from the hostel is the wonderful little coffee shop: Java Cabana.I stayed in the pilgrim house for 4 nights and I loved it. Never stayed in a hostel before and this was a great time. Yes u do chores but so what. I spent less then 20 minutes all together on the chores. For 15 bucks u can't beat it. Most of the staff were really great. Did see much of the cat. Every1 that stayed there were really cool. Had a great time n would go back there anytime. Thank you pilgrim staff u helped make my time alot more fun :)","I really liked staying at the Pilgrim hostel. It was clean the staff was friendly and the people staying there were nice aswell. The chores they have you do are super easy and take about 5 minutes max. It is in a safer hip part of town so you don't feel scared. Near by are some good restaurants too! I recommend staying here if you are on a budget and are up for an adventure!I almost didn't stay here because the website makes it look like this place is run by a bunch of stodgy old church ladies, but the staff are actually young and fun, and so is the atmosphere here. It's a bit far from downtown so you do need a car. It's super-affordable, one of the nicer hostels I've stayed at.Stayed here for a night during a road trip through Tennessee. It was not at all what I expected from a church hostel! There was plenty of space, lots of comfortable loungey-areas to hang out, and a huge kitchen. They require that you do one chore while you're there that takes about 3 minutes (mine was wipe down the kitchen tables). The dorm rooms are cramped with rickety bunk beds so I didn't sleep very well. Then again for $15 it was fine for a night. If I was to stay there for longer, I'd definitely try to get a private room. The town near the hostel is cute with good restaurants, but it's definitely easier to have a car if you want to go down to Beale street at night.Didn't  love this place...staff was type A about everything unlike most other hostels i've ever been to. take this place with a grain of salt. 5-7 miles out of town, you'd need a car. good coffee shops, antique shops and cafes nearby as this is a trendy outskirt neighborhood.A friend and I booked a reservation here for one night, happy to have a very cheap place to stay as we passed through Memphis. We checked in, played with their really cute cat, and then left for dinner. When we returned, we met near disaster - the cars that had been parked on either side of us earlier had been vandalized while we were gone. Each one had a window smashed, and who knows what belongings were stolen from within the car. We immediately decided to head back downtown and wound up, thanks to the extreme number of drunk tourists populating all of the cheaper hotels, staying at the Peabody. After an outrageously expensive night of deep sleep on an amazingly plush bed, we finally got through to someone at the hostel to let them know why we hadn't returned the night before. When I explained the situation to the girl there, she seemed unconcerned. Her deadpan response was, ""Yes, some cars were broken into."" She then proceeded to ask whether we had left belongings there and said goodbye. There was no apology and definitely no offer of a refund. I mean, the girl obviously wasn't personally responsible for our crappy situation, but she didn't seem to care, either. I'm guessing that her nonchalance indicates that break-ins are not uncommon. So to those of you bringing a car (especially one filled with all of your belongings because you're roadtripping to LA to begin grad school...), be warned. You may not find it like you left it.",,,,"['far', 'hostels', 'pretty', 'good', 'church', 'big', 'parking', 'lot', 'safe', 'part', 'town', 'doors', 'security', 'codes', 'changed', 'regularly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-memphis-beale-street-memphis,Hampton Inn & Suites Memphis-Beale Street,4.0,$$,43,"I had a god experience at this hotel, I would stay here again. Right next to Beale St. The room had a balcony where we can here the music. The breakfast was okay. Things I didn't like.-no bellman-the one egg dish had ham and bell peppers.-the area to drop off your luggage Other than that, this place was great.Like most other Hampton Inns across the country, this one offer clean rooms and good front desk service. They also have typical Hampton Inn breakfast and a very helpful breakfast staff.This hotel is literally located a block away from Memphis' famous Beale Street. Next door, you have a pizza shop where you can buy a cheese slice for $5 or $6 for pepperoni. Inside the hotel they also have a small bar and restaurant with yummy gyros.WHY ONLY 3 STARS? Here's why I am only giving this hotel 3 stars- It's noisy as hell. All through the night you hear music and banging. The front desk has a disclaimer about the noise, but I would imagine they could construct an effective barrier to drown out the noise a little better. I was up all night both nights I stayed here, even after using sleep aides to get some sleep. So, don't expect to get much rest if you decide to stay at this specific hotel, BUT you can expect good customer service like any other Hampton Inn.The Hiltons are good friends of mine. Well, at least their chain of modestly priced hotel properties are good friends!The Memphis Hilton is very clean and convenient to all things Memphis as a tourist (though be warned Graceland is nowhere near downtown). As noted at the desk ""Beale can be noisy"" this is not a place to stay if you are a light sleeper. Memphis is working really hard to clean things up, even so Beale has a gritty side that keeps me from recommending it to a solo traveler after dark. Many rooms have a lovely alley view of Beale St bars and restaurants complete with patrons ready to refund whatever they ate and drank for dinner. That's Beale! Parking is super easy and convenient here. The staff is tops. Security is very visible and other touches like a key card activated elevator make your stay more pleasant in the #4 out of 10 most dangerous cities in the US.Great location in write at Beale Street can listen to music all night hopefully like good musicReally amazing customer service, and right next to all the cool places you want to be.Hotel staff is VERY FRIENDLY.  We arrived a little early and they allowed us to go ahead and check in.  The lady at the front desk was extremely courteous and helpful.  Housekeeping staff in the hallways asked us how our room was.This hotel is a little pricey, but you are paying for the awesome LOCATION, which is literally steps from Beale Street.  We could hear the sounds of Beale St from our room, but that's what we were there for, so it didn't bother us.  This is probably not the hotel for you if you are there to get some sleep or get work done.  Our room was very nice and clean, and the bed was comfortable.  I like that the hotel is very secure.  You have to use your key card to access everything -- the elevator, the doors after hours, the parking deck (which is right next door, not valet, costs $19 per night).  They have a bar in the lobby, and there is also a sundries shop to purchase miscellaneous items such as toiletries and snacks.  Wi-fi was easy to access and worked well.  My only complaint was the free breakfast buffet.  The free buffet is one of the reasons I chose this hotel, and it was not up to the quality of other free buffets we've had.  The sausage and eggs were barely warm.  The eggs were a little weird (powdered?).  They had other things like bagels, yogurt, bananas, and muffins.  Selection was pretty good, just needed the hot foods to be hot.  I guess I shouldn't complain since it is free.Despite the buffet, we will most likely stay here again.Overall:  GREAT hotel in a GREAT LOCATION.  Buffet -- meh.This Hampton Inn is located right off Beale St downtown.  We stayed here over a long weekend and were impressed.  We had one of their suites which was very nice.  Well appointed, with balcony, small kitchenette and living room room area, and a separate bedroom (king bed) and adjoining bath (flat screens in both rooms).  For a place that I am sure sees its fair share of partiers, the hotel and our room were in nice shape and very well kept.  They do not offer room service, but there is a Fajita joint attached that will deliver.  The hotel also has a nice complimentary breakfast buffet with a good variety...cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, waffle makers, and a couple hot buffet items (eggs and sausage when we stayed).  Overall it was a nice place to stay and I would return if I am back in Memphis.Love coming here. Great place to stay. Rooms are nice. Right in the heart of downtown, Beale St. Memphis. Staff is friendly. Check in was easy and fast. Complimentary breakfast. Balcony view of Beale St.This place was totally decent. Definitely didn't exceed expectations or anything, but all needs were well met. The staff was helpful for getting taxis and helping us with directions. There were always a few people at the desk ready to help and there's a tiny snack shop next to the desk with some pretty good options, especially if you're coming home from a long night on Beale and feeling snacky :) My bf and I also stayed at the Hilton while we were here. It's particularly good for a Hampton, and the other is particularly bad for a Hilton. and this place was significantly nicer, but much louder! However, they definitely warn you ahead of time about it and that's just the price you pay to stay in the fun part of town. The gym was, of course, tiny. But they had a bench, some free weights, and a few cardio machines. If you're creative or just a cardio bunny, you can make do here. At least they have one. If I ever go back to Memphis, I would consider staying here again but only if there was a humongous price difference between here and the Peabody. Now that place is awesome! But this place definitely does the trick for a place to sleep and grab a quick free breakfast.Nice people, clean rooms but not a place for a good nights sleep. Very noisy even on the 6th floor.  Outside music from local bars/clubs.Centrally located, friendly and helpful staff, wonderful and generous breakfast buffet all made this particular Hampton Inn stand out. While other reviewers complained about the noise, we didn't need to use the earplugs that they handed us when we checked in. The noise wasn't bad on the 6th floor even though we were close to Beale St. We heard the music but it was bearable. Room was very clean. Liked that we had a safe in the room. No fridges in the rooms.My boyfriend &amp; I stayed here for Valentines Day. They let us check in early which was great because we were seeing a show at the Orpheum and wanted to get ready before the show. The staff was friendly. They have an indoor pool &amp; hot tub (24/7) The room was clean &amp; bed comfortable. One thing I was worried about in Memphis was safety and I felt extremely safe. You need a room key to get in the elevator to the rooms which is right in front of the front desk. When we went to smoke a cigarette at 3am, there was a bunch of security hanging out in the lobby which was awesome. THE LOCATION WAS AWESOME if you are wanting to party on Beale Streets! It's 1/2 a block away and was an extremely easy walk. Saw complaints about noise level in other reviews and when you check in there is a sign saying basically that they are right on Beale Street. Our room overlooked behind Beale &amp; we heard nothing all night and it was a Saturday night. The only thing that could be improved was Breakfast when it came to the eggs, sausage &amp; fruit. They did have yogurt, cereal, bagels &amp; waffles though so we were satisfied. Would stay here again definitely!!!!!Staff was friendly. The Night Auditor gave us each a large complementary Toblerone chocolate bar when we arrived which was a nice surprise. Super soft beds. I felt safe. Main doors to lobby were locked at night and you needed to ring a bell to be let in if you didn't check in yet. Additionally, you need a key card to call the elevator. Our guest room was right next to the elevator and I didn't hear any hallway noise or street noise. Nice indoor pool with hot tub (no jets or bubbles), gym, and business center. Nice to have free wifi even though we didn't use it. The lobby layout was communal and it reminded me of a cozy Smoky Mountain cabin. I liked the free breakfast. Parking was a $15.56 + tax, but I knew that when I booked. It was a wonderful stay. Check out the video I made at this hotel: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fv0tDkEr-amk&amp;s=955bfd7c3459ee38fc60b9c1383057db532ddfd150a74c41c65fc896fdd1512c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtu.be/v0tDkEr-amk</a>This Hampton Inn delivers on location and cleanliness.  In general I like Hampton Inns for their reliable internet, check, and decent cable tv offerings, check, and free coffee in the morning, check.Back to location, this Hampton Inn is just around the corner from the heart of Beale St.  Also, I walked to the Civil Rights Museum/Lorraine Motel, about 10 minutes away, although you can take a street car which is about 2 blocks away.  There is also a Starbucks one block away and a Hooters across the street for catching whatever football, baseball, basketball game might be on.  Parking is $17 extra which a lot of other have mentioned and the spots are super narrow.  Overall, Hampton Inn is a good option although if money is not an issue and you are picky then the Peabody might be a better option.This Hampton Inn is 3.5 stars, better than average but below very good. Overall the staff were very nice and the rooms were clean. I stayed three nights here. The location to Beale St is great step out the door and turn the corner.. it's only 1/2 block away. The down side was every morning it took 15 mins of running the water to get it warm enough for a shower, also late night hunger will not be satisfied until the morning. No options. Which surprised me for a so-called ""party area"". So it had pros and cons. Overall I'd stay again just on proximity to Beale Street.We have stayed at the Hampton many times in many different cities, and we have never been disappointed.  They have an adequate breakfast, with clean and quiet rooms.  If you stay here, try to get a room NOT on the Beale Street side.  We were on the Peabody Place side, and had no problems at all.  Others on the other side had difficulty with noise, and unruly guests.  I was surprised at all the security here, but I guess it is necessary.  For one thing, you can only use the elevators to get to your rooms.  No stairway access except in emergencies.  Also, you need your room key to access the elevator, and, at certain times of day, the lobby bathrooms and the lobby itself.  We asked for one, king bed, but, somehow, we got two standard beds instead.  When we stayed at the Hampton in Nashville, they did the same, but we got two queen beds.  When you make your reservations, be sure they give you what you ask for.  Other than that, the rooms were clean, well-serviced, and comfortable.  The staff was nice and accommodating.  You can usually find good rates at these hotels, even when they are located in or near popular sites.Stayed in the King Suite with 3 other people.  The room was spacious and clean.  The pull-out couch not so comfortable but my guest didn't complain much.The hotel is around the block from Beale St so if you want a quiet room this hotel is not for you BUT if you are stying in Memphis why not listen the music from Beale St to keep you in the mood of Memphis???The continental breakfast was AWESOME and lots to choose from!Would definitely stay there again!My mum and I had the absolute pleasure of staying here. All staff members were absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond to help us. This isn't something you  come across too often. The rooms are super clean comfy beds fantastic breakfasts. This is the best spot you could stay in to be so central to Beale St. Would highly recommend.I've always enjoyed Hampton Inns. The branding is great, affordable, rooms are comfortable. But as soon as I was greeted by Mario, I knew I was in the right place. :)  (Ok, also the sign at the front desk was adorable so that won me over too.)I would have given this place a 4 at least, but Mario greeted me by my formal name when I walked past the desk  or had a question AND there is a pool/hot tub AND we are a street away from Beale St. Perfect :)This Hampton is in a great location! Close to Beale Street. Rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was great. All staff was kind and helpful. We'll be making more trips to Memphis in the future and plan on staying here again","If you are in Memphis, stay here.  Period.This hotel is right around the corner from Beale Street, probably the only reason that you are in Memphis in the first place.  Located within easy late night stumbling distance from all of the nightlife that Beale offers, the Hampton Inn cannot be beaten for the pure convenience factor.The staff is typical Memphis friendly in that if you are in a hurry for something, you will be disappointed.  But that is part of the overall charm of the entire city.  Kick back.  Relax.  Smoke em if ya got em.The rooms are larger and nicer than your average Hampton Inn in that they are suites with a 'full' kitchen included.  Not that you should use it, there are fantastic eating places literally around the corner.  Rendezvous is just a few blocks away if you get that urge for some Memphis Dry Rub served ala Tourist Style.  The hotel has an adjoining covered parking garage so that you can park your ride while you enjoy the ride.Was transferred, left a message, called again later, transferred again, then waited on hold for around 8 minutes waiting to talk to someone to ask how much a room was. Giving up. Shouldn't be that difficult to ask a simple question.Spent a night here not long ago. Lovely location. Only exception is you have to pay for parking. Our room was on Peabody st side, high up so it was nice and quiet. Didn't see any unruliness or rude guest. Rooms are modern and tastefully decorated. Facilities are good. Breakfast was wonderful. Good options for cold/hot foods. Would stay again.We loved the very welcoming lobby/living room area which also served as a breakfast eating area in the mornings. To the right was an inviting fireplace with sofas and chairs although it was in the 60s when we were there on November 21. The large breakfast buffet was very good. Different coffees were available all day and night. Although we were warned that we might hear music late into the night in our room, we did not. Our room was quiet. This hotel was quite a bit more expensive than any other place we stayed on our two-week road trip, but you are paying for location. The parking cost $15.56, and there was a sales tax plus a hotel tax which increased the total price by $50. That's my only complaint.Very pleasantly surprised with the Hampton Inn on Beale St! Spent the night here with the family for a downtown weekend and play at the Orpheum. Wasn't sure what to expect for a family stay this close to Beale St but it was great. I used a fellow Yelper tip and requested a room high up which reduced the street noise and this was probably a good call. The staff was very attentive and polite, everything was clean and new, the indoor pool and breakfast buffet were HUGE hits and the location was great. Little details like the unique TN/Memphis related pictures next to every room number and the guitar artwork in the rooms are what upped this place up to 5 stars for me though. The price seemed a little expensive for a Hampton Inn when I was researching, but after the stay I say it was fair and worth it. You can't beat the location and the amenities plus the staff.loved the hotel, room and the pool!  kid friendly too!  we were right downtown and within walking distance of everything.  only downside was that we had a car top carrier on our van and it didn't fit in their parking garage so we had to park down the street, but price wasn't bad for parking.Awesome staff at the hotel. The FD supervisor is amazing! The breakfast staff is amazing and very friendly. I will visit this hotel again!I stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. Upon arriving there is a garage adjacent to the hotel to park in. We arrived a lot earlier than the check-in time but the lady working the desk had no problem letting us check-in. The entire stay was full of a friendly/helpful staff. The hotel is super close to Beale Street as well as a lot of other tourist attractions.The hotel is clean and well-maintained. The elevators require your key card to use after certain hours so the added security is nice. The breakfast set up in the morning was nice with hot and cold foods available. The room was clean and fresh. Although the bed was a little harder than I am used to it did not bother my sleeping at all. The bathroom was spacious and clean with all the amenities available. As another reviewer said there is a sign at the front desk stating that it can be loud because of Beale Street but I did not seem to have a problem with it. My room didn't face Beale Street directly but it did face a park that had a band playing into the early morning and I didn't find it too loud to mess with my sleep.All in all this is a great hotel to stay at if you want to be in this part of Memphis. When I go back I have no problem staying here again.Awsome place and people to boot! We were warmly greeted by Rashonda I believe who was vary helpful. Even though I was excited about getting over to Beale St. and keept bombarting her with question she laughed with my wife at my excitement. Even offered her a place to stay in  St. Louis if she would be unable to find a place when visiting STL in the next few weeks. Hope you enjoyed STL when you came up Rashonda.     Location was fantastic. Super close to alot of things Charles Vergos, Beale St., trolly and so much more. Only stayed one night coming through town on our way back to STL.     Rooms were clean and staff was all friendly. Parking garage is just a few steps form the door. Breakfast is served just like all Hamptons we have been too. Super big breakfast area with nice seating. The gentleman who was keeping the breakfast stocked up worked his butt off with all the guest eating in the morning. This is not a bad thing, but showes he is deffently their to make sure you are treated great and get what you need and want. Thank you sir for being upbeat and a friendly man at breakfast.Have stayed here on business two times. The first time we stayed at the Westin and decided to save a bit of money and try this place. The staff are some of the friendliest people around. Always cheerful and helpful. The hotel as a whole is clean, warm and friendly with newer furniture. The location is also great, near all of the action. You can ask for a room on the quiet side if you don't want to hear the noise from Beale street. Love the fact that it has breakfast which is included in the price of the room and that coffee is available all the time. The rooms are spacious and include a nice workspace and large bathroom. My only complaint is that the beds are a bit hard, but certainly not uncomfortable. Since we will continue to do work in Memphis, we will continue to stay at the Hampton Inn.Great location overall. Loved being able to walk right over to Beale St.  We had trouble with our keys constantly, which you need for everything. (Nice for safety, of course!)Beds were not comfortable. The staff was friendly &amp; helpful. Breakfast was so-so, but there's lots of good food in Memphis!!Great location a block from Beale street which to me is a positive!  However, beforewarned if you are a light sleeper this may impact you depending on which room you are given.  As a HH member, I was given a high room with windows facing Peabody place which is on the opposite side of Beale and I had no problems.  My colleague; however, was given a Beale side room and heard the jazz music all night.  Fortunately she was happy with it...Gym is small but decent (one treademill and universal weight machine).  Small indoor pool and jacuzzi. Best part of the stay: FREE wifi, breakfast and all day coffee and fresh fruit.5 stars for location! Literally a half block from Beale St and EVERYTHING is in walking distance, we parked our car in the garage and didnt move it until we left. The front desk service was great, but keep in mind there is a sign on the front desk that says ""ATTENTION PLEASE This hotel is located in the sports and entertainment district of Memphis. As such. it is noisy here till the wee hours. We want you to have as enjoyable a stay with us. If you are looking for a quiet hotel (and area) this isn't it. Eat, Drink, Boogie... Repeat"" and its true the party really gets going on Beale St and doesnt stop til after 3am so keep that in mind!As soon as we got there we freshened up and walked down to Rendezvous for ribs (it was abt 2 blocks away) and then did a little touristy walking through the Peabody and some shops all of which are very close. We swam in the pool in the hotel (the pool is not very big but the jacuzzi was heavenly, esp after a long night on Beale!) and got ready and headed out to Beale St that night which was literally in our front yard at that point. If your looking for a place to crash before &amp; after bbq &amp; beale st I definitely reccomend the Hampton. If youre looking for a quieter family weekend, I definitely do NOT reccomend it, but it fit our purposes perfectly!The location of the Hampton Inn is great for easy access to Beale Street and Gibson Guitars.Check in was a breeze, our room is extremely clean and comfortable.The parking is self-parking, no valet in a parking garage attached to the property, just know that it runs $18 per day.  We have not found a downtown hotel in any city that doesn't charge for parking and this rate is not bad.Our room is quiet, but I can imagine on a weekend when Beale Street is hopping, it may be a tad noisy, but well worth it for the location.I will update once we have breakfast, but so far it is great!Proximity to Beale st, Gus's, Rendezvous, Arcade, Peabody, and Fedex Forum is the BEST!Came for UFC 107 and found that having everything in walking distance kept the cab fees down.. hotel staff was very helpful.Not too expensive or too far, walking-wise, to hit up when you spend a wild night on Beale, which we did.  When friends come to town they try to book a night here and a night at The Peabody.Great pillows.  Hey, it's important, right?  Fresh-smelling, slightly bleached bedding, the comforters are classy and clean, and you don't feel like you need to roll them down.  Yes, I've stayed in my share of dives on road trips.It's a nice hotel.  New furnishing in the bathrooms, Wi-Fi, and close to the happening places in downtown -- catch brunch on Beale before you head home.Excellent location and staff!  We wanted to go to a different city for our Christmas holidays and we decided to give Memphis a try.  We are Hilton Honors members so we expect a lot from any Hilton stay.  Hampton Inn Beale Street Team delivered! We stayed five nights including New Year's Eve.  The location is perfect for walking to Beale Street for fun and all of downtown Memphis, including the National Civil Rights Museum (a must on your trip!)  We had a suite on the 6th floor and even though people talk about it not being a quite location-Beale Street parties etc., we found it very quiet. It is the perfect size for a few days away from home.  The kitchenette is well stocked and includes a dishwasher, stove top, microwave and a decent size refrigerator.  We enjoyed several meals in the kitchen that has a table for four.  The living room has a sleeper sofa (the only negative-it was all springs and not very comfortable) and sitting chair and flat screen TV.  The layout of the suite was perfect for a family trip-we could go out on our daily adventures and come back to the hotel suite to visit and relax.  The queen size bed was super comfy and the pillows were nice and soft.  The curtains were nice and heavy and kept the light out when sleeping.  The bathroom was spacious enough and extremely clean.  The breakfasts were well presented and well stocked.  The staff was very kind and helpful.  We highly recommend this Hampton Inn and thank them for all their help in making our family trip so happily memorable. We will absolutely stay at this location again!Well, this wasn't the W... but it served its purpose, and like the other reviewer said, it's in a great location.  I'm not sure how much the room cost, but it was clean and the staff was helpful.  The decor was actually decent for a Hampton Inn, but the bed was not comfy and the linens were pretty standard.  Overall, it was good for a short weekend stay.Good location, prices ok, but not one of the best Hampton Inn's I've been to.For the most part, you're paying for the location of this very generic hotel. It's right on Beale Street, close to FedEx Forum and Autozone park. Great location if you want to be a tourist and leave the car in the parking garage for the majority of your stay. Speaking of, be prepared to be gouged on parking. We were surprised to find a $17/day charge for parking on our bill that we assumed was free for hotel guests. Breakfast was average.It's a solid hotel with a great location and a high price. No real complaints, but nothing very special.","Expensive Hampton Inn!!!!  its in a nice location, right off of Beale St if that's what you're into.  The staff is nice, very helpful.  Rooms are clean, maids were friendly.  Parking is kinda pricey.  You can walk to the trolley which will take you around downtown Memphis.  I've been here several times, so I would go back.The location is outstanding if you want to be in the middle of tourist town, which for this trip we definitely did.  This is one expensive Hampton Inn, however.  We splurged on a suite, which was defininely 2 rooms but it wasn't the most spacious suite I've ever been in.  The ceilings were very low and the rooms felt a little outdated even though I think the hotel is relatively new.  Everything you want to see is no more than 4 blocks away - Beale Street, Autozone Park, Rendevous, Gibson Guitar factory...all conveniently located.  The noise from Beale Street stays pretty loud until the early morning hours, so unless you also plan to be up and out late too, you probably shouldn't choose this hotel.Nice little hotel in the heart of downtown Memphis. It's moderately priced and about a block from Beale St -- Memphis' answer to Austin's 6th St.",,,"['god', 'experience', 'hotel', 'right', 'next', 'room', 'balcony', 'music', 'breakfast', 'okay',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/elvis-presleys-heartbreak-hotel-memphis,Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel,2.5,$$,48,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Great location to visit Elvis home. Hotel outdated and just average on cleaning. I have been at worse hotels.  Nothing so bad that we would not stay again.Don't stay here.Ranking this based on price, it is a dump.  It is not Elvisey.  There is no Elvis magic that makes it worth the price.The two room suite is not a suite. Two tiny rooms and bathroom access is only through one. So the other room has to walk thru the room with the restroom. Free internet is worthless. I have to type this with my personal wifi hotspot. No customer service at all.  Forget a toothbrush at Hampton Inn?  They will give you one. Here?  They tell you when the gift shop opens tomorrow so you can buy one. There was a giant Beetle awaiting us in the room whith was a bonus. Bottom line, this is a low value budget hotel (think holiday inn) at a premium price. Come here if you want the complete Graceland Ripoff experience. It's a dump for the price. 'Nuff said.I highly agree with the last three reviews of Elizabeth, Steve and TJ - not worth any money - basically a Ramada Inn or some other crappy hotel in the US. Also in an unsafe part of Memphis (but i'm not sure there is a""safe"" part) They do have security when you enter which I suppose is helpful. The staff was friendly!oh and the breakfast - cold cereal. TerribleThis Hotel was a complete and utter disappointment.  I classify it as a tourist trap in it's current condition.   I think this hotel represents Elvis horribly and I'll tell you why.   1.)  We stayed in one of the standard rooms and it appeared to us like renovations were never done since the hotel originally opened (in the 1980s?) and before it became the Heartbreak Hotel.  It gave the general appearance of old and unclean.   2.)  In addition the room was set to 79 degrees when we entered it, felt like it was in the 80s and after adjusting the temp it seemed like it took hours for the temp to become bareable.  3.)  They have a security gate check into the parking lot however we heard some noise outside and saw a man get out of his car in the middle of the parking lot and proceed to urinate in public.   Considering that they have security this was not only disgusting but also left us feeling unsafe.4.)  There were numerous dead bugs found in different areas of the room.5.)  The desk clerk was kind enough to write up a report of this for the General Manager along with my contact information.   I never heard back from the General Manager so I actually had to call her a few days later and I left a voicemail.  Instead of her calling me back, it appears that she pawned the report over to her night Manager who I finally heard from.  The night manager apologized and then said she wouldn't offer any type of credit.  It's like she found all of this acceptable.  I consider this extremely poor customer service from Management an insult to Elvis, his family, and myself as a customer.I hope they do Elvis justice with the new hotel they are building although I probably will not go based on my experience with this old hotel.  If I owned the old Hotel they are currently operating I would close it immediately until the hotel is brought up to acceptable Elvis standards.  They are likely generating very bad public relations (as evidenced from other reviews too) which could impact the new Hotel they are building and is likely impacting people considering seeing Graceland itself.  On a bright note, the Graceland tour and their staff gets five stars!I gave this place a third star solely for the staff.  The people who work in this building are exceptional, especially considering the amount of complaints that I am sure they must hear on a daily basis.Overall, this place is, unfortunately, a dump.  It's been a dump for a while, but I think that since the Graceland Hotel plans have launched, the owners of this building no longer take pride in upkeep of the rooms and the morale of the staff.The rooms are old...which isn't always bad, except that these rooms have clearly not been maintained in probably a decade.  With stained carpets and furniture and walls in dire need of fresh paint, it's clear that no one has invested in the location in a very long time.I understand the draw of staying in a place that seems to be the heart of the King himself, but seriously, don't.  You'll do yourself a favor to stay further outside of town (in a much safer area) and just driving in during the day to catch Graceland.  Heed the warnings, Yelpers!I'm glad I did it, because it feels like something you have to do if you're an elvis fan. But it was overall a pretty crappy hotel. Staff was super nice though. Not a great neighborhood.I found this place to be exactly what one would expect.  The suites were laid out a little strange with the bathroom off the private bedroom which made privacy impossible but they can't do much about that.  The staff was fantastic.  Truly understood hospitality.  If you are going to Graceland I would without a doubt stay here.   It was old like many reviews stated but if you started changing a lot of things would it be the Heartbreak Hotel or just a super 8 next to Graceland?Thank God, I didn't listen to any of the yelp reviews on this hotel. The staff was awesome and the bartender Bryan was the most knowledgeable ,kind and sweet person I've met in a long time. It's so great to be around people with the same interest, it's like an Elvis convention 365 days a year. I wish every vacation could go this well.I'm sure the five star rating I gave this place is causing you to question my reviewing credibility ...BUT give me a shot to explain. This little hotel is not 5 star as in fancy schmancy but 5 star in its own right. When you sign up to stay at the Heartbreak Hotel you expect it to be close to Graceland and Elvis themed and that's exactly what it is. The place is staffed with great friendly people and is walking distance to Graceland. It's a really cute hotel with gimmickie Elvis stuff everywhere. What is most important to me is that it's safe and clean, and it was. Like I mentioned the staff at front desk was very welcoming, the souvenir shop had great stuff at decent prices, and everything from the lobby to our room was spotless. This hotel is exactly what you expect it to be and I had a pretty awesome experience here!A dump that hasn't been cleaned since Elvis died.Took my Elvis-obsessed daughter here for a surprise visit to Graceland. She loved the hotel for all of the Elvis themed decor, but I thought it was in need of an upgrade. Our suite had two rooms, which was nice but it wasn't anything special. Aside from the two elvis pictures on the wall, it was basically a Best Western room in disguise. The lobby is the highlight of the hotel, but on the smaller side. The ""heartbreak"" pool was a nice touch, but again very small and my daughter couldn't go in as it was 5ft deep all around. The Jungle Room lounge is a small bar/eating area with basic food (hot dog, hamburger, etc). The staff was very friendly and the gift shop and lots of nice Elvis memorabilia. The close proximity to Graceland was a plus as it was just a short walk across the parking lot.We have been planning a trip across America for a year and Graceland was going to be our third stop on a 6000 mile road trip. First of all they charge your Credit Card the day you make the reservation, so be prepared to pay long before you arrive.The hotel is need of some cleaning and painting, some of the walls in the hotel and rooms need to be touched up, $300 a night is very pricey. Lisa Marie you need to get involved with this hotel and have the staff take care of the hotel and the guests.There is a shuttle to Beale Street from the hotel for $5 where you can shop and eat, there is a COP on every corner so rest assured you are safe.Now let's get down and dirty, if we hadn't talked to other guests at the hotel and around town I would have thought it was me. There were two African American female employees at the check-in desk, they made a white female employee come out and help us, other guests complained of the same thing. I sent an email to Graceland, Inc. do you think they would respond. The two African American females were rude and wouldn't help us, Yikes!There are no different employees of ethnic groups at Graceland or the Heartbreak Hotel to respond to needs of Hispanics, Asians, etc.Remember me, we had our picture taken before the tour started and when we got back we bought it for $20, and you  threw it at me, then I asked for a bag and I think it bothered you, well guess what, you will never get a dime from us again.The hotel feels run down.  It is dirty and I felt that the the owners are about getting the most money they can for least amount of effort.  The room we got had old beds that sagged when you sat on them.  I could feel the spring push through.  Room  226 had a strange odor; I wanted to open the window but it was sealed shut.  The ""free"" breakfast was one of the most dismal I have had in years. TERRIBLE.  No fresh anything.   The room wifi was free and the shower was hot (otherwise I would have gave it 1 star).  Not recommend ... get a nearby hotel that will be cheep and make up for what you save with their Elvis package.Terrible customer service, rude employees at the store, run down rooms, I took my aging mother here for the Rock and Roll package. Over $500, totally not worth it. Graceland it's self was awesomeI agree with everyone who talked about the excellent staff. Most true! They gave dining recommendations that were right on target. Also a good complimentary breakfast, including Krispy Kreme donuts! We appreciated the shuttle to Beale St, was great not to drive more after a long day of driving.  We also had a ton of space in our hotel suite -- an extra room that we didn't need but I could see how that would be great for a family. Here's the caveat: if you are used to staying in uniform nice hotels, this is not the place for you. It is quirky and eclectic. And, it's super convenient to Graceland but nothing else. The area around there has a strip mall feel.Basically an Econo Lodge with some posters and a gift shop. Slow wifi, and the house keeping has a meeting every morning to discuss how to be as loud as possible in the early hours. Other than the 24-hour tv station devoted to the King, this place was pretty much a huge disappointment.If you like ants. Get ready to welcome them. You will be sleeping with then. Leaving now and going to the best Western... Will update laterI will give this hotel 3 stars because of the service and accommodations. The hotel itself could use a face lift.  That being said we still had a nice time here. Since we were going on a Graceland tour the next day we figured why not stay at The Heartbreak Hotel?The hotel has a shuttle van that will take you to Sun Records, The Peabody Hotel (where the ducks walk) and on to Beale St. and pick you up at a later time.Beale St. was more than I expected, neon lights all around, people singing the blues everywhere.  We stopped to watch one group, the singer said he's played with BB King and other well known blues singers.They had what they call (Big Ass Beer) for sale in plastic cups labeled ""BIG ASS BEER:""  We only had one because we had to get up early the next morning for our Graceland tour,  but it was awesome, and I am so glad we came here.This place is very comfortable, friendly, kitchy, and close to everything Elvis. My husband bought a package deal from them that included about 5 different activities (Stax, Sun, Hard Rock Cafe, Graceland, and the Rock &amp; Soul Museum). We did them all in 2 days. The best part is the hotel offers a shuttle to Beale street for $5 pp each way. A hell of a deal considering you'll have to find your way there and pay for parking if you don't. This was out first trip to Memphis and we also caught a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game, to which the shuttle took us so we were able to drink up and have the shuttle take us back to the hotel. We didn't drive the whole weekend. I bring this up because nothing else, besides Graceland, is nearby. You'll need to either keep driving to Beale Street or take the shuttle. Almost everything is off of Beale street. Graceland is next door and we got up early Saturday morning, walked across to the Rock &amp; Roll cafe and then straight to Graceland. The hotel plays Elvis movies in the lobby nonstop and there are Elvis pictures everywhere. Including the room. Somehow, we got upgraded to a suite with an extra full sized bed (along with the king size we reserved) so we were pretty pleased about that so that my husband could watch tv in one room and I could sleep in the other. This is not a fancy hotel, but it is very clean and comfortable. I thought the staff was super friendly and helpful. My husband described the deluxe breakfast as lots of bread items, some fruit, and coffee. Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely. In fact, we plan to rerun in the spring.The heartbeak hotel is  located in a very unsafe neighborhood but there is a guard to get into the hotel.  When you first walk in don't get the impression that the room looks just like the lobby.  The room isn't colorful at all.  The rooms are very old and small.  We were in the hotel for a 1 night stay and were glad we didn't stay any longer.  We went down stairs for dinner and the food was mediocre.  The salads were fresh and their fried pickles were amazing.  You have to go to the bar to get another drink refill if you need one.  In the dinner room there is a projector playing Elvis clips from all his tours and shows.  For breakfast the food wasn't good no protein just carbs, so you might have to bring protein bars if you just cant have carbs.  The biscuits were dried out and the gravy on top wasn't good either.  The juice for breakfast was watered down and the bar wasn't open to get soda.  Our room looked right out to the heart shaped pool its very cool but very small.  It doesn't fit that many people in the pool.  Graceland was right next door in walking distance.  Would stay here if I went to Graceland again.","Heartbreak hotel on Lonely Road!! Can't get more Elvisy than that!!!Since we were going all the way to Memphis for Graceland, I wanted the full Elvis experience for my mom, so I booked our one night stay here. I did read reviews here on yelp and tripadvisor, so I knew not to expect anything fancy. Elvis themed rooms (regular rooms just have pictures of elvis, you have to rent the higher ends suites for the decked out rooms) and fun lobby decorated with purple and gold furniture. A cafeteria called the Jungle Room and heartshaped pool outside. A free shuttle service from and to the airport, a short walk to Graceland made everything super convenient. They even have a pink Limo pick u up for dinner at the nearby bbq joint Marlowes! Just pick up the pink fuzzy phone in the lobby<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elvis-presleys-heartbreak-hotel-memphis?select=gnSg7GgZXWDkBKWYuxotVA#J8mpEcx_UzwfPTGDdGjN2Q"">yelp.com/biz_photos/elvi...</a> and a friendly driver who will even take ur picture for u, will come pick u up within 15minutes! I got a king bed suite ($150) that comes with pretty good sized room that has another room separated by a wall and small kitchenette area in between. The other room has its own tv and sleeper sofa. Watch Elvis 24/7! The sleeper sofa was EXTREMELY Uncomfortable. The springs were poking into my back so I had to grab some extra pillows and sleep on those. Besides the very uncomfortable sleeper sofa and things looking a bit worn, and thin walls, the convenience (since we had no car), friendly staff, and included breakfast made the one night here a decent stay. Amenities included coffeemaker, frig, microwave, hair dryer, bathtub/shower, toiletries...Complimentary breakfast was basic but did the job.  Biscuits and gravy, yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, mini muffins, bagels, cereal, toast, coffee, tea, juice, milk, jams, peanut butter. They stored our luggage for us at no charge while we toured Graceland. Cool place for after a flight and rest before a morning at Graceland, but if u plan on staying longer and want a more comfortable stay, you may want to check out some other places. But we enjoyed our stay for the most part!Their car service will also take u to Beale Street for free.*you can get a Triple A discount, but doesn't apply if you buy the Graceland package. Reservations staff was very helpful and courteous when I needed to make changes.We got a suite room letting my in-laws have the bedroom we crashed on the pull out. Thus our name for this place is ""The BackBreak Hotel"" LOL!Hubby and I did not sleep that night and giggled like teen girls every time we heard a noise :) The hotel is old and on the shabby side for the high suite price we paid, but hey it was fun being soooo close to Graceland.The common area is awesome. It's the breakfast bar area, so it the morning very early I got the heck out of the room and located some coffee :) They have a huge projector playing live performances nonstop.There is where I listened to a full blown conversation between two 70 year old ladies about how every morning they go early to the gates to pray. Their special new friend bond was amazing and they were full of tears for The King.I loved it!The room was outstanding.  Very big, and comfortable.  Overall, it was clean and I loved the decor.  I was a little disappointed that the hotel keys did have the Heartbreak Hotel logo.  It would've have been a nice touch.We got the love me tender package and it was a great bargain. The hotel room was clean and smoke free. The staff was very friendly and the free breakfast was ok. I love the atmosphere and the gift shop was small but decent with items you can not get anywhere else. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that you can hear the toilets flush in the other guest room. Overall the experience was great and the people and atmosphere was just what we were looking for.We showed up not sure what to expect. Check in was straight forward, great lobby and staff helpful. But then you walk toward the rooms and it just looks old and in need of some TLC. We then realized that an attempt was made to spruce at least our suite up when we walked in to the smell of paint with the bonus of a paint can and blue painters tape in their. The only thing the night staff could do after 30+ minutes was give me and my family 2 rooms with king sized beds (5 of us) so one person is sleeping on the couch as 3 of us are in one room and 2 in the other. The front desk people were kind enough and very apologetic when telling us that one room was comped. The other room would be discounted by $25 - will be revisited with management in the morning.I had high hopes when coming to this hotel, I thought it was going to be much more ""elvis-ee"". The lobby looks fantastic, but we just stayed in a normal room, not a suite and it was run down. The halls are all busted up as are the walls in the rooms. The rooms were clean (aside from the blue body pillow that had a substance on it that looked like...well someone had fun with the pillow if you know what I mean) and the hotel was clean, but everything was just old and run down. The walls are also paper thin, so you can hear toilets flushing from the rooms upstairs. The staff were very friendly and polite. The dessert in the ""jungle room"" was good and there is always coffee available for free. The breakfast was average.I think they should tear this place down and rebuild something nicer, they have the space and the $$. A recreation of graceland in a hotel. I would probably not stay here again.(2.5 stars, rounded up because I'm feeling generous)There's no denying that this was a really cute idea. When my girlfriend informed me that we'd be staying at the Heartbreak Hotel during the Graceland portion of our trip, I had to laugh. The hotel isn't the cheapest, but we were happy with the fact that it was walking distance to Elvis' house, so it was all good.The lobby is awesome. The seats are all tacky 70's throwbacks, complete with an old style TV box housing a small LCD TV playing Elvis films 24/7. I feel bad for the staff. If I had to watch those cheesy films for the duration of my shift, I'd probably lose my mind.The room itself is pretty average. The bed is comfy enough, and our room had a great view of the pool. Another thing with the hotel that reeled my girl in: The TV featured 2 Elvis stations, one which just plays his music with a photo slideshow, and the other plays random Elvis films 24/7.There were a couple of flaws. When calling for a shuttle to Beale street, prepare to wait a long time. We were told a few minutes, and sat waiting for about a half hour. Also, we had a big problem with the A/C in our room. It worked fine, but at random moments, it would suddenly start making a horrific banging sound, as if a little person was trapped inside and went crazy with a baseball bat. When we told the front desk, they got the message wrong, and told the maintenance man that the A/C wasn't working. Luckily we happened to be in the lobby when the man reported back that the A/C was working fine, and I swooped in to inform him of the actual problem. He quickly returned to the room, waited for it to happen again, and fixed it for us. Really nice guy.Cute concept, but feels average in many ways. You really can't pick a better spot for a hotel in Graceland though.This is a must for all elvis fans! They offer package deals that include tickets to all the must see tourist attractions in Memphis! What a fun experience!I couldn't pass up the novelty of staying at the Heartbreak Hotel, but you should only stay here for its location.  It is right across the street from Graceland and, technically, part of its property.I was put in the worst room, Room 214, which another Yelp reviewer mentioned.  I read this while in the room and the front desk courteously changed me to the ground floor.  She didn't even mention the worst part about the room -- while it does indeed look out into the Jungle Room lounge of the hotel (a far cry from the real deal at Graceland), they blast the Elvis Sirius station all day (and maybe all night, I didn't hang around that long), which funnels its way into your room and slowly drives you mad.In my new room, several lights didn't work -- including the one above the sink.  The room was tacky, as expected, with two large pictures of Elvis.  But you can't expect anything less here.Pros:- Free, secure parking (meaning that you have to stop every time before you enter)- You can walk to Graceland- Staff is friendly enough- Free breakfast (highlight was the sausage gravy)- It's a lot like the song -- they actually have a Lonely Street sign at the foot of the driveway entrance and the staff wears blackCons:- Old, rundown hotel rooms- No amenities beyond free breakfast- Hotel wireless was inoperativeIf you're an Elvis fan, this is a fun place to stay -- and, of course, you are going to Graceland.  I hear the themed suites, while insanely priced, are quite a hoot.  I'm not sorry I stayed here, but there was no need to be that close to Graceland.If you are going to Graceland this is an easy and convenient location. However the hotel is in desperate need of some sprucing up and updating. It is in a horrible part of town so if you want to do anything besides the Elvis thing I would stay somewhere else.It's a over priced motel 6 across the street from Graceland . Secure parking lot. Offers a shuttle to Beale street that will cost $5 per trip, $10 round trip. Which seems expensive until you travel ""through"" Memphis, which is when you'll be glad your car is safe in that secure parking lot I told you about.So I could have stayed in any hotel in Memphis but the allure of staying in the Heartbreak Hotel was too much. It is by no means a fancy hotel. It is actually pretty plain unless you put out the big bucks for the special suites. The hotel is definitely on the cheesy side but you are also right on the grounds of Graceland which is kind of cool if you are an Elvis fan.The pool was also in the shape of a heart with what looked like a big crack at the bottom. So yeah... cheesy, but whatever.It's exactly what any sensible person would think it would be. It's tacky. It's gaudy. It's elvisy. You're surrounded by jean shorts, fanny packs, and NASCAR hats/tats.  The wifi is almost non existent, probably due to a lack of computer owners staying there.At the same time:It's somewhat clean. It's safe. it's elvisalicious.All in all it's better than most of Memphis. Embrace the cheesieness and do the whole Elvis experience.                  Just don't go to Dodge's Chicken gas station. It's horrifying.Pure Elvis overdose. If you are not an Elvis fan you will be brainwashed into being one.  Pictures, movies, music, everywhere.  I guess that is why they call it the Elvis Presley heartbreak hotel.Problem is that it is rundown. They replaced a faucet here and patched a hole there but the infrastructure is beyond repair. The heart shaped pool is very small so forget about lap swimming.The rooms are spacious but need major renovation  Bartender had a bad days and grumpy. Drinks expensive. Can't figure what continent the continental breakfast is from but it leaves a lot to be desired. Someone spilled coffee and when the attendant was told about it her response was that it is a slip free floor so there was no danger of someone slipping. Well what about the fact that people are walking through it. DaaaaGood part is that you are in walking distance of Graceland. You save big bucks by not having to pay their parking. Also you can walk back to the hotel when you need a rest. All in all the hotel is a one timer for the extreme Elvis fan. If you aren't an Elvis fan you are in the wrong hotel.My wife and I stayed here at the end of April 2103, it was clean and tidy considering its age. It's only about $17 cab fare to Beale st.Despite the convenience to Graceland, they could do better. The room was okay but housekeeping didn't replenish the supplies properly.  No room service and the included hotel ""continental breakfast"" was the worst I ever experienced. As one person said - ""all sugar and starch"".  Even with that, less offered on the second morning then the first. Nothing replenished unless you went to the lobby and begged. All bread was white bread, nothing healthy. I know it's part of the room price but I, along with others I spoke to, would have preferred to get a $2.00 discount (what the breakfast was worth) and pay separately for a real breakfast.Only thing good about this hotel is location near graceland. we booked 1956 Elvis package. Hotel seemed okay from outside but rest turned out to be a big hype. All those reviewes we read, nearly proved to be wrong. I rather stay at The westin or Peabody in memphis. Except being near Graceland and related area, there is no food around in area. Once you have done Graceland tour, you should probably go to other hotel if you want to enjoy memphis. Pool was good in heartbreak. Airconditioning is extremely poor. Elevators probably will break soon. Staff can not point you to any good direction, but guard in parking can. I thought that was hilarious. overall, I rather stay even at comfort inn and probably be just as happy. so we decided to go to The westin on Beale street. Not only we had excellent memphis experience, at least Sun studio tour, Gibson tour and blues museum tours were just nearby. Never again, Heartbreak hotel....We visited Memphis in 2005 for our honeymoon and stayed here for the ultimate Elvis experience. It was an experience, but not a good one. The hotel is nothing special. It is close to Graceland, but the part of town is not great and the hotel itself is a let down. The common areas are fun and full of tacky the '70's vibe and maybe the special suites are too, but the cost is too high for most people. The regular rooms are like an old chain hotel that has not be updated in years with a couple Elvis pictures on the wall. They are not worth being the pricey category. I would go to many other hotels in Memphis before ever staying here again.We had the regular rooms and they are worse than best western. Trust me. The only things that portrays Elvis are the two photos on the wall in the room. It's old, the air condition is loud and noisy and it seriously needs some maintenance work done. The lobby is a misconception of the rooms.The only reason I gave two stars is for the fact that I am a huge Elvis fan and I love the fact that this place is an Elvis lovers dream.However, my experience here was pretty bad. The front desk did not have my reservation on file, even though I was charged for one night at the time that I booked, and I pulled up the confirmation email on my phone. Rather than just making me a reservation (there were rooms available), the person at the front desk started to fight with me that I made my reservation for the wrong day. Finally, after waiting 30 minutes, a manager came up and took care of making a reservation for me.The rooms are very run down. The free breakfast is ok - I guess you cannot complain when it is free. It is right across the street from Graceland which is nice, and there are buses to Sun Studio and downtown. It was nice to stay here once for the experience, but next time I will stay downtown.","Not impressed. The room was okay (a regular room, not a themed one). It was clean but the wifi didn't work unless you are in the lobby. Worst of all is that I didn't come across one staff member that was helpful, never mind being polite or heaven forbid friendly.The complimentary breakfast has cereal and toast, bagels and such - acceptable for being included with the roomI didn't even bother going to Graceland I no longer saw the point as the staff was rude and their souvenir's etc were ridiculously over priced. I will not be going their again, I should of stayed at another hotel. Lesson learned...(sigh)My husband and I stayed here for one night on our 4-day trip to Memphis this past week.  The room was expensive given the quality of the accommodations but clearly you are paying for the location, kitsch, and the right to say you've stayed at the Heartbreak Hotel.  Room:  The room itself was clean and comfortable, though the bed was a little hard and the fan in the bathroom (which turned on with the lights) was deafening.Staff:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They are not allowed to show you the themed rooms unless you book one (to the tune of $300-$500) but they keep a binder full of photos at the front desk to satisfy one's curiosity.  It's definitely worth a look.  Also, if you stay in a themed room please be sure to tip your cleaning person; someone has to clean all those mirrors and polish all that gold-coated awesomeness every day!Pool:  The heart-shaped pool is a must-see.  Unfortunately I couldn't find an overhead view of the pool (our room was on the opposite side of the building) but I still got some fun pictures from the patio.  If you like pictures that are not full of other people sneak over to the pool in the morning just before its closed for cleaning (~9am) while everyone else is eating breakfast. Breakfast:  Get there early!  We were at the buffet at 9am and a lot of items were gone and were not replenished.  It's your standard cereal, juice, coffee, and bagel breakfast.  Also, it's a zoo; even on a weekday the line was long and people were sort of pushy.  I know it was ""free"" food but I would have been happier and more relaxed grabbing a bagel and coffee down the road for a few bucks.  (If the Elvis footage shown at night in the dining area were shown at breakfast I may feel differently.)Gift Shop:  Pretty decent for the area.  I found some postcards here (specifically Santa Elvis) and some TCB bottle opener magnets here that I didn't see at any other gift shop.Location:  You can easily walk to Graceland from here.  If you want a picture at the gates be sure to walk over in the evening after the tours have stopped (the gates seemed to be open all day when tours were going on); there will be fewer people and you can photograph the gates in full without getting run over by a shuttle bus. :)Most of the rooms are pretty much nondescript. It is only the themed rooms that go full-on into Elvis kitsch. Those regular rooms and suites and pretty reasonably priced, tidy and just fine. Do NOT accept room 214, however. Not only is it designed for handicapped visitors, which means rather ugly linoleum in the entrance rather than carpet (not sure how that's supposed to help the disabled), the room's sole window looks out on the INTERIOR of the hotel, directly into the ""Jungle Room"" (which is just a glorified cafeteria/bar). We initially had this horrible room, but when we asked to be moved, the staff was courteous and gracious about it. The complimentary breakfast deserves no compliment. The coffee, although dark in color, doesn't even taste like coffee (and no, it's not chicory, either). I mean, if you want a bagel or cereal, it's okay, but if you're looking for something more substantial, head out. We decided that the ""sh*t on a shingle"" (creamed chip beef on a biscuit) may actually have been sh*t. But all in all, this is a fine place to stay. And if you're an Elvis fan (which I'm not, particularly), the themed rooms are cool. We attended a party in the Hollywood Suite, and it really was quite fun! Tacky and wacky, but thoroughly fun.I want to lower my rating.  The breakfast bar was typical but the tables were dirty and the late to show attendant did nothing to improve the situation.I haven't been this disappointed since Elvis died.  This heartbreak hotel is aptly named.  When my friends and I planned our trip to Graceland we decided to spend our money on immersing ourselves in an atmosphere of Elvis rather than spend money on individual activities.  We regret that choice.  The hotel delivered what they promised but with no enthusiasm.  The lobby is small and has a flat screen TV that doesn't match the decor.  The desk clerk is dressed in black.  But not the way you would expect.  There are no bell hops.  There is a space approximately 10 by 20 feet called the jungle room.  B o r I n g.   A continuous DVD of Elvis past concerts plays on a screen in a cafeteria area.  Unimpressive.  The heart shaped swimming pool which was closed isn't big enough for a dozen people.  Graceland is in walking distance to this and about thirty other hotels.  Pick one of them and save the money.  The hotel was clean.  There was a TV free WI fi fridge and coffee maker.  If you don't care of the theme this was a decent place.  If you think it will be part of your experience you will be disappointed.This place cracks me up and I don't even know how many times I've stayed here while in Memphis. I've been to Graceland A LOT. Life is cruel in that each time I've been here it's been too chilly out to swim in the heart shaped pool. Graceland is right across the street and they have really awesome packages at this hotel that include room, tours and meals at restaurants downtown. I LOVE the 24/7 Elvis channel you get in all the rooms. Who doesn't want to watch King Creole as they drift off to sleep? Rooms are clean and fun and some rooms are Elvis themed to the extreme - those room are ridiculously priced though. I have a feeling that I will be here again.Ok...this place is HILARIOUS!  It's right across the street from Graceland for all you people who are wanting to check out Elvis's jungle room at the house. lolThe rooms are all different and Elvis themed, complete with memorabilia of the era. There are regular guestrooms and then there are the themed rooms...you can stay in a mini replica of Granceland lol.  Also an art deco themed room and a Burning Love room...a hunka hunka lol. Rooms from $99 and themed rooms from $520...ouch!The staff can hook you up with tix to visit the King's abode as well as tix to tour his plane, the Lisa-Marie.  Good times.Our hearts were broken and so were our wallets when we stayed here on 03/07/12. We had made reservations and requested two beds and a pull out sofa or rollaway. When we arrived we were given a room with two beds but no rollaway or pull out sofa. We returned to the front desk, explained the problem and the manager assigned us to another room. It had one bed and a pull out. We again went to the front desk and the personable attendant on on duty nicely told us that the hotel had no such rooms and that the reservation office will say anything to book the reservation. We kept the first room with the two beds and sofa that did NOT pulll out. We had no car and it was late. We shared our room with bugs crawling on the wall, soap scum under the soap dish in the shower and mold, mold and more mold. The sheets were paper thin, the rug was peeling from the wall border and the room looked liked it hadn't been spruced up since the hotel was built. We took a chance and ate in the bar. The food was edible and the person on duty informed us that we were in an unsafe neighborhood and not to venture outside until after the sun rose the next morning. We checked out as quickly as we could, toured Graceland and departed for the airport. We were disappointed with the whole experience and felt ripped off. I'm sure that if Elvis were still alive he would not allow his fans to be ripped off by such a dump!!!",,,"['staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'great', 'location', 'visit', 'home', 'hotel', 'outdated',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-memphis,DoubleTree,3.0,$$,44,"So far from everything we wanted to do in Memphis.  No ""pantry""  Otherwise we enjoyed ourselves.It's quite average, although some of the rooms are upgraded and renovated.  However, as a frequent business traveler, the LOW SPEED WIFI is just sad.  I think my  1200 baud modem might have been faster than this WIFI set up.  I'd say that they need to clean the place a bit more and improve the infrastructure some more and I'd give it 4 stars.  Typical Hilton property, minus the items mentioned above.I had a pleasant stay at this location as a group of 30. We were greeted with a smile and the check-in went quickly. Unfortunately, several of our rooms still weren't clean at 4:30 but that was only 2 of 16. The rooms and lobby were in good shape and must have been renovated in the last year or two. Reasonably clean and well kept, the help staff did a good job cleaning each morning. The workout room was decent as well. Free-weights up to 45/50 lbs and several treadmills. In the surrounding (walking distance) there are numerous eating choices, grocery stores, and a movie theater immediately behind the hotel.I travel for a living, and I can't recommend a better place to stay in Memphis than this Doubletree Hotel.The hotel is recently remodeled.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful, from the front desk to the on-site restaurant to the service people, everyone is professional and a pleasure to do business with.I wish the same hotel and people were coming with me to my next work location!Newly renovated with super nice accommodating staff. Hotel is reasonably priced, in a nice neighborhood with a bunch of dining option even within walking distance. everything in the room was new and well-kept. The business center and concierge lounge was also updated and everything was functioning.New day at the Doubletree - give them a try!I travel for work, this double tree is easily one of my favorites list. The staff is always pleasant, there are a handful of restaurants in the area, grocery stores within walking distance, nail salons also near by- check out Diva's around the corner of you're interested. The rooms are nicely remodeled, always clean &amp; every room I've ever stayed in has had a fridge.This is the filthiest Hilton property I have ever seen. I am shocked that anyone would spend more than one night here. I would never return. I will recommend others seek alternate accommodations. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I have written Hilton (as well as my company, to never send me here again).Dirty bedding, faulty cooling/heating units, broken bathroom sink, smelled of straight mold.Bad bad bad.And the staff was cordial ...when addressed first :/Pretty entrance that went down hill from there.  The bathroom was on an angle and you couldn't even go to the bathroom sitting straight.  It was filthy and nasty.  My first room had pubic hair all over the toilet so I changed rooms and my second room wasn't vacuumed.  The third room was pretty close to the second room - errant hair and sticky surfaces.  Kinda grossed out.Nice staff, but the location is FAR from downtown, the airport and any other attractions I was interested in. Oh and no free breakfast. If you don't mind driving 10 miles to anywhere go for it. I would consider this hotel again if the price is right but Zi may bite the bullet and stay downtown.I will say this.....I received a email from the manager AFTER I booked my room to notify me of upcoming construction in the hotel....ya know jack hammering! Fair warning!My closet door wouldnt close either but no huge biggie....not enough to make a maintenance call over.Not the nicest hotel, but passable. The primary issue with this hotel is that it's run down. The walls are all dinged up and could use an extra coat of paint. The carpet is messed up in places. Also the bathroom tile just looked raggedy and could stand to be redone. Thankfully, the bed did not appear to suffer the same issues as the rest of the room. It was relatively comfortable and seemed clean. The rooms also have a fairly nice flat screen TV.  The staff here is also incredibly nice and helpful.  They give you cookies when you check in! And the restaurant in the lobby is decent.  So overall, if you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel to stay in for a night or two, this isn't a bad option. But certainly don't go our of your way to come here.If I could give them 0 stars I would. Our keys would not open our door we were sent to a concierge room at 1:30am to wait until maintenance arrived at 6 am. Awful first experience at a Double TreeNice rooms, great business center, no free breakfast, no jacuzzi but they do have a pool and fitness center.  Slow service but overall I had a nice stay.Nothing on Internet about construction happening. As a Diamond member no thank you from front desk staff, no water or cookie. Place is old and it shows, had to keep AC on 63 just to stay cool. TV went in and out all the time during my stay. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and professional, front desk staff could take lessons from them. Had booked another night on my return from a business trip but cancelled and won't stay here again.Doubletree hotels are supposed to be really nice, but the rooms at this location are dingy and could use an upgrade. I do like how a fridge is provided, but it would also be nice to provide a microwave as well. There is no Hilton Honors lounge for Hilton diamond members here.The first time I stayed, the mirrored door for the closet had been shattered a little in the bottom corner. I explained to the hotel that I didn't cause the damage (so they didn't charge me), but it would've been nice if they had cleaned up the bits of broken glass. The second time I stayed, the freezer section of the fridge was dirty with remnants of who knows what had leaked from a previous guest. Both times I have stayed, the room is an interesting setup. You walk in, the bathroom and small counter (with fridge underneath) are to your left, you go around the corner, and then you'll see the desk/bed. The rooms are spacious, which is nice. The front desk staff have always been courteous. There's free parking. Due to status, I am not sure if everyone gets free wifi, but I didn't have trouble connecting (like I did at the Austin location). There are no outlets near the bed though.I do like the Hilton honors program because you can double dip. You can earn miles and hotel points simultaneously, unlike Marriott Rewards. I rated this hotel two stars (experienced better) for cleanliness. Attention to further detail would be much appreciated!We stayed here while attending a MU game in Oxford at Ole Miss. The price was reasonable considering we could not get a hotel room in Oxford; however, price alone could not make up for what seemed to be a 2 star hotel. Our room was noisy, we never could figure out what one of the noises was, but the other one was definitely the trash trucks. We did not have shampoo in our room and I waited 20 minutes after I was ready for my shower for them to bring some to our room.  I thought the pillows could have been better quality. We asked for water several times and as Hilton Honors member, that should have been given to us without question. We did not receive a receipt upon checkout and had to ask for one to be emailed to us. All in all, we will not be returning.Worst Hilton experience ever - NASTY!I was forced to stay here by Delta due to cancellation...Their shuttle quit at 10 PM - of course...Little did I know it would be a $30 cab ride from airport which then doubles when you go back.They do not staff for the travel disrupted travelers - so check in was OVER ONE HOUR in line - not the one lady on staffs fault as whe was nice.MY ROOM REEKED of stale smoke though it was non-smoking.  The picture by the bed had cracked glass...the light swith on the lamp was broken and the bathroom had mold on the grout.GROSS!  ROTTEN!  NASTY!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS...and they advertise they are remodeling and I think it is a ploy because no sign of it in room 224 and viciintyThere are better hotels to stay in the same area. I normally stay at another Hilton-brand down the street but when they were booked full I came here. It's outdated. The carpet is seriously stained. There is rust on the bathroom faucet. Overall the room is a solid 2.5 out of 5.... This needs a serious upgrade. I won't be coming here again and will actually be checking out a day early to move to another hotel. Pros: Fox and Hound is next door. Free parking. Ultimately - go someplace else until it's updated.And now for something completely different, somebody not totally hating on this hotel. I stayed on the 4th floor, as I don't have enough HHonors points to get bumped up to the HHonors floors but still had a fairly nice room.Yes, the hotel has been there for probably 20 to 30 years, but the air conditioning worked, the flat screen TV worked, the WiFi worked, lighting was good, the shower was hot, the furniture was fairly new, the bed was comfortable, and of course you got a cookie at check-in. Some things in my room looked a little worn (the fridge, for example) but most of the room looked recently refurbished. It was a comfortable stay, it's close to the airport, the rate was reasonable, and there's a ton of places to eat nearby.I'll call that a road-trip win.I've stayed in so many Hilton properties on business that I've lost track.  This has got to be the worst Double Tree in the country.  The rooms are so incredibly outdated that I had to laugh when I walked in the door.  We're talking old, dirty bathrooms, popcorn cielings, pealing wall paper, nasty curtains and valences, and the slowest airport shuttle ever.  Couple that with very uneven guest service, and you've got a lousy Hilton property.My favorite low point for this hotel was the manager's Hilton Honors reception that all Double Trees and Embassy Suites have during evening check-in hours.  Completely out of every single piece of complimentary food, a nasty mess on tables, and cash bar.  The only Double Tree I've ever been in that doesn't have complimentary house wine and beer.  Not to mention it's in an odd, converted room on the 8th floor.If it weren't for a comfortable bed and a decent hot breakfast, this would be one-star.Let me start by saying it has been 4 days since staying at this Hotel and I still have a rash under my arms and other unmentionable places.When I arrived I was told they were sold out, even though I booked a room 2 weeks ago. So, they gave me the mini suite...which you would think is a good thing??WRONG!The room was gross. Towels were gross. Bed and couch were gross. I felt icky and should have listened to my inner voice who kept telling me to get another room. Walls were yellow....food behind the couch (I had to move couch to plug in my cell phone) and no outlets near bed to charge phone. I have stayed at this hotel before (Hilton Honors Member) as I travel to Memphis quite a bit...and I have never had such a poor exp!Not 2 days later I noticed that I have a rash under my arms and in other places....Now, I have not been in any other hotels and I have not put myself in any other situations where I would contract a rash so I have to assume it is from this hotel room and towels. Again, after looking at towels I should have listened to my inner voice but I didn't and now I am paying the price.I will continue to use the Hilton Brand as I am a long time Hilton Honors Member but I will NEVER use this DoubleTree again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Decent hotel with spacious rooms and flat screen tv.  Pros:  Friendly staff!! Perfect example of true southern hospitality.  Love it.  At check in, the hotel staff gave me two breakfast vouchers for free.  Say what?! ;-)Two warm chocolate chip cookies are handed to you as you are checked in.  Mmmmmmmm...HHONORS Floors are on 6-8.  Clean rooms.  Clean bathroomsCONS:  water pressure is non existent. Boo. There is a train track near by.  I am a light sleeper and I was jerked awake when the horn sounded.  0_oNo creamer for coffee?? -__- black sugary coffee will have to do. Wolfgang coffee for the room is a PRO though. Decent place to stay.  I am on my way to Texas from NC and have been in the car for way too long.  I think I'd sleep anywhere...JUst wished for a hotter shower.  Fail.Great room and very attentive staff. Sam in the Concierge Lounge was amazing. The Salmon BLT was a great sandwich for the night we didnt go out.Save your time and money and don't stay here unless and emergency. Not worth the $110 we paid. Customer service at front desk was horrible coming and going. Worn down, beds were not comfortable. Totally disappointed.  Management needs to come in here and do an undercover boss for real!I really can't say anything negative.This is a pretty nice hotel and the staff is friendly enough.The room was clean and smelled fresh.The bathroom is another story. There were cracked tiles, the bathtub wall felt like it was going to fall off.IT is close to a lot of stuff and some really good food places.Undergoing major renovations. This hotel should not be open right now. Obnoxious construction noise. Room was never cleaned . Would never stay here again as...Let me start by stating that I'm a loyal Hilton Honors member and almost always choose the Hilton brand to stay at when I travel. I went to Memphis this past weekend for a wedding and had the WORST experience at this Doubletree. And I wasn't alone as many of the other wedding guests said the same thing. Let's start with the little good that there was: - The woman who checked us in was friendly and nice- We were able to check in early- The gentleman that drove the shuttle back to the airport was extremely friendlyNow the bad (we'll get to the ugly...): - Our TV didn't work. It would turn on and the picture would randomly just fade away and turn off- The construction is obnoxious- The service was inconsistent. Half the staff was nice (see above) and half were clueless and unhelpful- Hilton Honors floors are 6,7,8 and yet we were on 2?- The wifi was weak.The ugly: - Our bathroom, as well as another couple we were traveling with, was DISGUSTING. We asked them to clean it again and it was still gross. - Our friends tried to take the shuttle (after we scheduled it to pick them up) and it was 40 minutes late and then REFUSED to pick them up. So they had to cab it back to the hotel. The woman at the desk was woefully unhelpful in rectifying the situation. I would never stay here again and would recommend others find another hotel to stay at as well.This is a nice hotel and I love the cookies.  The room was clean and the staff was friendly.  I presented in the hotel as well and the accommodations were great.Clean, spacious rooms, comfortable beds and a decent small gym.  Service is friendly, free parking, and by far above the average ~ especially for a hotel that is used a lot by corporate management.  The cookies are a nice touch ~ always warm.  I did NOT try the attached resturaunt, it seemed a bit high priced and there were places close by (Corky's) that were better options.  All in all, a good, safe, quiet, comfortable place to call home for a few days.For me, it was just okay.  I read several of the Yelp reviews, but my decision to stay here was based on the following:a) priceb) no fee for parkingc) relatively close to airportd) i'd get Hilton Honors points and another stay towards HH statuse) yes, the cookie :)I didn't have a chance to take a look at the gym, but from the condition of my room and the other interiors of the hotel I wouldn't have imagined it to be pristeen. (But maybe I shouldn't prejudge...) But for 24 Hour Fitness members, there is a club not too far from this hotel. Cookie was good... like always. Warm and gooey this time... oooooh. Bed was comfortable, but I'm not still dreaming of it like other Yelpers have stated. Internet was SLOOOOWW! We're talking between 1mbps and 5mbps. Ouch! Very hard to catch up on my re-runs on Hulu. ha!Staff was friendly. Room was clean. Neighborhood was fine. Yes, per Pam A.'s review - -the AC was extremely loud in my room.A comfortable bed, a usable gym, and included Wi-Fi... What more could you ask for? Oh right, warm and gooey chocolate chip cookies upon check-in!Our room had a king-size bed, a work desk, a mini fridge, and a flat screen TV.  The people who work at the hotel were extremely nice and helpful with all requests.  There is a restaurant on site, but there are many places to eat within a few minutes drive (Corky's!).While the hotel is on the old side, there are enough amenities and upgrades to make the age a non-factor.  So, overall, this a great place to sleep, relax, work, and have a warm cookie!We stay at Memphis Doubletree on Sanderlin Ave almost exclusively. Because, 1. Most comfortable bed I have ever sleep on. 2. Very old hotel with nice facilities and free highspeed wireless internet  3. Great location for shopping and dinning. 4. Easy access to airport. The reason I didn't give it 5 star is because it is an old hotel need to be upgrade which they are doing right now. The carpet is very old and it smell funny at some room we stayed. The aircondition unit is loud and need to be replaced. They are in process upgrading their rooms these days. It will be a great hotel to stay after that, of course, they may raise price as well. Right now, weekend rate around 98, and regular goes to 120. If you stay at this hotel, check out restaurants at neighbor area. Such as: Pei Wei for lunch; Interim for after work drink; Dinner at Napa Cafe for wine drinkers; Belmont Grill the highly rated burger restaurant; Half Shell for Cajun cuisine; Looking for 5 stars dinning experience, Folk's Folly Prime Steak house and Erling Jensen Restaurant is nearby. And the famous Corky's BBQ is 3 minutes away by car. If you visit Memphis and your burget fit in this range, consider this hotel to rest your feet. :)The bar service was less than professional. I met a friend there for a couple of drinks. After last call, the employees complained about how ready they were to get out of there and go home. If your employees can't wait to leave, why would I want to be there? I would say a bar rescue is in order.I'm pretty impressed and pleasantly surprised, not going to lie. I'm on a tour for Peeps and we are going to 9 different cities, and we have to stay on a budget, so to make up for going way over in certain cities, I decided to really go cheap in Memphis. The price was fantastic, and so of course I was nervous it was going to suck. Nope! Not at all!Free cookie and amenity bag for HHonors members on check in, and they also have a free reception with hor d'vours [I have no idea how to spell that and neither does my spell check] and a cash bar [but free soda!!] The room is big, as to be expected for anywhere not New York or Boston, the beds are way more comfortable than the Hilton Garden Inns I've been staying at, cool looking amenities, a nice pool I can't use since I'll be working for 17 hours a day, and a fridge! No microwave, though, bummer, but the location is awesome. TONS of shops nearby including Krogers and Whole Foods. Free parking and free wifi doesn't hurt either.Mostly, I'm happy because I've been warned many many times about how....""urban"" Memphis can be and this area so far seems really safe and nice.I was in Memphis for a conference and we stayed at the Doubletree as the other conference hotels were booked.The room was only slightly under my standards. The air conditioning was really loud, and we were unimpressed with some of the construction. BUT! There was free wireless internet and free parking, and a business center with free printing. I was most disappointed in the gym. On the confirmation e-mail there was information to ""Experience our fitness facilities by Precor"". I checked out the website and the pictures looked awesome. I went to my first workout and entered what looked like to be an old hotel room. Once you're on the treadmill, your head is about 6-12 inches away from the lay-in tile ceiling. There were only 2 (maybe 3?) treadmills, an elliptical, and two bikes. At one point we had 5 people in the gym and it was hot, sweaty, crowded... you get the picture. So if a gym is important to you, this is not your location.Fairly good hotel for your stay in Memphis!I stayed here for 5 nights.  I slept great, got 5 free breakfast.  Quiet, free parking, close to many food joints.I checked in 11/27/11 at about 2:00pm, by 2:30 I heard the fire alarm go off in my room and immediately smelled fumes strongly. I called to the front desk to report while the alarm was going off, the clerk said she would send someone up immediately, no one ever arrived, I called back downstairs and asked to speak to a manager, after a long wait the ""restaurant manager"" gets on the phone. I hung up on him and checked out, telling them why on the way out.  They were not in the least concerned about my fumes or smoke alarm nor were they sending anyone up.  This is a high rise hotel, I mean really......Needs refurbishment.  Cracked tiles, panels  loose in elevators, sloped beds, dirty drapes, ill fitting room doors and marginal desk staff.  04:15 train near by, so beware.  No outlets near where needed for standard business traveler devices, ie desktop, bedside, etc.  basically an older property showing age.  Though I am a loyal HIlton Honors gold member, I'd choose a different brand rather than stay here again.I love the location of this property.  There's a Whole Foods right down the street (which I often visit when traveling) and a restaurant in the same parking lot which was open until 3AM &amp; came in handy since I arrived after midnight. Other pluses are close to the airport &amp; free Wi-Fi &amp; parking.  The rooms are okay, a bit dated, but clean.  The only big negative, was that I woke up to the housekeepers yelling down the hall to each other, which then happened several more times throughout the morning.  Since I got very little sleep, this was disappointing.VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I have stayed here before and at that time I would have given 4 stars. I am barely giving one star. The first day I had to show the maid that there the person before us in the room left smeared candy on the desk. The next day the maid never came in the room so I had to go downstairs for towles after coming upstairs ready to shower after my work meeting  which was fine but of course inconvenient. OK so the next day the maid came and made the beds that is ALL , never cleaned the bathtub, dirty glasses stayed on the counter, and most of all gave us wet towels to use for a shower. I will not stay here again.It was fine. It's odd though, some parts of the room were up-to-date and modern (TV and bed) but then other parts seem to be too outdated (AC unit, phone didn't work, water pressure in the shower was weak). All that being said, I slept fine and the staff was really friendly, so I'd probably stay there again.","Hotel have nice amenities and is pretty. But the cleaning room services is horrible. I booked two rooms for my family and my parents. Both were not clean. My one had lots hair in the bathroom floor. I found two straws plastic wraps, one in the bathroom, another in close to the bed. This is distisgusting!!! There was a shirt on the floor, probably from the previous guest... But the worst was to see a yellow/brown stain in the toilet that you can imagine where it came from... I cleaned it with toilet paper easily and I could not tell my family about it because I fear they would like to leave the hotel. So I do not recomend this hotel to anyone.Was in Memphis for Business and stayed at this Double Tree.  Overall this Double Tree is a nice and well kept up hotel.  Parking can be a little tight but there is enough here that you shouldn't have problems finding a spot.  One of the nice things about this Double Tree is that there are several places to eat at that are within walking distance if you decide to pass on Cal's Championship Steakhouse that is part of the hotel.The place is kept up nicely.  Everything seemed like it was clean and in good condition.  Some of the extra's they have here is a nice business center (about 3 computers, 1 laser printer, &amp; fax), several conference rooms, an indoor pool that look nice, and a gym (though the gym was out of order during my time here but I give them credit for converting 2 rooms into a mini gym).  They also offer Free WiFi and Cable TV with HBO.I had to stay here a couple of times so I got 2 different rooms.  I was able to book one of the business rooms that came with a King Size Bed, a Desk Working Area, a mini Frig, and decent size bathroom.  Both the sink and the shower were in the same room and the mini frig had it's own little counter complete with a coffee machine.The bed was comfortable and the pillows was nice.  Service here was friendly and I have to say, those chocolate chip cookies they give you are great.Overall I would stay here again.  I paid about $99 but the taxes here are pretty steep because you got a room tax, sales tax, and a county tax on top of that, so expect to pay about another 15% on top of everything.  But overall, it was a good stay and would recommend staying here.I stayed at the Doubletree on Sanderlin when I was in Memphis for a conference in May 2010.  The hotel is located in east Memphis which is a nice, safe area with plenty of great restaurants.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Parking is free and that's always a plus.  I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and evening happy hour in the 8th floor concierge lounge.  I would definitely stay here again.  I highly recommend this hotel for folks who are visiting Memphis on vacaction.  The hotel is only a ten minute drive or so to the downtown attractions, the Liberty Bowl, Sun Studio, and Beale Street.i was here in 2006 for a work related trip.  i still think about how comfortable that bed was.and the cookies were an extra bonus.friendly staff.  southern hospitality.and that bed.  dang.  that bed.",,,"['far', 'everything', 'wanted', 'pantry', 'otherwise', 'enjoyed', 'quite',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-by-marriott-memphis-5,Courtyard by Marriott,3.5,$$,36,"This is rated as a three star hotel but it's in better shape and more convenient and cleaner than the four star properties I've stayed at in Memphis. Better than its $200 price would suggest. Blows doors on Doubletree room I stayed in a few weeks ago Jayant blocks away. Rooms clean and recently decorated. Downstairs public areas have food and coffee options missing from competitors. I also like the way this and three other hotels share an enclosed motor court off the public street. We rolled in at midnight and when we got out of the car we were on semi enclosed. hotel property so didn't worry about getting stabbed. I have an aversion to undeserved stabbings. Also valet is only 18 per night and the garage is nicer than the ones down by Beale St. So yeahThis is a bad place to stay!  The rooms are fine, but from the attitude at the valet stand, and then to charge me $20 for your attitude, no thank you. Next, no coffee in the lobby- every courtyard I've ever started in has free coffee, in the lobby, in the mornings...but not here!  I was told""This is Memphis"".  Really, well this is a really good customer, platinum and gold level for as long as I can remember, telling you that it's coffee. Rooms are ok, but this isn't a 5 star Ritz or Four Seasons. The front desk people seemed nice and do their job well, but this hotel gives the impression they're too busy.  Seriously, isn't that the job- serving customers?  What irritates me most is I burned to certificates to stay here- because of its category- don't waste your time, it isn't that great. Pay more and stay at the Peabody, where at least you're treated with respect- which is also where you'll find me and my money next time I'm in town. And Aisha in valet should be fired for speaking to customers that way.Immediate problems with our room. For the price it wasn't worth the problems! We travel frequently and were in town for wedding, with plenty of our party staying here.-hair found right away on the toilet seat: gross.-trying to use the outlets and finding them to be faulty and shorted out by the bed: not trying to die in a fire.-the exposed wires falling out of the phone jack by the bed, also: not trying to die in a fire or get electrocuted.-fridge did not get cold the entire time, maxed out on the setting.-shower seal was false and leaky.  End of rant, but I expect more from a Marriott. Also, valet was incompetent and stained the drivers side carpet and refused to admit any knowledge of it.3.5Memphis, your hotels are not cheap. Between Nashville and Memphis, visitors to the Volunteer State might need to start packing tents! I was visiting Memphis for work and this hotel was the best blend of location, price and comfort. Don't be put off by the 3.5: this is a perfectly fine place to lay your head for a couple of nights. With a few changes, I would wholeheartedly come here without reservation.Pluses: the staff with whom I interacted were all Grade A. From the valet to the desk staff to the cleaning staff, everyone was friendly, approachable and engaged in making my stay as pleasurable as possible. It sounds like such should be second nature for hotels but when you travel enough, you begin to see that this isn't the norm and should be called out for commendation. My room (601) is one that I'd ask for. It was huge. It was a corner room that wrapped around the side of the building and had a terrace! Despite the weather (it could have been warmer), I, gladly, walked outside, sat on the chair and looked out and below at the life on the trolley line. Beale Street is only a quick walk away and there are plenty of sights to take in close to the doorstep. I enjoyed the view greatly.My king bed was comfortable but it did come with those small pillows people speak of in other reviews. Luckily for me, I don't have a big head so it didn't bother me that much. The bathroom is a good size but not very modern. I'd say it's comfortably mid-90s in amenities and appearance. Nothing offensive but you might be left wanting more. I felt the same way about the carpet. I try not to think about *some* things while in hotel rooms. The carpet is one of those things. Again, the appearance suggested a time gone by and, for me, that suggests things living in it. That might not be fair but it's a trigger. I'd imagine it's a trigger for others as well.Back to the positives, the work desk was quite generous in size and the cherry wood helped make me feel productive. After a workout one morning, I wasn't left with much time to hunt for lunch and was left going to a cooler of sorts to pick up a sandwich rather than getting something from the on-site restaurant. Not a huge thing, but nothing that helps earns a full four stars. This Courtyard has a lot of good things going for it and given the location and cost, it probably is one of the better bets in the area. There's some room for improvement but I don't think you'd dislike your stay.Unfortunately this hotel helps buttress the Memphis reputation for rude and indifferent service. No one ever smiled or even bothered to look us in the eye. Saturday morning we went downstairs for a cup of coffee, where a woman behind the counter could only briefly turn around and look at us as we offered a cheery 'good morning'.  With not so much as a grunt, she turned back around until we just gave up and walked 2 blocks for coffee.   This is only one example of indifferent service, there were three or four others. The room was as one would expect for a nice business travel accommodations.   Great location, on the bus/trolley line, etc   But if you like being treated like an appreciated guest - this hotel is not for you. It's worth mentioning that I am a Platinum level customer with Marriott. I shutter to think how they treat infrequent travelers.We stayed here for a wedding, and it was a very nice experience. The room was absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the furniture choices. I need to get one of those giant beds for myself...I was also a fan of the spacious walk in showers. The employees we interacted with were very nice as well.This hotel caters to the male travelers.  How do I know this?  Simple.  The hair dryers.  This bathrooms in this new and otherwise well appointed hotel have the most horrible, outdated, weak hair dryers that took a good 25 minutes to blow dry my hair.  As any woman would tell you, this is not cool.Other than that, the room was, for the most part, comfortable and large, with reasonably fast free internet.  The only other downside to the space was the pillow situation (see picture).  For a king sized bed, they provided only four teensy tiny square pillows - I've never seen anything like it.Hotel staff were friendly, meeting spaces were serviced promptly, and food served on site was reasonably good.  The location was convenient for most of the downtown area, and almost anything in the tourist-y area was a safe and quick walk away.  The valet parking was well staffed, and we never had to wait long for our car.I wouldn't object to staying again, but I'd bring my own hair dryer.My second time staying here!!! Nice, great customer service, and great balcony views. I would stay again if in the area!Ok, we asked 6 months ago for 2 rooms adjoining but we are on separate floors - even though we are Elite status customers!I was having a resonably nice time on a business trip until I was walking into the bathroom and saw a good 1"" black fat cockroach go skidding across the floor.  I stopped at the front desk while rushing to my next meeing, I said, ""I'll be back in about an hour, then I want to know what you would like to do to fix this situation.""  While I was away, shift changed and previous shift left no mention of my issue.  Luckily, front desk got me a new room on the same floor -- really annoying to have to move, but stay away from 520 -- unless you like big black cockroaches... (shudder)  Skip the food at the bar.  Depending on the bartender a single can be a double... ;-)We had bed bugs in our room. Need I say more? We were told by the manager and I quote "" they were brought in by foreigners two days ago"" Their solution to the bugs getting into our luggage was an offer to put our clothes into the hotel dryer. The heat might kill them. When Marriott front office manager L. Davis was contacted she suggested we had mosiquto bites so prevalent in Memphis. I have a picture of the bed bug my friend found crawling on her and that I squished with the hotel key card folder. Don't stay here!My wife and I checked into the Courtyard Marriott on June 22 to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. We had a king balcony suite, but they must have upgraded us to a 2nd floor corner balcony suite on the corner of Main and Jefferson. So far, so good. When we entered the room, I noticed a large dark stain on the carpeting. Things take a downturn. My wife found a dirty sock under the bed.Then, since I'm in the IT business, I checked their Internet speed and found that I could use the free Internet, or for for $5.00/day I could get higher speed Internet suitable for streaming video. I was already paying $264/night, but I registered for it. I left my phone on free Internet. I checked their ""high speed"" connection, and found it was barely 1 Mbps. I went down to the desk to inform them of this. They told me to go back to the room and call the desk and they would connect me to tech support. When I talked to tech support they seemed a bit clueless to the point of asking me to clear my browser cache and try it. When I told them that had nothing to do with Internet speed, they said they would get it fixed. The next day it was still slow. Desk said they would delete the charge from my bill and promised to follow up getting it fixed. When we left four days later, it was still slow. There were two TV's in the room, one in the bedroom and one in the living area. The one in the living area flickered constantly, and was very annoying. The next day I told the desk about it, and they said they would have it replaced. That night I turned it on and nothing had changed. I called the desk and told them this. They said they would send someone up from engineering. He looked at it and said it was a problem with the set and they would replace. The next day it wasn't replaced. The day we checked out it hadn't been replaced. There is no full service restaurant or bar in this hotel, just an all purpose area they call The Bistro.There were some things that were good.  The curved balcony was nice for people watching, the room was large, and the bed was very comfortable. There was a fitness room on the same floor, two treadmills, an elliptical, free weights and a few machines. The machines were not very extensive, however, and I couldn't finish my usual workout. There is only one ice machine on the third floor. I would rate this hotel ""less than satisfactory,"" because of the price. I could tell the staff was frustrated because of the types of problems I had, and having their hands tied by corporate. Marriott Corporation has 15 hotels in the Memphis area. I'd advise them to have a rep stay in each hotel for a night on a regular basis to make sure that the prices they charge are worth it.I haven't stayed in a ton of different hotels in my time but this is definitely one of the best experiences I have had. Place is clean and staff is friendly. Great amenities. Had breakfast here every morning at a decent price. Love it! I hope I get to come back to Memphis one day and if I do I will definitely stay here. Thank you Courtyard!I stay at the Courtyard Marriott downtown Memphis for business. Now, I will say that the bedding in this hotel is great and the balcony rooms have a great view, and that I've had better experience in the past. That being said, I've always ran into at least one issue each time I've stayed. This particular stay, I had multiple.I couldn't change the TV channels using the numbers on the remote and the TV did not display channel information. So, no way to go to a particular channel and then I wouldn't even have a way to know what channel I'm on. This is frustrating when you are coming back from working long hours and trying to relax. I called down and 2 different folks came up to see what was going on. They brought replacement remotes but to their surprise, they didn't know the not being able to use the buttons thing was even an issue. ""You would think that with these flat screens that you should be able to change the channel, you know?""The toilet would randomly leak water every 15 minutes or so (flushes on its own). One of the guys that came up for the remote, replaced the seal for the flusher (excuse my layman's terms). However, instead of flushing on its own every 15 minutes, it turned into every 30 minutes. Awesome.Last thing for this trip, the shower door, when opened and close, makes a CRAZY loud squeal sound. It probably just needs some oil on the hinges. You would think that Housekeeping would have been annoyed enough by the sound when they are cleaning that they would have fixed it...This was all in room 624, which I would avoid if you plan to stay here.Me and some friends stayed here to have a fabulous Fourth of July weekend staycation. I was very impressed with the employees. Everyone we came in contact with was so friendly it was unbelievable. I almost didn't think i was in Memphis. The room was great. We had a king bed with a pull out couch, both pretty comfortable. There was even a mini fridge which to me is a necessity when you stay in a hotel. Second floor had a hot tub which made a fabulous ending to the night. Probably would have gave 5 stars if the hotel bar/cafe had more than one person working the station.We had a wonderful stay here! Friendly check in- valet parking was great as this is downtown so hard to find parking- we stayed in the part of the hotel that was annexed and super nice- comfortable bed - new hair dryers - quiet  and clean suite - walking distance to some great Barbecue - police patrol was everywhere so felt really safe - carriage rides will pick you up at the back doors and front desk will call them to reserve your carriage - fitness room was small but clean (televisions were broken on the treadmill and elliptical) -  free breakfast was hard to beat with a large variety for all my crew- free Wi- Fi - we will be staying here again when we come back :)This is a great place to stay for the most important reasons for me; it's clean and quiet. In fact, the entire place is immaculate. I had breakfast there and it was decent though the scrambled eggs were a little on the runny, slimy side. Customer service was neutral which to me is not good. The front desk staff was not friendly or helpful (get a job talking to boxes).  The only service I got was from one very friendly security guard (the other two were far from this and should be guarding boxes) who helped me with places to eat and use if their computer and printer. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the stay as the bill was more than I would be willing to pay.Don't know about the hotel but the ""bar"" was horrible!Nice hotel, well kept. The staff, especially at the front desk when we checked in, was exceptionally helpfulq and friendly. Room was really clean and well maintained. I recommend this hotel as a downtown stay especially if going to Beale St.So much nicer than the springhill suites which is old and worn. Bistro, laundry machines, hot tub. Room was light, renovated and clean. Will stay here every time over the springhlll suites.","The hotel is great. Rooms are adequate and the staff is really friendly.  However, this hotel has the worst pillows of any hotel I've ever used.  They are old and worn out.  The pillows are stuffed into the end of a pillow case and the case is folded inside itself to make them look bigger (see pic).  The carpets are dirty in many of the rooms.This is 1 of my favorite Marriott Courtyards in the USA.  It is the newest hotel in downtown Memphis at only 3 years old.  I have stayed at several full service hotels in Memphis and none will hold a candle to The Courtyard, for a discount hotel room it is more plush than the finer properties here, super clean, super state of the art, so open and welcoming.  Great taste on the decor and the lobby and bar area is massive in size.  Within walking distance of Beale Street and all the major places you want to visit while in Downtown Memphis.Very nice, clean and updated. The only thing is parking. You have to pay to park unless you park on the street which most people do. However for Platinum Marriott members at most places this is free. But not here. Also, we had to wait at the front desk for about 10 minutes before the employee came from the back to check us in. Not sure what she was doing.Stayed in Memphis for five weeks on a project as a guest of the Courtyard. It's relatively new and not in a terrible location, right on Main St and pretty easy walking distance to Beale St. and downtown restaurants. The negatives- the breakfast food is terrible, the crew is disorganized and they are frequently out of things. The walls are thin, and do NOT stay on the 8th (top) floor- the elevator mechanism is on the roof and the soundproofing sucks. Lastly, every room they gave me had something wrong with it- one, the curtains wouldn't close. Another- the shower door wouldn't close and showers would flood the bathroom, etc..... Then again, not sure what your other options would be in downtown Memphis unless you want to shell out the big $s for the Peabody.....I only write reviews on hotels at which I've had multiple stays and I base them primarily on location, cleanliness, value, and staff. I was not expecting such a pleasant experience at the courtyard. I was there for an extended stay (6 weeks) while I transitioned to Memphis. Value- compared to other hotels in the area, this is an outstanding value. Peabody is charming, but at 100 more (at least) per night, but with smaller older rooms, no comparison. The Westin is very nice, but valet parking is terrible, staff is not particularly friendly and it's at least 100 more per night Staff- so friendly it's almost a comical! Just nice relaxed and very friendly people!! There's more, but that's enough.We stayed here with several family members for a weekend wedding. The location is awesome, right on Courthouse Square with an easy walk to the river and to Beale St. The room was large and comfortable, the closet held both of our stuff, and the bathroom was fine, the shower powerful.Our only issues were with service. The front desk did fine, but they did not keep the self-service store very well stocked, and the service at the Bistro was abysmal. They had one cook and one counter person on duty no matter how busy it got, and the counter person was often overwhelmed. This made for long waits. Once we even gave up and went somewhere else for breakfast. The prices at the Bistro were also astronomical.The maid staff did not show up on our first day until nearly 5PM. (We had been gone touring in the city for most of the day, so there had been ample time to do our room.) At that point we were getting ready for the wedding, so we had to refuse maid service and sign off that we had done so. The furnishings and rug were showing their age. There was a light stain in the middle of the floor between the TV and the bed. All in all, an okay experience, but for $159 a night I would expect more.The hotel is the first one in Memphis to be built with Marriott's ""refreshing business"" concept. The spacious lobby has a full-service bistro that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plenty of space for sitting and working, and private booths with TVs that are equipped with laptop and iPod ports.The Courtyard also has a large workout room, guest laundry machines and a completely genius computer where guests can print their boarding passes for flights. There's also plenty of meeting space. There are two boardrooms, a large conference hall that holds 120, and a media room that's perfect for meetings (or movie screenings).The Courtyard has 131 guest rooms, all decorated with luxe furniture and muted colors. Some of the rooms have balconies, and all have ports to hook laptops, iPods and more to the TVs. Since Courtyard was designed with business travelers in mind, it's also got free wireless internet.The Courtyard is located directly across from Court Square in the center of downtown. It's about a 15 minute walk (or short trolley ride) to Beale Street, and a five minute walk to the Cook Convention Center.I take a road trip through Memphis once or twice a year...have always stayed in the Marriott just a few blocks away. Saw that this Courtyard opened up in late 2009, so we wanted to try it out...will NOT be going back to the regular Marriott. This Courtyard is AMAZING and reasonable.Do valet...it's only $3 more and you don't have to walk a block to get to your car. There is a quasi-Starbucks in their lobby, along with a limited selection of foods, but it's perfect for a business traveler or someone who is just staying the night.This will be my Memphis hotel for the foreseeable future!Absolutely would become one of your favorite hotel. I like the rooms atmosphere so much. Front desk is very welcoming and staffs were so kind. Breakfast is best too.I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It's in an excellent location, the staff is really friendly, and the beds are clean and super comfortable. The room was small, but well-designed. The only thing I wish is that they had continental breakfast. They do have a cafe there, but the food is not included with your stay. It didn't matter to me for the most part the weekend I was there, because a lot of the meals were already planned. But had I wanted breakfast, I would have had to pay on top of what I was already paying for the hotel. I did eat there one morning, and the food would have been good if it had been warmed all the way through. It took them forever to make the egg sandwiches we ordered because they forgot our order. Then I'm pretty sure they just heated pre-made sandwiches up in the microwave because the outsides were hot, but the insides were cold. Oh well, the coffee was good. I'd go back to this hotel despite my cold breakfast.The Courtyard is in a great location. With a plethora of options for dining and entertainment all within walking distance, you can valet your car and not pick it up until checkout. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. And the fitness center is top notch for a hotel this size and price. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all friends and family traveling to Memphis.Great rooms and fantastic location. Good service upon check-in. Definitely a place to stay if you are in downtown Memphis.I stayed here during a weekend trip to Memphis. It was great! It's right along the trolley line and just a short walk from Beale Street. I appreciated not being RIGHT on the busiest road in the city actually. It was quiet and the staff was friendly. It would be awesome if it had a pool but I won't hold that against the staff. There's a small cafe in the lobby that serves happy hour which we hit up when we first arrived. Not a huge selection, but convenient. All the staff we encountered were friendly and directed us to all the hot spots.Great service, nice rooms and a comfortable bed. I enjoyed our stay.Valet is a little slow but thats okTim C has a point re the activity of the staff and friends, which I onlydiscovered as I was leaving-at 4;45AM.  It was a little odd to see anon uniformed person come from the office when I inquired aboutmy reservation for a ride to the airport and there were two peopleusing the computers who were definitely not guests.  I mentionthis because on the other nights when i was up early, they hadone of THE BEST people I have EVER DEALT WITH workingthe graveyard shift: Jessica Brown.      I CANNOT say enough goodabout Jessica, because she BENT OVER BACKWARDS to help me---and it was JESSICA who clued me in to the factthat i could use the pool at the 2 doors down MarriottSpringhill Suites, as well as partake of the buffet breakfastoffered there.  MAYBE not everyone gets these 'perks'(Andthere were 2 hilarious earlymorning encounters with someone from Springhill who told me I could NOT but then within2 minutes, as I continued to use the pool, someone elseappeared and said YOU are more than welcome to usethe facilities.  I should also mention that Katherine whowas at the front desk when I arrived and Elesie whoworked in the pm were helpful, friendly and reallyfirst rate.   I also was 'amused' to see James Barton,the General Manager, looking somewhat 'harried'(as a GM should) come and go from his office andnot seem to mind that I insisted that Eleslie engagein conversation with me(knowledgeable aboutthe Hollywood scene which is always fun for me totalk about) and to have him say that Mr. Bartonis accessible, knowledgeable and I feel runsa good hotel. THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMSwith the area: the homeless folk  who lingeroutside are no more unsavory than those i encounter in LA, but the backdoor is not locked 24 hours,which means that some of these folk wander in andout, helping themselves to coffee, using the freecopy machines, etc.  HOWEVER, the factthat they have these available for the guestsis so great-the Business Center actually works (!)and the coffee is strong enough to send youout to Beale St. as if you were a marathon runner.The Bistro offerings looked tasty and theStarbucks staff was really friendly, but I wastoo worried about the calories to try thevery appetiziing looking lemon bars.   TheSpringHill Suites is undergoing rennovations-which maybe why I was allowed inside-I was theonly one using the pool (which is not heated but gave me an invigorating workout).The buffet breakfast was tasty and I had funtalking with Felicia, who did not say a wordwhen I helped myself for takeout......andthe great thing was that the police alsoenjoy early morning oatmeal and althoughi was not up to talking to them, it was justgreat to have them right alongside.The room was fine-apparently rooms in allhotels are not cleaned before mid-afternoon,but when i asked for towels, they arrived!I would have liked to have a tv guide re.the channels-but that is a petty complaint.Kerry C's review covers in far less words the itemsI may have missed.We had a wonderful weekend planned in Memphis including dinner and the Orpheum Theatre  for my daughters birthday. in route to downtown Memphis we were involved in a car crash, which scared us all to death. So we arrived late at the Courtyard down town. We parked as quickly as possible and went to check in, we were immediately assaulted in the lobby by a gentleman wanting to know where we parked, Did we park in the parking lot? That's for the SpringHill Suites he said (where i wish i had stayed by the way) so we needed to make a decision right then and there if we wanted to self-park or valet. I said ""Can i please just check in and then make a decision""? We went ahead and valet park since it was $18.00 and self-parking was $15.00. The lady at the check-in kiosk was not very friendly either. We hurriedly placed our belongings in our room and headed for our late dinner. After the show at the Orpheum we walked back to the hotel in the rain to find the front doors out of order, so we had to walk around to the back of the hotel in the rain to get in. I asked the person at the front desk what the problem was and stated they were trying to find a part. going to bed exhausted after a long day we were woken up this morning at 8:00 AM by a wake up call we didn't request. since i had been woken up i decided to go ahead and take a shower. after doing so i was going to dry my hair just to find out that either the blow dryer or the electrical socket is bad. So i thought i would ride the annoying elevator that has the lady that speaks to you and write this review. We are Marriott gold members and stay in allot of Marriott accommodations and this hotel does not measure up in many ways. If you are wanting to stay in downtown Memphis and want to stick with the Marriott brand, which i do stay at the Spring Hill just down the street. They will provide a breakfast with your stay where the Courtyard will not. If you are not in a hurry try to find a place on the street to park.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-memphis-primacy-parkway-memphis,Hyatt Place Memphis - Primacy Parkway,3.5,$$,31,"I used the Hyatt Place Primacy Parkway for all of my wedding block rooms. Hyatt was ideal for hosting wedding guests because the hotel has a free breakfast (standard hotel breakfast, nothing fancy), large lobby and gathering space, pool, and a 24/7 bar. Each room has a sitting room area with a couch that pulls out into a queen bed, so each room can accommodate additional people or people handing out. Each room also has a microwave and fridge. There was a free shuttle that operated from 7am-9pm in a five-mile radius, which includes lost of restaurants but not the airport.I found the rooms clean and spacious.  Moreover, my wedding guests loved the accommodations because they could hang out in rooms or the lobby and had a free breakfast every morning. They hotel and its guests are very chill, so we held after parties in the lobby and later in the rooms and no one complained (but some joined in!).Dealing with the sales staff was fine-  worked mostly with a very sweet lady named Tiffany. They were extremely polite and accommodating when I called, but they work only 7am-4pm on business days, so I found it hard to get them on the phone. I also had to follow up a few times to get updates on our hotel block and how many rooms we had left before the block closed and the hotel filled with people. (We got married the same weekend as the Southern Heritage Classic, so lots of people.) So they are not very proactive in working with you and identifying issues, but they are responsive if you voice an issue.Easy going. Booked it on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and had no hassle at the desk. Very friendly staff, even includes a downstairs mini bar but it's kinda expensive. Recommend  this place for sure though!Wow this place is a dump. A reviewer said a year ago that the rooms were under renovation? Maybe they haven't gotten to the 6th floor yet because aside from the 6 year old plasma in the room, this place is falling apart. The door looks about 20 years old and so does all the furniture and bedding. To top it off, it isn't clean. I found hairs in my bed upon arrival which just grosses me out. Not only will I never stay here again, I may never stay at another Hyatt Place. Absolutely disgusting.Excellent hotel!! Great service!! Awesome breakfast every morning!! Hyatt Place Brand is consistent!! It is tucked away between two other hotels across from the hospital.My wife and I booked a nights stay at the Hyatt place in Memphis on our way to Texas from Virginia. We have stayed at a many of hotels in our time but I must say for the price, this was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. The lobby is very inviting and the customer service was better than expected. The breakfast bar was good, the king bedroom was beautiful! We have all intentions on staying at this location whenever we are in the Memphis area!I was impressed with the room. Beautiful! Employees were super nice and helpful. Check in was a breeze. The fitness room is clean and has plenty of equipment. There was a business room, as well. The internet connection was terrific and free. There was a complimentary breakfast available. The room had a small refrigerator. There was a coffeemaker, too. There was plenty of parking.No problems at all with checkin. Clean, roomy, and up-to-date suites. Comfortable, clean beds. Modern, small bathrooms. The floor plan of the rooms are funky though with the bathroom, closet, and beds all scrunched into one half of the room, which made for a difficult time entering and exiting the bathroom. The breakfast is nice as well as the attendants, even at 6:00 in the morning.I had a great experience I was visiting here. I wasn't there for business, only  pleasure.  It was a lot of family reunions when I went so I thought it was going to be noisy but it was peaceful.  The rooms were really clean, the front desk was very professional when I went. I probably wouldn't go during the summer again because of so many family reunions it can get crowded in the day time and breakfast area.I stayed here last weekend, Friday and Saturday nights. We had a reservation for a room with two double sized beds and a sofa sleeper. We are three guys in our upper 50s and we're not great sleepers. When the three of us (guys on a trip to see Johnny Cash's boyhood home, the Sun Studio, Graceland) started the check-in process the desk told us they couldn't give us our room. They said they had to close down some rooms and couldn't give us a room. I told them we were very disappointed in them and asked them what they were going to do to fix this. They said they'd move us to another hotel in their chain. We were already out on the eastern edge of Memphis, as far from Beale Street and the places we wanted to visit on Saturday as we wanted to be. I told them this and they proceeded to explain that ""Memphis is a big circle"" and then suggested a hotel with the type of room we reserved. I said as long as it isn't east or south of here we'd probably be okay with it. I then got the ""Memphis is a big circle"" comment and assured we'd be ""closer to where you want to go."" The hotel they suggested was east and south of the Hyatt Place, definitely outside of ""the big circle""! I said this was unsatisfactory and after a few more clerks got involved they came back with a suggestion to move us to a room with one king sized bed and a sofa sleeper. They did agree to take 20% off the room rate. That was decent and probably what motivated us to agree to the move. That and the fact that it was now 6:30 pm and we were tired after the 450 mile dirve and wanted to close this deal and get some bbq.The room was nice enough but after the first night I'm convinced that some of us would have slept much better with separate beds. At least two of us are restless sleepers. The breakfast the next day held another surprise: no eggs of any kind! One of our group is on a gluten-free diet and depends on eggs to get his morning protein and to get something nourishing w/o it being pancakes, muffins, toast, bagels, etc.. Maybe our bad for assuming they'd have eggs but a place promising a full, hot breakfast ought to have eggs in my opinion. His protein option was peanut butter on a banana to go with his hot (non-instant envelope) oatmeal.The hotel was clean and other than the no eggs at breakfast the accommodations were as promised. However, the reservation of a certain type of room is fundamental. At the time I set up the reservation I did have the option to reserve the kind of room we were given. Even if the rate had been 20% less I wouldn't have reserved that room. My point is that the three separate beds was the point of our making that reservation and they failed to keep their end of the contract.On a side note, am I too picky in expecting an ice machine to be on every floor? This hotel has ice on every other floor so if you are not on first, third or fifth floors you have to take the slow elevator or the stairs to get your ice bucket filled. It would also be nice if the ice bucket liner was big enough to fit the ice bucket. And if you are going to provide real glasses and coffee cups for a room for three adults it would be nice to have at least three of each, not just two.Really nice and spacious hotel rooms. Free wifi, lounge area in the room with a large couch and ottoman. Large flat screen tv that is mounted and pivots. Working area with lots of outlets. The workout area is poorly equipped. That's why this doesn't get a 5 star. Free continental breakfast and parking. If you have a good company rate you can good a really good deal. Like $80. Hahaha.They do have dry cleaning service that picks up on the weekdays and coin laundry onsite if you needed.  The location is really good, on Germantown Pkway and TONS have food places to pick from.========================================================ok, so I came back to change it to a 5 star because IT IS THAT GOOD.  The service in this hotel is EXECELLENT!  I've been coming here for almost 3 months now on a weekly basis.  Try it out if you're a frequent traveler to this area.I've been in quite a few hotels. Never heard of not having room service. That's brand spanking new to me. The staff isn't too friendly. I called down and someone answered the phone saying "" yea"". Another time, I ordered food and received a call to pick up my food. When I answer the girl is like "" yo food done"". No greeting, just that. the rooms are decent. Nothing spectacular however I didn't really care bc I was there for business and didn't spend much time in the room. However if I was visiting I would've gone to a different hotel bc of service alone. I know all hyatts aren't like this but this one definitely sucks. Most if the women are bitchy but the men are pretty chill.40 year old single white male business travelerI stay at three hotels in the area, Hyatt Place, Courtyard and Hampton. The general quality and staffing are very similar. I will focus more on the differences. Pros: nice free breakfast, free coffee in the lobby in the morning, the free wifi speed is good enough to watch movies on Netflix. The pool area is visually great, but kind of public being right next to the street and parking lot. The wifi is very spotty in the pool area. Cons- no microwave in the room. Not sure why, since there is a space for it. Much like the other three, the ""restaurant/bar"" is really more of a glorified snack bar. This may not be a ""con"" for you, but for me; lots of kids at the pool. I stayed here three times and every time, the pool was packed with kids. The lobby was very slow, not a big social area. The shower only has one very small wire shelf. The soap falls through and you cannot keep soap, shampoo and conditioner all inside. I prefer hotels with a full restaurant and active social area, but overall, I do like the hotel and have never had a bad experience. For the price, I think it is a good value.Wonderful business atmosphere. I have had several occasions to stay in the Memphis neighborhood due to teaching duties and in my opinion this is the best available within the surrounding area. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and floor plan was convenient to work on data for the next days presentation.Popped in with no reservation after trying the same thing at another local Hyatt Place.  That one was in the middle of an office park and was full.  They sent us to this one, which looks like it was built yesterday.  (Google maps don't show the driveway yet, and keep wanting you to go to the end of the block and make a U-turn because they don't know there's a cut in the divider.)  It's in the middle of nowhere, but there will probably be an office park there soon.  Good amenities; if this was a downtown hi-rise, rooms would probably be well over $200.  (We got one for $89 a night.)Bed was nice, big TV right at the foot was nice (first REAL HD I've ever seen on a hotel TV).  The ""jack rack"" is very cool; you can plug ANYTHING in to the TV if you brought the right cable (VGA, HDMI, composite video, component video, mini-plug audio).  The Wi-Fi showed 15mbs download speed and 5mbs upload, way better than my cable internet at home.  There's an ethernet jack too, if you have a cable and don't want to use Wi-Fi.Room was big, everything was new and spotless, very nice shower.One-cup coffee maker, but it's a big cup and makes very good coffee.  The hot free breakfast is not spectacular, but it's pretty good stuff.  Staff were very nice and helpful.This is my first stay at a Hyatt Place, but I'll keep an eye out for them in future travels.  For the price of a typical motel, you get a pretty good imitation of a classy four-star hotel.  They've obviously studied the process and done their homework on these.  It's a smooth-running place.Oh, the location of this one is way out there.  A good half hour away from downtown and Beale street.  There are plenty of restaurants and shopping in the area, though.We had a pretty bad experience at this hotel. They put us right next to the ice machine, and it felt like a party of people walked by talking loudly to get ice like every 10 minutes (the ice getting was also loud). Those walls were thin, so it woke us up a lot. Since we were driving cross country (between Virginia and Dallas, TX) it would have been nice to have had a good night's sleep between the two legs of the trip, but c'est la vie. Oh and the A/C was this old fashioned, super loud, difficult to regulate system. When it was on it was super cold. When it was off it got super hot. The bed was okay, pillows were uncomfortable (so take your own if you're going to sleep there). Breakfast was acceptable.Pros: Clean, convenient location near shopping and restaurants, staff was friendly, reasonably priced, rooms had nice decor and a nice seating area, tv, microwave and fridge. Also had a small snack bar/case next to the check in desk for all your munchie needs. :)Cons: the bathroom or lack thereof!! I HATED that the sink and vanity was not behind closed doors. It was right across from the bed. So much for letting someone sleep in while you get ready! Also, if you're traveling with someone I hope your cool with them watching you pop pimples, floss, tweeze your eyebrows, get dressed etc. The toilet and shower are behind a closed door but you have to be totally in there to even close the door. Very small space. It also annoyed me that there were no hangers or even a place to hang clothes. Would be willing to stay there again IF I couldn't find something in the same price range nearby.Someday, when the machines take over the world, they will stay at the Hyatt Place Memphis Primacy Pkwy when they visit the grave-site of Robo-Elvis.Like so many others, I made my reservations here online.  I didn't need to actually talk to anyone made of flesh, when I had nice friendly pixels explaining prices, features, amenities, and everything else I needed to know.Upon entering the front lobby of this ultra-modern hotel, you are presented with a choice: check-in with a ""human"", or use the automated kiosk.  That's right, you don't need to deal with a line, just input your information and it spits out your room's key card.The room has the nicest integration of a computer to TV setup I've ever seen.  Component video, HDMI, VGA and stereo RCA cable hookups with an input selector right next to the TV.  Handy if you travel with your X-Box and the video game ""Robots"".Searching for my favorite ethanol, I stopped by the hotel bar for a drink.  Again, a automated kiosk allows you to place your drink order.  The same person that handles check-in can also take drink orders, tend bar, and serve food in the restaurant.  I'm pretty sure she wasn't human, but a series T-1001 series robot.  Either way, service did not seem to suffer.Despite the nice tech advances, the overall effect did not wow me.  The shower was sub-par, but I guess that in a hotel built for machines, the bathroom would be an afterthought.  The bed was pretty average, but not bad if you are planning on going into sleep mode for a limited period of time.What is nice, is that this hotel gives a glimpse of the hotel of the future.  A hotel for when the machines rule the world...... and we will......resistance is futile...This hotel is a great value. We were able to fit 2 adults and 5 kids in a standard double room. The breakfast is free and hot with eggs, sausage, and pancakes as well as other continental items. Free wi-fi made our teens happy and they offered Starbucks for purchase also.We stayed here for two nights during a recent vacation in Memphis. It turned out not to be central to anything we did on the trip except for the night we ate at Gus's fried chicken joint down the street, but we honestly didn't mind the 20-minute commute at each end of our days.The hotel staff were very friendly, but I almost wish I would have seen the automated kiosk MJD wrote about because I'm totally for minimizing human-human interaction in all situations up to and including reproduction.It may have been overpriced and might not have been a great selection, but I really appreciated the option to purchase freshly cooked food 24 hours a day. If you've traveled a lot on business you've found yourself dropped off in a hotel room with no transportation outside of ""normal"" eating hours. Usually your only option is to purchase snacks from a vending machine and cry quietly into your pillow, but here you can get something a little more substantial even if it's just a cheeseburger.The rooms were OK, but I thought it was dumb that the sofabed totally blocks the front door. When I worked out after the kids were asleep I had to climb on the bed going in and out of the room. Also to shut the bathroom door you have to get all the way inside the room on the other side of the toilet before the door will have enough clearance to close. Even with the gymnastics, ours was too warped to fully close, a fact I really appreciated when my non-privacy-respecting 4 yo boy kept walking in on me pooping.The exercise room was standard motel fare, but the night shift never had the towels stocked, a fact I never remembered until I was done working out and dripping with sweat.The breakfast was ok and the staff never stopped replenishing the items to be sure we all had access to the juices, toasts, english muffins, cereals and biscuits &amp; gravy.One other cool thing about the room that's been mentioned before: unlike the standard hotels that put locks on the TV to prevent you from watching your own stuff on it, this one had a panel with just about any kind of connection you could want including HDMI. We didn't bring anything this time, but usually we have some sort of portable media player and would have appreciated the ability to hook up to the big screen TV.I visited Memphis for a business conference that took place in this hotel. The hotel also had a special deal for the people who's attending the conference with the rate $90/night. I stayed here for 4 days / 3 nights. At first I got lost on finding the location of this hotel because I didn't believe such a nice hotel would be on some small road behind a giant strip mall. I called the hotel and they gladly assist me on finding their location.There's alot of parking space up in the front and I walk in and the same person whom I spoke on the phone with was there at the front desk greeting me. I asked to be checked in and gave them my ID and the print out confirmation. I was checked in really quick and ask if I have their membership. I said no and they went over the membership application and the benefits of being a Hyatt Gold Passport member. I took the application and they wrote down my room number in the card key slip.They also went over the layout on where to access the pool, the fitness room, the Internet area which is free, showing me the breakfast area and room service area. I took my stuff to the 2nd floor and went into my room. I did not expect a double to be that spacious. There's a whole giant living room with a dining table, working sink, coffee maker, a small mini fridge, L shape couch, and room for me to do exercise from the free TV channel teaching you yogas and stuff. The air condition was working very good because it was really, really cold in the room.The service is very good as the front desk person remembers my last name, maybe it's because I am one of the people registered for the conference and they know everyone that's in the conference. I had a good swim at the pool, it's a typical family friendly outdoor pool. There were some dead bugs in it but it wasn't too bad. The fitness area had a good amount of jogging machine and biking machine, some light weights, and a TV for you to view.The free breakfast in the morning is wonderful. It had some good hot food with good selection of cold food. Although there wasn't stuff like scramble eggs or bacons, but the grits with gravy was very filling. They brew Seattle's Best Coffee and had 3 different types (2 regular and 1 decaf), there's always someone to monitor and make sure to refill anything tha'ts out as there's alot of people eating the free breakfast every morning.The room service was very convinent as you could just order the food you want to get from a POS kiosk. You simply slide your room key to charge anything you order to your room and you could sit at the free Internet area and they will bring the food to you or bring it up to you. The Internet center is good as they use those remote login software wihch the computer would restart every 20 minutes so it would clear out any cookies that may have saved while you browse the Internet.One thing that I didn't like was that the hotel was very far from Memphis downtown, but it is right next to the one of the Galleria mall and it's surrounded by stores such as Target, Barnes and Noble, lots of different restaurants to choose from, etc.Over all I had a great pleasant experience with this hotel and particulary Hyatt chain. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's visiting Memphis to stay here, even if it's very far from the Memphis downtown, it's still a good place to stay as sometimes downtown is more expensive and pretty scary at night.","everything is okay just. worse than the hyatt place in OK.the staff did not give me basic info about fitness or parking or  breakfast when I check in. I had to ask later.the fitness center is not as well equipped as other hyatt.but, the location is nice and convenient for sure.On a recent road trip from Houston, TX to Columbus, Ohio we stayed at this Hyatt, twice. On the way up we had a decent experience, on the way back... not so much.The Good:Spacious rooms, huge tvs with decent channel selection, free wifi, near loads of restaurants and shopping, in what appears to be a decent neighborhood and cheap. They try a little too hard to be 'hip' and the service is just ok.The Bad:The included breakfast is TERRIBLE. Everything tasted like freezer burn. Completely inedible both times we stayed. Security is a major problem. The second time we stayed here on the return leg of our trip, our truck got broken into. Obviously I know this happens in lots of places but this one is special. The hotel did nothing aside form a very nice maintenance man who helped us tape up our window for the 10 hour return trip home. They wouldn't even call the police for us. When the police came this is what we were told... ""Thieves in Memphis target vehicles from Texas because they think everyone in Texas has a gun in their car."" His partner was down the street at another hotel filling out a report for someone else who's car was broken into that same night. And the police officer told us that the city removed patrol from that neighborhood because they're wasn't enough crime. So basically if you stay in this area, there will be no cops anywhere to help prevent this sort of thing from happening. We drove because we couldn't afford the plane tickets. A few tanks of gas, an oil change and two nights at a hotel cost less than airfare for 3 and a rental car.  After the break in and the $450 deductible, we ended up spending more :(We called to make a reservation for 1 night July 16, check out July 17. At the time of making the reservation, I let the reservations representative know that we would probably be arriving well past midnight, as we were driving into town from Mississippi. A couple of hours went by and I hadn't received my email confirmation. I called the hotel again and they confirmed the reservation and emailed me my confirmation. We arrived at the hotel at 2:00 am, and the main entrance was locked. We were pounding on the door for a while, and it so happened that a couple of guests saw us from inside and opened the door for us. At the time of checking in, we were told that they were booked!!! Nobody called us to let us know that the hotel was booked and that they wouldn't honor our reservation. After complaining, checking if any hotel nearby had rooms available (which they didn't) and trying to understand THEIR LOGIC BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF MAKING A RESERVATION, we were ready to leave past 2 in the morning and drive for over AN HOUR to a hotel that had a room available. We were told that we could be accommodated at a La Quinta that was right behind the Hyatt Place. We were also told that ""Management"" makes decisions as to ""re-arranging"" reservations. The name of Jerry Roach - General Manager at the Hyatt Place - Primacy Parkway was given to us as the party responsible for these decisions. If I wanted to stay at a La Quinta, I would have made a reservation at La Quinta. I did not want to stay at a La Quinta. Nobody makes a reservation at a specific hotel only to find out that your reservation has been moved to another hotel. I ask the Hyatt Place, what is the point of making a reservation??? I have never had this happened before. I even called to confirm the reservation. This is not a serious business. Do not take your chances here.I love Hyatt's in general. A first visit for  Hyatt place.I must say very impressive room for the price point. Excellent Svc ! Tried the food last night. Just the right touch after a long trip from Cali . Excellent breakfast!!w/Starbucks included in the price of the room.Rooms are undergoing some renovations, but laid out really cool.  I like the super larger TV in the middle of the rooms with easy connection for those who have kids who travel with game systems.  All the food you could ever want is close by, but only one place that is really in walking distance.  For this place being located so close to I-40 the rooms are very quite and you never realize that your that close.Stayed here for 6 nights the last week in May. All the staff members were helpful and friendly. Hotel room was big and clean, nice TV 42' and free wifi. We enjoyed the living room and bedroom area being separate. Housekeeping cleaned our room everyday. Breakfast was free but, not that good. We drove to Chick-Fil-A which took about 3 minutes. We had a great stay !I have stayed at two other Hyatt Places, and this one was pretty much a carbon copy of the others.  I really like the decor and interiors of the rooms.  I also like the check in kiosk near the door. Yay!  No interaction with local humans!Downsides: double beds instead of queens kinda bites, and it took us forever to get extra blankets for the pull out.  Other than that it was a pretty flawless visit.Clean and pleasant.stayed here for the thanksgiving holiday and to explore memphis. booked the room online through the hyatt site and got a rate of $80/night..not too bad.The hotel itself is pretty nice. Friendly staff, very very large rooms, HUGE tv, a seating area, very clean and well stocked rooms. really to us the only downside was that it was not near downtown. If you are younger and looking to go out i'd recommend staying downtown and not here. We drove into downtown most afternoon/evenings once we were done siteseeing around memphis. that said though it is not a reason to not stay here if you dont want the hustle and bustle of downtown. the hotel is otherwise perfect and a great value.I really loved this place.   If I ever visit Memphis again, which I hope to, I'll definitely stay here.  It's by no means the nicest hotels I've stayed at, but it's also very far from the worst.  I found the rooms very spacious and clean.  I personally prefer softer beds, so I loved the mattress.  As Joshua noted, the self-service check-in was pretty sweet.   In a perfect world, I would have liked this place a little closer to downtown Memphis.  However, I don't think it took me more than 10 minutes to get anywhere from the hotel (downtown memphis, graceland, stax musuem).I was very impressed with everything about the Hyatt.  Especially since I got a King Size bed for $82.00 a night w/tax!!After spending all day traveling to see your recent love interest the one thing you want is a decent room. While the 42'' flat screen tv did make early morning talk shows a little more enjoyable, sinking into a hole at night left a little more to be desired. Sure everyone likes a comfortable, soft bed, but there is such a thing as TOO soft!!! No room service means you have to leave your room to eat even if you're too tired too. Of course these problems are minor, however it's the losing a reservation that brings me to yelp.     After your sister travels to memphis to put up with a couple days of mushy talk between you and your love the last thing either of you want to hear is ""im sorry we dont show you registered here.""  Of course mistakes happen and if that had been the response we received maybe we wouldn't be so upset. I would expect a little tackiness if we were staying a motel 6 or a no-tell motel but when you're paying $139 a night is it too much to ask for a little kindness? The ""lady"" at the front desk refused to offer us any form of assistance, she took one look at her computer and that was that. The next 5 minutes of her time was spent snapping her neck and rolling her eyes at us like we were some transients off the street with no common sense. It wasn't until we made a fuss and the manager came out that we were even offered to be put up in the same room. Needless to say I withdrew my money from the hotel and we went on to stay at another one near by.The hotel was beautiful and the decor was cozy. The staff on the other hand is in need of some serious class time with Mrs. Manners!",,,,"['used', 'place', 'primacy', 'parkway', 'wedding', 'block', 'rooms', 'ideal', 'hosting', 'wedding', 'guests',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sleep-inn-at-court-square-memphis-2,Sleep Inn at Court Square,3.5,$$,31,"Best bang for our buck in downtown Memphis. Rooms were clean. Bed was comfy. Staff was friendly. Very convenient location. Not a lot of parking spaces, but you can park for free if you find one. They do give you the option to valet your car for a small price.Room was VERY small, and everything was clean but the bathroom.  I've seen worse, but this was pretty bad!  Bed &amp; pillows weren't very comfortable.  The location of the hotel was ok.  7-8 blocks from Beale street where all the action is.  I think I would tell people to stay elsewhere though.NEVER AGAIN!  Management was rude.  No customer service.Given the amount we paid for the room I was very impressed with the comfort and amenities during our stay. Nice location, short walk to Beale Street. Very friendly staff. Decent hot breakfast.What a great Sleep Inn! This place is high quality with great rooms and a perfect location in downtown Memphis. Parking is reasonable and safe, and my second visit here was excellent!The continental breakfast isn't bad, your typical bagels, cereal, waffles but they also have scrambled eggs and sausage. I'm OK with it! The staff is always friendly, though slightly slow with some things, but I really enjoy staying here!The rooms and service were fine. The staff has always been friendly and informative. unfortunately when you're on travel, you want to have a nice breakfast. This place was a NO GO. The first day, I go down and there is moldy and bruised apples on display. I got a bagel only to realize after I ate it that there were other bagels on the tray with a dark green powder on them. YUCK!!! The next day I kept with packaged foods. Even the apple juice I got had hard sediment in the bottom. Sorry but this needs to be fixed!!! 2 stars for not seeing this blatant flaw in the food you're servingExcellent room!  Cozy is a better word than small, because it is comfortable and has all the amenities.  Minor problem with the in-room safe, but the staff quickly attended to it and it works fine now.I am usually wary of 2 star amenity hotels, but this was quite a pleasant surprise. No, there's no in-house restaurant or bar, but it was walking distance to to Beale street, restaurants, bars, Martin Luther King museum, Mudd Island, etc. Also very cool was that the trolley stop was just steps outside the door of the hotel. As stated in other reviews, the room was pretty small, but it was clean and super cozy with a puffy inviting bed, microwave and fridge to keep your snacks and leftovers. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sleep-inn-at-court-square-memphis-2?select=EqUD0PQBdIiv3HRLmwlFFA#irPrqBM5vTGyhUDb2hFl4Q"">yelp.com/biz_photos/slee...</a>We had a river view, although you did also stare at the parking lot, there were some nice sunsets.  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sleep-inn-at-court-square-memphis-2?select=EqUD0PQBdIiv3HRLmwlFFA#dAD9LqSIotGUFEmHqqqnJg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/slee...</a>On the other side of the hotel, you get a pleasant view of Court Square park. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sleep-inn-at-court-square-memphis-2?select=EqUD0PQBdIiv3HRLmwlFFA#WlXYB6RKpwR4VA5LR_-jBw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/slee...</a>There was a complimentary continental breakfast. Nothing amazing, but it covered the basics you might need with bagels, oatmeal, eggs, waffle maker, etc. Free wi-fi, which is nice. The last more expensive Hilton I stayed charged for my wi-fi. Greedy corporate bastard. They do charge for parking in their own parking lot. A total peeve of mine which the hotels do these days. But it was on $12 which was nothing compared to the $30 I paid last month at a So. Calif. hotel. So not bad price, but still not cool. I paid ~$100 a night and that was the cheapest I found at that time, and I was so happy with it. I had tried to find hotels closer to Beale which cost more, but they were all booked up. I am so happy that I ended up with this cheaper place which was still so close to Beale, I didn't need anything closer and really covered all of our needs. Didn't need an in-house restaurant or bar because everything was so close anyway. I would stay here again.Thoroughly enjoyed the service from the team and to me that is most important in a hotel stay. All hotels have beds, but this one was very comfortable. Although the room was tiny, the updated room and the breakfast area (with a WAFFLE maker) made up for it. Next time I will choose this hotel and I will choose a suite :-)Front desk staff is rude and unaccommodating. They will talk behind your back if you have a disagreement with them (due to their unaccommodating nature).   Considering this is a low end hotel with tiny rooms, you would think that they would make up for it with customer service; not the case here.Pros:: The cleaning staff did a great job tidying my room. There is a fridge in the closet, so I loaded up with snacks from the City Market store a few blocks away. The hotel is also in a great location in Downtown Memphis, right on the park and main street. Cons:: Tiny rooms. I usually love lounging in hotel rooms, but this room felt like a small box. Also, the light from the hallway came in under the door, so I had to use an eye mask to sleep. The room was also either too cold or too hot, which was weird. However, my largest complaint would have to be the rude, unhelpful, disengaged front desk staff. To be fair, it seems like it is just the one guy who is rude, but still, it left me with a negative impression multiple times. Don't work at the front desk if you don't like people. I probably would NOT recommend this hotel to friends.Cramped room unless you are by yourself.  Pubic hair in between sheets.Shower stall tracks caked with dirt. Small, half size pillows to sleep on.Michael at the front desk is a total dick.   Doesn't even look at you when you're checking in.  Other than than that, it's not bad.Very pleased with our stay. It was only for one night, but there are many reasons for the 4 stars. First of all, the location was perfect. The trolley was 30 feet from the rear entrance. The area around the hotel was lovely and very clean. Within easy walking distance to Beale St. The streets alongside the trolley tracks were very attractive with a lot of trees, lampposts, many benches, and cute shops. The room was clean and decent-sized and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was small with only a shower stall, but the shower was roomy. The breakfast served was pretty impressive to me since most hotels offer a complimentary breakfast that consists of cereal, a muffin, an apple, or a banana. This hotel includes a hot breakfast with bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and a waffle bar. And the woman at the front desk even gives you a map upon check-in showing exactly where we were located and the number of blocks to Beale. If I'm ever in Memphis again, I will come back!Hotel lobby was clean and updated and check in staff was friendly. The room was small. We are a family of 4 and it was tight. The sink is outside the bathroom with the shower and toilet in a tiny room. But it was clean and updated. My bed was a bit lumpy but sleep able. Location was great walking distance to Beale street and close to the trolley. Can't beat it for the price. I would stay here again.I definitely would stay here again.What I like about this place1. Location is great, in the heart of downtown2. Breakfast is pretty impressive3. Clean4. Soundproof between suites5. Free wifi5. i thought the price was affordable for its qualityWhat I dislike1. This guy who works in the evening after 3pm, is not nice2. The computer in their business center is slow3. No shuttle bus from and to the airportI strongly recommend this place if you are traveling to Memphis TN.Perfect place to stay in the downtown area. Surprised with the price, approx $100 for a sat night stay! I hope it stays that way. Beautiful hotel, soft bed. You can walk out the back entrance and the trolley stop is directly out that door. Everything is walking distance, even Beale St. People were super friendly here.If I had paid more, this would have been a three star review. I booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> about a month in advance. The rate I got was $90 a night including tax. Not too shabby for downtown Memphis! The pros: - the rooms are clean. Very clean! - newly remodeled. Sometimes when you book with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> you end up in the crappy rooms... but our room was newly furnished with nice spreads and dark wood furniture. - $12 a day self or valet parking. In Chicago, this would cost you a fortune a night so I thought it was a deal. - free continental breakfast - in room microwave and fridge - beds are COMFY - you leave the cleaning staff a few bucks on the bed, they leave you an extra roll of toilet paper and handfuls of toiletries and coffee packs - conveniently located downtown - trolley station literally steps from the back door of the hotel Cons: - the valet is SLOOOOOOW. Call at least 20-30 minutes in advance - the staff is feast or famine. Either extremely helpful or extremely surly and unhelpful - our key had to be ""re-magnetized"" every single day. We'd get all the way to the 5th floor and then have to go back down to get the key fixed.- the bathrooms are teeny tiny. Minuscule. The only thing that separates you from showering and peeing in the living space is a small sliding door. No bath tub.   All in all, I'd stay here again, especially if I got this rate. The pros outweighed the cons in my opinion. It was a great deal!I'm one who wants everything for a bargain.If location matters to you, in any big city, it's difficult to find the biggest bang for your buck - especially right smack in the middle of an entertainment district. With anywhere I go, $120 per night is just about the max I want to spend, however,  most everything in downtown Memphis was $150 (PLUS tax) average and above.I went with the Yelp reviews here, and this place is just about the least expensive for the location. I stayed on a Fri-Sun, so the rate did increase, and INCLUDING tax and everything, came up to 145-155 p/night, which was still OK with me.The location was great, and within walking distance to downtown, Mud Island, Beale St., the historic trolleys, etc. You can't go wrong here! Across the street was Confederate Square, great views of Hernando DeSoto Bridge. and immediate access to Riverfront Park.The room was fairly updated, nicely appointed, and as clean as you might expect 2-3 star hotel. The bed was comfortable. The great thing about the lower-star hotels (vs. business-class hotels) such as this one is that they had free internet in the room, and also a microwave, and refrigerator. They also had free breakfast, with cereal, fruit, so-so pastries, juice, coffee, and make-your-own waffles. A note on the fruit and the fruit salad - it seemed that they brought the same ones out from morning to morning (i.e. mushy fruit salad, and whole fruit that was getting too soft to the touch).What wasn't OK is that they have their OWN parking lot, yet they charge you for using it. If they want to make the extra money, shouldn't they be charging ones who AREN'T hotel patrons for using it? I have a gripe about this because when I was checking in, the front desk person did NOT call it out that I was going to incur an additional charge. The only thing she said was, ""You got a car?"", after which I said, ""yes,"" and she handed me a parking stub that she instructed me to hang on my rear view mirror.It wasn't till after I checked out and looked on my bill that I had noticed the $12/night charge for overnight parking (in addition to the rate I mentioned earlier). Had I known this, I would have consciously used ""metered"" street parking, which is free on the weekends, and was within a block of the hotel.My only other gripe is that the windows were so filthy from the inside/out with finger prints, grime and all, that it was cloudy looking out the window, so I washed the interior windows for my own piece of crazy mind.Had it not been for these last two points, I prob would have given this place four stars.A very solid hotel-stay at what seems to be a reasonable price for the neighborhood.Free wi-fi.I found the bed very comfortable, and the bedding to be a nice heavy quality.  The shower itself was spacious and pleasant due to an unusual design that should be more widely adopted.The breakfast was fairly good for a chain-type hotel: hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juices, waffle-maker, some basic pastry and bagels, cereal, plus bins of scrambled egg and sausage patties. There is a free safe in the closet unit which was a nice touch.The service was very friendly.","I was so impressed!I was on a road trip recently and passed through Memphis. I didn't need anything fancy so I started calling around and pricing area hotels. This was certainly (not surprisingly) one of the cheapest. It's location is great though, right on a cute little square between Front and Main streets. This made it very convenient to get around. Parking is only $12 a day (seems that $25 is standard from my recent experiences) and I was able to jump on the wifi connection for no additional charges.There isn't a gym or pool but there is a free continental breakfast which actually wasn't too bad either. They were also really nice about letting us stick around a little after check out the next morning so I could finish up some work before getting back on the road. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is that while I was overstaying my welcome, housekeeping came in to clean and let's just say they didn't really clean... kinda gross. But overall, it's probably not too different than the nicer spots in that respect.We will definitely stay here again on any future trips to Memphis. it was in a great location. We had a view of the river from our room. The room was VERY clean, smelled clean, and the bed was comfortable. The room was a little small, but you just sleep there, so it's not a big deal. The staff was very courteous and friendly.We really liked the bathroom, it was small, but had a big shower instead of the tub/shower combo. Parking is only $12 on top of the room rate, which we paid only $99.Sleep Inns are generally on the low end of the Choice Hotel chain. This one does not fit the mold.Clean, centrally located, downright inexpensive. It's the best value for the price that I've seen all year.Very small rooms and not enough lighting, so it was quite a bleak stay for me. What made up for this was the housekeeping and front desk staff. They were so funny and sweet!I paid 109 for the night, Got an excellent room on the top floor with a river view just like I wish and asked for. The room looked nice, newly renovated, and the internet was free and the location was really very central and ideal. I would recommend to everyone. I didn't have more than like 10-20 cable stations, but the beds knocked me out right away anyway.Great location, Mud Island park is a short walk over the bridge, Union Ave and Beale Street a short walk or Trolley Ride.  Very clean, great breakfast, but most of all the staff was amazing!  very helpful and friendly.  will go back here in a heartbeat!Great location; great value.  I would stay here againGood hotel.  Great value, very clean and great location!!Very nice hotel at a great price. Rooms are smaller than most hotels I've stayed in,but newly remodeled and super clean. Flatscreen TV and the bed was very comfortable. Offers free wi-fi.  Great location and Beale street is only a trolley ride away! ***Don't confuse this hotel (Court SQUARE Sleep Inn) with Court Street Inn. My husband and I made this mistake and upon entering the wrong hotel room, which felt like a crime scene, we knew we were at the wrong place and switched reservations right away. Would recommend this hotel and stay again.Great location downtown, close to the Convention Center and Beale Street.  The staff was helpful and friendly, the room was clean, the rates are reasonable (for downtown).  I had an uneventful stay, which is all you can ask for from a chain hotel you picked because of its location and price.very nice hotel for the money.  everything was spotless and the bed was super comfy.  the parking lot was a little tight because it's shared with the marriott next door.  the location of this place is perfect...the trolley is right outside and beale street is only a few blocks away and there are a bunch of good rib joints in the area.  it can seem a little shady at night, but the people are friendly and you just need to stay aware of your surroundings at all times.",,,,"['best', 'bang', 'buck', 'downtown', 'rooms', 'clean', 'bed', 'comfy', 'staff', 'friendly', 'convenient', 'location', 'lot', 'parking', 'spaces', 'park', 'free', 'find', 'give', 'option',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/econo-lodge-downtown-memphis,Econo Lodge Downtown,2.5,$,31,"I had read so many bad reviews about this hotel before we arrived, but my partner and I were traveling across the states on a budget without a car so needed somewhere cheap and central. Econo Lodge was that. I was paranoid about bed bugs so the first thing I did was check the mattress. Not a single trace of those little blood suckers. The bed was HUGE and super comfortable. The room itself was huge as well, with a nice bathroom and it was very clean. The pool wasn't in operation because it was November. Yes the hotel is old and a little tired looking but for the price you pay you get a comfortable bed and a clean room. The breakfast wasn't super exciting - pastries, toast, waffles, cereal etc, pretty standard. The service was pretty non-existent, but we didn't want housekeeping to go into our rooms so had the sign on the door to keep them away. Location wise, it's an easy walk to anywhere in downtown memphis. The bus from the bus station is right outside (we walked, which was about 20 minutes) and the bus to Graceland leaves from just down the road too.I'd definitely stay here again if I was to return to Memphis.One of the nicest econo lodges ive ever been too. Still doesnt deserve more than 3 stars. Free parking, close to beale st and a big spacious room and pool are the best parts. The elevator sucks, ask for a low room if you can and take the stairs. Its doesnt have ac and i had sweat dripping off of me in my 7 minute ride down 3 floors, it was well over 100 degrees inside of it and it was full of people because apparently the other elevator doesnt work. They need to fix this, someone is gonna pass out, its that bad and a health concern now.The front staff was pretty rude. After getting into our room we were sitting and watching tv and someone came into our room. Seems they might of double booked the room. I called down to the front desk and she didn't seem to care. She just said ok and hung up. Room was pretty dirty and you might die in the elevator.One of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had in my travels. The staff at the front desk watched 'Maury' on tv during my check-in as drunk locals argued near the reception area....at 3pm in the afternoon. The elevators were slow and seemed on the verge of crashing. Our room smelled terribly, with furniture that was cracked and stained. The level of noise going on at night made us lock the deadbolt and put a chair against the door for safety during the night. In the morning we ran into a security guard who discussed with us that other guests for a convention were making noise on the floors, 'but what can you do?' he said as he ate a bowl of Cheerios in front of us in our hallway. How about some command and control over the hotel? The continental breakfast was disorganized and messy and appeared just thrown together and abandoned at some point in the morning. I understand this is a budget/commuter hotel but I shouldn't feel grossed out or unsafe to leave my room. Forget about it being near Beale Street...Avoid at all costs.Okay, I get that this is a budget hotel.  The name openly advertises that fact.  However, even at a budget hotel, I have certain expectations.  These expectations are not luxury expectations, but reasonable expectations; these expectations are merely that the hotel meets minimum standards with regard to cleanliness and service.  This place failed to meet many reasonable expectations that any hotel should meet regardless of whether it is the Hilton or the Econo Lodge.The elevator is painfully slow and the floor numbers do not appear inside the elevator because the display that shows what floor you're on doesn't work properly.  If one elects to take the stairs instead of the elevator, be prepared to walk into a musty and damp stairwell that would make a fitting setting for Hollywood's next horror film.  It also becomes apparent rather quickly that the interior of the building hasn't been properly maintained for a long time.  From cracked pictures hanging on the walls to damaged ceiling tiles and dirty carpets on the floors, the halls bespeak the same, serial-killer atmosphere as the stairwells.  One glance out of the window, at the hotel's pool, similarly disappoints.  From one of the upper floors, debris was visible inside of the pool such that it looked like the pool was struck by Hurricane Katrina.  If memory serves me correctly, Hurricane Katrina did not devastate Memphis.  What, then, was the excuse for the condition of the pool? The room itself was surprisingly mediocre.  Yes, the hair dryer didn't work according to my roommate.  Yes, the interior still exhibited signs of wear and tear.  But, with properly lowered expectations, the room itself was bearable.  One gleaming error: one of my ""clean"" towels had a hair folded into it.  The towel itself was clean otherwise, but no towel should have a hair folded neatly inside of it.  I don't need such a gift.  Otherwise, the bed linens looked clean and the bathroom was clean too.  At the very least, if I stayed in my room for long enough, I could close my eyes and convince myself that all of this was merely a bad dream.  I think my exhaustion level, after over 10 hours on the road, impaired my ability to care about anything but sleep by the time I made it to my room.However, when I woke up the next morning and sought out the free breakfast, a familiar depression set in again.  First, breakfast is served in a tiny room somewhere on an upper floor (the 6th, I think).  Second, I only discovered where breakfast was served after bumping into another hotel guest in the hallway.  There were no signs indicating that breakfast is served in such an odd location.  If I hadn't bumped into this guest, I'm not sure I would've known where to look.  Finally, when I found breakfast, I was sorely disappointed.  Most free breakfasts, even at budget hotels, include some assortment of common breakfast foods, such as scrambled eggs, sausage, etc.  Here, there were biscuits, cereal, and some danishes.  That was about it.  I took one of the biscuits, doused it in the complementary gravy, and began eating only to discover that half of the biscuit was hard as a rock and, thus, inedible.I traveled here last spring (2015) for an event with a student organization from my local university.  As a result, the goal of booking this hotel was to save money for the group.  In this regard, I think my student group succeeded.  As the old adage goes, you truly do get what you pay for.  This place was no exception.I know it's budget friendly, but it's not worth it. We arrived and there was a sketchy group of guys hanging out in the lobby. The people were not friendly at all,and to be honest it wasn't the safest part of town. Don't waste your money or your time it's not worth it.I would have given this hotel a 4 star except we got a call from the office at 6:00 am to come move our Harley. My husband had to get up out of bed &amp; go outside in the cold.  He parked where the attendant told him too!  Then when we asked to check out at noon since we were woke up by their staff, she refused to give us the extra 15 minutes. The rooms were clean &amp; decent but the staff needs a good course on customer service!Never, ever, ever, EVER again.One word: Yuk.Of course I'm here to elaborate on that but oh  my gosh, yuk. It's very old-style, decor is daggy, the lift is rickety and you know you're in budget accommodation. Staff were fine, not unfriendly but not O.T.T. No problem.At first glance the room we were put into was fine. Spacious and what we expected. The coffee pot didn't work. We slept the first night and went out during the day to see Graceland and Sun Studios. We had a knock on the door at around 9am by cleaners and we told them 'no thank you'. With laptops and other valuables (and suspicious minds) we left the sign on the door. We were only staying two nights and didn't need things changed over. I came back early and my room smelled like smoke. It hadn't smelled like that the night before. It was cold so I pulled back the covers. We generally don't check the covers when we check into a room because we ASSUME things are fine - WRONG. I'm doing this every single time I book into a room.ARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! See for yourself. Stains and splodge marks. It looked like blood stains and had gone an icky brown. When my husband returned I told him and wanted to say something but he asked me not to, didn't want to cause any problems. I wish I had. That night we slept on top, away from the gross marks. We checked out and got the hell away from there. We flew from Memphis airport to Las Vegas (Memphis Airport, another story altogether) and sat next to a Memphis police officer who told me 'that hotel is nasty.' He told me that a few years ago a guy murdered his girlfriend in one of the rooms there but the body wasn't found for weeks afterwards, despite cleaners going in and out, they hadn't lifted the bed. That's where she was hidden. Very creepy. I've since contacted the Choice Hotel Group who forwarded my complaint onto the manager of Econo Lodge Downtown Memphis who responded with this:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you for bringing to my attention your unpleasant experience at ourproperty. At our EconoLodge, the Owners and Staff pledge to do everything wecan to make you feel at home during your stay with us. We understand thatnothing replaces the feeling of home, but we will do our best to make sureyour stay with us is as comfortable as possible.We are very sorry that you were dissatisfied with our housekeepingefforts with the linens in your sleeping room.

In the future, never keep an issueto yourself, most hotels want to make things better for you.This property has NEVER had any shootings and/or murders, again NEVER.The information that was given to you could not be more wrong. We are notresponsible for any bad happenings at other Choice Hotels and should not bepooled in with them. Again, there has NEVER been any shootings and/ormurders in and/or around this hotel.Once again, I apologize for your inconvenience, and if there is anythingelse I can do to help resolve this further please contact me at901-522-7050.Sincerely,Adam HoleyfieldGeneral Manager-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry Mr Holeyfield but I think you're full of crap. Clean the frickin' sheets and blankets, throw out the ones that have blood stains on them, fix your coffee pots, don't allow people to smoke in rooms, tell your cleaners not to knock on people's doors at 9am, set up a better security system in your hotel lifts and invest in something more than pastries and porridge for your breakfast. Alternatively, burn the place down. That might be better for everyone.The entire hotel smells terrible, breakfast is served from 6-9, however get there early because once everything is gone, its gone. Bring some extra towels because they'll take your towels and not give you any. They also give great elevator rides, where you'll be able to explore the entire hotel, with one push of a button. Also, be sure to bring a bulletproof vest for when you decide to leave the hotel. In sum, dangerous location, poor service, scary elevator, rundown.This place was such a nice change after the horrid night we spent at the Weatherford OK. Americas Best.Located a couple blocks from Beale St, totally walkable, this place is inexpensive and oh so nice. Their garage is attached, so that's a plus. Every staff member we encountered was so super pleasant.My husband checked us in and we went up the garage to the ""top"", parked, and proceeded to our room.This was not the room at a budget hotel. This was more like a room at an older 5 star hotel. Deep thick tapestries for drapes, a large plush bed w/ an ornate headboard, a beautiful vintage 4 claw chair... yes please.  And my favorite part, clean. It was so clean!Seriously we paid a bargain hotel  price to stay in this hidden luxury. I don't think Ive slept better while travelling.Stay here. We will be again.By far the worst hotel I've ever been to in my life. I don't want to give this hotel a star but this is forcing me. It deserves a ZERO. We arrived, staff was rude when we checked in, went up to our room and it reeked of smoke. The room was marked non-smoking but it smelled terrible. The sheets were stained and the room was so old. The ceiling had brown stains all over it and cracks. Being a college student and coming to memphis for two nights I thought it would be an OK hotel and I could bare it. Nope. We walked in saw that and got the hell out. We were there for maybe 15 minutes. And of course when we left the lady working was incredibly rude. But it was worth just getting out of that dump! Please do not go here!Basic accommodations at a good price in comparison to other downtown hotels.  It was about what I expected.  Nothing fancy.  The hotel sits on top of a parking lot and part of the lot is used for hotel guests, who pay $10/night for the convenience.  The hallway smelled like cigarette smoke but I was pleasantly surprised at the odorlessness of my room.  Not sure if 'odorlessness' is a word but you get my drift.  The shower was a narrow, old-school tub with a narrow curtain-holder (I'm accustomed to the curtain rods that bulge outward to give more room!).My room was on the opposite corner of the building from the elevator bank, so it was nice and quiet.  Continental breakfast was in a conference room on the 9th floor and was simple yet enough.  Biscuits and gravy, cold cereal, fresh muffins, and juice/milk.Would definitely consider staying here again in the future.Oh, man.  We needed a place for the night, preferably near Beale Street, and this technically worked.  But man...The room was rundown.  Not awful, and things were clean, but not up to par.  The neighborhood, like most of Memphis from what I saw, was iffy.  The garage had some very dark corners that made Sweetie nervous.  The free breakfast was just passable.  And then we couldn't get back into our room.  Yep, the key was bad, and we were on the 10th floor, so a ride down- only to have the replacement key not work either.  So back down for another, which also didn't work.  Maintenance guy finally let us in.  I was a little surprised his key worked...And those elevators.  Hellavators, as someone said.  Jerky.  Noisy.  Music cutting in and out.  Indicators, inside and outside the elevators, that pretty much showed random numbers.  I am not exaggerating.  Waiting on one to arrive, I saw it read 1, 2, 5, 9, 2, 6, 7, 9.  Inside one, it said 4,5,6,10, 9, 10.  Yeah.  Check your floor before you get off!Service was good.  That's about the best thing I can say.  Next time we'll find somewhere else.Yes this is just a 3 star. Needs updates on everything. However you get free breakfast. Also want to add $10 a night for parking if you have a vehicle. We had a nice view of  North Memphis. The room smells, probably the disgusting carpet. Elevator had some problems. I would take the stairs. I won't stay here again.My time at the Econo Lodge was not a pleasant one. Positioned in an unfavorable part of town in what is currently the most dangerous city in the U.S., the Econo Lodge (which is nothing more than a parking garage with the top three floors ""renovated"") is a dirty, filthy mess. You never feel safe here- you walk into the lobby and find no window of safety between you and the homeless people roaming the streets. You get in the elevator and feel like you're on the Tower of Terror, never quite sure when the rackety thing is just going to drop. You get to your room and find that your room service didn't bother to make your bed for you, but the TV is on when you know you turned it off before you left (perhaps the maids enjoy their television entertainment for than their job). The only time I felt safe in Econo Lodge was when I was leaving it. The place, as mentioned above, is in dismal condition. I would not jump in the pool if my life depended on it. The pillows feel like they haven't been washed in a year, and the bed has a broken-in and overused swing to it. The whole place is supposed to be smoke-free, but I found nowhere in the hotel where I could not smell the characteristic after-fumes of nicotine. The whole place feels like a matchbox- and one that doesn't provide an adequate fire escape, to make it worse. The soda machines are all broken in one sort or the other (one doesn't take money, one takes your change but acts as if you didn't pay). There's no out of order signs to warn you of this either. For $80 for 3 nights, this may seem like quite the deal. The one plus of the place was a free continental breakfast (and to an extent the variety of TV channels- you get. 30 channels or so, including HBO, which was quite a contrast to what I was expecting). However, in the end, it isn't worth it. This place doesn't have much life left in it- either the health department is going to shut it down first, or that elevators going to finally give way,kill some innocent people, and prompt legal fees the Lodge won't be able to pay for. Trust me- don't risk your life for a cheaper hotel. Pay a bit more. There's plenty of better hotels around- the Sheraton and Courtyard Marriott are just a street over (even if that's too much for you, there were others around, but I forgot their names). But please- don't support this. Don't risk your life for this. Stay away from the Econo Lodge.I'd give it five stars but the building is a little too worn down for that. The location is great for getting around downtown and the staff is friendly and helpful. It doesn't look great but it's clean and the price is right.I paid $300.00 total for four nights here including parking. Room was clean and included a microwave, refrigerator and free Wi-Fi. . Location is awesome.For $60/night and it's close proximity to Beale Street, I can't complain too much about this Econo Lodge.  Parking is $10/night for hotel guests.  There was a sign for Memphis Redbirds game parking for $5 in the garage.  I don't understand why hotel guests would pay more for their parking than those going to a baseball game nearby.  Despite the relatively low price for parking, I felt ripped off after seeing that sign.The configuration of the parking garage in proximity to stairways and elevators is awful.  We had to unload our suitcases from the car and drag them up at least one level of the parking garage in order to get to the elevator.  In addition, the elevator felt like it was going to stop working at any moment.We only stayed here one night.  I would've been extremely unhappy with the hotel had we stayed here any longer.  The bed linens were terrible, and the pillows were so flat we had to fold them in half.  There were only 2 pillows on the bed, which meant one folded pillow for each of us.  I woke up with a sore neck the next morning and did not sleep well.Generally the room was clean.  But the air was so dry in our room that I woke up with a dry, fake-sounding cough.  This contributed to my sleeping poorly as well.The front desk staff was lame.  I find it really aggravating when I have to stand there, looking at 3 people working behind a desk who are all engaged in conversation with each other and ignore me.  I am standing at the desk holding a suitcase.  Obviously I want to check in.  And when they finally broke their posse up, the counter girl took her sweet ass time getting us checked in.This Econo Lodge is fine if you are only staying one night and want to save some money.  I don't think I would stay here again though, and I would avoid this hotel if you are staying in town multiple nights.  I'm giving it 2 stars for 2 things:  price and location.This was home base for my 2 nights in Memphis.  It had some good and some bad.  Here they are.............Good-  Inexpensive.  $60 a night.  Real close to Beale St and only 2 blocks from AutoZone Field.  $10 a night parking with tons of available spaces with in and out privileges. Staff was friendly.Bad-  Dated rooms. Crappy towels.  Shitty elevator.  Bed was not too comfy.  Floors in the room and bathroom just felt ""icky"".  Thin walls.Would I stay here again?  By myself, yes.  With my wife, no.  It would be a decent hotel to crash at for a guys weekend or something but its far from fancy.Not bad but I really can't give it more than 3 stars. We were traveling the weekend before Thanksgiving and were stopping overnight in Memphis. I got the Econo Lodge for $75 a night before taxes. Not a bad deal. The location is great, waking distance to everything downtown. The hotel has a parking lot that's $12 a day. The staff were, eh. The room was clean but very basic. Make sure you bring your toiletries, they don't leave any conditioner. If I could get a cheap rate again, I'd stay here in the future. It's not worth more than what I paid.","The room was large with a fairly nice view, but everything about the hotel seemed pretty cheap and grungy.  Also, my non-smoking room was very smokey.  The location and price ($70) were decent.This place has ""meh"" written all over it, but that's not the worst thing in the world. The price was decent if you go through Expedia ($89 with tax), but parking was somewhat of a ripoff. $10 for hotel guests, but there is definitely a cardboard sign in the windows that says ""Public Parking $5.00"". So...there's that.Rooms look like they were probably last updated in the early 90's, even though I heard the guy at the desk telling another guest they had just recently updated the carpet and beds. Maybe 5 years ago, but seriously man, not recently. The sheet didn't quite fit over the bed, the pillows were flat, and everything smelled a little funky, but the good news is the windows are all screwed shut so you can't open them. Oh, wait.The people at the desk were nice, the room was clean, and overall it's just a cheap, quiet, old hotel downtown. I just came to Memphis for one night to hang out on Beale St., so honestly, I'm not that worried about it. But seriously - update something, Econo Lodge! Anything!Great location, close to downtown. You pay for what you get though-the fitness room had one tread mill and only five pound weights. It was very clean and pretty quiet. I would stay here again if I were on a budget.For an economy hotel we were pleased. It was clean. The staff was courteous. The cleaning crew on our floor were so accommodating to our needs. The ice machine was out of order on our floor, but working on the floor above. Decent continental breakfast. Lots of attractions close by. Enjoyed our stay.This property was great. Reasonable rates and a downtown location. I was here for the St. Jude Memphis marathon, and the hotel location was about 2 blocks from the race start. No better place really, especially with the comparable rates from nearby properties.I didn't have any problems with the hotel, although when I needed a bandage for my foot, the hotel desk did not have any to spare. Oh well, I guess they aren't as big as the other chains, but they fit my travel budget to a tee. The room I got was a king bed and the room was clean. Bed was comfortable and slept pretty well. Clean and comfortable, that's basically what I look for in a hotel. Nothing fancy.I had fun in Memphis and managed to rock a PR in the marathon. If I ever do come back to Memphis, this is the race I would do again.Don't expect much for the low price. Faulty room keys, half washed sheets, and an Internet connection to rival the speeds of dial up are a few of the problems that plague this hotel. The rooms are severely outdated; this TV looks like it's from the mid 90s. The windows looking out from the rooms on one side of the hall are limited to the view of the communal pool, and I can imagine that the view from the rooms across the hall only shows the building directly across the street. The beds are quite comfortable, and the bathroom/sink is not bad. It is really cheap compared to other hotels in the downtown area, but it is noticeably more disappointing. While it is a good alternative to the more expensive hotels, it is certainly a compromise.I found this hotel on Travelocity. It was close to Beale street which was the attractive part. It seemed cheaper than nearby hotels so I thought I was getting a deal. Was prepared for a ""cheap"" hotel. Well the $20 in taxes and fees (more than 2x the other hotel I booked) brought the price up to a Non deal price. Still ok with my decision cuz any closer to Beale street and your spending twice as much anyway.. Parking was only ten bucks a night which I considered a deal.(chicago would be $40+) Easy 10 minute walk to the restaurants and pubs we wanted to go to. A/c was quiet and cold but the hotel blinds and curtains did not block out the annoyingly bright outside lights... Kept waking up thinking it was 9am when it was really 3am... This is the biggest reason why I gave a low rating. I was expecting a cheap hotel but I was looking forward to those blackout blinds/curtains that all hotels have. I wanted to sleep well!!!If you are looking for a hotel that is close to Beale street but affordable, this hotel could be a logical choice. Just be prepared for a mildewy bathroom, an elevator that has not been well maintained, a parking structure with burnt out lights, and an unsecured stairwell that can access every floor of the hotel without passing by the front desk. We had a safe and comfortable stay in the end (which is all you can really ask for at a discount motel), but we did worry about the security of both our room and our car because of the aforementioned issues. To be fair, I mentioned these problems in a survey that the Econolodge sent after our stay and the general manager emailed back right away to say that they would be addressed.We stayed there and it was CLEAN and the people were all very helpful.. The breakfast was about what you would expect : bagles and cereal and bisq.&amp; gravy. For the price it was all GOOD and we walked to everything we needed to go to: even Gus chicken when it was cold we would take a cab home ro about $6 bucks.. It is OLD and tired in the hallways and Lobby and even the rooms could use a facelift but rooms and Bath were very clean- that is what counts .. If you want NICE stay at the Hampton for  $199.+tax or the peabody for $245.00 but we only slept there so we were HAPPY! for $65/nt + tax!I won't say it's the worst hotel I've stayed in.  But lets just say I've been to Detroit.  The location was great, walking distance to Beale and Main streets.  The parking was ample and seemed safe.  Wi-Fi was strong and fast.  Pool area looked pleasant, we didnt use it as it was a cold rainy day when we were there.  The problem was the elevator.  After several attempts to call it, we finally walked up to the 9th floor (parking goes up to 7th) through a very smelly outdoor-type stairwell.  Later when we did finally convince the elevator doors to open, it took us from 6 to 9, the doors tried to open, then back down to 7.  I took the stairs the rest of the time.  This is not a handicap accessable hotel.  The staff started vacuuming and shouting to each other in the hallway at about 8:30 am, so dont plan on sleeping in.  The breakfast was very simple, but ok.  Overall, next time I would spring for the extra $50 and stay at another downtown hotel.Nothing special.",,,,"['read', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'hotel', 'arrived', 'partner', 'traveling', 'across',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-by-marriott-downtown-memphis,Springhill Suites by Marriott Downtown,3.5,$$,32,"Wonderful experience! Stayed one night and didn't expect much since this was just a stop along the way to Florida. Ended up loving the experience and will be planning a trip back. Some excellent things to mention: staff is very friendly (Willie the valet went above and beyond), clean hotel, beautiful historic building, one of the best free breakfasts I've ever had, 5 blocks to Beale Street (great music, food, and drinks), close to the trolley line, spacious rooms with huge windows, lots of towels, bottle water in the room, clean bathrooms, and very comfortable beds. There is also a fitness center and outdoor pool and hot tub. Didn't get to try those because we ran out of time but did take advantage of the complimentary WiFi.It's an okay hotel, really a 2.5 for my tastes, but I'll round up in honor of National Random Acts of Kindness Week.I chose this option for its location, but in retrospect it is far better suited for business travellers than one-night pleasure vacationers such as myself.  The surrounding area was completely desolate on a Sunday evening; all of the fun stuff is south and/or east, although some of it lies at the edge of walking distance.  Furthermore, in the morning I found that the nearby Mud Island River Park was closed for the season, another disappointment.But as a hotel it was fine.  The ""suite"" aspect was wasted on me, but there is a serviceable kitchenette--emphasis on the ""ette.""  The hotel offers valet parking for $15 per night.  Fifteen dollars is not necessarily a happy price, but it is actually the least among all the downtown Memphis hotels, and for some reason costs the same as self-parking.  So you may as well use the valet.The complimentary breakfast cannot compare to Hampton Inn, but offers a fair variety and mediocre quality:  scrambled eggs, sausage patties, ham; hard-boiled eggs; breads and pastries (still covered in plastic); whole apples, bananas, and oranges; whole strawberries and cubed cantaloupe; cold cuts; hot oatmeal; make-your-own waffles; coffee and tea; apple, orange, and cranberry juices; and ice water.Details:+  Real glasses+  Lemon-sage scented toiletries+  Lots of outlets, including on the bedside lamps+  Exhaust fan in the shower room-  The TV is positioned between the bed and the sofa, so that you get a neck crick either way.-  The bathroom and sink are uncomfortably close to the bed, especially for a suite.We usually stay here or the Courtyard Marriott when we travel for business. We prefer this over the other because there are usually less problems when staying. Staff are friendly. Rooms are clean.They need to upgrade their cable package though. I couldn't even watch the Memphis Grizzlies vs Atlanta Hawks game on TV!I would most likely not stay here again.  We checked in and the guy was not very friendly and pretty short with us.  It was a busy day but being a little friendly goes a long way.  Our room was in the old Kress building on the 5th floor.  I took the elevator up to the 5th floor and could not find our room.  I called the front desk and asked him where it is.  He said you take the elevator to the 3rd floor walk to the end of the hallway and then take a different elevator to 5.  Taking two elevators to your room is ridiculous enough but why didn't he tell us that?  There was no way to know to do that unless he told us and he didn't.  We get in the room and it looks good.  First thing I do is use the restroom and the toilet overflowed!  Not just clogged but it overflowed onto the floor and I had to throw every towel in the room down there.  I called the front desk and he said he would send up maintenance.  I said I wanted to change rooms (I didn't consider that bathroom to be sanitary after the toilet overflowed!) and he said he would send new keys up.  The maintenance guy brought up the new keys along with a plunger and he started plungering before we even left the room.  The new room was bigger but had no view.  That room worked out fine.  The free breakfast was good.  They definitely cater to Europeans with things like lunch meat and nutella.  Parking is $15 a day for a lot across the street.  Parking should be free.About 10-12 minute walk to Beale StThe shower was clean and hot with great water pressure. It's so terrible to end up with a luke warm shower with terrible water pressure. This was excellent. Free breakfast included all the basics of a continental breakfast as well as waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage patties, turkey patties, fruit, cereal, etc. The breakfast was actually pretty good. The staff were all absolutely amazing. Everything was as the website explained it. No mess ups. My wife has a very mild case of OCD. We usually have to always alter one thing or another while on a trip. Not one single thing needed to be done here. No problems. Great room. Awesome people.  Thanks Springhill.Go to the SpringhillLooking for a nice place to stay for our Memphis getaway, the Springhill looked like the top choice.This hotel exceeded our expectations in every way.: Courteous staff: Excellent location within walking distance of the downtown historic area.: Large comfortable rooms: Included free breakfast that equals what you would pay for elsewhere.: Parking is extra, but, is worth it for what you get overall.My fiance and I took a road trip to Memphis for his birthday and we stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night. I chose this hotel because of the positive reviews it got on TripAdvisor and the reasonable price. Many of the ""better"" hotels downtown tend to get pricey. I just wanted to make sure to book something nice that was close to the famous Beale Street and wasn't going to break my bank.We drove up and checked in with ease. All the staff we came in contact with were really friendly and helpful. We were given the option to valet or self-park. We chose to use the valet because it's the same price as the self-park($15). Plus the parking garage is two blocks away from the hotel, so we decided to let them look for the parking spot for us.They put us on the 2nd floor in the Main building. Our room was facing Main St with  view of the trolley station right outside our window and we loved the view! To be honest I was a bit worried about the trolley keeping us up at night being so close to our room and also from reading others reviews. But the sound of the trolley did not bother us at all! Maybe we are use to hearing a little background noise when we sleep or others may be more sensitive, but it didn't bother us. Plus the trolley does not run all night. The room was pretty nice. We had the King Suite. I loved how the bed was so comfortable because most hotel beds are anything but.The locations of this hotel was awesome! It is close to all the lively spots downtown. It was only about a 7 minute walk from Beale street and only about a 2- 5 minute walk to some restaurants and shops off of Main St. We didn't have to use our car for the entire stay!The hotel even had a decent fitness room which we used only one time. There is a stationary bike, treadmill , elliptical machine and free weights. They have breakfast that runs from from 6 to 10:30. We didn't get to try the breakfast so I cannot comment on that. We were too busy finding places to eat brunch on Main St( try Majestic Grille).Overall we had a really good experience at this hotel. We would stay here again if we visit Memphis in the future and I would recommend it to anyone planning to visit Memphis!Dirty rooms.  Nothing in the rooms really looks or feels clean.  When I checked into my room there was handprints on the desk and you could tell it had not been wiped down.  There are stains on the floor and the rooms feel gross.  From what I hear this is what you can expect from any of these older hotels here.  Just has a really run down feeling in it.  I would expect a little more from the Marriott, but I guess not.More like a 4.5. Stayed here 2 nights. Everyone was really friendly and complimentary breakfast was hot breakfast with a good selection that was constantly restocked. Easy check in, good price, great customer service (had room issue they immediately resolved). Feels old but maintained well and clean. Negatives? $15 to valet park or self park for $5 across the street and one block down. Not unusual for a downtown hotel. Also corner/angled rooms have only one very small window so little natural light. Also, I am a fitness facility user and was worried that there is only one bicycle, one elliptical, one treadmill, one bench, one ab mat, and some free weights. However, I was here both mornings for an hour each day and only saw one other person. Note also there is an outdoor pool and hot tub that are open year round (there was snow on the ground so nobody was in either). They are small and dated but inspection certificates on wall in gym say a 98/100 health department score so must be OK.The hotel has seen better days, but the location and staff make the stay. It will depend on your expectations and what you value.  The rooms are not the most modern or kept up; there were horrible stains on the carpet of the first room we had. We requested a second room with two beds, and the same stains were evident on the carpet. We had a view of the park, which was nice, and the trolley runs right by the back door, making local transportation or just a fun ride to the Peabody or surrounds very easy.The gym is meager. There is one bike, one elliptical, and one treadmill plus free weights. On the plus side there are towels and water. On the minus side, the equipment faces a floor to ceiling window and directly across from it is a building with glass windows that reflect back the hot sun. There are no window coverings so it makes working out really challenging from both a glare and heat perspective. When I was there, the remote for the TV was missing and the staff didn't have a replacement. They said ordering one would require them to ""program the TV again""--apparently above the skills of the staff. The pool and hot tub are very small, with a view of an alley.Breakfast is a plus. Big buffet with plenty of variety. Stay away from the scrambled eggs, which tasted powdered. Waffles, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, bagels, cereal, meats, biscuits, etc. A plus is coffee available 24 hours a day in the lobby.There is a small bar off the lobby with hefty prices for drinks. There is a small area off the front desk where you can purchase soft drinks (at twice the price of the coke machines on your floor), sundries, and snacks. Two computers are available free in the lobby. When I was there, neither of them would print to the printer but the staff let me use their office printer which was great. Free WiFi in rooms as well.The staff are really great. Super friendly, always greeting you. By the end of our week we felt like family, and that really makes up for a lot. There is a small fridge in the rooms along with a microwave, coffee, and safe so that's a plus if you need snacks, want to make a lunch or your early-bird partner brings up breakfast while you sleep in.You can walk to the Mississippi, riverboat rides, and Mud Island as well. You have to balance the condition of the hotel with the location and staff, then determine what's more important to you. Be aware that there is a $12/day charge for parking regardless of whether it's valet.Acceptable. Valet Parker looked like a rapper wannabe (hat turned sideways). Not a great first impression. The guy at check in was at least 104 years old. Rooms were ok. GPS took us to the railroad tracks in front of the building. Had to use the force to find the entrance. No breakfast or coffee until 6:30 (must be a union thing?).Wouldn't come back unless I had to.I generally do not stay in Springhill Suites but I am happy with this hotel.  This location could easily be converted to a full service Marriott and has most of the amenities one would expect from a full service hotel. Lobby bar, small swimming pool and a streetcar station just steps from the door.My room on the 7th floor had furnishings that seemed new and a 40"" HDTV was mounted on the wall in a way that it could be swiveled for viewing from both the living room and bed room.As other reviewers have said, the AC seems like a unit from a 1970's Motel 6.  The neighborhood seemed ok to me, a few homeless people were hanging out on the street but it was no worse than other places in Memphis...I stayed at this hotel after reading all the excellent reviews.  Unfortunantly, had a horrible experience.  I will start off with the positives - the location is great.  It is right next to a trolley stop and very close to Beale street and the mississippi river. It has free breakfast, a swimming pool and a very nice lounge area with a bar.The rest of the story is different.  The hotel is split into two sections - a newly renovated section and something the staff calls the 'historic' section.  I checked in with my husband and infant baby.  I had heard about the trolley noise and asked for a nice room away from the noise.  I got a room in the 'historic' building.  I later found out 'historic' meant old, moldy, dirty and smelly.  The room we walked in had no sun, the window was adjacent to another tall building.  It smelled of smoke and as if it had been flooded.  The bathroom was very dirty and I was afraid to put the baby anywhere on the bed or the couch.  I called the lobby and requested a new room - they seemed a bit irked that I made this request...They provided me with another room in the same building.  This room was right on top of the trolley stop and right across the elevator.  We had nonstop noise in here - when the trolley wasnt moving, the big radio speaker right outside the room was playing.  The lights outside from the businesses were very bright and not able to be blocked by the curtains.  The window had so many spiderwebs and was disgusting (see picture).  The bathroom was extremely tiny and the sink is located outside the bathroom.  In fact, each time you opened the door, it touched the toilet - you literaly had to stand in the corner of the bathroom to open it and step in/out.  I did not want to annoy the staff anymore, so I just stayed here.  Bad idea - on the second day my baby got pink eye from the dirtiness.  The staff is not very accomodating.  They knew of the circumstances and did not help.  Throughout my stay they ignored my presence.  In fact, I called to see if they could order me a taxi. I came down 15 minutes later and found out they had still not called for a taxi.  I then had to wait 15 additional minutes in the lobby for a taxi.  I later called yellow taxi on my own for future rides and was able to get on a taxi within 10 minutes.  I recommend staying at the residence inn right across this hotel.  It is just as convenient for location, is much cleaner, and has much friendlier customer service.My stay at the hotel was nice, and the staff was friendly and helpful while I was there.  I can't speak for the food but I slept comfortably in my room.BUT after leaving the hotel, when I found I had been erroneously charged more than $650 for a room that was supposed to be charged to someone else, the front desk manager (Mr. Silva) was considerably less helpful.  In my case it was problematic to have $650 disappear from my bank account unplanned - I was hit with overdraft fees as a result.In fact I felt Mr. Silva was quite rude to me over the phone and instead of taking responsibility for the mistake and making it right, made an already frustrating situation even worse.  I have worked in customer service quite a bit and I know how important it is to listen to a customer with a complaint, and treat them with respect.  Instead, Mr. Silva was argumentative, spoke over me many times when I attempted to outline the details of the situation, and overall left me feeling very upset.  Before my conversation with Mr. Silva, I was merely anxious to receive a refund of the erroneous charges; after, I felt angry and stepped-on.  Great job, sir.The location is ideal for tourists who want to see the main attractions for Memphis. and not worry about car rental and parking. The Trolley is in front of the hotel. However, it is a very quick walk to Beale Street and all of its sights and food, Rock N Soul Museum, Gibson Guitar, Lorraine Hotel and Civil Rights Museum, etc. The price is very competitive for hotels in the area. We were in the main hotel and did not stay in the older Kress building. The rooms are a good size and a standard suite with frig, wet bar, two large tv's etc.  The Breakfast had a good variety of food and the staff were very friendly.  They periodically come out of the kitchen to greet guests and make sure you have things you need or just chat with you.The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows, also.The high Star rating is due not only to the location, price, and amenities, but also service. We had two issues that arose both of which were handled not only promptly but beyond our expectations. Things can happen no matter where you stay, but you just want someone to take care of it.  We really felt ""pampered"" by the way things were handled for us! TIP:  It is easy to get to the Rock N Soul Museum from the hotel.  Once you get there, you can take a FREE shuttle to Graceland, Sun Studios, and Heartbreak Hotel. You can stay at either of these sights, or go from one to the other as we did. Call the Museum or go on line for the shuttle schedule.Nice hotel. I have stayed at just about every Marriott and Hilton brand downtown and this is my favorite. Nice lobby and good location. Also has a bar in the lobby which many Springhill suites don't have. Only complaint is the room ac was only fair. More like a fan. May have been configured for heat since it was middle of Jan. and I like it cold, like 60 degrees cold.Springhill Suites are not fancy, but comfortable. The furnishings are modern and inexpensive to achieve the casual look they are seeking. I like it, but it may not appeal to some. They provide a complimentary breakfast and Internet. I did not try the breakfast. Honestly after 140 nights in a hotel I can't say I have enjoyed many free breakfasts and prefer to go out.Very nice hotel.Excellent location.Great Value.Our Suite is very nice. The people are friendly and accommodating as well. You can walk to many places from here. Very small pool and hot tub.. Breakfast is good as well.Room was nice. Carpets and fold out bed left something to be desired. Housekeeping didn't seem great. Left a note and tip asking for extra towels and still had to call front desk to ask for towels. Pool is nice and breakfast was pretty good as well. Very convenient to everything!We were in town this past weekend for the UFC in Memphis and chose to stay at this hotel. It was pretty much as good as it gets, location was perfect. Rooms were HUGE and super clean. Friendly staff. 2 full beds along with a pullout bed was just great. Free wireless internet along with a good breakfast in the morning. Would definitely stay here again, its a huge suite with room for a large crowd.","I'm really starting to love Marriott  hotels. We're two for two for having great  stays on this week long cross country trip. First off, the location is great! It is located in the middle of Main Street which the the main downtown street and the trolley route. Walking distance to Beale Street, museums such as the Rock-n-Soul museum and the Gibson Factory tour, and excellent restaurants. If you prefer to ride the trolley, you can.Valet and self parking are the same price ($12). Parking hasn't been an issue. We stayed at the Kress hotel, which is adjacent to the main hotel. It can get a little confusing because if you enter through the main entrance you have to take a couple of elevators and cross over to the the next building. However, they are great at offering alternative routes to getting to the Kress hotel. There's actually a direct entrance off Main Street.Complimentary breakfast which the whole family loved! Free Wi-Fi. Nice exercise room. Very very friendly staff and community.You just can't beat the location of this hotel!  You can step outside and walk to the bank of the Mississippi River or head on down to Beale Street for a night out.  The hotel itself was very nice as well.  We stayed in the historic building, which was very charming.  Loved the beds and the extra little sitting room by the door.  The lobby is gorgeous, the staff is super friendly, and the included breakfast was better than most. If you're planning to visit Memphis, I highly recommend staying here!Those who gave it a 5 star review must not have stayed in the Kress building which is part of the Springhill suites. I had a room overlooking Main street in the Kress building. It wasn't a ""5 star"" experience.First off, there is a raised walkway on the third floor connecting the two buildings. So for my room, it was an elevator ride to the third floor, walk down the end of the hall, then another ride to the fourth floor. Not a really big deal unless you gotta pickup your car from the valet every day and go back and forth.Then there was the room. The closet door was broken. I mean off the hinges, smack you on the head if you opened it broken. There were a couple of bulbs out in the room and the floor CREAKED. Not just in one spot, but all over. I felt bad for the person in the room below me if there was one. The windows were very drafty and I was lucky enough to be there during an ice storm, so it was cold outside. I had to keep the drapes closed and the heater at 77 to stay comfortable. And what the windows lacked in heat insulation, they also lacked in sound insulation. Luckily I sleep like a log, but when the trolley came by, it sounded like rolling thunder.And finally, the location. It is downtown on Main street. And there is all kinds of stuff within walking distance... as long as you go before 6pm. After 6pm, that whole end of Main street starts closing up and there is nothing open. Including the Walgreen's which closes at 8, (7 on Saturday, 6 on Sunday). All in all the room was clean and the bed comfortable. Which is why I still give it 3 stars. Just try to stay in the main building and not on the Main street side. P.S. The car accessible entrance is on the North Center lane side of the building. Turn west on Court avenue from Front street to get to it.The pros were Sarah at the front desk (so nice and helpful), the location was great, the room was very big.  The cons were some of the other staff were surly, my bathroom wasn't very clean and luggage carts weren't readily available.  Loved our time in Memphis, but would probably try another hotel for another stay.It was clean, you get a decent breakfast and they have coffee available all the time, plus internet is free.  They have 2 buildings, main building and a historic Kress building.  The only thing about being in the Kress is you have to take an elevator up, cross over to the other building and take another elevator up.  Annoying with a kiddo and luggage in tow.Location is good but not grat.  It's a quick walk to anything, about 7 minutes to Beale st.  Memphis at night (outside of Beale) is rather vacant and I didn't like walking with the family down quiet streets.  So a location closer to Beale st. might be better next time as we wouldn't have to walk quiet streets at night downtown.What is happening to the Marriott chain? Kevin at the front desk was great; very friendly and eagar to assist. I had read a review about the carpet being stained and the furniture being bargin basement and thought, oh please. But our room was kindof gross. The carpet in our room was pretty stained; makes you feel everything is dirty. A large front sitting room area with a small glass and aluminum table.  Food was yuk.  Had a bagel the first day from the breakfast buffet that was so stale! The next day I though maybe if I toasted it, but the bagels were so hard, I didn't even try to cut it to do so. The location is pretty good. Not too far to walk to Beale St, but got hit up a lot by vagrants (obviously, no fault of Springhill Suites; just be warned).Very good hotel.  Great location.  New and clean.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Parking is reasonable.  Right by the trolley.We stayed in the historic section, rooms are very nice.  It was a little wonky getting to the room, we had to take two elevators each time, which wasn't a bit deal.  You could get around this if you asked for the 3rd floor of the historic building.Overall great experience.The SpringHIll suites is being renovated-but I slept at the Courtyard,two doors up, but was permitted to use the pool and enjoy theBuffet breakfast, where Felicia was amused (I hope) that Ihelped myself for post meal snacks.  Jeanette Myers was in chargeof an event promoting the Hotel for Bridal parties and she wasgracious when I appeared, as I am always interested in thesekinds of things. It turned out that the caterer who provides thefood for all of the Marriott events, is absolutely first rate-the dessertprepared by the l8 year son of the owner was so rich and sodecadent-that i am still longing for another taste.  There are afew people who are also sales managers who need to relaxwhen it comes to what they think about who might have significance but dont fit their rather old fashioned ideas about'appearance' but this is a minor complaint-given the numberof marginals who hang around outside, one would think they'dbe able to discern the difference.  Sigh.Great rooms for the price, and the service is always cheery and excellent.  We stay here once a year for the St Jude Marathon, and always have a pleasant stay!I've gotta say that this SpringHill Suites was one of the most cozy and comfy hotels I've ever stayed in.  I don't know if it was the sea of soft pillows, the soft linens, the whirring on the A/C, or how the shades completely blocked all sunlight; but I was happy.  I slept 2 nights like a baby.  It really felt like home.  The rooms were big.  We had a seperate room with a sofa-bed and it's own TV.  Everything was clean and worked great.  A huge reason to stay at this hotel: the convenience.  It is right in the heart of downtown Memphis overlooking the Mississippi River and the bridge to Arkansas.  It's only a few blocks away from Beale Street and all the surrounding jazz/blues bars.  Beale Street can be a blassttttt if you're visiting.  The ability to WALK to Beale street instead of driving is a terrific advantage.The Springhill Suites Downtown deserves three stars for location.  Everything was right outside our door  and the Main Street Trolley stops right in front.   There is also a Walgreens right across the street. The downside of this hotel: -Not clean, the trash cans had not been emptied, the mirrors had gross smudges on them, and our toilet did not flush-Our coffee machine was broken and coffee ended up everywhere in the kitchenette area-There were no local brochures in our room, which I expect in a tourist location-The pool had not been cleaned-The television offers many choices for chargeable shows, it takes time however, to find your free channels, it's very easy to accidentally select something with a priceIf you can get a good rate at this hotel I would recomment it, but don't expect any thrills.This is your basic bargain hotel, The location is fantastic, with a streetcar stop right outside the hotel that will you get you to anywhere you would want to go downtown, for $1 a ride. The room rate was NOT a bargain, but I think that's because I was there for ""Memphis in May"", which is the local high season for tourism. The public areas of the hotel are clean and modern and pleasant, apparently very recently renovated. We chose a room in the ""historic Kress building"" because they're supposed to be bigger, but this wasn't really a plus. It was large with a high ceiling, but it's not really a suite - there's no door between the sleeping and living areas. There is an old standard (not flat screen) TV that swivels so it can be seen from either part of the ""suite."" The living area kind of dwarfed the furniture - a small loveseat and two chairs, and a simple desk. The ""kitchen"" area included a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a coffee maker, with no dishes and only enough coffee to make one cup. (It was dreadful.) The room was a little tired, with cracked bathroom floor tiles, some crud oozing from the shower safety bar, and so forth, but over all it was adequate and quiet with comfortable beds. The guy who checked us at the front desk managed to not say a SINGLE word to us until he handed us the keys and told us where the elevator was - so obviously we had to figure out for ourselves that breakfast was included in the rate. The breakfast itself was pretty good, with eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits, bagels, cereal, sweet rolls, juice, and all that - other than the crumbly scrambled eggs and weak coffee, it was really quite good. Kevin at the front desk (NOT the guy who checked us in) was incredibly helpful and friendly, and called a ride for us to the airport that worked out great. All in all, there's no reason not to stay here, as long as you're not expecting the Ritz.",,,,"['wonderful', 'experience', 'night', 'expect', 'much', 'since', 'stop', 'along', 'way', 'ended',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-memphis-downtown-hotel-memphis,Sheraton Memphis Downtown Hotel,3.0,$$$,65,"I'm giving it 4stars as I feel I've been to a lot worse. I stayed here this past weekend to attend a dance convention with my daughter. Location and ease to convention center is nice. Location in general is what it is considering the high crime in Memphis. The check in went smoothly for me and the bell hop check to make sure our key cards all worked at club lounge. Staff at lounge were bland and sometimes rude. The food was mediocre but it got my kid some food before a long day of dancing. The beds were comfortable. A lot. The room was decent sized and the bathroom had adequate lighting for three dancers to apply make up. There is a fridge and safe and real glasses to drink from. There is no microwave- but access to one on 3rd floor. I do think at this level, a micro should be included. Only real complaint was how the room would get up to 80 degrees after we set it lower. I heard this complaint across the board.  The fitness center was ideal and had plenty of equipment. Was able to use most everything. View was less than stellar on the mill- but... Pool area looked nice. We tipped valet- and like some say- hit or miss. Lots of people but still waited a good 40 mins for bell hop to load our belongings and take to pack car. That said, they did so more efficient than we did! Service at bar area was kind of slow too but people were all kind and friendly there.The Sheraton Downtown Memphis is a very nice hotel. My husband and I happen to arrive during a convention. The convention center is attached to the hotel which makes it convenient for a lot of guests.The parking is valet only and $22 a night not including tax. I think it would be convent to have parking onsite but charge a smaller rate, but they do have a small parking lot. If you do not want valet or pay the price, parking is conveniently located across the street for $10. Now the parking had some conditions. You must move your car by 7AM or you'll be fined $20. Also, once you leave the parking lot, you will have to pay another $10 to get back in, and it doesn't matter if it's the same day. The attendants are nice and willing to work with you because they don't have notices aren't everywhere. We stayed on the 18th floor which allowed us a great view of the city. If you pay a little more, you are able to access the club lounge. The club lounge is beautiful. Breakfast is prepared every morning and hor dourves are served every evening. They have a very nice spread, comfortable seating, tv's, magazines and other things you may want to enjoy while relaxing. We had a small issue with accessing the lounge on one morning, and the attendee did not allow us to enter. She told us we had to go down to the front desk and sort things out, mind you, another couple was having issues getting in, and in order to get to the lounge area, you have to use a key card on the elevator. We went downstairs and the receptionist order new key cards for us and for the other couple as well. We went back up stairs, and the cards still didn't work. The attendee gave us a hard time and then allowed us to enter, then told us we needed to go downstairs and let front desk know the issue again. I asked her since we just went down to the front desk, if she could use her walkie talkie and alert them of the issue since other people are having the same issue. She said no and apologized. I went down to the front desk and the manager assisted me and went to the lounge and talked to the attendee. He guaranteed me the situation will be taken care of before happy hour. He was right, everything was taken care of.My husband and I both enjoyed our stay. The fitness center is renovated and opened 24/7. The pool is clean and the water is warm. They offer towels for your convenience and headphones if you need them. The deck is great if you want to sunbath. Overall, the experience at Sheraton was great. We had a wonderful time. The housekeeping staff was friendly and asked what we needed. I would come back and enjoy another stay.This hotel used to be a Marriott and switched a couple years ago to be a Sheraton which seemed great because the only other Starwood property in downtown Memphis is the Westin Beale Street which is typically above my company's nightly cost requirement.  Yes, I know the Sheraton is across from the Convention Center and it's a huge hotel that doesn't always have a personal touch.  But I get my SPG points, right?  And as a lifetime Platinum member I get access to the Club Lounge, right?  Sadly, neither is usually the case.I can tell you that the rooms are generally clean, the beds are comfortable, and the on-site restaurant &amp; bar are decent.  The location however is horrible unless you're going to the Convention Center across the street or you enjoy dealing with homeless and indigent folks as you walk to any of the ""nearby"" restaurants which are all at least a few blocks to walk.  Valet parking, hit or miss.  Access to the Club Lounge, it turns out they either don't care or they screw up the key card coding just about every time.  And your SPG points (for those who care) - my last 3 stays at this property on a AAA rate were put into the system as a ""non-eligible"" rate for SPG points despite the fact that it was clearly an eligible SPG rate.  The money I spent at the restaurant &amp; bar was awarded points on each stay but my room expenditures were not - and I'm still fighting to try and get the points I'm due for a stay that was almost a month ago.  Hmmmm.  I understand that many people at a convention hotel may not care about SPG points but it strikes me as entirely dishonest and unfitting of a Sheraton to try and screw their most loyal members out of their SPG points - if it was a one time occurrence that would be one thing but at this point it clearly seems to be a consistent, systematic choice by hotel management.Quite frankly I don't plan to ever stay at this hotel again, even if I have to stay at a less desirable Marriott property instead of Starwood which I've done a couple times.  The lack of customer service at the Sheraton Memphis Downtown is just not good business, but I guess if you're a convention hotel with unscrupulous management it may work out in your favor overall but that still doesn't make it right,  This hotel should be kicked out of the Starwood family, and I can only hope that it happens sooner rather than later.Stayed here for 6 nights and everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful, the room was clean, modern and well stocked. The location is good if you want to be in walking distance to Beale St but not right in the busy, noisy area. I'd stay here again.I was only in Memphis for a short time, but the short stay was really great. We stayed here at the Sheraton on the 18th floor, which was cool because it was a clubhouse level that required your room key to access. The view was pretty spectacular, too. We could see the pyramid and all over Memphis. The valet parking was a little pricy, but I did enjoy how friendly the attendants were. They were also really quick at getting the vehicles out of the garage. The room was really nice. Pretty much your average nice hotel room, comfy bed, couch, and desk. It was all really clean. That's what matters most, right?All in all, Memphis was a good time. It's a really cool city and the stay here was great!The hotel was recently renovated - nice rooms, clean, comfortable.  Executive Lounge was very good.  Nice staff.  Location is so-so.I'll be honest, I've been putting off this review.  Mostly out of disdain for having to re-live my short, yet still too long, one night stay here. I was also hoping that in some way, some how, the hotel would at least ATTEMPT to make things a little better. Well, no such luck. So, let's get down to it.    We arrived at the hotel around 3:30, tired and hungry from a day's worth of riding in the car. Since our, and I'm quoting here, guaranteed checkin time was 3:00, we were right on schedule. But, as I bet you've guessed, our room wasn't ready yet. They were gracious enough to not offer an excuse, inform us that he couldn't give us an approximate time when the room would be ready, and tell us where we could leave our luggage while we waited. At 4:45, we'd had enough of sitting in the lobby. I went to the front desk to ask when we could go to our room. Would you believe they had JUST finished cleaning it? Yep, didn't even get a chance to page us yet. I never knew I had such killer instincts, but I suppose I should start picking lotto numbers too.    Fast forward to 11:00pm, 7 hours before we intended to be back on the road. Since words cannot accurately describe, and I don't have visual aids, the next 5 hours must be intangibly visualized. Imagine hell. Now make it worse. Drunken young adults screaming, crying fighting, banging on your door. Trampling up and down the hall ways, puking in community garbage cans.... Yes, that all happened.... until 4:30am. I, of course, called the front desk. Then again. Then a third time, being assured that security was there and police were on their way. Then a fourth time. Then a fifth. Finally, about 4:30, I walked into the hall determined to stop the chaos at any cost. My neighbor, a cameraman who had to be on set at 6:00, was already out in the hallway. He was mad. Very mad. And rightfully so. The security guards were there as well, FINALLY tending to the situation. Too late. WAY too late. If I'd have known we wouldn't get any sleep in the hotel, we could've just drove straight through to Nola.   Bottom line, we went to the hotel to get some sleep. Not to party, not to swim, not to watch T.V.... TO SLEEP! We purposely stayed at one of the nicer (more expensive) hotels in hopes of a restful night. Needless to say, we didn't get what we paid for. If you went to a fine French restaurant, paid the bill before you received your food, and they came back and told you all they had was rotten potatoes and charged you anyways that would be unacceptable. Same here. We got NOTHING for the money we paid. Not even a voucher for a free bottle of $3 water. NOTHING. HORRIBLY managed. Knowing that Sheraton, as a company, finds this acceptable will keep us from EVER even considering them as a place to stay again. Do I have to say that I wouldn't recommend this place?Stay somewhere else. 1st room...ants on the desk, ants in the bed,  ants on the towels,  ants in the tub. I call the front desk, they say they will send someone to spray but I asked to be moved. 2nd room...ants in the tub, ants in the shower. At this point its nearly 9 pm and I have to get up early. I call the front desk, they move me again...to a lower floor. 3rd room...I am only turning on one light and getting into the hopefully ant-free bed. Oh, the front desk comped my valet parking. Yipee...too bad the company was already paying for it. Do not come here. There are too many other choices to have to deal with this...at a Sheraton!!Update...went to check out, parking hadn't been comped, there was a charge from the bar that I didn't visit,  and it only took the girl 20 minutes to have me check out.2 1/2 StarsThe good...the valet staff and the front desk staff, Darell and Velisha.The bad...mosquitos EVERYWHERE in the lobby AND an unfriendly bartender at the bar.The ugly... Club Level room- the minimalist and outdated decor, no toiletries and no refreshments except Diet Coke in the Club Lounge!This hotel has definitely done a 180 since I stayed here years ago. Not sure when it was remodeled, but it looks absolutely beautiful. The room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. All in all, I was pleased with my stay.But...the reason I give it 2 stars out of 5, is that when I came to check in (it was 1:30 AM on a Monday night..) the hotel clerk/receptionist gave me a room that was already being occupied by other guests. Yes, you read that correctly. She had given me a room key to the 3rd floor and as I opened the room, there were people in their beds. Such a horrifying experience. When I came back down and let the hotel clerk know, she didn't seem to be as concerned as I was. Does this happen regularly here? Safety is key, and that is not a mistake that should ever happen again.This place is great!! We really had a great experience here! We had a room that was very new and clean. On top of that, they also gave us a ride to Beal Street, and a ride back! I really had a great experience here at the Sheraton Memphis Downtown.I loved this hotel. The room was perfect, comfortable, efficiently designed and very clean. The overall atmosphere gave me a sense of protection as I was alone on business. The staff made me laugh every day and had me looking forward to seeing their smiling faces in an unfamiliar place. As a millennial, sadly, I don't immediately think to tip hotel staff but this was different. Before I ran to catch my plane, I made sure to break some cash and give it where it was deserved. I had to come back to Memphis the following week and decided to stay closer to where I'm doing business, not realizing how much I'd miss the Sheraton. I know where I'll be staying next time.Not pet friendly.  Told them twice when i made reservation that i had dogs.  Told  them at check in i had dogs. Four hours later they told me i had to move because i had dogs on a non pet friendly floor. When i said i would not move i was told there had been complaints about the dogs and if there was one more i would be asked to move to a pet floor. I explained i had told everyone possible that i was bringing dogs i was then told that if there was one more complaint i would be asked to leave the hotel and not just moved to a pet floor.I was given a three page document i had never seen before that stated i would never leave the animals unattended in the room. I was escorted to my room by a front desk supervisor who stated she was the ""night manager"" and who was unavailable for further discussion for 20 minutes before her shift endedMy advice: stay away from the ""pet friendly"" Sheraton Downtown Memphis.My friend and I had a pretty perfect stay at the Sheraton for a long weekend. I was worried based on so many mixed reviews but our stay was great!Our room was perfectly clean, no funky or stale smell in the hallway or the bedroom. Sheets spotless white, turned down, no undesirable stray hairs or objects. Bathroom was clean and modern, good water pressure. I have to really highlight that I did not feel gross or dirty while staying here. I have that problem sometimes where everything feels very icky, not here. Beds were comfortable, not too firm but not super plush.Staff is extremely nice, valets especially. If I am remembering correctly there are two towers to the Sheraton. We were in the North Tower, it seems to be brand new basically which probably explains why our hotel room was so nice and clean. I think I read that the other tower is older, we did not visit it, maybe it is a less enjoyable experience, but the North Tower was great. I used their fitness center as well, this was also really nice. Quite a lot of machines, ellipticals and treadmills, free weights and weight machines. Very nice and clean as well. I was very impressed, it's nicer than my actual gym at home.Solid 15 minute walk to downtown, which for me, living in Chicago, is nothing and worth the walk to save money on the hotel. For other tourists who maybe aren't use to walking to bars and restaurants, you might find this hotel to be a bit far out. I would stay here again.Do not stay in room 1136. I had a horrible experience and I just want to warn people about this hotel. As a flight attendant for over 6 years I stay in many hotels. I checked out of this one in the morning a bit itchy, thinking I had about 5 bug bites. By the time I was done with work for the day and undressing for a shower in my home that night, I noticed that I actually had over 40 bites. I will post a picture. I dont know what bit me. To begin with, the hotel airport shuttle picked us up 30 minutes late. 30 minutes of waiting on the curb calling the hotel and asking them when our shuttle might arrive. During my stay I went for a 30 minute walk. The valet saw me about to walk around the neighborhood and told me to ""be careful."" During the 30 minute walk I probably had about 100 bums try to strike up a conversation with me. The neighborhood is the most annoying neighborhood I have ever walked through. The bums are out of control but apparently its okay with the city of Memphis because the bums are all super friendly, telling me to have a great morning, how is my day going, where am i off to, god bless you, etc. I felt like I was living the spare some change episode of southpark. So annoying. I couldn't find anything to eat during my 30 minute walk through bum-ville. Every place was open but with literally no one eating there, so I never stopped anywhere and just assumed I would order room service when I got back to what I was still thinking was a clean, bug free room. I ordered room service and it arrived and was not what I had ordered. She left it there and told me she would be back up with the correct order. I never saw or heard from her again so i ended up eating somebody elses cold food about an hour later while listening to my next door neighbor tell his wife about his trip on his phone. I could also hear her end of the conversation crystal clear thanks to the super thin walls.The rooms are newly renovated and seem clean, but when I laid down in my bed it almost seemed like the top of the mattress collapsed down and I pretty much was laying on a wooden beam covered with a bunch of fabric. When I got back up to look at it, it looked like someone had slept on that side of the mattress every night for 50 years straight and left a huge hollow spot. Obviously the mattress was not new.That leads me to my 40+ bug bites that I ended up with. I guess I had roommates staying with me in/on that old mattress that I was unaware of when I checked in to the room. When I exited the elevator on my way to check out in the morning I was greeted with a super cheerful ""Good Morning!"" by a smiley old bum who had made his way into the lobby.  Our hotel airport shuttle was 10 minutes late picking us up for the airport that morning and if any of you are flight crew then you know a 10 minute late pickup can cause a flight delay. If only I could go back in time. I would rent a car at the airport for my layover. I would drive the car to kmart and buy the cheapest tent and sleeping bag that they had on sale. i would stop by mcdonalds on my way to the nearest KOA campground. I would eat my chosen dinner on the campground picnic table, and have a better nights sleep in my sleeping bag on the rocks. I would wake up with probably only about 10-15 bug bites and I wouldn't have to throw away all of my possessions as opposed to bringing home new ""friends."" It would have been cheaper, less stressful, and more comfortable than staying at this dirty crap hole and having to buy a new suitcase and new clothing and work uniforms. This was by far the worst hotel ever and I have stayed in a wide range of hotels over the course of my lifetime.Thanks sheraton memphis!!!!!!!!!! great job!!!!!!!!!!I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago when it was a Marriott. Sheraton bought it a year or so ago and apparently have been doing renovations and updating things, because there are certain things that have been vastly improved.The staff is among the friendliest I've come across in my many travels. Always willing to go the extra mile and help in any way they can. That's especially appreciated after driving over 10 hours and stopping for a night. There is a small convenience store open until 11pm and rooms service is also available. I did not have the opportunity to try out the room service, but I'm sure I will get the chance fairly soon.Rooms are improved and updated since my last stay (when it was a Marriott). Bathrooms are modern, well appointed and very well lit. Beds are comfy, carpet seems new and has that ""cushy"" feel. This Sheraton could take a cue from fellow SPG property (Aloft) and get updated and mounted flat screen TVs that can be controlled with a mobile device. A refrigerator would be helpful, too.A couple gripes:1) Valet parking is the only option. It's not the price but the inconvenience that matters here. After driving for several hours, I don't have my wits about me to the point that I'm not going to forget something. There is 24 access, but it requires you call down so they can get your car. I'd rather pay a smaller fee and park myself so I can have access and be able to grab my toothbrush at 2:30am without involving someone else.2) Maybe they are renovating with a phased approach, but there are some things that need attention. One that stands out are the elevators, at least for the south tower. Several buttons are broken and the lit up Sheraton logo on the inside has seen better day (seems like the bulb is too hot and has browned the logo paper). It's one thing if the hotel matched, but most of the hotel is modern, clean and elegant... it's a little disjointed to step into a less nice  elevator.NOTE: I've become a fan of SPG hotels (Sheraton, Aloft, Westin and others) mainly because a vast majority accept pets, which is important for me and my wife...and my pug. Given the choice, I'd probably pick another SPG hotel in Memphis, the Westin on Beale Street, but it's usually about $50-$70 more per night. All in all, this Sheraton is very nice. It's reasonably priced for the services you receive. I was going to rate it 3 stars, but because of the hospitality and friendliest staff I've met in a while, I'll go ahead and give it 4 stars.First let me say that the location was great for the trolley transportation and proximity to attractions.  Deep breath, that said...it gets 2 stairs because:1.  The mosquito infestation inside the hotel is horrendous!2.  The service staff was lazy in the restaurant bar area every day3.  We had to change rooms due to getting locked out constantly and finally offered another room on day 2 1/2 and husband insisted 4.  The pool was overrun with unruly kids until we asked for assistance from staff to bring order before someone gets hurt5.  Did I say the bar closes at 11 on friday and saturday?!!!Came for a convention, greatly enjoyed our stay! All of the staff were very polite and answered any questions. Rooms were clean.We had a small leak in the ceiling, but it was fixed quickly. Car did not receive any damage in valet parking. I would stay here again.My family and I have stayed here quite a few times when it was Marriott. it's one of our favorites!! As a Sheraton Hotel it's even better! Friendly Staff.. great rooms ..pretty views!love it! !!Stayed there May 17-21, 2015 .Had lots of bites due to bed bugs on both hands, and it was very difficult to sleep  due to the itch. More bites showed up over the next two days after I checked out. I called and spoke to Bernard, an assistant manager,  he said they will take the room out of commission and that someone will call me. Two days later, their "" head of security"" called me to get a report - he even asked for my date of birth....??   Two days later, another guy called to tell me that they looked at the room, and someone else was going to call me very soon. Yesterday, one week after my initial complaint, an ""insurance adjuster"" for Sheraton  called me from Texas and gave me claim no 972 012 1136 and asked me to tell the story all over again. She asked me if I had my clothes cleaned , and I asked if I needed to clean my suitcase or dispose of it. She said that she could not tell me what to do, but asked about the ""damages  that I am claiming"". She said that she did not receive any inspection report but will call me later. Fast forward two weeks, still no call backHey guys, I only wanted to let you know that I had a sleepless night thanks to the bed bugs and apparent lack of hygiene at your hotel. I did not ask, and I do not want a free night, or reimbursement for my laundry expenses, the Benadryl pills or to pay for my disposed luggage. I called you as a courtesy to the next guest that will stay at room 443. I expected an apology, and it doesn't look like I am going to get that either. I stayed at this hotel every year since 2004 when it was still Marriott. Looks like 2015 was my last at this Sheraton.BTW, the receptionist that handled my checkout for my three rooms at 12:30 PM on June 21 was beyond rude and arrogant. She needs to be retrained.","Honestly I booked a room here for business not sure what I was getting seeing the 3 stars. Perhaps this place started to listen to its customers because I had hardly a single complaint. I was promptly greeted when I showed up, my luggage loaded and held in the lobby for me by Eugene while I checked in. The staff the whole way through was friendly and professional. My room was clean and very welcoming. The location of this establishment is right on the limits of downtown with the trolley line running right outside its doors. Or take an Uber/taxi which ran about $5 down to Beale street. I think my only real issue was the TV acted funny with the remote, but honestly I mostly had the TV on for background noise so as long as it turns on I'm okay. Will stay here again.Dirty room. Toilet wouldn't flush. Starbucks cafe sucked. Customer service, although kind, wasn't efficient and didn't care enough about doing things in a timely manner.I think they were just wrapping up construction during my stay.  It also seemed like they really didn't know what they were doing at any given moment.  I think they had vouchers for different meals and then they never took them for me or tried to bill me - it was all very confusing lol.The staff was extremely nice though through all that was going on.  I was on the club level and the girls running that lounge were sweet and helpful.What I didn't like, is that I had ants in my room and the last night finally got transferred out of there.  I mean...ants were all over my things it was awful.I hope with their new upgrades they catch on to how to ""run"" things and take care of any infestation problems they have.Much thanks to Scott (from Thousand Oaks) for helping us out with our situation. See you the next time we're in Memphis!  You and Sheraton Hotels ROCK!!!We made reservations more than 30 days in advance. We arrived at 11:30 pm to find that they are giving away rooms ""first come, first served."" This is stupid, what the hell is the point of making a reservation. Could be the last Sheridan Hotel I stay at. I. Top of that, valet parking only.Clean, comfortable beds. The view from our room faced the brick wall of the north tower and there was no microwave in our room. Other than that, the staff was friendly and service was extremely fast. There is no parking onsite except for valet parking at $22 per day, which was worth the price, especially since we were traveling with an infant.Myself, my wife, and two little boys stopped at this hotel on our way home from Florida. Definitely not what I was expecting. A/C didn't work, my 4 yr old slipped on a puddle of spit in the elevator , I went down to order a drink for my room from the bar, and sat for twenty minutes without one person offering to help me. Don't waste your money, I will never return to a Sheraton as this one has left a real bad taste in my mouth!!I like this place great for being right next to the convention center. Rooms are large and comfortable. Restaurant is pretty goodStaff is very nice and courteous. Hotel is conveniently located next to the Convention center. Not much nightlife in walking distance, but taxis are readily available to take visitors to Beal street or Graceland.Absolutely zero complaints. This hotel was pretty and staffed with folks who were just incredibly helpful.  My colleagues and I were in Memphis for a short stay, and we were so lucky to stay at the Sheraton for this visit.  We were greeted with valet, which is priced $21 a night.  We were checked in quickly and shown to our rooms.  The beds had pillows on pillows and were just so very soft.  The comforter was not overly thick but it did the job on a freezing Memphis night.  I used the fitness facilities and I wish I could show a picture (cell phone camera is not working-I would NOT give 5 stars to Apple right now).  But that gym. Woooooooo.  LOVED IT.  Let's be honest-what do I do when I go to a gym?  Walk realllly slowly on a treadmill and watch TV.  But if I wanted to climb a rope ladder? I could do it.  If I wanted to do exercise things on a huge mega-ball, then I could.  Fitness beyond my skills was accessible to me, and it made staying at the Sheraton seem like a real treat.  The indoor pool features a skylight and access to an outdoor deck.  Not something that I was interested in, again FREEZING in Memphis!  But such a nice feature.  Loved staying here and look forward to staying again soon.So far so good! Yes the hotel is going through a renovation right now, (looks to be almost completed) from an old Marriott to a new stylish contemporary Sheraton. Our room on the floor we are on seems to all been part of the renovation, all new!We had a quick bite at the bar and was totally amazed! I had the Bacon Cheeseburger and the my wife had the Turkey Club! Both of us agreed that it was one of the tastiest experiences we have had! And the hand cut Fries excellent! Definitely worth checking out!People here have been super friendly!Very clean, safe and hospitable. Twice while I was walking to/from our room to the elevators I saw security personnel walking the halls. Rooms and very clean and personnel was friendly. Breakfast prices are outrageously overpriced. $9.00 for oatmeal, $11.00 for pancakes! We went to Blue Plate Cafe, which is just a few blocks from the hotel, and enjoyed a homemade southern style breakfast at good prices.The hotel is located downtown but the area is very hood. Its scary to walk around. The place needs to be renovated.A Priceline bid allowed us to enjoy this Sheraton, a fancier hotel than we usually frequent as a couple.  The front staff treated us just as nicely as any other of the (many!) people who were checking on on a Friday night in June.  A Bruno Mars concert was happening that night, so it was a madhouse, but the valet and front desk staffs did a great job keeping things moving.EVERYONE was friendly and helpful and smiled alot.  It was like being at the Ritz Carlton, having such great service.  We asked for extra towels and they were there in less than five minutes (at 10 pm!)Great shower head. Granite in bathroom. Kingsized bed with great linens and pillows.If you ask IN ADVANCE for a special door knob notice, you can get back ""voucher"" points.  That is, if you say it's not necessary to have maid service , I think it's six dollars per day you get vouchers for.  Not sure how that works.On the sixth floor, we did not have a fridge or microwave. Some floors' rooms offer them, I think.  Without a special key, you can't get onto the top three floors. But the view is great from the 16th floor, if you want to ride up in the glass elevator and see the skyline of Memphis.  (And grab a free USA Today off the credenza there - is that okay??)The trolley stop outside the hotel is between it and the convention center. You should take the ""long way"" around, down by the river - the ""loop"" - it gets you to Beale street in about 30 minutes instead of ten....but you get to see the sites of the city for just a dollar!  Including the MLK museum and between its buildings, the hotel balcony from which he was killed (including the cars of the day).Remember to tip your valets, bellhops, and housekeeping!!(PS - WiFi and ethernet cable&amp;connection were both available in our room. Both were fast - - BUT - - both knocked us off A LOT, even during non-business usage hours.)We waited well past check in time for a room.  The staff could not provide any reasoning for the delay.   They also could not provide a time frame for which we could expect our room.  After sitting in the car for nine hours, the last thing I wanted to do was sit in the lobby and wait.  My husband complained again after 45 minutes, and the hotel produced a room.  This also developed into a disaster; by 11 pm, as our kids tried to sleep, dozens of college aged kids began yelling, fighting, and banging on doors.  Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident, and this carried on for hours.  We made multiple calls to security, as did another guest down the hall.  The situation was not handled, and continued well past 3 am.  The hotel needs to contain disruptive guests, and in a timely fashion.  It should not take for hours to stop drunken yelling and fighting in halls, and far worse, obnoxious kids banging on our doors all night long.  We left with only a few hours sleep, and no apologies from the hotel.What a bad experience.  The people working the front desk and valet were wonderful, could not ask for any nicer!  First night we were next to a room of loud, no sleeping women!  All night would not shut up, we could hear their conversations over the tv.  Then when they left, they were doing construction in the room above us.  Are you kidding?  They moved us finally to another room, and gave us a credit of $50, and Whitney sent us a nice fruit tray!  We left for the day, came back and our tv did not work, sent someone up yo work on it, with no luck.  So off to another room.  Asked for a late check out the last day, could only do 1 hour.  We come back next month, but will look at another hotel!!!Okay...so looks like a very very nice hotel...but you just don't know. On our first night we met the producers from ghost asylum..I think that in itself says enough. This building is on a huge fault line. When you go up past the 10th floor..well number one you can see the lights flickering in the elevator..and the floor just isn't even..so uneven you feel like you're about to fall...you will even see the ""do not disturb signs"" on doors rattling. And once you do decide to see memphis...you will find that there are so many homeless it's so accepted that they have panhandling licenses for this..they will harass...follow..chase..yell...and even threaten you with knives. There are so many the police man told me ""well ma'am it isn't illegal to carry a knife""...oh ok sir certainly had no idea about the law..which is why I would approach you..concerned in the first place. Thank you memphis ""police."" If you must stay here stay under 10th floor and don't leave or you will be harassed by 100s of men.The staff at this hotel is the nicest hotel staff I have ever met.  They have customer service down.  Everyone you meet is so helpful and friendly.  We will definitely stay here again and you cannot go wrong by booking here.  The rooms are clean and do not smell.  The lobby is a great place to chill and enjoy a glass of wine.We chose the Sheraton so we would be close to all the downtown attractions. First, the room is clean and well appointed. It's also extremely noisy from the adjoining rooms so if you are expected a quiet night, it isn't likely. We stayed on the 17th floor, a club level room. The view would have been nice other than it appears as though the windows haven't been cleaned for over a year. The club level offers a breakfast on the 19th floor and it was a free for all. Too small for the number of guests, woefully understaffed so there was no busing of tables, LONG waits for any of the buffet food, just plain poorly managed, but then that would imply there was any presence of management.Sheraton is supposed to offer an upscale offering. This location doesn't. Next time I travel it's going to be a challenge to consider the Sheraton brand.This place is super cool. Great beds and even better surroundings. Close to the river. And a really cool trolly.","I visited the Sheraton in Memphis for a conference. It is located in close proximity to the downtown Memphis area. It is also the perfect hotel for conferences because it is connected to the Memphis Convention Center. The rooms are nice. After roaming the hotel, I realized that the side I was staying on was the older part of the hotel.  About 10 rooms from my room was I noticed newer rooms and different carpet. I'm assuming a renovation had happened or this part of the hotel was added. The bar was nice. It also offered food. The parking attendants/valet were excellent. We never had to wait long for our car. The hotel is large and very easy to get turned around. We noticed later that this hotel was a trolley stop. So I'll try to catch it on my next visit. If I were to stay in Memphis again, I'd likely stay here.I came here for a business Conf.. I expected atleast a decent staff and basic things to be good in the room.. I hated staying here.. Wouldn't recommend at all.. I came here for a business Conf.. I expected atleast a decent staff and basic things to be good in the room.. I hated staying here.. Wouldn't recommend at all..The hotel is undergoing renovations..was very hard to find the front door since there isn't one due to the renovations must check in in the back then ride an elevator up to the second floor...valet is $22 or u can park on the street at a meter which is free from 6p-8a or park across the street in the lot for $5 per park. I was given my room got to the room and the door was already open and the bed was unmade,..go back to front desk to get another room which the beds were made but the pillows were all on the floor luckily security was doing a walk thru and he saw the room called the front desk and they gave me another room all good right?? Wrong in the middle of the night we hear a loud boom like someone is trying to break the door down....nope just the ceiling in the bathroom falling down...go to front seat again this time they offer a $50 credit ugh!!! Not even an offer to change my room...the wall are extremely thin you hear everything...the food is extremely over priced...I will probably never stay at another Sheraton again in life one of my worst hotel experiences ever!!!When I buy the cheapest 4-star hotel I can find on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> in Memphis - I have pretty low expectations because well, I know I paid $104 a night for the place. Well, I was wrong. It's a bit of a mid 90's feel hotel in the interior but clean. The room was clean, but simple, and the dresser a little dated but clean and comfortable. I have to say the staff was overly nice. They smiled ALOT, the made sure I didn't need anything else and if I was enjoying my stay.. I asked for some extra pillows and within a minute or two they were there. And again asked, if I needed anything else. They asked if I needed recommendations for anything. They said thank you, and seemed like they really wanted to make sure all was good in my world while I was there, and it was. For the price, the location and the friendly staff, it's going to be hard to beat. I'll go back for sure. Tip: It's $22 to park plus tax.Trolley stop RIGHT outside doors of hotel - $1 to ride - can't beat it to any downtown attractions!! Loved it!Ordered food, or at least we thought we did, then 30-45 mins later the waitress comes up &amp; says ""I'm so sorry, but I totally forgot, was so busy, I haven't even put your order in yet."" NEVER AGAIN.room for a couple about $150 clean very comfortable great staff easy distance to Beale Street where all the Blues Music action is. The only thing isn't the Sheraton per se its the beggars and hustlers on main street on your way home from the bars and restaurant's that sucked...so catch the Trolley its a dollar pp each way its worth waiting for just so you don't get hassled by the local losers. in the daytime its all good. enjoy Memphis We DID.Staying here for two nights, not impressed with this hotel, I mean when you hear Sheraton you think upscale hotel but let me tell you this isn't the case here. While the lobby is nice, the room is old and the bathroom screams to be updated. Also $25 for parking per day!!!! Not cool. The bed on the other hand really nice and firm which was a plus. Overall I wouldn't consider this hotel next time in Memphis, for the money I could do better....This hotel is ... Slipping, and on the edge of bad. Nothing is truly poor, but everything is not quite running on all cylinders. Room wasn't made up on two different days during a four night stay. Breakfast buffet was the exact same thing each day and none of it really all that tasty or fresh. The dinner service was overloaded - plenty of open tables but not enough staff and sold out of key items on the menu (even ordering food to go takes 30-45 minutes). Front desk staff is, well not quite surly, but definitely not overflowing with friendliness. But then again, perhaps it's a perfect fit for Memphis - a sheen of hospitality, but lacking in so many regards.For a Sheraton you would think they would at least try. The hotel staff are children that have no customer service skills. The room had stains all over the ceiling. The shower head was falling out of the wall. Asked to get it fixed the staff just blamed one another. Then came to the room did a temp fix left didn't say sorry nothing. I would never stay in a Sheraton based in this visit and I stay in hotels at least half the year.Wonderful place to stay. Extremely friendly and helpful staff, very clean building and rooms, reasonably priced.My fiance and I visited the hotel on Feb. 6. He is in the military stationed in Little Rock and I am in NJ. We met in Memphis for the weekend to relax and spend some time together. First, let me say that the hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly (when we asked for things we needed). Unfortunately we stayed at the hotel during the same time that some sort of theater convention was being held. Not sure what it was exactly but from what I could gather, it seemed like a job fair for actors. A bunch of different auditions for shows being held at the same time.  On our first night there we were in a room that had an adjoining door to another room. We didn't think this would be an issue even though we didn't know the people next to us. At about midnight, we were woken up by the guys next door 'running lines' . They were not necessarily being loud but the thin walls and adjoining door made it sound like they were standing next to our bed. My fiance had to go over and ask them to keep it down because we were trying to sleep.  I also called the front desk that night to ask if it would be an issue to change our room in the morning. they said it would be no issue and just call in the morning to get a new room. The next morning, my fiance went down to get a new room key so we could start moving things. They told us they couldn't give us another room until we were ready to vacate the current room; just call the desk when we are packed up an ready.  Once we were showered, dressed and packed I called the front desk and was put on hold... for 20 min! I hung up, called back and was told they were busy with guests... uh, was I not a guest???  I then walked down to the front desk (where there was no crowd) and let them know I was not happy about wasting 20 min on hold when we had plans that day. Phyllis at the front desk was friendly and gave us a ticket for  a free breakfast for each of us.  We changed rooms and went on with our day. On our way back to our room later that day we realized that one of the rooms in our hallway was holding auditions in their room. At first this didn't seem like it would be a problem, but we soon realized it was because there was constant talking and traffic outside of our room and there were always people in the hallway when we needed to get by. Not to mention that the 'audition room' had a card table and wooden reindeer set up in the already narrow hallway. At times there were people waiting to audition sprawled our in the hallway reminiscent of a college dorm or something. it started to get annoying that we felt like intruders in a hallway and constantly having to walk around people.  The next morning we were woken up at 7am by our new neighbor practicing her singing exercise all morning.  We got up, went out for the day and when we returned around 4pm our room had still not been cleaned. We got dressed for dinner went out again and returned about 10pm. Room still not cleaned. OK, fine but we needed more towels. I called the desk and they said they would send more up. An hour later I had to call again and ask where our towels were because we wanted to go bed. They then sent them up within 10 mins.  We tried to sleep that night but starting at about 1am, the room above us were obviously practicing leaps and dancing routines for at least an hour. We couldn't sleep but we also didn't call the front desk because we didn't know exactly what room it was.  It seems as though many of the people there for the convention were unaware of common courtesy and hotel etiquette.  The next morning we used our free breakfast buffet coupon. It wasn't until we got the bill that we realized the coupon 'expired' the day prior. Why would you give something for our inconvenience and then only give us 12 hours to use it? We left it on the table with our bill and left before the waiter said anything to us. We went out that day, returned around 4 pm our room still wasn't cleaned. I called the from desk, again and was told they have til 5. We were out all day and we weren't going to leave for the housekeeper. I asked for more towels because we needed to shower and when they brought them up I asked if they could at least empty the trash since it has been 2 days.  I should mention that part of the reason we needed so many towels is that our shower constantly flooded our bathroom floor, regardless of how we positioned it.  I really feel that the hotel should have take precautions to make al guests comfortable during this type of convention. Maybe not allow auditions to be held in rooms or put all the audition rooms in the same hallway. Possibly put a curfew on auditions and 'practicing.""The parking situation there is a bit of a rip off at $22/day, but there is a lot that we parked at across the street. an EXTREMELY short walk that was HALF the price per day. The trolley was cheap but hours were VERY limited.  Probably wouldn't stay here again unless my company paid for it, not me.Hotel was nice people friendly but front counter staff were not trained or knowledgable. Took the lady 20 minutes to check us out and then gave us wrong directions to Graceland.  Beds are comfortable and showers are very nice. Their shower soaps and shampoos are very good quality.  Ordered French Onion Soup from the bar and it was excellent.  Club lounge was just o.k staff couldn't get the coffee machine to work but like most Sheratons they need to work on a better brand of coffee to serve.My husband and I visited this Sheraton location for one night, just a brief trip to see the basketball game for my birthday.  The staff was fantastic and the service far exceeded my expectations.  We were truly blown away by the excellent way we were treated.  They upgraded our room at no additional cost and even came by our room with a complimentary treat and hand-written card after the game.  I almost cried.  The room was really nice, warm &amp; toasty, with a wonderful view.  The bed was comfy, the shower was hot, and all of it was very clean.  Every place we went was a short trolley ride away, which was not expensive.  We will definitely be telling all of our friends and family about our experience.  We were very well-taken care of and will definitely be back.This place has some of the worst customer service ever.  Took 4 calls to get shampoos and towels up to the room and people were just not polite at all.  The reception area were rude and laughing at us for thinking we had 2 nights and they only had us for 1.  Never helped us to try and get another night there or at another hotel.  Every person I encountered had a horrible attitude and did not treat me with respect.  With that said, the hotel room was quite nice and I would stay at a place like this again, but not with the service.  Something needs to be changed there.  For $200 a night I expect great service, not what you will find here.My new husband and I stayed at this Sheraton for the tail end of our honeymoon. Coming from Nashville, Memphis is pretty much a dump but there were attractions that were exciting to us, so that's where we went. When we first got there, one of the valet/ porters helped us unload our suitcases and brought them into the lobby for us. I tipped him and thanked him, but he said he was also going to bring them up to our room for us. Once we checked in (less than 3 minutes later) the porter was nowhere to be found. We schlepped the bags ourselves, no big deal. The first room that they gave us (on the 14th floor) had no one from housekeeping in it, but there were dirty dishes, bedsheets and towels all over the floor like someone started cleaning and then left to do something else. This was also at about 5pm.. so it wasn't like we checked in at 8am. We called down to the desk and they said there would be no issue giving us another room that was ready for us. The room change was fast and they upgraded us to a slightly bigger room on the 15th floor with a better view and seating area that the first didn't have. The hotel was ok- nothing exciting but we were annoyed that EVERY SINGLE MORNING at exactly 8:20 AM the housekeeping staff would knock on the door and ask if they could come in to clean. There were no ""do not disturb"" things to put on the doorknobs so we answered every morning so they wouldn't come in while we were still in bed. The beds weren't <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomfortable.at&amp;s=4cb2de614a48efbcb63869283943afac96f5cadd333e690f2aeb169ff5e843f1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">comfortable.at</a> all- but as  plus they did have a pool, a fitness center, and free laundry facility ( you just had to provide soap). Location isn't ideal for everything in Memphis, but you can't go wrong with the $1 trolley stop right outside the hotel.Quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever experienced.  The hotel staff were very rude.I called to notify the hotel that I had received by mistake a reservation confirmation that belonged to someone else.  I must say, top of the line rude as hell telephone customer service agents, this includes the lady who transferred my call to Reservations!  No customer service skills at all.  To sum it up...UNPROFESSIONAL!enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton.  it was very comfortable, convenient and the staff was awesome!  the trollies stop right outside our door so we used them ALOT!  room was very nice!  we stayed memorial weekendThe hotel was going through some renovations. Front lobby was closed. Had to go to 2nd floor to check in. Not bad though. The only problem was jack hammers in the lobby first day. That noise went away for the weekend. The front desk was accommodating and gave us the corner room on 9th floor (view of city &amp; peak of river). The windows were all along the front and side of room. Very nice!!! The bed was awesome with white down comforters, down pillows and 40 or 42"" tv with cable.  The cable was fading in and out of signal, but not why I was on vacation to watch tv. The trolley was under maintenance and was looking forward to riding it. The bus replaced the trolley for $1.00 each way. This place is 9 blocks from Beale Street. We walked it sometimes and it wasn't all bad. The bus goes there if you want to wait for it. I wished the hotel would have gave us some freebies for putting up with trolley down and hotel renovations.  The adjacent room was not noise free. You could hear their tv and their baby. Not very quiet, but quiet than most hotels we've been in. I would recommend this hotel if you want to be away from it all. Nothing really to do in Memphis downtown other than Beale Street and Mud River Park. there is NO Shopping in downtown. Very strange downtown and dying out.My hat goes off to the front desk at this location.  They've consistently gone above and beyond the call of service during my visit. At 1:30 in the morning I went to the front desk to get change for a drink from the vending machine. Unfortunately they were unable to accommodate my request at this time of the morning. However, instead of settling for that answer the night manager, Jenette, called another department and asked them to open the gift store so I could purchase a drink and they'd charge my room.  As we awaited the other department to arrive I overheard the other front desk attendant named Kenyatta assist another guest request as respectful and polite as Jenette handled my dilemma. Upon exiting I thanked them all by saying ""three people and 10mins later no I have a tea drink and I am very happy."" Jenette responded ""no problem we want you to be happy."" I took the time to write this because believe they should be properly acknowledged from a customer level and a corporate level. I was unsuccessful in posting this comment on their corporate site so decided to post on Yelp.It may seem like a no brainer on the surface but I've worked in customer service and its not only about how they treat you but how they treat others when they don't know your paying attention.  The other guest request was just as crazy as my 1:30 request but they did their best to assist and didn't say anything bad about he or his request.This is the 20th city I've traveled to within the last month and this hotel experience has been the best by far. .J.R.","No rest for the weary here. In the a.m. an Army of cleaners invade the hallways replete w/very LOUD Walky-talkies and slamming of doors. Never mind that a guest arrived after midnight, each room gets loud a banging knocks and a question,""are you checking out today? No coordination/communication between front desk and cleaning staff.If this hotel expects to remain a 4 star hotel it needs to step up its game a bit. We stayed here while in town for my daughter's wedding Friday through Monday morning (checking out today). Here are things that I don't expect to see when I pay over $200 a night for a room: - dead ladybugs on the carpet (maid said they were a problem everywhere...matter of factly, no offer to help and no apology)- active ant activity in the bathroom (I didn't report, will upon checkout,I am allergic to raid and didn't need them making my eyes swell or stopping me up for the wedding events)-hardest bed I've ever slept in, pillows are the exact opposite, way too soft, no support- security is a HUGE issue, hubs is in the military, -as we walked in from a late night supper run, he commented on how shadowy the trolley side is at night and how anyone could walk in and access the elevators, etc, with no security guard in site. we get on the elevator and another lady runs on and says, "" Wow! Dangerous city! Two men were sitting outside on the curb, saw me coming in and came towards me, followed me in and I ran to the elevator!"" She came in on the trolley side. Hubs called the front desk, they said there was a guard??? and they take security seriously...uh, no you don't! They asked him if he would like to speak to security...uh, no, what security? We told them what floor the scared guest was staying, but they didn't seem to care. - Breakfast buffet is good, but for $18 I didn't think it was that special...- rooms have no menus for in house restaurants, only room service- laundry area has no vending for detergent, fabric softener,etc, - gift shop is actually a coffee stand...if you call a few (maybe 8) random t shirts a gift shop okay, they have a gift shop- tv was RIGHT by the bed....awkward and too close- stains on the ceiling in the room and bathroom- parking is wayyyy over priced- pool is under major renovation...okay, this is spring break time, reno should have been done in the dead of winter. They were jackhammering when we went to the gym. I feel sorry for the folks on that floor trying to rest- rooms don't get cleaned until very late in the day. One day ours didn't get done until 6:00 and we only asked for fresh towels, toliet tissue, and trash removalA few bright spots: - ALL staff was super friendly and eager to help(except the ladybug situation and the security issue) - valet parking staff is pretty dang good- super friendly and helpful- very convenient to downtown venues- trolley access a plus-if you call for extra towels, more tissue, etc it arrives quickly with a smile! - complimentary bottled water in room dailyWe don't usually stay a Sheraton hotels, this was our first time in at least 6 years that I can recall. I think we'll stick with the Marriott or Hilton chains next time so I can at least rack up reward points.Quiet, clean, extremely friendly and helpful staff, a short cab ride to Beale St!Just wanted to update after leaving to note that the rest of my stay was NOT any better.In fact, our entire conference lamented over group dinners about the number of issues this hotel still has to figure out.My room was never cleaned while I was there, the room service that I waited over two hours for was cold (shocker) and actually inedible (and, listen, I'm a phd student, I eat pretty much everything). The front desk staff admitted that they forgot to get things ready for the ""easy checkout"" so there was a HUGE line at 5 in the morning (and only one person working the desk) from people just trying to leave. The hotel bar didn't have drink menus because the staff said they ""hadn't made them yet"" (it seemed like the staff was equally upset at the new management). Post-conference, most of my peers found out they were charged incorrectly (some were charged DOUBLE, two were charged only $33/night for no apparent reason).In terms of complaints from our conference organizers: -They scheduled a BALL in a room right next to one of ours so halfway through an academic talk Justin Timberlake's ""Bringing Sexy Back"" started BLARING through the wall (I mean, ok, this was actually pretty funny, but come on Sheraton). -Similarly, there was a kitchen next to some of our conference rooms and people had to run out and ask the staff to stop screaming and singing at the top of their lungs because they were drowning out our speakers.-I guess scheduling the catering/food service was a nightmare (according to one organizer), and the ""breakfast"" that was offered was prepackaged muffins, which were awful. -From my own perspective, the cash bars that were assembled during poster sessions charged $12 FOR A GLASS OF HOUSE WHITE WINE. Are you kidding me? -Someone took off with one of the organizer's credit cards for about 4 hours for no apparent reason (it was supposed to be for room service? But she said they already had her card on file?)Long story short: Pretty much nothing service-wise went smoothly here. Hopefully reviews in the future will be more positive as they get their act together.",,"['giving', 'feel', 'lot', 'worse', 'past', 'weekend', 'attend', 'dance', 'convention', 'daughter', 'location',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-hotel-memphis-2,Hilton Hotel,3.0,$$,73,"I've never stayed here (except for one night in 2003 when I was a Princess in Cotton Carnival and needed to sleep the night's festivities off...aka I don't really remember anything about the room because I was a blacked out 19 year old),  but I've been here abagillion times to attend parties, banquets, fundraisers, etc. And I was here this past Saturday for an annual banquet aka the same event reproduced down to the last detail every year. The ballroom is standard and the staff is always lovely. I've never been too impressed with the food, but the facilities are clean, so that makes me happy. I think their rental fees are slightly overpriced, but, again, this is a super safe bet if you book an event here. I don't have anything bad to say, but there's nothing particularly memorable or special either.Stellar customer service, affordable hotel, free self-parking, and proximity to the East Memphis business district were key factors in my selection of this Hilton location. It was obvious that hotel management ensured their staff had proper training on customer service etiquette. We were amazed by the level of friendliness and courtesy shown by hotel staff members on a daily basis. Being visitors from out of town, we felt very welcomed from our arrival to departure. We decided to stay on the lower floor to be able to freely use the stairs when needed, to save time waiting on the elevators and to get some healthy cardio in since we would be dining out for meals. We did get to ride up in the elevator all the way to the top of the hotel when someone inadvertently selected the wrong floor and it surely was a grand, scenic view of the city! The standard king room, although comfortable and clean, was more compact than rooms we have stayed in at Holiday Inn Express or Marriott Courtyard. Unfortunately, the room was not equipped with a mini-fridge nor microwave so do keep that in mind if you require these amenities. I did appreciate the gorgeous full-length mirror in the hallway, which was all I needed to get all dolled up for our nights out exploring Memphis. The hotel bar was a nice place to meet up friends for drinks, but drinks were overpriced, as to be expected. The lobby was very spacious with ample seating available and festively decorated for the holidays. There was a small business center area with computers for public use. The hotel was pet-friendly as we saw a handful of families with their pets inside the hotel. Outside of the hotel was a walking area with a pond and gazebo, in dire need of a facelift. The outdoor pool looked inviting but the cold weather prevented us from going out there. There was an event each night we were there, but the influx of people did not interfere with our stay. The fitness center was actually one of the nicer ones I've seen in a hotel and we made use of it a couple of time during our stay. The hotel does show some wear and tear but we were glad to see they were undergoing much-needed renovations. One downside with room for improvement was the parking lot. The confusing layout of the parking lot could be hard to navigate without signs to clearly direct people, and there was limited parking available close to the lobby entrance. We did not mind parking far and walking, but if you were traveling with young kids or older adults, it might not be the best option in terms of easily going to/from your vehicle.All in all, we were more than happy with the convenience of the hotel's location and nearby proximity to restaurants and shopping centers off Poplar Avenue. We dined out about 4-5 times along Poplar Avenue at local restaurants. With it being the holidays, we didn't really have to worry about sitting in traffic on the interstate to grab lunch or dinner. I would recommend the Hilton East Memphis for the value, location, and excellent customer service.Southern hospitality at its finest. I have yet to walk by an employee who has not greeted me in one fashion or another. The rooms are not the newest and greatest but it's very clean, comfortable, and I definitely recommend this hotel. We have a great view and considering that this hotel is one of the only tall buildings in the immediate area, I'm guessing every room has just as an outstanding view as ours.Lobby is huge and spacious. Haven't tried the gumbo at the restaurant downstairs yet but hubby says its one of the best he's had. They are undergoing construction in one area of the hotel right now and evidently there will be a pizza bistro going in.The bistro service was beyond excellent but unfortunately you can't stay with them. The elevators were down the first night we got in. We walked 23 flights down from our room the first night. The soda in the machines were outdated. The was no insulation in the room. That is pictured. The down comforter was stained. That is pictured. Just wondering what it would take to replace something. Overall I hate the hotel mediocre.We had a great stay here in June for a friend's wedding. Every time we entered the lobby, the staff greets you warmly. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. This is why I generally love any Hilton. There was a huge conference here the weekend we stayed, but the facility was always clean. The only down-side was two of the four elevators broke down on a check-out Sunday when the 300+ guests from the conference were checking. My friends and I subsequently were late for our reservations. Some of us took the stairs from the 11th floor in heels. Others waited 20+ minutes for an elevator. This is an average Hilton. I love staying at the Hilton, so no real complaints. We even got lucky each night with a parking so close enough to the lobby (the parking lot was always full, even after the weekend).There's a Target &amp; several stores &amp; restaurants right across the highway. Very convenient location.The price and location were right, which is what led me to this hotel for a recent visit to Memphis.  As others have mentioned, the hotel is a bit dated and in need of freshening up.  I am happy to report that the lobby does appear to be under construction to improve the experience.  The staff was super friendly.  I was able to check in early and get a little work done unexpectedly.  The room itself was in much better shape than the common areas of the hotel.  There was a decent sized vanity area, which was helpful, however the bathroom itself was a bit compact.  If you have a fear of heights, ask for a lower floor.  The elevators are on the outside of the building and are a bit like an amusement park ride.  As you approach the hotel from I-240, there is a sign giving you instructions on how to get to the hotel.  Were it not for that sign, I definitely would have gotten myself lost.  Thankfully GPS was on the right track, so would definitely suggest plugging in the address if unfamiliar with the area.  Once you enter, you are in the portion of the parking lot that is the farthest from the entrance, so it is worth trying to drive back towards the entrance.  Initially, you won't see any signs directing you to the lobby area, but that changes as you head farther back.  In a perfect world, there would be more directional signs as the layout of the hotel from the exterior is a bit confusing.Disappointing stay. We consistently stay at Hilton properties and rarely have bad experiences. The staff was great -- welcoming and friendly as we arrived. Three of the four elevators weren't working. There are 25 floors in this hotel and a conference (or two) happening in the adjoined convention facility. We waited 15-20 minutes for elevators going both directions. Our shower in our room didn't drain at all.There was only one towel left in our room for us. I hope this is an off day for them, but it was a frustrating instead of relaxing stay.Average hotel all around (I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could)... under usual Hilton standards, but still a good place to stay for the price!!! While visiting Memphis I decided to stay here and it was an enjoyable time. Once landing at the airport, I called the hotel for a shuttle right and they were right there as I walked out of the airport.The hotel itself; lobby, common areas, gym, etc are slightly dated... think early 2000s, but you're not actually paying an arm and a leg to stay here, so it's petty nice for the price. To me the service was very friendly, despite what the other reviews have stated, I actually thought the service was spot on.The room is awesome! Make sure to get a higher level room so you can enjoy the view. The rooms are clean, spacious, and the beds are super comfy. Would I stay here again, yes... if the price was right!Location is the perk of this hotel and the employees. Other than that, Iwont come back and for a Road Warrior, I highly recommend do not stay here.Upon arriving at this hotel I was incredibly pleased with it's appearance and the customer service I received from every employee I encountered.  My first annoyance came with the realization that there was no mini-fridge or microwave in the room.  I felt like for the rate I paid, these things should be included in amenities.  The deal breaker came at night when I tried to go to sleep.  This hotel must have the thinnest walls/floors of any hotel I've ever been in.  I could hear every door slam to what felt like every room around me all night long.  I was here to run the St. Judes Marathon, and really needed a good night's sleep.  Needless to say that did not happen.  It was so incredibly disappointing.  It was a very nice room, but the main reason we all stay at hotels is so we have a place to sleep and since that didn't happen for me here I can only give it 1 star.Although I haven't stayed in one of the rooms (I was born and raised around the corner), I recently went here for an interview. I was extremely impressed!!! Haven't seen a nice hotel like this in the area. Extremely clean and very nice front desk staff!! Meeting rooms are nice and there are also little TVs telling you which room has what event going on in them. If I ever need a hotel in this area I will be staying in this hotel or at least recommending it!Every time I come to memphis this is my hotel if choice. Awesome view of the city from high up, great hotel staff, beautiful entrance. The pool and workout area is very nice. The rooms are not family rooms their a bit small if you have children but if it's just you and wifey you will love it............ The breakfast is average it hits the spot and there is more than enough to get you going.The view of the lake is so sweet it puts you in a relax state of mind while enjoying breakfast.This review is simply about the upkeep of the public spaces at this particular Hilton Hotel. This is NOT a review of the restaurants or the rooms not staff. It is entirely about the state of the way our group is shuffled around from conference room to conference room and the sad state of the restrooms. I attend a monthly meeting at this hotel. We pay a LOT for use of a conference room and we are often moved around and placed in rooms that are not adequate in size with a giant post in the center of the room which is very inconvenient for our meetings. Many times there is no other conference being held in the hotel but we get sent to this terrible room. One would thing that they would appreciate the every month commitment but apparently not so much. Now about the bathrooms. Bathrooms drive me crazy! Does no one care about the sad state of the restrooms in a public venue such as this?  Apparently at one time they had huge crowds and prepared for that by building huge bathrooms (I think the ladies room on the lower level where all the banquet rooms are has about 15-20 stalls.) yet the photos will show the terrible disrepair of some of the stalls. It's not like they got this way over night, I've been attending my monthly meetings for almost 3 years now and the issues have remained unchanged. But then again, this is only a 3 hotel yet I'll bet their prices reflect more of a 5 star!  It is fancy-schmancy on the surface but apparently no one there cares about the sad bathrooms. Enjoy the pics.Can't beat a $70.00 (tax included) <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> weekend deal! Nice lobby with newly renovated guest rooms and comfortable beds. Throw in free self park and a complimentary airport shuttle (6:00am-10:00pm) and I am one happy traveler!Notes: Pets up to 75 lbs allowed for an extra $50.00.Midtown and Downtown are a 20 minute drive.Memphis International Airport is 10 miles away.Staying at this hotel really feels like you're in Memphis (instead of another hotel) and is smack in the middle of midtown with tons of great affordable restaurants within two miles. The Hilton staff was very friendly and our room had all the creature comforts you'd expect from this hotel chain. Despite being a chain , this hotel still had a local feel and some unique southern touches. The bistro restaurant downstairs is a tad pricey but the tables by the windows offer a great view of the outdoor fountain and geese. Our entrees were prepared well and tasted fine. Also, the wifi (which was free with a coupon) and elevators are super duper fast and they have four computers with laser printer in the lobby for business. The fitness room was clean and had a variety of machines.When we arrived we discovered that we were booked for a Double Room instead of King bed. Quentin was awesome! He placed us in a room with a King bed. In addition, I requested a room on an upper floor and he accommodated with putting us on the 20th floor - PERFECT. The room was spacious. The bed was comfortable. Housekeeping was awesome! They provided us with additional towels, tea, and cups daily. The location was good. There is a Target and Panera Bread near by as well as other restaurants nearby that are good.Fabulous room with a great view of a large flock of Canadian geese, which our Chihuahua and Shi-poo watched from our window! Although our room was not cleaned one day, Ms. LaWinter at the front desk made everything better! In addition, Pat Balfour, our waitress in the Rook Restaurant, was fabulous! Both of these fine employees deserve a thank you and a pat on the back for jobs well done! Got a great deal on PriceLine that was about half the normal rate!If I could negatively rate this hotel I would.  The hotel itself could use some work.  The staff is not willing to help in any way. The lady at the front desk had a sign next to her that said something like if you are not satisfied let us know and we'll make it right.  YEAH right.  I brought my issue to their attention more than once and was blown off like I didn't matter.  From the restaurant to the front desk HORRIBLE hotel and WORST customer service of any Hilton by far.Did not stay here, thankfully. We were already booked at a hotel nearby. We were here for a convention. The restaurant is only open until 2 pm, hard to find. Where in the US is there a Hilton restaurant that doesn't remain open all day, particularly with a big convention taking place in their space. We were shuffled to the upstairs lobby hotel, where the bartender continued to ignore us, even while standing directly in front of us. He had less than 6 customers at the bar, yet couldn't find time to acknowledge us or thanks us for waiting. Pathetic service for a Hilton Hotel. We walked to a nearby hotel for lunch. Never again.Used to love this hotel. Till my daughters bathing suit got stolen from houSe keeping ! I mean who steals a kids bathing suit ! PleaSe be careful staying here. House keepers here r thieves !","This is the 2nd time staying in this hotel.  I always enjoy my time each and every time.  The entire staff is always very friendly and helpful.  I enjoy the fact that they allow dogs.  I will definitely be staying again in the future.Very nice hotel with a gracious staff. Shower need replacing desperately!The best part was the breakfast, a tad slow service but WELL worth it. Homemade hash browns.The hotel is very dated, the restaurant downstairs called the rook is awful, you can't get seated and when you do you will pay 16 dollars for powdered eggs which aren't even stirred up. I always stay in the hilton chain but I will never stay at this location again.I actually think it should get three and a half stars but I'm giving it 4 because one employee went way over above and beyond to help me. My room was very typical of a Hilton room so I have no problem with that. liked the headboard and the decor of the room Lobby definitely was very pretty but the parking is not what I expected. A bad parking space is a really bad parking space.  Sort of surprised that there was no covered parking. The bellhop got my bags and also went to get my car and discovered a flat tire. He went out of his way to get the air compressor and get it filled up enough to get me to the local Goodyear. Definitely made the experience greatHad to rush to Memphis due to my mom being sick. Diabetic but not taking her medication. Getting the wrong dietary information from her doctors. This is really stupid by the way. How you going to tell her she can drink juice and eat bread. (things you are giving her at the hospital) and then complain that her sugar isn't going down. I really need to write a review about that St. Francis Hospital. We picked the Hilton because it was right next to the Hospital. Thanks to Hotel Impossible, we can't help but to critique any hotel we get going forward. Normally it is no big deal, but this place started off really bad. As soon as we walked into the room we noticed the room had an odor. My wife walked into the bathroom and ran out saying the bathroom is dirty and the toilet wasn't flush. Checked myself and noticed their was urine everywhere. Yikes. We left Rm. 1203 and called the front desk that we had to be moved somewhere else. The front desk apologized and got us into a new room and a gift bag with an apology card in 5 minutes thanks to Kristal at the front desk. When we left the room the cleaning lady was outside and also apologized. The main lobby actually looks pretty awesome. There is a large water sculpure and the furnture around it are a modern style. At night the lobby has strobe lights that changes color that looks pretty cool. The Gym isn't bad. Treadmill and bikes have there own tv's attached and there are complimentary earphones. (they come wrap in plastic) Dumbbells go up to 50 pounds. Which isn't the norm, usually you are lucky to get 25 lbs. A nice fly machineHD TV with actual HD channels. Is it silly when you go to a hotel and they have HD tv, running on standard definition channels and it really looks bad. Might as well go with a regular tv if you are going to do that. After hours rant*After running around to get things my mom needed and eating out tired but ready for a drink me and wifey decided to check out the bar and experienced high comedy. I guess there was a lady that was talking about her child and how hard it was to be a mom. Then she started yelling at some dude about the fact that he was a dude or something. (hard to understand her in this drunkin state) The dude started going off about how people are good people and that he is a good person. But not everyone are good people. A few other people chimed in. Someone stood up and started yelling at someone (not sure why and I don't think they knew why either. (the person yelling or the person being yelled at)) Needed a good laugh and I got one. End After hours rant*Check out kind of sucked. When we got there we asked the check in lady about wifi. She said there is complimentary wifi. But I guess she thought that meant they have it if you pay for it. It is actually complimentary if you have a HHonors members. We are members but didn't know we had to use it. Check out was an extra 30 mins because they had to call to see if they could use our Hilton account (they couldn't) Then they had to find out how to remove it from our bill (because we were not going to pay it) Next time I am in Memphis I will probably go someplace else.Just ok.....The lobby is beautiful but the rooms are very average. The vanity has been updated but the tub is still old school. I have had some pretty annoying stays here... The floor to ceiling windows were leaking.... Housekeeping didn't show up before 5:30 PM!.... Room service takes a very long time..... Parking is always a hassle and usually need to walk a ways.  This isn't my number one choice but it's not horrible. It may be great for an event because the ballrooms are large.Stayed for a weekend. It qwas overbooked with Family reunions &amp; wedding parties. I could not rest due to the noise level off kids running down the hallway. People next door were loud.  For a seemingly upscale hotel,they have absolutely nothing in the rooms. If you wanted a frig or microwave, they charge you per night. That's the basics that come with most  hotels /motels. There is no continental breakfast etc. Bar is over priced for watered down drinks.   If you come in after a certain hour, you have to walk quite a distance to get into the front entrance because your key does not get you in from the back like most places. Security cameras does not c over all directions............If I  had to say something positive, the staff is extremely nice,knowledgeable and accommodationing. The view. ( depending on your room location) is nice........My advise is to ask what they have going on and to put you away from the action unless that's what you like.The service was nice downstairs. But the actual guest rooms were just awful! The rooms were so small and cramped. Our bathroom walls had water damage and I didn't feel comfortable showering in the tub. Additionally, the room had a faint smell of smoke or some other odor (like wet dog and mold). They say free wifi but when you go to log in they say you need to pay per day. Just call the front desk and they will give you a complimentary wifi coupon code. No free breakfast (I'm sorry, but I thought that was standard!) And slightly far from any main attractions in Memphis. If I am ever back in Memphis, I will not be returning to this hotel. HOWEVER- If you need a church to go to for Sunday morning I recommend Saint Louis Church, it was near the hotel and it was a really beautiful and moving experience.Room okay but concierge lounge was unstaffed and no drinks.  Lobby is inviting but Lobby bar was out of most everything. Women bartender angela was a total bitch beyond belief... Appeared to be suffering major case of hemorrhoids.  Could not make basic drink.  Food was cold and tasteless--- salmon burger. Other than that, just dandy.The bed alone could be a four star!  The Hilton experience is defiantly present in the decor, toiletries and shower experience.  This hotel is near the airport and across from a strip mall full of stores and eateries.  It is twenty minutes from downtown and one exit from Graceland.  Downside the cleaning staff did not replenish the room at all and only laid a stack of towels on the desk?  It also took thirty minutes to check in.  Other than that fabulous main area and stay!The service was great, from bellhop, to security, to the front desk.   We really appreciated the fact that there was security patrolling the parking lots since it made the entire experience better.However, when arriving at the room, I have to say that there was something more to be had.  Judging by the neighbors and carpet, we were stuck in a ""pet friendly"" room since we had pets.  That's fine and all, but if you look at the pictures of the carpeting and furnishings, it seemed like we had been thrown into a second rate room, but paying what everyone else paid along with a $50 pet fee (to be expected at all Hilton chains that take pets).Kind of a let down for accommodations when the service was actually pretty nice.  I would probably suggest at least re-doing the carpeting and perhaps putting insulation into the walls so that you can't hear everything that goes on between rooms.I've stayed at Hilton Hotels at other cities.  This is by far the least impressive branch.  The rooms have an overall dinghy feeling.  The first time I stayed here,  my flight wasn't landing till midnight.  I called ahead and pre ordered food. At first,  the receptionist couldn't even tell me what was on the restaurant's menu.  She transferred me to two different departments she suggested I talk to.  Unfortunately,  none of them were available to respond.  Finally,  I asked that she order a simple burger.  I made it clear that I had been traveling for 10 hours and really needed this meal ordered before the restaurant closed since I hadn't eaten all day. She assured me that it wouldn't be an issue.  When I arrived, I was very disappointed to learn that they couldn't put my order in because I wasn't available to sign for it. I was amazed that the front desk clerk would not know this  policy and did not try to make an accommodation under the circumstances. When I've done this at other hotels, it was never an issue. I returned to stay at this hotel two weeks later. I discovered that my room much like my previous stay was not properly cleaned. There were stains and remnants of other people's hair on the phone, dink and toilet,   the sheet had a really bad encrusted stain in it. I did not discover the stain until the night before I was checking out otherwise I would have reported it. I hate going to hotels where I don't feel comfortable touching anything without gloves. This hotel makes some of the much cheaper brands look WAY more appealing and it is an overall disappointment to the Hilton brand.  I have to travel on Memphis on business frequently and  in the future, will ask my company to have me stay elsewhere.  The staff is also very unfriendly.The lobby is designed in such a way that even if there are only 20 people milling about in the bar (it's very open), it sounds as though there are 200. This isn't Hilton's fault, this building has been 5 other hotels previously.  But it made me want to avoid that part of the hotel.The staff were very friendly and helpful and were happy to recommend good Memphis eats.This seems to be one of the few upscale hotels in Memphis that is also cat friendly, though to the tune of a $50 nonrefundable fee. I think that is excessive, particularly when they claim to be ""pet friendly."" (I checked, and it's the same for dogs, who can weigh up to 75 lbs.)We lucked out and were given a room on the P floor (""first floor"") which is right on the water (the hotel is surrounded by a ""moat"" with geese and ducks). They also gave us a code for the wifi, which I don't think is always free? Hard to tell.They do lose major points for seeming to have a great pool and spa, but it doesn't open til NINE. They have a fitness center that opens at 5am, but many people prefer to use the pool in the early morning, certainly before families come and overtaken it. Particularly since the fitness center hours are right below the sign for the pool and spa in the lobby, I found it very misleading.A wonderful room, great view and an excellent staff. A nice quiet escape but still close to downtown Memphis. Great Hotel!Nice location, great amenities, good service! No complaints. There was a conference in the meeting room on the ground floor. I was hungry after working out, and so in my sweaty gym clothes I walked right through a bunch of people in suits (they were having a business conference in the hotel) and b-lined to the desserts table and scrounged up some yummy brownies. SCORE!This is the average hilton, with an extended conference center. Expect rooms to be on par with airport Hilton's or the average Hampton inn. The breakfast center at Rooks is a nice touch, downstairs from the tower which contains all the rooms. The lobby and foyer has a nice seating area and bar.Of you are going to hold a conference here, the center downstairs is adequate. One thing to consider is that the staffing levels for a venue that size is fairly small. So if you need something quickly you may have to hunt for a coordinator to help you out.All in all a decent Hilton, especially for events.This is a very nice option when staying in Memphis.  It's not downtown, however, so keep that in mind.  Have always experienced friendly service and a decent room for the price.  Very pretty building, lobby and water moat around the outside of the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.Let me preface this review by saying that the staff at the Nashville Hilton was extremely friendly and helpful at all times.  I was surprised and disappointed by the aesthetics of the lobby and the room that I stayed in.  The lobby furniture is old and worn out and looks like a throwback to the 80s.  The bar in the lobby had fruit flies buzzing around that we had to continually swat so that we could enjoy our appetizers and drinks.  The hotel room had a shabby, old headboard that was split and coming apart.  The full wall windows overlooking the pond was continually covered with condensation and the water that collected on the old rug permeated our suitcases (we didn't realize at first that the rug was all wet).  My roommate complained about the smell of mold and had a headache the entire time we were there.  This hotel should have been a lower end motel, not a Hilton.Good location next to I-240 and blocks from Germantown but on a quiet business street.Small bathroom. The design of the building is unique in that it is circular so Hilton had to be creative.Hallway - with hotels - 2 doors are built directly next to each other so if someone knocks on the door of the next room - the echo within the hallway makes you believe someone is knocking on your door.Bathroom - Surprised the sink is in the common area and not within the bathroom. ""within the bathroom"" is a toilet and tub in a room/confined space. Not much room to do more than that.Using the hot tub/whirlpool, I was disappointed. It did not feel as clean as other Hilton properties (grant it, it was 9PM) but the temperature was also not very warm. It was lukewarm at best and left much to be desired on this cool night.Parking - others have said it. There are about 20-30 spots relatively close to the door. Otherwise, you will be walking down a slight slope (not hill) to reach your vehicle. On weekends, it can be crowded and a good 2-3 min walk from the front door of the hotel to car.Bonuses: Hotel gave me free internet for my stay (but I was staying on a corporate account). Lobby sundry shop is open til 11PM.The rooms are just ok.  I'm a diamond at Hilton and I've stayed in better rooms.  For frequent travelers to Memphis, I would recommend the Hyatt.  The Hilton is just too much trouble with the elevators and keeping your stuff there for long term stays.The breakfast is good because they serve hot foods and all the water you can take!","On a business trip that I booked 3 weeks ago and I'm currently sleeping in a pull out bed due to overbooking. No pillows at all in the room and there are tiny LED lights above the bed shining down that cannot be turned off... My thoughts echo those of the other 1 star reviews.Lobby nice but by the elevators you're back to 1970 Elvis style. The elevator environs need upgrading. My room was nice, service staff nice and helpful. Hilton needs to invest money to bring it up to 2014. Food options very limited for a hotel this size. Pool area pretty parking goodOnce again, I am not sure about all of the negative reviews of this place.  I had a great stay over Liberty Bowl weekend, which was VERY busy.We arrived from a very long drive (all the way from Iowa) around 6:30pm on Saturday night.  We were greeted by a bellman who helped load up our stuff to take upstairs.  Although the lobby was busy (and not overly loud like everyone else said), there was no wait at the front desk.  The check-in process took only a few minutes, and the Gentleman that assisted us was very friendly.  Although, when I asked for change (to tip the bellman), the agent told me he didn't have any. I asked the next person and they also said they didn't have change - um, HELLO?! What gives.  They said another guest had just ""wiped them out,"" doesn't that mean you should go get change for your bank? (I work in a hotel and would NEVER tell a guest just flat out ""no."")We were given a room on the 24th floor.  Over the course of the weekend, the elevators were very busy and some were a bit old and creaky (scary).  They really need to be updated.  Our room was nice, nothing spectacular, but a typical room.  The bed was very comfortable and we had everything we needed.We ordered room service for dinner one night, and for breakfast one morning.  I was not impressed by the menu, or by the fact that it was only available until like 10pm.  This is 2013 - your room service should be available 24 hours a day!  Especially since the menu was very basic.  When the food was delivered, the server told us just to place the tray in the hallway when we were done and they would pick it up.  I did so later, and also place the breakfast order sheet on the door, but checked back after awhile and both were still there.  So I had to call the front desk to ensure both were picked up - since I don't believe they would have been and we wouldn't have had breakfast the next day.We did go to the hotel bar one night.  The bartenders were friendly, but very unprofessional.  It was pretty busy, but they were telling everyone they were probably going to close early, because it had been slow all day (??)....They had a limited selection - one of my friends asked what champagne they had and she (the bartender) just laughed and showed her the 2 bottles, neither of which I've heard of.  They did have Yuengling on tap, which I can't get in Vegas, so I was pretty happy.  The one weird thing was when we went back to the front desk to settle our bill.  My friend and I were splitting the charges and thought it would be pretty easy (once again, I work in a hotel and deal with this daily).  Well, we were assisted by a front desk manager, since there was a line - and it took her approximately 10 minutes to even log on to the computer and get our room number.  Once I explained what we needed to do, she said it wasn't possible until that night's room and tax charges had posted.  This makes no sense to me, but whatever - we had to go back in the morning.  Meanwhile, they are still holding a large amount of money on my debit card, which really hampered my bank account on the trip home.  Also, the front desk manager gave me a 1pm late check out (normal check out is at noon) and advised me if I needed later to let her know.  I realized that this would leave me waiting in the lobby for awhile until I caught the airport shuttle (which leaves every hour), so I called the front desk in the morning asking to extend it to 1:30pm.  I was told by the girl that it was not possible.  I explained that I was told the night before that it wouldn't be an issue and she very rudely responded ""well, fine, if that's what the Manager said.""  Wow, thanks!When settling the bill at check out, I was not really sure that it was handled properly, but made sure to get a receipt showing that my friend had paid half on her credit card, and that only the other half was charged to my card.  Still waiting on that refund.....For some reason I thought this hotel was downtown at first, and when I was double checking the hotel info/location I looked at the reviews....which I admit got me a little nervous about staying here. I agree with the recent review by Teri W where I don't see much reason for the negative reviews.  I'm on the 21st floor and the room is clean, carpet is newer and the decor is that of a hotel...not a motel :)It is the older circular style building, but the interior is well maintained.  Bathrooms are modern - shower/toilet room is a little cozy, and the hot water pressure makes for a nice shower.Whew!SLOWEST FRONT DESK CHECK-IN EVER!  We checked in early on a Saturday morning (2am), there were tons of people milling about in the gigantic and very loud lobby area and it took the one desk person over 30 minutes to check in the 3 people ahead of us.  This experience with the front desk was pretty consistent for our whole trip - it always took forever to get to the front of the line.  The lobby is garishly decorated and the moat outside is hideous, looking like someone dumped 50 gallons of teal colored paint into an otherwise nice moat.  The stay was comfortable and the view was pretty good when staying on one of the higher floors.  The bathroom was hard to maneuver in because of the strange orientation of the door and toilet.  Room was definitely not as nice as other Hiltons I've stayed at.We did initially stay on the first floor, which gave us an expansive view of the gross moat, but then had to move up to the 23rd floor because our room, mysteriously, started smelling intensely of cigarette smoke (non-smoking room).  The workout room is nice, similar to other Hiltons.  As for location, don't stay here if you want to get to any of the typical tourist sites (Beale Street, Graceland, Zoo, Sun Studio, etc) in less than 15-25 minutes of highway driving.  There was nothing wrong with the room itself, a fairly comfortable hotel room but I wouldn't stay here again because of the insanely loud lobby, extremely slow service and hideous common area decor.NO FREE WIFI :(Was here for a  training meeting for work. Rooms are not spacious, but comfortable. Bathroom clean, with good water pressure for shower. Big flat screen tv, and wi-fi access provided. Breakfast at their restaurant was good, with omelets made to order, or an extensive buffet. Coffee refills a little slow. The food they provided for our training session of about 90 people was very good. Staff is friendly and efficient. They do provide a free shuttle from the airport. Hotel is in a safe area with a big, free parking lot. Overall decor is nice and hotel looks up to date and well maintained.Greeting Hilton Honors,I was going to get my status with Hilton Honors back to Gold by the end of the year. I have been spending most of my time in Marriotts and Hyatts, lately.My two most recent stays in The Memphis Double Tree and The Garden Inn in Frankfurt were excellent. I needed to work in Memphis, TN on 09.09.2013.Late afternoon 08.08.2013, I booked a last minute room at the Hilton Memphis East. I have stayed there before and it was just OK.When I finished my job at a local hospital early, my company sent me to another location. I called to cancel and Hilton Honors told me I had to call the hotel.I called the number and no one answered the phone. Since I was only a mile away, I drove to the Hilton.I was then informed that I was going to have to pay the penalty of one full night. After the desk clerk spoke with the manager, it was dropped in half.OK, I am good with only having to pay half. If it were any other hotel including most Hilton, I would have until 1600-1800 to cancel day of arrival.I was told the General Manager of this location sets the policy.Well you can thank this general manager.I will. Because of his decision, I will now become Platinum with Marriott and hit Gold with Hyatt.Please feel free to watch my Hilton Honors account.It will not be exciting as there will be an extended period of inactivity.With an industry which is so full of Hotel options, one would think that Hotels would want to do everything possible to retain repeat business travelers.Memphis Hilton must not need return guests and they don't seem to care about future travelers visiting other Hilton properties in the future.We prepaid for a room through Amex and called at 6pm to let them know we would be arriving in town a little late.  We went to check in and no rooms were available.  Do you want to risk staying here?  I won't again.I am a travelling consulting and frequently stay in Hilton hotels, so my review might be a little weighted.  In summary, the Hilton Memphis is acceptable, but I wouldn't recommend it.The Good:Breakfast:  The breakfast was free (for HHonors members) and everything was fresh and tasty except for the occasional watery eggs.  The coffee was fresh and the breakfast lounge was usually busy with a lot of people.Appearance:  The hotel looks very nice.  During the day it looks classy and elegant, and at night it looks hip and trendy with all of the accent lighting and everything.The Bad:Parking:  The parking lot is designed in a way that you need to arrive to the hotel before 4:00pm in order to find an open spot within 100 feet of the hotel entrance.  Otherwise, you'll be looking for spots along one long strip with parking spots on each side.Food:  I ordered from the hotel restaurant twice.  The first time I ordered a BBQ burger, medium-rare, and it came to me charred and well-done.  The second time I ordered a normal hamburger, medium-rare, and received the same result, except that it took a whole 45 minutes to cook my burger.  The McDonald's down the road can cook a better burger in 2 minutes.  I expect much better from a hotel of the Hilton brand, and this disappointed me.Room Service:  One evening I decided to order a sundae dessert (ice cream on top of a microwaved brownie) and the lady on the phone said I should receive it in 20 minutes.  I actually fell asleep while waiting for the brownie to come, which ended up taking nearly 90 minutes to show up at my door.Since my stay at the Hilton I contacted the hotel management who stated that their Food and Room Service problems have been addressed.  I don't have a lot of confidence in this, since it's probably a staffing issue and I doubt they fired their entire kitchen and room service staff.  So this could be better now... but don't say I didn't warn you!Comfortable, Clean, FriendlyI called for a shuttle, was told it should be there in 20 minutes, 50 minutes later I ended up taking a taxi for $27.We took the shuttle to a restaurant, called for pickup, it was at over an hour to come. The restaurant closed, and we were told that it is a normal thing to have to wait forever on the shuttle.We were waiting outside, and then the shuttle driver told us that is a bad section of town.Lobby is beautiful.  Parking was a hassle. Executive Platinum happy hour and breakfast were amazing.  Great area.  The best service we've had at any Hilton.I recently attended an event at Hilton Memphis.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We had dinner that was served during the event - think a lot of speeches and awards.  The wait staff was quick to retrieve old plates, give the next course and fill glasses, with very little disruption to the event happenings.  There weren't many options for food, which was the event planners decision.  We were given the option of vegetarian or a chicken entree.  Everyone had good things to say about the food.  As far as the banquet room goes, it was pretty standard.  Not, knock your socks off, swanky, but not tacky, either.  All in all, I enjoyed myself.  No complaints, whatsoever.Computers down at peak check in. Waited over 15 minStaff nice but unsure what to doAsked for a comp and was not offered. Person I traveled with checked in at a different station was given free drink and breakfast.  I am a freq hilton honors...not good move on Hilton's partThis is a strange hotel. It has some really nice and fancy aspects while other things were very run down. The biggest issue was the crappy parking lot. The front door is up a long driveway that has no parking near it. So you have to walk through a very large parking lot which was a blast the night it was pouring rain.The rooms are nice, but are a strange size. The seals on the giant window walls are also shot so there are some serious drafts if you leave the curtains open. The bar was nice, but a bit on the expensive side.The room were very nice and the bar in the lobby was a plus. The Hotel itself is pretty modern and the lobby is massive with a cool water fountain in the middle. The bar is a little pricey but it is convenient. It is also within walking distance of a Benihana's and a few other restaurants. It is not close to downtown but it was a great place to stay while on business!Read my earlier review for details on the horrible stay I'd previously experienced.  My new rating is really 2.5, but since we can't do half stars, I'll push it up, rather than down.First - let me update on the final results of my bad stay.  I was contacted through YELP by the hotel manager, who was very upset about my review.  I was offered some additional Hilton points, which I declined.  He then offered to refund an additional night's stay, which I accepted.  Following an email of my reservation number, I found that they did, in fact, credit my AMEX with $200.Last week, I was stuck in Memphis due to bad weather in a connecting flight.  There were a lot of people pushing for hotel rooms, so I decided to go out to the Hilton because I knew the room, at least, would be decent.  I don't know if my profile was marked in some way, or not, but when I arrived, I was treated very well.  It was late in the evening, and due to the weather, the airline was not footing the bill.  The woman at the counter indicated that she felt that wasn't fair, and then offered me a free meal in the restaurant.  She also went out of her way to find a nice room for me, away from smoking floors, without being asked.I did have a quick meal, and the food in the restaurant was only slightly better than the room service, but it was tolerable.  I have had MUCH better food in many other hotel facilities.  Someone should tell the chef that most people can tell the difference between ""saute with peas, carrots, &amp; bacon"", and what was done - which was more like ""topped with microwaved peas &amp; carrots &amp; crumbled bacon""I was told when I made the call from the airport, that the hotel had a free airport shuttle service.  They did pick me up from the airport, but when I got to the hotel, was told that I would have to pay for a cab ride the following morning, because my 6:00am flight would have me leaving the hotel before the shuttle service started (I find it odd that they can't cope with early morning flights).So... overall, not a bad experience, but not one that I'd note as ""exceptional"".  I'd stay again if needed, but probably not for a stay longer than a night or two.First room we checked into had huge horrible stains on carpet. Then moved us to executive suite, but took an hour for them to get our keys to work. Long line. Overpriced. Terrible service. NEVER will stay here again!!!Probably the nicest Hilton staff I have encountered in the nation. The staff was always willing and ready to help us and accommodate our service dog in training.  The rooms are nice, but the doors are a little too close to other rooms. It might have to do with the shape of the building though. The executive lounge is great and man do they do their breakfast right.I stayed here for three nights on business at the end of December. The property is located off one of Memphis' main roads and is a short distance to the I-240 beltway.There were some issues of varying degrees during my stay, but, to a person, every staff member I dealt with was pleasant and at least attempted to be helpful.It's a fair walk from the large parking lot to the front door and the sidewalk ends abruptly at one point, causing a step down to the driveway before picking up the sidewalk again. More often than not, this isn't a problem, but in heavy traffic while carrying cumbersome bags, it could be a tricky maneuver.The lobby is large and comfortable, with the lighting scheme continuously fading between various bright colors. Check-in was efficient, though the elevators to the main tower are located another fair walk from the front desk.The main tower is circular, so all guest rooms are just a short walk from the elevator bank. My room was clean and comfortable with a well-made king bed, a good-size desk and an HD television. There was plenty of closet and dresser space. Wireless internet access is available for $9.95 per day and the signal was reliable and strong.As other reviewers have noted, the walls between rooms seem thin. A crying baby in the adjacent room might as well have been in my room.The shower in the bathroom, at one point, was making a terrible noise, to the point where it sounded like the faucet was going to fly off of its fixture. This was coupled with a lack of hot water. After a few stops and starts, though, the noise abated and piping hot water followed.I had breakfast one morning at the on-site restaurant, which was my poorest experience of the stay. The restaurant was crowded - not jam-packed - but the staff appeared to be overwhelmed. It took five minutes just to be seated, another five to get a menu and about 30 minutes for a rather basic order to be delivered -- incorrectly. It's worth reiterating that the staff was pleasant and courteous despite the tough morning they were having.The hotel is a good - not great - option for business travelers who don't need to be close to the bustle of Beale Street. It was reasonably priced, generally comfortable, and the well-meaning staff compensated for some of the shortcomings of the property.Wife and I stayed while on a visit for an interview.  Checkin was quick and staff was very friendly the entire stay.  We received a free wifi password, although it was very slow at times.You can surf the web, check email and the basics, but we tried to stream Netflix on my iPad and it constantly lagged and was unwatchable.I also carry an HDMI cable to hookup the iPad to TV's and the TV's here are deliberately rigged such that any input ports don't work except for the basic antennae; not a huge deal but if you travel a lot like we do and like to keep up with your shows it simply won't work here.The restaurant was good, but average and the staff was extremely friendly on every visit.Overall this Hilton is a bit on the low side when compared to others of its brand, yet similarly priced.","I had trouble deciding if I was going to give this hotel 3 or 4 stars. It was a beautiful property, large glass elevator overlooking the city, striking fountain in the lobby. The rooms were large with a view. Of course, there wasn't really anything to look at unless you find Target and the highway visually stimulating. The employees were really nice, which is why I decided to give it a 4 star rating. The front desk was exceptionally friendly, they even called to make sure I was enjoying my room. In the concierge lounge, the woman running it made the effort to chat with my while I was eating my breakfast. Service like that can really make a difference when you are a lonely business traveler.The cons? Well the walls were paper thin. You can hear everything going on in the room next to you. In fact, when I woke up form my nap I could hear the man in the room next to me as clearly as though he was in my bathroom, I actually double checked! Also, the parking lot is really confusing. If you've never been to the property before, it is easy to park a mile away from the entrance. Even the closest parking spots involving carrying your luggage up a staircase. They do have valet parking however, so if this is a problem for you, you can easily fix it.All in all, I enjoyed my short overnight stay. I would certainly stay here again.The room was OK, but the food in the restaurant was just awful. The location was convenient for my trip because it was close to the building I had meetings scheduled, but it's pretty far from everything else in Memphis... Now I don't know if this is the incompetence of the staff or Hilton itself, but when I asked them to print or e-mail me my charges, they said that because I booked the room through Expedia, they were absolutely incapable of printing out an itemized receipt detailing all the charges to my card ... I found this extremely annoying. I wouldn't recommend staying here.Sadly disappointed with my stay at this hotel.  I stayed four nights and my room was on the 5th floor.  The first night I set out my breakfast card only to find it wasn't picked up.  The second day I came back to find my room was never serviced and each day when they did service my room they neglected to empty my ice bucket which was always full of water.  I found the room to be very outdated, carpet was stained and the bathroom wasn't in the best shape. The wireless Internet was extremely slow and would go in and out in speeds, the tv was also slow and didn't work very well.  The best part about the room was the mattress which I found to be very comfortable.  I ate 3 breakfasts and 1 dinner at the restaurant downstairs.  I found the food to be very good as was the service.   The elevators sounded old but were pretty fast.  I only had one issue mid week where it took nearly 15 mins to find an empty elevator getting lucky on the third car.  I think it was due to some conference being held there and everyone was heading out at the same time.  I personally will not stay here again.In room wifi password is hiltonwifi8. If that doesn't work, call down to the front desk and ask for the password.  It's that easy.This is an older Hilton property that is in dire need of refurbishment. Parking is not good as the convenient spaces are limited and additional spaces are a significant walk either up a slope or up many stairs. There was no room service menu in my room so I ordered room service from the restaurant via their best uneducated suggestions.  The food was below average.  Location of this hotel is not great either, as it is not in walking distance to any restaurants or stores.  I am a Hilton honors gold member, and I would not stay in this property again.I stayed here recently and was really displeased, though I typically find Hiltons to be decent. This particular location was determined to wring every last dime out of us, and had some misleading information posted online... first, it's nowhere near downtown or the river, which is easily apparent if you look at a map, but they market themselves as being in the heart of the city. I don't consider a 20-30 minute drive to be close, personally. Here, you'll find yourself in the middle of an industrial park enclave, not too far from some shops, but certainly not well located for the tourist visitor. We had two small dogs with us. When I booked the room they claimed not to have a pet fee, yet they dinged me an extra $75 when I arrived. They also banish pet owners to rooms below the lobby, which didn't bother me because I had a window, but may annoy some folks as it really feels like you're in the basement. The internet access was $9.95 a day, which I wasn't expecting because we'd been told it was free before we booked our room. In their defense, when I complained they gave me a voucher to log on. The greatest unjustified expense was the $18 PER (tiny) MARTINI they charged us in the hotel restaurant, with no warning. I complained and they told me that their policy is not to mention the prices unless a customer asks specifically, and this is why they have no drink menu printed in the restaurant. Another lady in the restaurant was so upset over the cost of her tiny drink that she refused to pay for it. We should have done the same, but I was too surprised at the moment to do so. I settled for complaining to the front desk after my shock wore off, and annoyance set in. The restaurant food was actually amazing- it's a shame that the other aspects of the hotel made us feel ripped-off.I stayed here for a business conference.  I've never stayed here before, but I'm pretty sure the hotel had it out for me.  It was no warmer than 60 degrees in the conference rooms.  I was wearing the entire contents of my carry-on suitcase.  I'm going to chalk this one up to climate differences, but  I was freezing in the meeting rooms and sweating in my room...EVERY day for four days.  The AC in the room was working, but somehow the humidity made me sweat like crazy!I found the service to be very good.  The bartenders were really nice, but those drinks were certainly over-priced.  Nice little bar area, and pool area.  The hotel and grounds were well maintained.  The hotel is quite a way from the downtown action, but close enough to the airport.  I would have preferred something closer to 'downtown'.  The complimentary airport drop off (shutle) was a very nice feature.  If I come back to Memphis I will probably choose a different hotel based on location alone.Very nice clean rooms and service. The beds were soooo comfy.Good example of a 3-star. And the front check in service is 4+. You can get a really good rate with Priceline but bar &amp; dining is crazy expensive for Sysco food. Sub 3-star for food. Room was clean but drafty and is a 3.5 star. Parking is terrible at times and is a 2-star.We stayed during a someone else's family reunion and these folk were loud and overran the lobby area.  Fortunately, the hotel clerk put us on the 22nd floor so that we could avoid the noise.  The room was okay, the furnishings were damaged slightly (bleach stains in the chair and the wires were popped in the shower's soap holder).  The bed was comfy. Overall, it was an okay experience.This hotel is in a good location.  Close to food and stores.  However the rooms are small, there were 3 of us in my room and we could barely move around.  Its about a 20 minute drive from downtown.  The restaurant is pricey, I guess that's to be expected from a Hilton.  Needless to say, I'm not pressed if I ever stay here again.  It was okay, nothing to brag home about.Oh, it was bad. Yes, three roaches in one night in our 17th floor room (all found in the bathroom). But that wasn't the only thing that was wrong. First, if you are a non-smoker, never accept a room on the 6th floor. When we checked in the room reeked of stale smoke and after we complained we were told that the 5th floor was smoking. No wonder. It was then they moved us to the 17th floor. Here are my complaints in no particular order: (1) the air conditioning does not work. The air blows but it is not cold. The thermostat can be set to 65 but the actual temperature never gets below 75ish. Fortunately we were in Memphis when it was only 85 outside. (2) They still charge $10/day for internet access - absurd. (3) There are almost NO useable outlets in the ancient rooms (4) No mini microwave or fridge (4) No free breakfast included (5) To add insult to injury, the restaurant does not open until 6:30 which is useless when you have an early business meeting (6) $4.50 for a 16oz bottle of water in the room (7) The carpeting in the hallways AND in the room was not vacuumed in days, if not weeks. White socks will turn black (8) In room lighting very dim and poorly place (9) And, oh yes, the roaches...To be fair, there were two staff members that went out of their way to help us during our abbreviated stay. It gave some humanity to a visit that couldn't have ended soon enough. The sad thing is that in checking out other Memphis hotels in the general area, none of them rated very high on Yelp and other consumer feedback sites. Which leaves you sort of helpless and hopeless when forced to visit Memphis again.",,"['never', 'except', 'night', '2003', 'princess', 'cotton', 'carnival', 'needed', 'sleep', 'night', 'festivities',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/madison-hotel-memphis,Madison Hotel,3.5,$$$,72,"Staff here is among the best of the best.  Harold at the Valet is wonderful and so helpful.  Phyllis, Connor and Ida at the front desk are more them willing to help with anything.  Knowledgeable and very kind.  They arranged a shuttle serve for us that picked us up right at the hotel and John our driver was AMAZING! You cannot go to Graceland, The civil Rights Museum or anywhere in Memphis without John as your driver.  Thank you all!The Madison Hotel is Memphis' trendy boutique hotel. Located close enough - but also far away enough - from Beale St., it's location is actually what I liked best about my stay. It's close to all the good restaurants, bars etc. on Main St. (as well as my favorite coffee shop, Tamp &amp; Tap). I typically stay at the Westin when I'm in Memphis for work and it's a 10 or 15 minute walk from there to this area.I definitely prefer the vibe of the Madison (chic, modern lobby tastefully decorated), and the staff is very nice (you get sincere ""hello, how are you doing"" at every turn). Rooms are similarly cool, but mine felt rather dreary (most likely because I was on a low floor looking out onto some kind of bleak, deserted street). Not really a big deal, given the excellent rate I received for my stay, but if I were paying their normal rates, I'd be more disappointed. I was also not crazy about the fact that while there was a card on the mini bar stating the bottled water was complimentary, the free water was nowhere to be found. One of my biggest pet peeves in a hotel room is the lack of bottled water, even if you have to pay for it. Nothing like waking up first thing in need of water and having to drink out of the faucet (yeah, yeah, first world problems). The weird thing is, they (or the previous guest) had filled the ice bucket before I had checked in. Another thing-- the Keurig hadn't been cleaned between guests as I found it full of water (typical. People don't know how to operate these annoying devices and abandon their efforts). The hotel gym is located in an old vault. How cool! I loved reading about its history (it was actually a club in 1960). The first day I used it, I entered and was hit with a musty smell of decay. That the room was also unbearably hot (I later found the thermostat and I guess guests can adjust it themselves, so I have the previous person working out to thank for this). The TV was on and music was playing creating quite the noise (thanks again, to a previous guest. Who does this?) I didn't realize until it was after my workout that I could have turned off the music. The TV remote was nowhere to be found. In addition to this type of unsavory environment, the fridge had a sign stating that there were cold towels in there... but they were all gone. I think that kind of thing can be avoided if the gym is attended to on the regular. Oversights that management should really be on top of in a hotel like this one. Other than the aforementioned issues, the workout room is well-equipped and both days I had it to myself, which was pretty nice. There's two elliptical machines, two treadmills and at least one bike. There's free weights, a cable machine and one bench... one stability ball. One uncomfortable experience that bears mentioning has to do with safety. My coworker and I arrived back to the hotel around 1 am and there was a dude loitering outside of the adjoining bar. When he saw us, he saw fit to join us in the elevator. He was stoned as hell and clearly on his way to hang out with us, uninvited. WTH? Security was nowhere to be found (normally there are doormen, but I think they are dismissed late at night). Luckily he was out of it enough for us to avoid him once we got to our respective floors, but this is unacceptable. I'm no shrinking violet, but I'd hate to think of women feeling threatened in similar situations. My coworker had an early flight and left the hotel at 5am. Guess who was still lurking around the same area when she left? Speaking of the bar, I want to mention how enjoyable my time was there after I checked in. I always get into the situation where I'm checked into a hotel at around 10pm and I'm hangry because I hate eating airport crap. My travel time was around 6 hours, so it was unavoidable. I don't know the bartender's name (she's a young African American woman, really cool and friendly), but she made sure my hummus plate was vegan and just was a pleasure to talk with in general. I think I'd stay here again as I prefer it to the Westin, but my first stay here left a few things to be desired.I wanted to try an alternative to the Peabody so i booked a night here to attend the Grizzlies game.  We stayed in a 1 bedroom king suite.  Overall just an average stay.  I will probably stick to the Peabody in the future if the price is not outrageous.  The classic luxury at the Peabody is a little more my style versus the Madison's modern artsy look.The valet process was quick and seamless.  Attendant was nice and joked around with us.  Check in was also quick, but the lady at the front desk was not quite as jovial.  I had to ask about the amenities of the hotel and the locations rather than being told up front as part of the checkin process.In the hallway on the 7th floor there was a tray of old food sitting on the floor which stunk up the whole hallway.  It was still there when we came back several hours later.The room was a bit small for a suite but had a nice wood floor living room with mini fridge and wet bar area.  Bed was comfortable, pillows were flat and not too comfy.  The bathroom was large with a walk in shower, but was missing a trash can.  There was also no shampoo or conditioner, just a bar of soap.  Quite inconvenient.  The rooms were a bit noisy as well, with the whole room shaking when someone else let their room door slam shut.  The location is excellent, right off a strip with some nice bars and restaurants.  Also walking distance to the fedex forum and Beale steet, but make sure to stick to the main roads.Downtown memphis is short on fancy hotel selections.  If you are willing to shell out the cash I would stick to the Peabody.  But the Madison is not a bad alternative if the price is right.This hotel was completely underwhelming. The room, service and food. If you are planning to pay this much for a hotel prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, my normal Memphis hotel was booked. :(Updated. 12/26/15 I stayed at this property again last week while home for Christmas. I have to admit the food was awesome this stay. The service is still a huge opportunity for this property. All and all I would stay again when in Memphis.Very bad first impression with terrible customer service. Staying here for business travel. Single valet working and he was very polite but completely overrun. Then, entered building and could not find signage indicating where to check in. When I did finally find front desk, I was not greeted by staff. I had difficulty checking in that required manager intervention. She did not even attempt to correct the problem. I eventually left, dissatisfied and without a room. I do not plan to return. Update: I did have to return the following night as I was unable to find another feasible hotel room. The customer service remained poor. Not once did a single staff member acknowledge the inconvenience caused. I have another trip scheduled there next month and I am actively working to ensure I don't have to return.Our room was incredible! The entrance had a little bar and a cool seating area with a TV. Through French doors was our bed and bathroom. It felt like a cozy little apartment!  The bathroom was perfect with a separate shower and bath. They also provided robes which I love!  The staff was friendly &amp; helpful &amp; they all seemed to really enjoy their job! There is a rooftop bar which is a great space to either begin or end your day. They offer a few mini guitars in the lobby for guests to enjoy during their stay. Cons: $29 valet parking only. However, there are parking garages all around where you can park yourself. The complimentary coffee in the room tastes terrible.Great service, the breakfast at the hotel restaurant is delicious, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly, and the rooftop bar is lovely at night. This location is perfect - it's right by the river, close to the airport, and a close walk to Beale Street, but far enough so that you aren't stuck in a noisy section of town. And I walked to Gus' from here :)Like others mentioned I think the service here leaves much to be desired. This is one of the more expensive hotels in the area and it's always given 4+ stars by all the hotel websites. It's not worthy. I woke up to construction which the hotel staff denied at first. Then they told me it was only on the outside of the hotel (yeah, outside my wall). It eventually stopped but not from any effort on the part of the hotel staff. And I never heard even so much as an ""I'm sorry"".Then it was the really, really gross bathroom. I think there was a slight leak in the shower head which kept the shower very moist. Add the high heat and humidity in Memphis and this equated to excellent conditions for growing mold and mildew. The shower was just covered. We showered at a relatives place. I didn't even want t o go in there. We asked the staff to address it and I noticed there was a slight difference, but it was still not a place you want to be.I would never go back.Drove in last night and arrived around 11:23 am. We had hoped to get in earlier and enjoy the splurge of the room - a stop on our road trip to upstate NY. We carried our own bags and luggage- no one asked.  We went down to bar for light snack and a drink. The bartender was more focussed on closing than providing the service that you would expect for this hotel. The bar was infested with mosquitoes and the bartender initially denied this until they started biting her. We ordered some Mac and cheese- stone cold and more like soup. Sent it back. Got to room- concave mattress with a thin sheet and worn mattress pad meant for a queen was used. Pretty gross. Got bill under door this am- 345.00I feel cheated. Not what I expected for our splurge.Follow up- my room rate was adjusted to address the concerns. Thank you Madison Hotel!Made reservations over 5 months ago and got a corner room no view. I requested a change but got a polite brush off from the desk clerk. Room was much smaller than expected for the price. Maybe just the one I got. Everything else was nice. There is a wet bar with prices. Best part was huge bed and bathroom was great.Service was impeccable. Rooms were very nice and clean. Will stay here every time when we come to Memphis.This is an overpriced hotel that is really underwhelming. We are paying almost 400 dollars a night for an ""executive"" double room... Well there is nothing executive about our room. The toiletries were opened, there were used kleenexes in the box (not kidding), the tub is just a run of the mill regular tub (very disappointing), not oversized or luxurious as advertised. The concierge was useless, and there isn't a turn down service as advertised.Honestly, if you saved up money because you wanted a nice vacation, don't waste it here.I hosted an employee retreat here. We had dinner as a group in a private room which was excellent. The rooms are sharp- clean and nice high end toiletries in bathroom.  Bedding very nice quality and mistress soft and comfy. Worth the price. Felt like a 4 star hotel.We stayed here for a night on our honeymoon road trip and it is a beautiful hotel! Love the decor and the staff is extremely nice and helpful!! The walls are very thin and there were stains on the sheets, which I'm sure they would've gladly fixed if we'd noticed before we came in from a late night out on Beale St. The Twilight bar is breathtaking at night... It's a must see! Don't be in a hurry for your car, or at least call down for it 15-20 min before you need it. Other than that, great hotel!Very nice hotel. We have enjoyed our week long stay. The staff is very polite and helpful. Everything in our room was great we stayed in the jr king deluxe. My only complaint would be the restaurant. The food was not good tried a few things and did not like any of it. I was so disappointed being they have such good reviews on TA. I would stay here again. Had troubles finding good food and decent places to eat while in Memphis. Prob won't return to this town kinda a big let down.I loved my stay at the Madison hotel. I booked my hotel at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and they messed up my reservation but Madison hotel fixed it and upgraded us for free. The entire staff was friendly and attentive. I lived in Memphis for 2 years prior and knew exactly where to book during my quick visit. I definitely made the right choiceMy husband did an amazing job picking this place on his own and surprising me on Valentine's Day. I was impressed the minute I walked into the Lobby. Boutique decor and friendly staff. It reminded me of a hotel that we love in downtown Portland (The Nines). I was over the moon when he led me to our corner suite on a top floor. You walk into a sitting area (couch, mini bar, TV), round the corner into the bedroom and bath. Both very spacious. Rain shower head. I appreciated all the tall windows and the view of the bay. The colors in the room are very warm, inviting, luxurious. Wifi worked. A few negatives- no bubbles for jetted tub. Our room service was ok. The ice cream for my blueberry bread pudding was melted and the shrimp appetizer was breaded and soggy. Of course it would happen if you cover the food at once and let it sit. If I were more hungry at the time, I would've been more upset. Luckily, I was in a good mood and the bread pudding was delicious. One more negative was that the gym was out of service but no one told me. I just found out when I got down there. None of the machines were working. Had to do weights and jumping jacks! It felt a little like a dungeon. I have to hand it to my Love for having great taste. We had a wonderful time and would probably stay again when in Memphis!Very nice accommodations.   Pro's...great location, can walk to Beale Street.  Roof top bar has the best views in the city.  Very friendly staff that is eager to please.  Con's...rooms are a bit small and parking is a bitch.  Valet park is really the only way to go.We were there for a wedding weekend and the block of rooms that was reserved for us was at the Madison.  Great location downtown as far as ease to get places.  The issues I had and that would keep me from leaving a 4 or 5 star review were based on customer service or lack thereof on at least three occasions.  Everyone was perfectly nice, but multiple times there was no one to valet cars (yes, that sounds ridiculous to say,  but they were all just sitting around the corner because every time I inquired with the front desk, she radioed to someone and they walked around the corner).  The room was nice enough though.  We had a weird room location near the elevator which made it a bit noisy.  All in all, it was an okay experience but could have been better.Overpriced for what you get. The walls were a bit dirty and we had to call to get a second robe and for ice. Staff was helpful. The terrace is nice but not in January.","My family just got back from a beautiful time in Memphis. We stayed at the Madison hotel and we were very impressed with the professionalism of the staff. The room was stayed in was spacious, modern, with a nice very of the river. We happened to get a room on the top floor. The roof top was really nice and the  kids had a great time in the pool. Check out the bank vault in the work out room. We also had Easter dinner at the hotel, as much was not open around 7:30 - 8:00 pm on Easter Sunday. Our entrees were wonderful, apps not as impressive, but all in all truly impressed, and far better than you the typical ""hotel fare"". I loved having coffee and breakfast at the bar in the morning before it got busy.We are so happy we stayed at the Madison, rather than a big chain such as the MarriotThis is only based on their service as i did not stay in a room here.We ate at their restaurant, 83, so I valeted my car, which the valet guy told me would be $10. When I got to dinner my friends informed me that it's complementary valet if you're eating at the restaurant. After dinner we wanted to go upstairs to their rooftop. The server told us it's free if we show them the receipt from dinner. So we go upstairs and the girl tells us that it was not free. I look outside and it looked like it had rained and all the chairs and tables were wet. There were  only 2 older couples sitting outside. Before I could tell my friends that, the girl said we could go out there this time (after she called someone) but that it's not usually free even if we have had dinner at 83. When we went outside everything was wet and their WERE only 2 elderly couple out there. There was no where to sit as they had not even cleaned the furniture.  We walked right out. If she had actually charged us $10 each she would have had to deal with 4 pissed off customers. How are you going to charge $10 when everything is wet and no one is out there? Soooooo we decide to go have drinks somewhere else, we walk to flight which is one block over. We have 2 drinks and head back to our cars. The valet guy says it's $10 and we have to pay because we left the restaurant and came back. I'm thinking 1) you told me I had to pay even though I was eating at the restaurant 2) maybe you should tell people that they would get charged if they leave the restaurant. So we go inside to pay. THEY VERY NICE LADY at the counter says to go to the restaurant and get our tickets stamped so it's free. So we did. As I am coming back out of the hotel the valet guy opens the door for me but before I could even step out he leaves the door and let it hit me in the arm and it pushed me out. That really pissed me off. He ran inside to tell the nice front desk lady that we had left the restaurant.  I walked back inside  and told him ""You are lucky I am not getting your name for being rude because you hit me in the arm with that door!"" Of course he's like no I didn't. Blah blah my arm felt the door, I could have opened it myself and would have been fine.The whole point is  that this is suppose to be a nice hotel and it did not feel that way at all. I have had great experience at the Westin and their restaurant. I felt like I was getting ripped off and then beaten up and thrown out. I would have gladly paid $20 for valet because I didn't want to walk far in heels as that's the whole point of valet, convenience, but their service made me feel like I was at a cheap trashy hotel. The lady at the front desk was the nicest person there and I made sure to let her know. I wanted to tip her but I wasn't sure if that was even appropriate.Horrible customer service.  Had to call them twice and manager was supposed to call back and never did.  I shouldn't have to spend my whole day calling to try and get someone who can make decisions on the phone.  Just awful.  Will update once I stay there since I am forced to.Great location close to everything and right on the trolley line. Interior decor is like a boutique W - very nice, upscale, and modern. My complaints were few - for their price I expect a really crazy attentive staff, and they missed the mark by a hair or two. The gym area smells like mildew, although the equipment is decent. I had to call for cups to the water machine.Nice rooms with rainwater showers. Don't skip the rooftop bar.Husband and I booked the King Suite on the corner. It was nice with modern decorations. The Jacuzzi tub was a nice touch. We also had the breakfast package, which was ok. The total came out to a little over $100 for just breakfast and they were 30 minutes late getting it to our room, however the lady was nice. I would DEF not use their valet. The wait time is HORRIBLE! The men are extremely rude. If you want to get your car out, they act as if it's a hassle and the wait time is FOREVER. We ended up waiting 30 minutes for our car at checkout and missed our massage appointment we had set up at a specific time. Also, the restaurant that is attached does not have a good variety, took a long time to get seated with many table open, and ran out of the menu items they did have. Overall, it is an ok stay.What a fabulous place! Great service, from valet upon arrival to checkout at the end of our stay. This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to Beale St. and a short 10-15 minute drive to Graceland. The rooms were large, well decorated, and immaculately clean; a great overall vibe. Beds and pillows were comfortable, and the bathroom boosted a large shower with good water pressure. Would definitely stay there again.Typically when you pay $200 a night and stay at any luxury / regular hotel they offer complimentary coffee in the mornings down in the lobby area. 3 weeks ago the Madison offered this however I learned during my current stay they are now charging $3 for coffee to go.  As guests we pay a pretty penny to stay here and that is at least one complimentary option of which they can offer to their guests.  The coffee isn't even Starbucks and they feel as tho it's worth $3 ?!?!? First and far most I've started at several hotels across the US of which I've stayed so much I earned Platium Status and I've never seen this before.  I tried to speak with the front desk lady Rose but she was not helpful at all, I prob won't have never wrote this review if she had just provided me with some complimentary coffee. Therefore, I am writing and following up with the manager as well.We decided to stay at the Madison overnight on our way to Chicago from Dallas.  The hotel was very nice and the staff was very friendly.  The room was not huge but it was nicely appointed with a flat screen tv, ipod docking station, honor bar, and big closet..  Although the bed was a tad uncomfortable. The hotel also has a very nice fitness facility that we enjoyed.  The only thing I was not impress with was the Twilight Sky Terrace, the pictures made it sound cooler that it really was.  Overall, I enjoyed this hotel and where it is located.  I would stay there again.Very nice hotel. I had a Jr Suite which was very spacious, very large bathroom with a separate shower and tub.  The walking distance to Beale is reasonable but not optimal in inclement weather. Right on two trolley lines although the trolley service was hit or miss. I felt it was a little pricey and not a great value. The staff was generally very friendly although when I arrived at almost 6 pm they told me the room wasn't ready, at 6 pm? One major complaint. When I asked about getting to Graceland they arraigned a car at 50$ round trip. They failed to mention the free bus that picks up downtown hmmm.  I liked it but would look for better value in the future.The Madison is considered a four star hotel, but should be a three.  We pricelined this place for $130 (total $160), plus $29 overnight valet.  So, I guess you get what you pay for.  The room absolutely not worth the $289+ regular rate.We were on the 12th floor and our room was in serious need of repair (the ceiling, the air vents, the pipe coming out of the ceiling in the shower).We got a queen room, which was small, but adequate for downtown.  There were very few rooms on our floor and we were right next to the elevator.  I didn't notice any elevator noise, but I could hear noise from the street, especially in the morning.This hotel only does Valet, $29 overnight, unlimited in and out.  I did not see any parking lots or other self-park garages nearby.I thought the location was excellent.  5 minute walk to Beale street and maybe 10 yards from Main Street.The staff was amazing.  Friendly and competent.We did not have a drink at the roof top bar, but did go up to take some photos.We had an average experience when we stayed at the Madison. We were celebrating a birthday with a weekend away. When the reservation was made, we notified the hotel of the birthday celebration. At that time, We asked for early check in and a river view. We arrived at the hotel about 11 AM, and we were told our room was in the process of getting cleaned. Early check in ended up being 2:30 rather than the regular check in of 3. We also didn't get a river view. Our room was nice, but I certainly wouldn't give it more than an average rating. During the second day we were there, housekeeping never cleaned our room. Service overall was pretty poor except for one bartender in the bar. When we go back to Memphis, we will try another hotel.The staff makes this hotel. Every single person I encountered gave me a greeting and a smile. The day I checked in their computers went down and they had to deal with a ton of stuff. You could see that they were stressed but everyone held their own.The room was comfortable, great shower, great pillows, comfortable bed.The roof top deck is a must see (no seriously, we told everyone that we encountered).Location is great...not that there is much in downtown Memphis.Overall I would gladly stay there again and again and againWe've stayed here twice.  Once in May 2012 and again in June 2013.  I am averaging the rating...First visit was 4 stars.  Room wasn't huge but the bathroom was just lovely, separate shower and tub, lighted make up mirror, very cool little room.  We saw Zach Randolph in the lobby :). Free breakfast was awesome, overall great experience.Booked again (through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>) and the room was cramped and LOUD... We finally couldn't take it anymore and around midnight asked to be moved.  One positive note: the lady that works the front desk is excellent, best part of our experience.  She moved us to a really nice, quiet room on the same floor...wish we had asked to move earlier!Also, I know it was a weeknight but the rooftop patio was not exactly welcoming... We got a glass of wine (the bartender was pretty nice) but we were the only ones up there and the music was blasting.  I WOULD have had another glass but the manager came up and closed the bar down.  He seemed inconvenienced by our presence... So no more wine for me, no last call, nothing.  They did, however, leave the WAY TOO LOUD music on for us....uhhh thanks?  Weird experience, not like the first time we went up there (pre renovation).  Why renovate your rooftop patio if you don't want people up there?  Based on our experience before, we got up early to get breakfast...but unfortunately they no longer offer that.  We asked a lady out front (NOT the nice lady from the front desk) about the breakfast and she asked who we booked through and then very bluntly told us ""you booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> so you don't get breakfast""Wow.  So much has changed in a relatively short amount of time!  We couldn't wait to come back based on our first experience, now I think 2 stars would be generous for our second go round...Done with the Madison.  And <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for that matter.Will find somewhere else to stay next time we stop in Memphis.I like the Madison. I won a free staycation here through a drawing and stayed here with my boyfriend at the time. We both were locals and never had done a staycation before in downtown but thought it would be a lot of fun to play tourists.We started out our night by having dinner at the hotel's restaurant Grille 83. We escaped barely with a tab slightly under $70. We gor drinks and 2 entrees and salads. He picked up the tab since I won us a free $200 room! After dinner, we ventured to the roof top where they has some soft jazz music playing and we relaxed with a wonderful view, drinks in hand, and a fine breeze blowing through. Later on we went out to a couple of places downtown. We caught the trolley to South Main which luckily there is a trolley stop not too far from the Madison. Seriously just a good night. We did feel like we were out of towners while staying there.The rooms are very modern-esque. The bathroom was very small, but it had a nice shower which was a plus for me. I loved the big shower heads where it does feel like you are in an actual shower and not being sprayed with a drizzle. The bed was a little too hard for me, but it was very spacious. Nice flat screen tv too. I'd say it's nice to stay in. Would I have paid for it? Probably not. I'm ok with staying in low budget hotels when I travel. But for those who enjoy simplicity with nice a room and the ends and outs, then the Madison would work for you. Especially I'd you want to splurge $200 a night.What a fabulous location! Close to all of the action of downtown yet still located in a nice little nook that isn't inundated with tourists too. The staff was super friendly from the valet to the front desk and cleaning crew too. My room was spacious and offered up a beautiful bathroom with a separate tub and shower arrangement. My room was located near an elevator and unfortunately I experienced the noise from the hallway a few times during the night. It would have been nice to be disclosed that my room was going to be in a higher traffic area.I loved the decor and vibe throughout but could do without the $23 valet fee and $10.95 service that is billed after you check-in. Why wasn't the service fee part of the original booking price again?My boyfriend and I got a deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FExpedia.com&amp;s=97a626974b048288cd55b0dd9e7766c0818e8160dff5a4ced59fe49339fdf839"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Expedia.com</a>. I feel for the money it was worth it and a better deal than Peabody (I've stayed at the Peabody before so I can knowingly compare the two).The front staff was very polite and thoughtful. They checked us in and also helped us call for a taxi when we were leaving for the airport. At 5pm they were offering complimentary petit fours and Shirley Temple's in champagne flutes.You get a complimentary breakfast buffet. The book in your room will say it's on the Mezzanine level, but I had to walk around, and found out it was at the hotel restaurant...so when you check in ask where breakfast is. Breakfast is eggs, bacon, grits, muffins, bagels, croissants, and fruit. You get your choices of juices, coffee, and tea. They'll bring you a bill but it'll say Complimentary and you can write on your tip for your server. Our servers were really attentive the two mornings we had breakfast there. One morning the manager greeted us and he was very engaged and nice. Our last morning, he even came out from the restaurant because he saw me waiting at the bellman stand in the afternoon, and he quickly helped me with my luggage.We had a nice, clean room. Our rate didn't get us a view of the river, but that's okay. We took the elevator to the top floor and saw the view. It is breathtaking!There is free wi-fi. Our room kept dropping the connection in the bedroom, but I was able to find a connection in the bathroom (hello.).The hotel itself is a quick 5 minute walk to Beale Street... or a slow 10 minutes. We felt safe walking to/from Beale late at night.Across the street from the hotel is Walgreens so that's helpful to know if you forget to pack something from home and need to buy it in Memphis. You can also buy postcard stamps there. There's also a dollar store type place close by if you need to pick up ponchos because of rain.Great service and nice rooftop. No complaints.I will come back to the Madison.Out here visiting colleges with son.  Could not get into Peabody which has a deal with the college.  Came to Madison on recommendation of locals.  Although kind of expensive (9th fl junior suite $400 plus), the service and property itself were worth it to us.  Apparently don't need the Peabody!Room very clean, comfortable and quiet. A junior suite is a single room with a sitting area at one end.  A double would probably suffice but we needed some work areas for paperworkValet service - very prompt and helpful with car and curbside service.Breakfast - served free on Mezz level until 10am - great touchPublic Areas - attractive - this is a 1905 property that has been updated a la Kimpton so it has postmodern design but in very good taste.WiFi - ok on ninth floor. Able to open VPN and not too frustrating.  No extra charge - good deal.Rooftop - PH level has a rooftop deck facing the river. It would be beautiful up there on a warm day. Totally worth seeing the view however.Check-in - we came in on a redeye flight from LA and after a day of touring were dead.  We got to the hotel at 230 and we were allowed to check in early. We passed out in the room.  i vaguely remember that a butler entered our room around 4 presumably because we did not respond to knocks.  I woke up enough to see that he was dropping off a cellophane-wrapped plate of snacks for us.  He apologized for disturbing us and ducked out..  When we came-to around 6 we found we had a really nice plate of toasted ciabatta with peppers, cheese and fruit. Really nice touch and that was very welcome as we had not eaten in 12 hours.Staff - we cannot get over how people here are outgoing and friendly. Maids, valets, desk staff all five star.  butler service and room service staff offered the kind of service you see in five star resorts on the west coast, but far more believable here.  For example, the maid on the ninth floor engaged us in conversation on a couple of occasions and made us feel very welcome, even gave us the scoop on things in the hotel and local area.  If this is Southern hospitality, then we are hooked. Well done, Madison!Generally nice hotel.  Friendly staff.  Don't pay for parking, though.  They charge $29 and only have valet.  You can literally park around the block and pay $8/day.While I didn't stay at the Madison (something I'd definitely consider, as it was often suggested by locals, regularly accompanied by animated gesturing), I did manage to make my way to the rooftop show/party they were throwing on a Saturday night. The rooftop bar experience really seems to be part of what winds Memphis up, and on this night, locals relaxed with cocktails or grooved in the open air to the band, who pounded out rock standards. Expect if you go here to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of ten bucks or so to just for the privilege of being on the deck: expect that the bar will likely be cash only (although as I recall I did get the bartender to help me finance a couple of cold ones without running a tab: weird, but effective). In all, if you want to listen to some music and sip on a cocktail with friends under the Memphis stars, you could do worse than the Madison Hotel. My experience wasn't consummate, but it was definitely worthwhile. I'd go back.","I will never stay at another Memphis Hotel!  This is really a gem.  The hotel staff is stellar.  There was complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in the evening.  The location is perfect - close to great restaurants.  I also had access to an event on the rooftop bar that had a great view!  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge.  My one complaint is the $10.95 amenities charge.  Unexpected, as it wasn't on the original reservation.  What's up with that?  Also, like someone else said, I had the room immediately to the right of the elevator and had a lot of traffic noise.  Nothing that bothered me once I was sleep, but I did find it distracting while I was working in the evening.  A heads up would have been nice...I guess that's two complaints...but that's ok.Heated pool is great and the daily breakfast voucher was much appreciated!I can't stop talking about how wonderful my stay at the Madison was. They know how to make their guests feel special from the coffee, to the fresh ice and chocolates. The Twilight roof deck had the most spectacular views of Memphis and the DJ played tunes that went perfectly with the vibe. The staff were beyond polite and courteous. I went to the Gaylord Orpryland after my stay at the Madison and it didn't even come close to comparing. Thank you for making my stay in Memphis so enjoyable!I am doing work in Memphis and have stayed at the Madison a couple of times. Love this place! I have also stayed a few times closer to Beale Street and this location is still downtown and a bit more quiet. I like it better. The staff are very friendly, the rooms quite comfortable and the rooftop bar has a great view. I would recommend that you ask for a room that does not have a pedestal sink in the bathroom. Don't know if it is more expensive, but without this there is absolutely no room to put your things in the bathroom. This is my one complaint. I really like the Madison and will be back on a regular basisI chose the Madison thinking it would be a special experience on our wedding day--a place to get ready with my bridesmaids, then return to that evening with my husband. It looked pretty and was  a little cheaper (but not much!) than the Peabody. Here's what happened:Problem #1: Despite arranging MONTHS in advance to check into our room an hour early so my bridesmaids and I could get ready... and following up the week of the wedding... we learned on the spot that the person who made that promise was mistaken because they were booked. So, our ENTIRE WEDDING DAY was delayed by an hour. That meant the ceremony started an hour late, we paid the band for an hour that we didn't get, and the whole day was mayhem. Not to mention, it was embarrassing that I had a bunch of women waiting around in the lobby for an hour and no one even apologized. Yet last week, when a similar overbooking happened to my friend at the Peabody on her wedding day, they immediately put us in a conference room to get ready, apologized profusely (see #3 below), and brought us champagne.Problem #2: We had a few trays of food out as we got ready--pasta, sandwiches, etc. I asked the front desk on our way out if they'd clean the room so the food would be gone when we returned that night. My maid of honor made the same request. I even called later to follow up and make sure they'd done it. But when my husband and I returned to our (expensive) room that night, NOTHING had been cleaned and it smelled like rotting food. Not exactly a dream wedding night.Problem #3: I wrote the Madison a letter via their website AND sent a hard copy in the mail right after this happened. I gave them all my contact info, but no one responded. I followed up; still no response. It's been OVER THREE MONTHS and I still haven't gotten as much as an apology for all of the trouble that the Madison caused with their terrible service. This is the most disappointing fact of all. I am dismayed that a hotel that promises great service and a fine experience would treat a bride and groom with such little consideration and care on their wedding day. Summary: Choose the Peabody or the downtown Marriott (I have no affiliation).There's nothing that annoys me more about a hotel then surprise fees. This hotel is valet park only, so you're already paying $25 more than the rate. But then there's also an $11 ""amenities fee."" What are the amenities? A pool and slow internet. Resorts can charge a resort fee. But hotels that charge extra for basic services should just raise their rate instead of tricking the customer.I was here for a wedding this past weekend. The valet people were so nice and helpful. The front desk staff were just as helpful. My room was great. The beds are very comfortable. Plenty of pillows. the decore of the whole hotel is wonderful. Very chic. The restraunt in the hotel was fabulous as well. the food was amazing and very good size portions. I would definatley have my out of town friends stay here.The Madison Hotel is a very cool place, with modern decor and beautiful, rich color patterns in their rooms and suites. It's pretty centrally located in downtown Memphis so you're within walking distance of Beale Street, AutoZone Park and some great restaurants and bars. But don't forget about Grill 83, the hotel restaurant, which happens to be one of my faves. The Madison hosts a rooftop party on Thursday nights during the summer that are always alot of fun. If you've never seen the view from their rooftop, you should definitely make a point to go. Simply amazing. Service is friendly and accommodating, and the staff really outdo themselves making sure guests are happy.Beware of the blonde bartender on the rooftop, sticky fingers...overpriced drinks with no receipt.I just went to Memphis for a wedding, and the whole party stayed at the Madison. This hotel was fantastic. The service was excellent, the rooms were spacious and clean, and the staff could not have been nicer.Great location in Memphis, close to most of the things you want to do (Beale st, museums, waterfront, restaurants). I would recommend the Madison to anyone traveling to memphis.Madison Hotel in Memphis is a modern, very clean, very friendly, very centrally located hotel.  I stayed here while in town for the Memphis St Jude Marathon and was very pleased from everything from the room decor to staff to location, highly recommend.Very nice room, comfortable bed, recently renovated. I would definitely stay here again. Rooftop is awesome!Bets hotel in Memphis, hands-down. Everyone on staff makes you feel like you're family. The rooms are delightful and you can't beat the location. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Memphis!If you are looking to stay somewhere in Memphis that is grand or upscale- you've got one of two options.  The Peabody or the Madison.  This hotel is much more modern and crisp looking than the Peabody.  The rooms are very colorful and decorated quite nicely- they also offer a tab bit more space than the Peabody. I love their rooftop.  I've been up their for the rooftop parties on Thursday, summer nights.  The river views are amazing.  It's breathtaking and surprisingly quiet (if you aren't at the party of course), to sit up there at night with a glass of wine and just take it all in.   They have Grill 83 on site, which I haven't been to but hear great things about.    You can't beat the location if you are staying here.  It's a short walk to the downtown attractions and an even shorter walk to the trolley.  Though I will always advise people to try and stay at my favorite, Talbot Heirs, this is always a second choice if their rooms happen to be sold out.As a local, one of the things I like about The Madison Hotel is the weekly rooftop party held there during the summer months on Thursday nights.  Now the crowd does skew a little older, and  I joke with my friends that instead of checking your ID at the door, they ask to see your AARP membership card.  Because, whereas there are some token younger people there, most are well over 40, most in their 50's.  Even so, I LIKE this event. It is much smaller than the competing rooftop event held on the same night at The Peabody. The views of the river are just awesome, and if you go early you can catch the sunset.  The band starts around 6 and winds down at 10.The Madison is billed as the most luxurious hotel in Memphis - all the sports teams stay there when they are in town.  However, it lacked a few things that come standard with four stars:  1)  a spa - seriously, spas are becoming standard in Hyatts and Hiltons2)  service - they called our room past midnight because another guest of the hotel asked them to.  I can understand a polite call to humor a guest during the daytime but after 10 is just out of line.  Not to mention, in our digital age, if we really wanted to connect with this person, I would have given them a cell number. 3) seamless coordination - they put us in a room next to one that they were doing construction in.  Our room smelled of paint and we heard loud banging noises.  The hotel was far from fully booked.  Now did it make any sense to put us on the same floor as one undergoing construction.  Really. They offered us dinner to make up for the mistakes.  However, after dinner we were informed that they were only comping one dinner and no wine.  Ridiculous.   The best part is when we called to report these things,awesome place to stay. the staff was great from the doormen to the bartenders. the room was very comfortable and relaxing. also, quiet on the floors. not loads of people coming and going. the food in the restaurant was great and they do a reasonable happy hour. would highly recommend this hotel.It is physically impossible for us to drive from NC to TN because of the winter storms Cleon and Dion and although Expedia told me that we should be able to cancel due to this fact, the hotel manager for this hotel not once but twice refused to allow us to cancel. Really? So I have to pay for a hotel that I can't even get to. I will never book this hotel again for this reason alone. Just another word of caution, I booked this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FExpedia.com&amp;s=97a626974b048288cd55b0dd9e7766c0818e8160dff5a4ced59fe49339fdf839"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Expedia.com</a> and could swear that the cancellation policy was 2 days (we attempted to cancel within 2 days) but when I got the confirmation email, it said 3 days. Double check this when you book anywhere online...My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Madison this week and it was a delightful stay. The service, the rooms, the rooftop area (bar wasn't open yet)... it was all amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Memphis.Poopsie and I stayed there last weekend for a staycation. The room was nice, but not exceptional and the staff we came across were very nice too. But for a supposed ""luxury"" hotel it lacked a lot. A couple of particular issues:I had a scotch neat in the bar a couple of times. The price for a scotch was a bit on the high side, but acceptable, but the kicker was that they charged an extra dollar for it ""neat"". In other words the charged extra money to not do anything with it. The first time I commented on it, the waiter said it was because they poured a larger shot for a neat drink. (It didn't seem larger than other places. Does that mean they are giving you a short shot in a mixed drink?) The second time I had it, I didn't bother commenting on it.The other issue was the complimentary breakfast. I was expecting something really interesting from a ""luxury"" hotel. What we got was worse than a Best Western. It was chintzy, cheap, small, lacked variety. A definite disappointment. The next morning we went to the Arcade for a decent breakfast.I general, it seemed like they did not have enough staff. There was no doorman and the valet parking guy was running his butt off. He was a great guy, very friendly and informative about what was going on. There was only one person at the front desk, both on check in and out. There was bar staff lacking the first night we were at the restaurant and the second afternoon at sunset time on the roof. Other than the scotch issues, the restaurant was OK, but we only had late night snacks. The view from the roof is excellent, it was too bad they did not open the bar up there.Stayed for a weekend in June, 2009.We picked this little boutique hotel in hopes that it would be a nice alternative to a chain. It was.For a competitive price, the Madison offered a great clean room with a great view. Mind you: this is from the time when both American's and their tastes weren't Supersized, so you may find the rooms a bit small.  But there's certainly more than enough room for a couple, and the king sized beds are very comfy. Oh yeah, the bathrooms are quite large!One block away is the Memphis Trolley to get you to any of the popular tourist attractions. One bit of advice: skip the valet parking service. The garage 1.5 blocks away on South 2nd Street just south of Madison allows for 24-hour parking and is much more reasonably priced.","Loved it. I stayed here during the Memphis Marathon weekend and the service was excellent.  When we walked in the door, at 1 p.m, they greeted us with a smile and had us checked into our room early.  The concierge, Stacy, was extremely friendly.  I had spoken with her prior to arrival to arrange transportation to the hotel and also a rental car for our last day in Memphis.  She was the best help ever!The rooms were big and the beds were comfortable.  Not quite as soft as a sheraton sleeper bed or of those offered in the Hilton hotels, but it was nice.  The linens were nice as well.   Molton Brown shampoos and soaps were offered and were quite nice as well.  The breakfast was good, cereal, bagels, toast, fruit, coffee, juice...  My sister asked for peanut butter one day and they went out of their way to find some for her.  Staff was very helpful.The only things I wasn't thrilled about in the room are.. the TV is old, not a flat screen and there weren't a ton of channels.  The hallways were cold, but the room temp was easy to control and was toasty warm.  The hotel was a little expensive for my typical taste, but I enjoyed every minute.My wife and I and our 18 year old son stayed here four nights and were very pleased.  We had the suite with a pullout sofa, giving us all the proper amount of privacy.  The room was beautifully cleaned each day, with turndown service at night.  All personnel were extremely friendly and helpful.  We are fussy folks but it is hard to come up with a complaint that is even minor.If you are on the breakfast plan, be aware that for some foolish reason you get charged extra if you want toast with your eggs and bacon.  The food and beverage manager might consider altering this off-putting policy.The shower head wasn't that great, but that is the ONLY thing we found lacking in our recent stay at the Madison. The rooms are graciously appointed, clear down to an umbrella in the closet, and two nice robes. The lobby is stylish and comfortable, the bar friendly and unpretentious, and the restaurant small but good. Best of all, and the reason I give it five stars, the service is unpretentious, genuinely friendly and responsive. Maids, bellmen, concierge, waitstaff and desk clerks all went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and that makes up for a shower head, in my book, any day.word of advice .  Do not plan a wedding at the Madison.  The accommodations can not support more than 60 + folks..  My experience when they were trying to serve the food to the guest they set off the fire Alarms and my guest were greeted by the Memphis Fire Department..   If your are planning a rooftop reception, beware of the temperatures  my wedding cake melted...Let me start by saying that I have not stayed at the Madison Hotel, and that my review is based on my experience dealing with the hotel staff while booking a room as a gift for my sister's honeymoon.In short let me say that the Madison lacks considerably in organization.  My request was to simply book a suite for my sister and her husband for two nights.  The first night would be under the honeymoon package and the second on the dining package.  While this appears a relatively straight forward reservation, the staff at the Madison managed to thouroughly mishandle it.  Let me explain.During my initial call with the reservationist, I was graciously offered a discounted room rate since I was booking two suite packages during my sister's stay.  After checking the confirmation however it appeared that not only was my quoted rate incorrect, but that they had also improperly entered the order in which I wanted the suite packages to be delivered (honeymoon package on the first night, and dining package on the second).  Fortunately I noticed the errors and was able to make another call to have the issue corrected.  At least I was assured that they had been corrected...When my sister arrived at the hotel, it appeared that they had still not managed to make the appropriate changes.  Not only was the rate still incorrect, the hotel staff had also neglected to deliver the items that accompany the honeymoon package.   Yet again, I placed a call to correct the situation, however at this point it was already too late.  The sole intent of having the honeymoon package on the first night was to have champagne, candles, and strawberries waiting for them upon arrival.  While the hotel staff seemed quite apologetic when this was brought to their attention, the champagne would still not arrive until late in the evening on the second night of their stay.  The candles and strawberries never made it to the room at all.The dining package posed problems of its own.  When they arrived for dinner, there was no mention from the staff that the package included a wine pairing with the meal, so they ordered their own drinks through the meal.  They were then billed for their drinks, and the wine was never recieved.   This was corrected from the room charges ultimately, but yet again the Madison had failed to deliver. The final gaffe took place at checkout, when a bill was presented for a $30 charge for valet parking.  Unaware that the reservation should have included valet parking on both nights, my brother in law paid the bill.  To correct this, I personally left a message for the front desk manager, however to this day he neither has returned my call nor made the correction.Ultimately, the Madison bills itself as being on-par with the finest four &amp; five star hotels in the world - yet I have found this to be far from the truth.  Without ever having set foot on the hotel property, the Madison has managed to disappoint me greatly.  Even worse, they failed to live up to their promises on my sister's honeymoon.  It requires an exceptional staff to manage a great hotel, and in this area the Madison appears to be quite lacking.  While the rooms and property may be well appointed, I can assure you that the ""service and luxury"" that they tout on their website is overpromised and under delivered.I don't know how this gets a 41/2 star rating.  The hotel is fine, however they don't offer transportation to  and from airport.  Worse is that they told me that taxis weren't available for 40 mintues, however a private limo service was in the area now, but it would cost $10 to $15 more. Well when the limo driver came in the lobby to get my luggage I walked out to see a taxi waiting in front of the hotel and he offered to take me to the airport for $15 less.  How could a class hotel do this??????Poor communication and managementWe had communication issues from the start, but the rooftop view was key to our trip. Check in was easy but the rate was wrong, concierge was never on their game. Details were missed and dropped, and for a surprise for my wife, I ended up making all types of calls - making excuses to step away. The suite, yes suite, was tiny. Not small... TINY. For $300, it should be decent. Far from it. It was two small areas about 8x10 with a closet and bathroom in the middle. The bellman did not come for check out service, the car was not pulled up - yet I paid handsomely for valet and tipped very well. Never got the final bill, but got overcharged and had to send several emails to get a reply. You could not pay me to stay there again.you can get this one on priceline, fyi.booked a room here for ufc 107 and it was cool. plenty of douches (as in my review of the hotel glenn in atlanta) but nice spot. the room was a decent size for a boutique hotel. one negative... i requested a room with two beds on the phone with someone the wednesday before my trip. didn't happen... they did bring up a rollaway, and i'm told it was quite comfortable. this particular room faced another building, so there was no view (fine with me, pricewire was decent to me). ""continental"" ""breakfast"" really wasn't anything to speak of. just a bunch of simple carbohydrates and orange juice from concentrate. i had two slices of bread with butter/spread that actually held me over until we got to gus'. also, there was a sign saying the breakfast was being served in the restaurant, but it wasn't. it was in the meeting room and i would have never found that out had i not bumped into a housekeeping lady. i'd certainly stay here again if i found myself in memphis again, but not before checking out the peabody first.eric bGreat boutique hotel, friendly staff , elegant modern design. Centrally located to Main St, Beale St is within walking distance. Great views of the river from the roof. Would staff there again and will recommend it to friends.Good but not great, did not meet expectationsWe stayed for a couple of days here in the summer.  Location is very good if you want to be downtown and the staff was mostly nice and very helpful.  (they could have warned us to avoid Beale Street on Friday night). Room was ok; bathroom had no counters or sink storage, but had deep windowsills to accommodate our stuff.   The room was not very quiet, even on weekends.  Good consistent AC would have helped, but it only came on now and then, with incredible noise, and blew straight on the bed.  We spent nights alternating freezing in the draft and being awakened by street noise.  There was a decent lap pool in the basement.  Very strange that most downtown Memphis hotels have pools only in the basement, not very conducive for hanging out by the pool to get a break from the Memphis summer heat.The Madison Hotel in Memphis was the best hotel experience that I have ever had. I've stayed at other 4-star hotels and B&amp;B's, but the Madison Hotel has the best service by far. There were four of us total with two to a room. Both us of got Queen Bankers rooms which are small rooms, however they made a good use of the space. The bathroom was quite spacious and the pedestal sink had plenty of real estate for two people. The twice daily housekeeping is a nice touch. We loved coming back from dinner to find our bed turned down with ice waiting in the bucket and chocolates on the pillows. They also turn the CD player on when they do turndown and move the TV remote to the table next to the bed. It's all the little things that were really cool for me. I've had turn down services before, but never to this level. The rooftop patio truly is the best view in Memphis. The view out over the river at sunset is breathtaking, and night is beautiful in its own way. The Mezzanine was also a nice place to sit and have a drink the second night when it was cold and rainy. It looked out over the lobby and there is a good music mix so it had a really chill vibe. The free breakfast is served at Grill 83 their restaurant.  They don't have a ton of choices, but it's tasty and it's free. The staff is what really puts it over the top. They remembered us every time we saw them. They would ask things like if we wanted tea since we had tea the day before. They also mentioned how good their restaurant was, but didn't push it on you. They always smiled and were just genuinely nice. I will say the valet parking is a little slow, but really I don't think it could be any better. The blocks in downtown Memphis are small and the staff does the best it can with the available space.  In closing, if you ever find yourself in Memphis, a stay at the Madison is a must!I was informed upon arrival that this hotel is the place where all the nba players stay when playing the grizzlies. I like lead ins like that. Styain with the ballers....place was great and i am told by locals that its superior to its much better known sister down the street The Peabody. Modern, clean and hip with a nice gym across street. Stay here.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-memphis-downtown-memphis,Crowne Plaza Memphis Downtown,3.0,$$,83,"Parking was too much so I just parked on the street in front. Little strange that the front door to the hotel was locked at night and you had to go around back to get in. But the room was nice. The TV wouldn't show a picture but it had sound. I figured out how to fix it though. It wasn't awesome but it wasn't badRoom is comfortable but the hotel in general is in dire need of an update. Items attached to the wall in the bathroom are loose and would fall off if pulled on at all. There is a musty smell that's probably the old carpet. All in all it's not a bad place to stay but the reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the totally unusable free wifi. So much for member benefits. When you could connect at all, it only lasted a matter of seconds - maybe a few minutes. The best part of our stay was the extremely friendly and helpful shuttle driver. He knew everything from the best places to eat downtown to history of the city, and the upcoming return of the trolley system to the city. He was there when promised to pick us up for our return to the hotel. Overall, he was a very intelligent, courteous, and entertaining driver. He more than deserved his tip.The room was nice, clean and comfortable. The professionalism of the staff was lacking at the registration desk and the hotel is currently undergoing construction. This was not known to me until I got to the hotel. And I was not informed of what time construction started in the morning. Needless to say, I was rudely awakened by construction noise when I needed to rest up for my road trip cross country. Also, Parking is not free at this hotel!!! Breakfast isn't complementary unless you purchased it with your room.I see potential for this hotel however, they need to work on their professionalism and communicationThe hotel stay was good. I didn't like that I came during the time they are renovating this hotel It felt like I was staying at a Motel not a hotel. Everything about it felt outdated. The fixtures are old and drains are not working correctly. The dinning area feels like a large conference room. I would not stay here again. The staff however was super friendly and the rooms were clean. They could have stocked the shampoo, coffee etc which they didn't.Awful. Checked in at 11pm and the lady in the front desk didn't even greet us (didn't even look up!). She didn't ask us what size bed we wanted nor asked if we wanted a smoking or non smoking room. She just asked for my id and my credit card and proceeded to swipe our guest room cards. When we got up to our room, we were given 2 double beds and the room was poorly lit with one lamp that had those awful LED lights. We were coming from a 9 hr drive and was so tired that we didn't even bother to get our room changed. We were finally settling in when someone in the hallway were drilling something at 11:30 pm!! Seriously?! Parking was $17 overnight. It should have been free since they were renovating at the time. It was our first time in Memphis and let me just say that this hotel left a bad taste in our mouths.This hotel cancelled our reservation before we arrived without letting us know. The official cancellation policy on our confirmed email reservation said we had until 6pm to arrive (or needed to add our credit card to assure a late arrival). We arrived at 4pm. They had overbooked the hotel so they just started cancelling rooms. They kept saying ""we're just following policy"" even though this was clearly against their cancellation policy as a stated in their email. They didn't seem very sorry about it because they knew they just had to deal with their overbooking problem. They did call around and find another hotel room for us and we were assured the same rate. We had to move down the street to another hotel. I'm grateful they found us a place. But their complete lack of attention to the real policy and general apathy was bad service.These are the sweetest, most pleasant people I've ever encountered in a hotel staff. I will stay here every time I come to Memphis - construction or not. Reginald is a phenomenal shuttle driver and Cleo is a awesome as well. The front desk staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they'll help you with anything you need. They've been handling all the woes of construction with grace and I know their lobby is going to be absolutely beautiful when finished. Also the French toast at breakfast is DOPE. Try it. No where else I'd rather get snowed in!Stayed here a few times on Thursdays before Friday AM flight. Check in was slow but did greet me as a Platinum, bonus points, and upgrade. This hotel does not have a Platinum Lounge but they do give you 1 free drink upon check-in... This is a negative for me - I like the lounges. Not really walking distance downtown a cab will be needed. They didn't offer me shuttle service but it looks like they have 1.Rooms were ok been in better - but it was clean and comfy. Nice little bar area downstairs with overpriced drinks and decent food. Didn't receive my wake up call on 2 of 3 occasions.Avg $150 a nightSo so:)It's about $100 + parking lot $10-15. If you wanna save some money, you should park at the parking lot around church.Room:clean, nice view, decent sizeSwimming pool:outside, smallGym:small, water cooler, weights, elliptical, towel, tvStaff:niceLocation:a little bit far from fun areas but you can use  shuttle serviceRestaurant and bar: Good price. Nice service. Friendly stuff.This hotel is definitely not any better than a Holiday Inn.  Actually it is not as good as The holiday inn.  We had to ask for several things to be fixed in our room and only one got fixed.  The HBO and other cable channels did not come in.  Was going to purchase a bottle of soda and a bag of chef mix in lobby but decided not to after I found out it would cost $10.  Parking is $17 per day.  A bit run down, but not horrible.  No free breakfast.  Generally worn out, loose sink faucet in bathroom.  No microwave or refrigerator,  not even a pen and paper.  Pretty bare bones.  Will not return.I stayed here with my parents on a stopover on a road trip to OKC. The hotel is right off of the interstate downtown and very convenient in that aspect. It's definitely more than walking distance to the festivities on Beale St, but there is a shuttle that they provide for guests to go down there. The rooms were well appointed and the first beds were very comfortable. You could tell the hotel's age in some places as some of the paint was chipped near the door to the bathroom in our room but there was nothing major. The staff here was absolutely 5 star. From check in to check out, they were very helpful and attentive. We requested a room facing downtown (which I recommend) and they made it happen. It really added to our visit. However, there were a few negatives- -They do charge $17/day for parking and that can really add in to your final bill. I would have preferred to just pay $10 in the nightly rate as opposed to having it tacked once we arrived. -I got a great deal on the hotel through Priceline, however we got the feeling that everyone got a great deal here as there were some seedy characters that were also staying here. Upon our arrival there was a large group of people smoking right by the front door that we had to walk through to check in. It definitely killed the otherwise upscale atmosphere and they would benefit from having a designated smoking area.Lousy wifi. $17/day to self park. Poor insulation in bedrooms. Some might say, Meghan, why 2 stars?Well the bedroom furniture is pretty contemporary and the location isn't half bad. I'd suggest the Holiday inn or Hampton inn and suites. They are closer to Beale &amp; probably cheaper.Basic hotel amenities but very well managed. Staff all very polite and accommodating. The shuttle drivers are the best! Reginald and Mr. Turner gave wonderful recommendations for navigating to various restaurants and sights without needing to pay for a tour package.Pros: free shuttle to downtown, certain staff members were friendly and wanted to help (not all, but there were a few that spent time and effort to try to help)Cons: dirty rooms (had to switch 3 times) and was still left with clogged sinks and tubs, hotel is in need of maintenance, air conditioners can't keep up (room couldn't get below 69F) and the one in the rooms are SO NOISY, the hallways are not airconditioned so it smells like mold and feels like hot, stagnant air, the location is not as close to Beale street as they lead you to believe. The free shuttle helps, but for $10 more, upgrade and stay MUCH closer to the action (and not the highway!)Nice hotel extra security and nice staff the thing was there were a lot of mosquito biting but I know cause we were on the Mississippi River but besides that everything was wonderful even room service was coolOuch!! This place has bed bugs! I was itching my legs the whole time that we stayed here. 9th floor. Do not stay here unless you plan on having the worst itching sensation cause you a tremendous amount of pain. Where I was bitten, burned, itched, and wouldn't stop itching even with Extra Strength Benadryl cream. Do some research, there are bed bug registry reports out there and this hotel is on there by other people also. Parking is overpriced at $17 a day charged on top of your room rate. Shuttle service is nice but overcrowded and overused. You will do a lot of waiting and have to fight for your spot on the shuttle especially late at night. Beale street is live and vibrant till 3am but the shuttle stops at 11:45pm on the weekend and 10:45pm during the week for its last pick up. The shuttle is not worth it considering it comes with high stress, bed bugs, and a housekeeping staff that doesn't understand you when you ask for a trash bag or complain about the bed bug bites. I showed the housekeeper my bites and she said it was because of the laundry detergent and changed the sheets. That didn't help, I still got eaten alive!! BEWARE - do NOT stay here!This place came up uber cheap for our random Memphis trip. Room was clean, beds and pillows were divine...really great toiletries. Appreciated the aromatherapy after the long drive. Only issues with this place...the little bus of theirs that takes you downtown, which is literally some blocks, stops running at 11....luckily in our drunkenness we had no problem just walking back, less than 10 min really...security was cool and staff was very nice. $17 bucks to park outside in their lot...not cool. Across the street is a church parking lot, $5 bucks for the day. Memphis police was everywhere so safety not an issue at all. But for a place that does not have free breakfast and shabby furniture...the parking price was ridic. Also a very late check in time. Its all a scam but the bed was great.Excellent staff from the desk personnel to the shuttle driver (Reginald). Clean comfortable rooms. Check in was a breeze. No worries here.The hotel is in a great location, about a mile from the famous Beale Street. Room is clean and I like the little extras they leave on the bed like scented oils and lotion that will help you sleep. The bathroom is a little small. The staff was really friendly. The two women we encountered at the front desk were really helpful with answering questions. They have a complimentary shuttle that will take you around the downtown area which is great! And they drivers of the shuttles are also very friendly and engage in friendly conversation. I'd stay here again when visiting Memphis again!I booked a king non smoking room at this hotel for a brief work trip. I'm understanding of the construction but the room was sub-par. My room faced the freeway and I was certain that I could hear the radio station of every car that passed. The radio had a sound machine setting, but it did not work. The TV had a large green line from the bottom of the screen to the top of it which was very annoying. The light switch in the bathroom had a short so I had to tap it to get it to stay on, this made me very nervous to be tapping while I was in the shower. I barely slept because of the noise and the walls were paper thin, I could hear everything above me, next to me and all the commotion in the hall. When I inquired of the front desk to see if this was an older room that would be renovated, I was told that 'your room is fine'. I honestly couldn't believe her response as I checked out. I will never stay at a Crowne Plaza again and would not suggest it to anyone.","I do stay here regularly when I come to memphis since this is my crew hotel. Tonight I was given one of their worst rooms. I had a leaky faucet, broken desk phone, the desk leg is loose and wobbly.  The TV had sound but no picture, so maintenance came up to tell me the TV needed rebooting because it's old, not to mention this is a flat screen LG TV.  So he turned it off and back on and it did work this time. The bathroom had no toiletries but they left me a half used tube of hotel lotion from the previous guest who stayed there. I realized the desk was broken when I tried to pull the chair from under it to seat and couldn't without slightly lifting the table. Someone or housekeeping intentionally wedge the chair under it to secure the desk, thinking no one will use it. So they knew about the problem and brushed it aside.This hotel is well on its way of losing its crowne because it's not up to standard with the Crowne Plaza chain. Rooms are outdated and often times smelly.  To me this just another low budget hotel with a big name.I decided to give The Crowne Plaza in Memphis a try as it seemed to be situated in a reasonable area and near to downtown Memphis.So I'm going to start with the good things about this hotel.1) Reginald the hotel shuttle driver, will take you just about anywhere within reason, in Memphis and pick you up as well. He works until around 11pm and he is a REALLY, REALLY nice guy. Plus he'll give you some local touristy info as you drive around.2) Very nice bathroom amenities, shampoo and conditioners.Unfortunately that's where it ends.1) There is NO working internet at this property as far as I can tell. Despite asking the front desk staff twice about this, I was told that this was due to current high occupancy. To be brutally honest, if your internet only works when there is nobody staying at the hotel, then you have some serious issues that need to be resolved. 2) The walls are paper thin, such that you can here the guy next door ordering his pizza and almost hear him eating it as well.3) The room we stayed in needed some major refurbishment, chipped doors and cupboards and a general unloved feel. 4) Front desk were somewhat offhand and rather inhospitable.All in all, rather disappointing.Poor customer service the lady was yelling to someone in the background while trying to converse with me. The shuttle bus driver tried to hustle us so I just said no and drove my own car to Beale. The room needs updating, lampshade cracked and broken, and the electrical outlet didn't work.  So disappointed this was my birthday celebration trying to stay in a nice hotel and enjoy Beale. To share something nice, I liked the pillows and the flat screen.This hotel is not up to the standards of other Crowne Plazas. Its currently under construction, which is fine. It needs major updating. What's not fine is having your hotel lobby dirty. The floor is gross. And the rooms are cleanish. They clean it but they do not try to hard or look closely. Also, in between nights they refreshed the room but didn't leave any new soap or shampoo. Also, hair dryer was broke. Called down to front desk and the front desk was great she had one sent up unfortunately, it took around 40 mins to get and a few calls down to the front desk. The breakfast is so basic and not good. I asked for a cooked to order egg item and the server was a little rude. They way she asked the question I didn't get what she was asking. What do you want when I replied eggs she was like what do you want. She could of politely asked how do you want your eggs. It wasn't that busy to be rude to a customer. The front desk was the only good part of this hotel. They are friendly and helpful. The rest of the staff not so much. Also, workout facility is on the 11th floor which this floor is a little creepy since no one is on it. It has major room to improve. Very disappointed in it being a Crowne Plaza.This is my favorite hotel in this area. It's a great place to stay. There is a particular bar tender in the restaurant who is pretty unfriendly. I can't think of her name but she knows she could do a better job at such a great hotel. I won't let it stop me from staying here but if she's working I drink and eat elsewhere.I'm checking out of this place now and heading to The Madison with my fingers crossed. This place is dirty, the walls are paper thin (heard a normal volume conversation from the room next door), the wifi was slow, the room had a funny stink that was covered by bleach, the breakfast buffet was cold (with watered down coffee and OJ) so we ordered from the menu (should've gotten breakfast elsewhere like we did yesterday), and I'll say it again.... it's LOUD - you hear everything. Don't get a room by the stairs or it'll sound like a shotgun is going off outside your door. Maybe it's better on some floors but I doubt it.The staff is friendly. The beds were clean and comfy.Definitely not worth their higher ratings on travel websites. Motel 6 quality... and that may be an insult to Motel 6.Let's start with the pluses--The hotel had friendly staff and my room was very clean and nice. It has a nice location right off the highway and near downtown. Now, to the not so nice. The hotel reeks of mildew and mold. The hallways and entry way are disgusting and there is a real lack of amenities. The ice machine on my floor doesn't work and the floor around it is literally falling apart. So, if you aren't effected my spell much and can hold your breath until you get to your room, it's a fine stay from there. Otherwise, I would pass.This place was so noisy and wifi so bad I checked out a day early even though I had paid through Expedia. I hope Expedia will reimburse me. The highway noise was worse than I have had when staying at an airport hotel.  The wifi was so weak I had to reboot several times.  The TV reception went out several times. The room was supposed to have a refrigerator. It had the space for it but nothing. This room is years past it's prime. #817The self park is more expensive than nearby hotels valet. The walk in from the parking lot is not ADA compliant by any means.  Curbs, doors that are not automatic. Hard enough bringing luggage-- can't imagine if I needed assistance. Worse? Reception didn't ask how my stay was. Did not ask why I was checking out early. Just said since I paid by a third party I have to ask about a refund from them. I thought I was in the south where hospitality was king.  Apparently not. And when a room cost $250 including the crazy taxes and fees in Memphis I expect more!Don't let the door hit you in the back on the way out. IWell...I stayed here because I tried to do a cheap 3 star through priceline. This is listed as a 3 1/2 star Motel (maybe years ago) it was $116.XX with tax plus $17.00 to self park or $20.00 for valet (not mentioned on the website) Its a nice hotel, but its older and need some maintenance, I would not stay here again for $135.00Pros:* Clean room* Very comfortable bed* Clean, newer outdoor pool and pool-side lounging area* 1 block from Convention Center* 1 block from Freeway* Free shuttle to Beale St and other downtown attractions. * Easy 15-20 minute walk to Beale St and other downtown attractions.* Complimentary good, strong coffee in lobby in AM* Very friendly staffCons:* WiFi totally sucked. We could not get the WiFi to work on Windows, Android, or IOS at all during our multi-day stay. Business travelers beware.* Worn-out furniture in lobby and room. Crowne Plaza Memphis needs to make another trip to the Goodwill furniture store and restock furniture with cushions that have something left in them* Leaky bathroom faucet kept the top of the sink wet constantlythis may not be the newest hotel and it may be right off of hwy 40, but i would stay here again. THE STAFF IS THE BEST!! from the valet, to the shuttle driver to the front desk.........everybody has been fantastic!! the bath products are much better than a lot more expensive hotels. parking is $17 self park and $20 valet, but no more than most cities. the staff makes it!!I was charged a 17.00 per night parking fee and wasn't even made aware of this until I received my bill.  When I asked about the charge they made the comment well you registered your vehicle.  Yes pretty much all hotels have you register your vehicle. I am now staying at a Holiday Inn and I also registered my vehicle here but they didn't charge me 17.00 per night. I think that is ridiculous and sneaky as well as dishonest.I've stayed at many Crowne Plazas. We stayed at this one for a night while in Memphis. My boyfriend used his points to get a free room. When I checked in, I confirmed that the room was free. The person at the front desk agreed that it was free. He mentioned that they put a hold for $30 on the card but that it goes back. Well we were still billed for $30 and it was never refunded. The only reason why we picked this hotel was because of the points. It is still a decent walk to Beale St. The shuttle driver was kind and dropped us off at Beale St. The hotel room was nice with a comfy bed but the view was nothing special. The valet was rather pricey especially given that the hotel isn't in the best location and it is Memphis, not Chicago or Philly.The hotel room is very comfortable and had everything I needed except a bag in the trash cans...  I like the lemon water and lemonade in the lobby.  The hotel is not very pedestrian friendly since there is so much construction nearby. The hotel food is not worth it. The price for the room is too high.This place was great, but I will start with the negative. Once you check in, you get your room key and the key is uses to enter and exit the hotel parking lot, but it never worked. The hotel apologized for the inconvenience. The staff was very accommodating. The hotel is close to the express way and less than 2 minutes from Beale Street. The hotel has fresh lemonade in the lobby, that is very tasty. Besides, the key fiasco everything else was awesome and amazing. Parking is $17/night (self) and $20/night (valet), unlimited in and out privileges, which is not bad for downtown parking, considering that I am from Chicago and downtown parking here @ a hotel is at least $49/night.1st impression, very nice hotel.  Very nice rooms.  Not too far from Beale St if you trying to find something nice under $200/night.The cons.  The free shuttle service is not reliable.  We had to take a taxi, because it was just an SUV, and there were too many people waiting in line to use it.  I booked a rate I could cancel.  My buddy booked a cheaper non-refundable rate.  He was also rewarded with a free breakfast (which he was completely unaware of until the day of our stay).  I was not given the free breakfast.  I found this particularly unfair, because we kept our reservation and paid $25 more.  I think we earned that breakfast.  I just think since I did keep my reservation, the hotel shouldn't continue to punish me during my stay for not taking the cheaper, non-refundable rate.  I mean, I just made you more money, and you thank me by not giving me breakfast!  On the flip side, he said it was terrible, and that the eggs nearly made him gag, so I guess we didn't miss anything.However, given I generally don't care about breakfast, I'd probably stay here again if I was trying to save some money.  Memphis hotels near Beale Street will ream you for sure.The hotel wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest.  It's in the 'quiet' part of downtown, and very close to the courthouse.  The 'blues' attractions are about a mile walk, which isn't bad at all.  I ranked it just 'okay' because, again, when I pay this much for a hotel, I expect complimentary breakfast.  Instead the continental breakfast was $5, and we paid $14 for regular parking.  The inside of the hotel looks quite upscale, so that's a plus.  We were blessed not to have a window overlooking the freeway.Overall its a fence riding A-okay/ Great hotel. We did get a great rate on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> @ $81.00 a night for a king size no smoking room. I did request apon arrival that we get a city view room and it was no problem at all. (the back side faces the interstate)Pro's:-Free WIFI-Friendly/ Informative/ Fun Front Desk Staff-Free Shuttle to and from Beal St. until Midnight-Nice and Clean Hotel rooms with great bathroom products-All requests answered and delivered very fast-Great Bar and Restaurant down stairs-No penalty extended check out time (1 hour) 12 noonCon's: -$17 parking or $20 valet parking on site-No complementary breakfast-Loud hallways (thin doors) do not get a room by the elevator. After a night of drinking, the last thing we wanted to hear was loud Room Service staff out side our door at 8:00am. (we called the front desk and it was taken care of fast)For the Rate we received I would stay at this hotel again!Just another hotel.  Fenced parking area, which is nice.  $8 per day self parking, $20 per day valet. 1 block off the interstate  2 blocks from the trolley station.I had a horrible experience at this property [especially given the rate of $159/nt in Memphis which seems exorbitant given the quality of your property.]  When I checked in Weds night, the front desk lady was very pleasant, and made a point of recognizing that I was a Platinum member. She said they had me setup in a ""Platinum Suite.""  Not so.  I was put in a standard room with a connecting door to another room.  First I tried to connect online - I had complementary wireless - and it didn't work.  I spent 30 min on the phone with your tech repair group and they were unable to fix.  I unpacked, thought it'd be fine, until the neighbor came home and I could hear every sound.  I would've been fine with a standard room, but had tons of work to do and couldn't handle the noise.  I called the front desk and they assigned me to another room.  I had to re-pack everything to move down the hall.A bellman came to let me into my new room.  It smelled awful; I even asked him if he smelled it, and he agreed.  So, called back down AGAIN and they put me in the room next door.  At this point I was livid, and wished I'd paid a couple more dollars to stay at the Doubletree downtown which is MUCH nicer than this hotel.  Finally, the 3rd room was standard without a connecting door and didn't smell, so finally had a room where I could begin my work.  Then the TV didn't work - it was so annoying and inconvenient all around.  The engineer came up and fixed it [then it didn't work again in the morning, so had to have him come back.]All in all it was a horrible experience, will not stay at this property again, and will likely not stay at another Crowne Plaza.  I would expect impeccable service and quality room to be given to a Platinum member.  Instead I was lied to, put in a horrible standard room, then a series of rooms with non-working services.  I also was never provided any sort of compensation or apologies from the front desk managers I spoke with.The only reason I gave this property 2 stars instead of 1 is because the people I interacted with, i.e. hte bellman, engineer, housekeeping, etc, were all very nice.","The staff was wonderful and the shuttle to Beale street was a nice addition to make our stay great!!!  If you looking for a nice hotle look no further!!,Worst customer service ever!! Obviously the employees do not get paid on customer experience. This is unfortunate that a great hotel chain like Crowne Plaza has a property like this to tarnish its rep. Very dirty and out of date as well! Would not recommend!My eleven year old wanted a adventure this summer, she said like last year in DC but better lol I'm thinking less educational and I don't want to take her out of the states yet. And we love Elvis! Getting in to town at  6am from Houston doesn't leave you a lot of options on where you have breakfast. We ended up eating in the hotel. The food for Memphis was nothing you couldn't buy at Denny's the staff in the dining room wasn't available at Denny's:)star- breakfast staff The only thing about this hotel that is up to date is the 2012 Tahoe they use for private transportation witch desperately needs its  oil  pressure checked and rechecked. A prankster thought we needed to  have  a fire drill so to speak, I  understand if it was a actual fire the necessity to stand around for 30 min and ""shoot the s   t"" with your coworkers but really . ""omg then I was like.... Oh kkkkkay totally"" Grow up, behind you is a hotel that needs CPR in the customer service and hospitality dpt. The morning desk staff has the worst attitude, as if the rolls are reversed and how dare  I make her  work. Gasp!All in all the guys who take you to and fro are really nice and the beds are comfortable  -star But sadly this is the end and we will be moving to the Westin.My friends daughter is staying there right now, had to move her room 3 TIMES, still she is with BED BUGS. She even took some on a tissue to show them.  WTF!!!Hello Health Dept, hope you are on your way.Clean, friendly staff, nice pool, but pricey. The room was very clean and the staff was very friendly. They even gave us advice on a good BBQ place, which turned out to be great. The cost for the room and the restaurant bar was pretty expensive. We ordered dessert and a few drinks and it was $70 with tip. The pool area was clean and nice.My parents and I have had a wonderful time here. The staff is so friendly, they seem genuinely happy to be here. The rooms are very nice and clean and the shuttle around the city had been very convenient. I will stay on this hotel again!I never write reviews but I created an account just to review this place. Absolutely rude staff and our room smelled awful. We switched rooms and the second one is just as bad. The entire place needs updating. We paid 130 bucks for one night and it was not worth it. We stayed at the Sheraton the night before for thirty bucks cheaper and for a MUCH nicer hotel and service. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone...especially for the price they charge.My wife was attacked inside the ladies toilet at the above hotel. The woman attacker brandished a knife, pushed her over, stole a case containing an umbrella (probably thinking it was a purse) and ran from the hotel into an awaiting car.My wife suffered severe bruising to her elbows and knees and mental anquish about visiting ladies toilets alone. The incident was reported to the hotels Chief Engineer who called the local Police. the local Police attended but felt unable to pursue the matter any further. I asked whether the hotel had CCTV but was told no. Other members of the touring party attempted to block the woman assailant and reported that the woman had been seen talking to the desk staff who should have been able to provide information to the Hotel Manager. I asked the Hotel Manager for a copy of his Chief Engineer's report but was refused a copy. The Hotel Manager maintained that I would have to go through his Insurance Company. This to me indicated that he recognised that security at the above hotel was inadequate. The reaction of the Hotel Manager to my request to me indicated that this was not the first time that this had occurred. Further research on Trip Advisor proved that my suspicions were correct. Below are the reports of robbery at this hotel to be found on Trip Advisor. ""Not Safe"" Reviewed 23 October 2012................ There are no security cameras. One member's wife was robbed while she was in her room using the bathroom. ............ ""A Beastly Atrocity of a Hotel"" Reviewed 18 September 2010..During the second night at this shanty, someone broke into our hotel rooms and removed the contents of our wallets. The hotel staff was utterly incompetent in dealing with this matter. They refused to provide any description or timeline of when our emptied wallets had been turned in to the front desk. Additionally, they were unable to furnish any video footage, due to lack of hallway cameras. I was informed by a sympathetic member of the cleaning crew that ""there aren't any cameras anywhere in this hotel"" and that ""stuff goes on all the time here"". Management took down a rather half hearted report of the matter ..... and referred absolutely everything to their insurance company. The malevolent insurance company called 4 days later and humored me by asking two simple questions before viciously denying any sort of claim. There was quite clearly no serious investigation on the part of either the hotel or insurance company. It was an entirely corrupt process utilized to deny any semblance of responsibility, both investigative and preventative, on the part of the hotel. I urge anyone to consider the security ramifications before staying at this hotel. You are placing yourself, your valuables, and your family at risk. The woefully inadequate camera system undoubtedly encourages this manner of theft and cat burglary all the time. They stole money from my suitcase in my room"" Reviewed 8 December 2009 ..We travelled from Australia, to the Uk and then to the US for 4 weeks, I loved Memphis but this hotel was shocking, I had hid AUD and GBP in my suitcase, which was zipped and hidden in a plastic bag and my wallet. We had pre paid 2 nights and after a day sight seeing checked my case and the passports weren't where I had left them and the money was gone.The hotel staff were not interested, the police were fabulous, the GM of the hotel never contacted me, just the insurance company and the police. Someone went through my stuff stole our money and the hotel staff did not show any compassion or understanding at all. There were no unauthorized entries for that day they tell me, so you make your own mind up  $300.00 AUD and GBP $30.00 stolen!!!! Just some Aussie tourists, so who cared. They work in gangs and this is want happened to us, October 14th and 15th October 2009. Stole it the day before we left, but they know when you are checking out .......Just remember... a 3.5 star hotel in Memphis is not the same as a 3.5 star hotel in Chicago or Boston.If you have ever stayed at a Crowne Plaza before.. Its like one of those.. except.. older.. and a little dirtier..If you can get a room here from a discount site like Hotwire or something and dont care/cant afford to spend the extra $40-50 a night to stay elsewhere.. then this is a perfectly fine hotel. No frills.. Its got a pool.. Its got in and out parking for $15 a day.. Its on the far end of Downtown so if you can get a room on the Southside of the building Im sure your view will be awesome. (we stayed on the Northside and had a great view of I-40 and St. Judes)They have a shuttle service that will drive you anywhere Downtown as long as its not raining. Its the most average hotel ever. We didnt hate it.. We didnt love it.. Like.. I cant even believe Im writing a review on it..But.. maybe thats why Im writing a review.. to either help you pick a totally average hotel.. or save you from a totally average hotel..Nice hotel but internet VERY SLOOOOOW and intermittent! They should have this nailed because is very important to business people!!!I stay in many hotels and this is worst WIFI I've experienced! You would think an ""upscale"" hotel like this would have fast internet... Oh wellThis place is great. They provide you with daily amenities if you ever forget anything or are traveling and do not want to carry too much. Toothbrush, toothpaste, and even deodorant. The staff is nice and very accommodating. The rooms were a good size for the rate that I paid. No dirty carpets and a clean bed and shower. The firealarm went off on the 2nd night it kept ringing for about 15 minutes and later turned off. Someone must have pulled it as a joke.Overall. I would stay here the next time I am on business around Downtown, Memphis.This hotel is pretty nice. I happened to stay in it the week of a very large Baptist convention, so it was very busy, and with a lot of people who didn't seem to travel often. The lobby was very crowded so it took awhile to check in. The staff were very nice and even called my room to make sure everything was OK! I like this southern hospitality! The room was fresh and crisp and clean. It is a super hot and humid day so I was so grateful when my room was CHILLY! You have to pay for parking ($18 a day I think?). To me it seemed really expensive for the area. The hotel is within walking distance of everything downtown and they even offer a shuttle to those who don't want to walk. The pool is strangely located across the street? I don't know about you but I would not want to walk across the street in a swimsuit to go to the pool.No continental breakfast :( Four stars for location, decor, friendly staff, and cleanliness.The man at the front desk, Darrell, was so kind and welcoming! He was also super helpful, giving is great pointers and helping make is as comfortable as possible. Great service. The room is comfortable. internet is sluggish. Clean and stylish room! There is a free shuttle service, a great perk to go out and see the city.Hotel is nice enough.  Considering the area, it's nicer than most.  Across the street is a low income complex where Elvis used to live with his parents, until he made too much money to qualify.The WiFi is spotty and very slow.  But it's free.  There's a shuttle that will take you to and from Beale St.  because you do not want to walk to and from there after sun down.  The shuttle will even take you to Gus's Famous Hot &amp; Spicy Chicken which is AMAZING!  Take advantage!The buffet in the hotel is meh.  There's a better (but of course more expensive) buffet at the hotel across the street.  If you get a room with a view of the highway, be warned that you can hear the traffic in your room.  It was a little cold, so I had to turn the heater on which drowned out the sound of all the traffic.I had a TERRIBLE experience at what is supposed to be a ""LUXURY"" hotel. Nothing was explained to me at check-in as well as unfriendly clerks. One heavy set girl at the desk didn't even look up at me when I walked in for 5 minutes until someone else came to help.  I found dead bed bugs and lady bugs in my room. I spoke with the supposedly front desk manager who did nothing to rectify the situation. She only informed me that they ""take these things very serious."" I let her know that I would be reporting to Trip Advisor and she basically said ""whatever go ahead"" This was not at all professional. My experience at this particular facility was not what I anticipated. RUDE STAFF and BUGS is not what I anticipated paying for.Not worth the money. The lobby and hallways were burning up when we arrived. Not fun to have a drink at the bar and sweat worse than if you were outside. The valet attendant was no where to be found when we arrived back from dinner. I had to have her paged and she finally come out of her room. We booked through Priceline and they usually have better hotels than this.Upon arrival the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  There were two couples in our party and we requested that we be near each other and they put us next to each other with out any issues.  The room was mediocre, the bathrooms were small, and overall just pretty average.  We were in memphis for a long weekend, so it was perfect for that!  We hardly spent any time in the room anyway.  The location was pretty good.  We were about a mile off of beale street and the hotel had a free shuttle which was GREAT! it ran until midnight every night except sunday, so that was very helpful.  The drivers give you their card and you simply call them to tell them where you are and they pick you up to bring you back...speaking of the drivers, REGGIE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! He was funny, fun, and gave us AWESOME suggestions for places to go.  He works the night shift, so if you end up staying there, you'll see what I mean!This hotel was not a five star luxury experience. But was very clean and nicely decorated for the holidays. The staff at the hotel was amazing. Tangela Flemming recommended a perfect itinerary for the weekend getaway complete with amazing dining (Blue Plate Cafe, Ms Pollys and Flight) She also make sure we added some entertainment to our stay and encouraged us to go to Memphis sound for Karaoke. We felt like we had our own personal travel agent with her spot on recommendations. The entire staff were amazing, warm and friendly. They wanted to make sure two big-city ladies had a good ole time in the south. Reginald and Mr Taylor were lifesavers. (The hotel also provided complementary shuttle service.) Whenever we called -- he was a few minutes away and rescued us from the cold. Kenneth and Temera in the dining area were also a treat.I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Good location, gated parking (it's $10 a day...EEK!), easy access to the freeway, and REALLY nice staff. It's about a 10 minute walk to Beale St. and the downtown happenings from this hotel but it's a quiet and safe walk, especially during the day. I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I'm in Memphis! One minor complaint is about their paper-thin walls and ceilings! First off, you can hear the conversation going on between your neighbors, which in my opinion is kind of awkward. Also, if you stay in the 10th floor, beware of the gym above you. You can hear people dropping weights and running on treadmills , especially at night, which is VERY annoying. But other than that, this hotel rocks! Again, the staff is sooo friendly and the location is convenient...can't really ask for more than that!Well, as stated by others, this is a perfectly average hotel. The location is decent and the beds are comfortable and usually that is all one could really ask for. But one could have the tendency to ask for the coffee grounds from the previous guest to be thrown away and the coffee pot cleaned out. One might possibly ask for the bathroom door to latch, but that is no big deal. The free shuttle service to and from Beale Street until midnight is a plus if you are boring and want to leave the bars at a ridiculously early time (just kidding!). The ladies downstairs called literally five minutes upon entering the room to make sure we were settling in all right, which was nice. The staff was also prompt in delivering my request for a razor and shaving cream. My legs were so hairy! My friend and I sat down to have a cup of coffee and a small bite to hold us over until lunch in the restaurant. The prices were as expected for a hotel, but we could not justify paying $17 for the tiny buffet (we were going to have lunch in awhile anyway, so that's okay). I should add that there was an omelet bar, which is probably why it was a little pricey, eh? We settled for a side of breakfast potatoes, which were delicious! We were kind of disappointed to find out after it was too late that they had free coffee in the lobby for the guests and we were charged $3 each. I don't know if that is a legit complaint as I understand that not everything is complimentary and we were technically dining, but seriously... they had three coffee urns in the lobby 20 feet away from our table. Such is life! No biggie.We decided to treat ourselves to some dine-in room service. Ordering was a hassle, because they seemed to be revamping their menu and anything we wanted to order from the menu in the room they did not have. We settled on two sirloin steaks and a bottle of sparkling wine. They gave us an estimate of 30 minutes, but it did not take that long at all. Yay! The lady who delivered the food was very kind and engaged us in friendly conversation. We did not get the salads that came with the steaks, but after calling they sent them up immediately (wrong dressing, though. Oopsies!) . The food was pretty good. Average.And to be honest, we're still here so our experience is not completely over. We'll see how check-out goes tomorrow. But overall, the place is average. Not a bad location at all and the food is all right if you're okay with paying the bumped up hotel prices. The bed is really comfortable and I want to take it home with me. I would stay here again if someone was offering to pay (man, I sound cheap!), but not too impressed. But not too disappointed either. Just... okay, whatevs. It's a hotel.","The bed was fairly comfortable.  They offer a free shuttle service to beale st and around.  The pool was not linked to the hotel.  You have to walk out the entrance through the unloading area and to the pool.  Room service isn't bad.  But I wouldn't spend the extra cost to stay here over somewhere like the Days Inn, again.This hotel was overall ok.  Not too fancy and about what you pay for compared to the other hotels in Memphis.  Worth the $100 difference from the others.  It's a good walk away from Beale Street, but the trolly stop is a street away.  If your feet need saved, take the trolly.  Breakfast was $13. Hold on to your money and go some place local.Stayed here for business. I just started a project that is going to have me in Memphis about 50% of my time for the next 2-3 mos, I will not be staying here. The air conditioner was moldy, the shower curtain liner did not stay in the tub very well and there was a large grease spot on the window. I mentioned these issues to the hotel manager at the front desk the next morning when I was heading out for the day. She said they would be taken care of. They were not. Cleaning the grease spot on the window was a 30 second house keeping issue. A little mold on the AC is only slightly less disconcerting than a lot of mold on the AC. Thats a 5 min house keeping issue. I had no expectation of them resolving the shower curtain issue. I hope they don't get sued when some geezer slips on a slick tile floor. The location was mediocre WRT Beale St, but still  less than a $5 cab rideThe WiFi was painfully slow. Only the Marriot across the street was worse.I will not be returning.If I could give this hotel 0 stars I would. FIrst of all, DIRTY BED BUGS. The room we stayed in not only felt old and gross it was. After waking up in the morning and leaving I found little red bites all over my body matching bed bug bites. I have complained to the hotel twice now and seem to be getting brushed off non stop. The hotel felt unsafe, the room was old and antiquated, and the TV didnt work. Cant find a single reason to ever stay there again.Staff was friendly and the room was nice. The wireless internet seems to struggle the later in the day it gets. The water pressure in the shower was good. Self park was $10. If you cut through the Marriott you can hop on the Main Street trolley for just $1, or a guy told us you can also buy a day pass for $3.25. The Crowne does have a shuttle, if you'd rather not ride the street car, but the street car is vintage and the drivers are friendly.Forgot my sweater in the room. Our group was too concerned about time to go back, ok fair enough. I called the hotel and made arrangements for it to be sent to me. I specified that there was no rush and if they could please send it the cheapest way possible.The sweater arrived 2-day-air. They charged my card $33.O U C HThats twice what the sweater cost. If given the option, I probably woulda just told them to chuck it.Thanks Crowne Plaza for dropping the ball.We Pricelined this one, and for the money we paid I feel like we got a pretty good deal. It's an older hotel and its age shows in the hallways, but the room seemed like it had been renovated relatively recently and was in good shape. Although you are right on the highway, the rooms are quiet (ours was, anyway). It seemed from maps that this hotel was going to be a bit far from the action in downtown Memphis, but that wasn't actually the case. Apparently they have a shuttle that takes you to and from Beale Street, which we weren't aware of when we stayed there. However, we had no trouble walking across the street and through the lobby of the Marriott to the streetcar line that takes you pretty much everywhere you'd want to go as a tourist. It does stop running at midnight, but the hotel is only a 15-20 minute walk from the Beale Street bars. Other reviewers have said you wouldn't want to walk back to this hotel after dark. I suppose I wouldn't attempt it alone, but my husband and I had no issues doing so and never felt scared or threatened.I wish they served a complimentary continental breakfast, and the wifi was frustratingly slow and spotty. On the whole, nothing special, but not a bad deal for a downtown Memphis hotel.Stayed at the Crowne Plaza this past weekend.Positives: Clean comfortable room, insanely comfortable bed, great water pressure in the shower, great bartender in the downstairs lounge, free shuttle service, good room service options, nice view.Negatives: Although I called the day before to ask if we would be able to check in a bit early (30 minutes before exact check-in time) and they said that it would be no problem- upon arrival they made us wait at the desk until exactly 4:00 to check in. Us and several other people waiting as well. Also we had asked to have a room attached or next door to our friends rooms- they also said this would be no problem yet upon arrival they could not even get us rooms on the same floor. There was no tv remote in our room and we had to call for one to be delivered. The parking lot does not seem very safe and for $10 a day they accept no responsibility for any damage done to your vehicle. The shuttle and trolley stop running at 1 am yet Beale St doesnt close until 3am so a taxi becomes neccesary (although the taxi ride only ran us $7)None of the offenses were enough to completely write off the Crowne Plaza but for the money ($92 with taxes on Expedia + $10 a day parking + $30 in room service breakfast) Next time we'll stay at the Hampton Inn on Beale, it's got the best location, free breakfast, and an indoor pool and jacuzzi (Crowne Plaza had an outdoor pool only- its march so thats not really an option)Do not stay here. The staff is very rude. I had a custodian yell at for walking through where he had just mopped. The bartender scolded me for setting my dinner plate on the bar. A ""thank you"" and ""you're welcome"" are apparently unheard and unknown by the staff here. Southern hospitality my eye!The maid service did not clean or replace the in room coffee service. Only half the channels worked on the TV. The bar closes at 11? Lame. The conference rooms were not air conditioned. I could go on. Needless to say but I will never stay at a Crap Plaza again.Good points: Very affordable the rooms are pretty nice. Bathrooms are nicely decorated and the shower head works well. The beds are really comfortable and they have 7 pillows on the bed. I sleep very well here... They also have quiet floors for those that are not in the mood for kids...Bad points: Exercise room and pool are at polar opposites in the facility. Pretty far from Beale and other parts of the city, however, close enough to the cable car... Just not a lot happening close to the hotel so if your looking for a quiet place, this is a great hotel. Overall, it has worked for me twice very well...Perfectly average hotel. The rooms were nice, location was nice, beds were great, but the walls are paper thin. We could hear everything - and I do mean everything! - in the adjacent rooms and in the hallway. It's also kind of a bummer that the pool is outdoors, which means you can't use it unless you visit during the summertime months.GREAT ROOM!   CLEAN AND GOOD SERVICE.We were traveling cross country and stopped there.   We spent some time at the hotel bar and ate dinner and then breakfast.  What a treat.  The bartender (think name was Kevin) was really excellent.  I mean he knew his profession!  Treated us like royalty and the food was outstanding.  This is an understated place that may be looked over but we had a great experience!Nice stay overall. The hot water was an odd color. The biscuits &amp; gravy in the restaurant are an embarrassment to the South,Pretty good deal for the price (booked on Hotwire, got a great deal) Rooms are large and updated, fitness center is just right if you're on vacation, because you won't spend hours working out by accident, or you'd run out of things to do.  Its a bit distant from Beale/entertainment, but you can hop the streetcar and be there pretty quick.  The staff was generally good, ask for Lee if you're at the bar and wanna chat, he's tops.Usually when I go somewhere, all I ask for is a clean bed and a shower since I wasn't in the room often. The staff was great even when I called in advance to ask when I can check in. I also booked a tour from them days ahead of time and they were very nice when I had to change it. An added plus was when someone called me a few minutes after to ask if I needed anything. True southern hospitality was when everytime I left the room, someone acknowledged me, unlike most places.There isn't much around it and I didn't have a car but it's only a 5 minute trolley ride to the action, a 15 minute walk, and they even have an SUV that will take you within 5 miles. I also saw a city bus behind the hotel so you weren't trapped. The bed was comfortable, the shower was great, and internet was free.I didn't use any of the amenities so I can't speak on them but I would stay there again just because of the way I was treated. Although it's not in the heart of things, I didn't feel unsafe when I was out and had no bad experience so this place is 5 stars in my book.This hotel is pretty much what you'd expect from any mid-level hotel chain.  Although, I have to say, the staff was especially nice here-- from allowing us to change rooms our first morning there to helping us get into our car after we had locked our keys inside (saving us the hassle and expense of calling a locksmith).  I'd stay here again, my only hesitation is that it's not very close to Beale street, so we ended up taking cabs a lot.Rooms are pretty normal in size for this type of hotel. Close enough that you can walk to the Memphis night life but it isn't right on your door step. The room I stayed in had a LCD TV and was reasonably clean. There are vents that connect the bathrooms so you can see if your neighbor has his bathroom light on, which is a little creepy. Also make it easier to hear your neighbors which is a little annoying. Which is probably why they give you ear plugs, a relaxation CD, and a sleep mask. Staff is friendly and Wifi is free.My car was vandalized in the hotel parking lot overnight after someone tried to break in by tearing out the passenger side key lock. One of the hotel managers gave me an insurance claim number the next day, and in hindsight I realized it was to get me out and on my way since I was booked for only one night. After a couple of hours on the road, the insurance company called to deny the claim saying that it is a self-serve parking lot and that the hotel is not responsible for any damages to my car. Considering I was charged a parking fee and the parking gates had been left up overnight, I still didn't understand how the hotel could have no responsibility securing the reasonable safety of my personal belongings. A follow up discussion with another member of hotel management said that they don't have coverage for this kind of claim. And phone messages to property management went unanswered. Fortunately, nothing was stolen but the passenger door was left unable to open from the outside. And although my insurance covered the damage to the car, I was unhappy with the way the hotel customer relations person packaged the situation and ""handled me,"" and I didn't like how upper management pretty much dropped me and the issue.Although the room was clean and pleasing, no one assisted me when I arrived at night and I brought my own bags to the room. I will not book with Crowne Plaza hotels again.If I were able to give it 0 stars, I would.  I stayed at this hotel on Saturday the 19th of June and I can say I will never ever choose this hotel when I come back to the Memphis area.  While I understand that things do break down, but the lifeline of the hotel/hospitality industry is service.  The moment I entered the room, there was a strong stench, it smelled like mold and a recently opened dirty laundry bag that had been left under the sun with sopping wet clothes inside.  Excusing it as just maybe sloppy cleaning, the fam and i put our luggages down and proceeded to unwind for the day.   I hopped onto the bed and reached for the remote which did not work.  I figured, maybe it was because there were so many items placed in front of the television.  I moved everything that blocked the bottom front of the tv and tried clicking again -- nope! nothing.  So fine, I figure, let me pretend I'm living in the 40s (the pre-tv remote days) and I'll use the channel button on the tv itself, choose a channel and be done with it.  One night of non-channel surfing isn't going to kill me.  As i settle comfortably onto the bed, I hear this water sound coming from the AC, then I hear my mom say that the carpet around the AC is completely wet.  So i got up and walked over....thinking...hm...ok, a little water, not so bad...when I went over, I could hear the wet carpet sound underneath my flip flops.  I carefully surveyed the area and it was bad.  We had to move all our bags onto the chair.  I believe this was my last straw, I picked up the phone and dialed for the front desk...the attendee who picked up sounded friendly enough as i proceeded to tell him about the dripping AC.  This was all he could tell me (1) our technicians just left for the day so you'll have to wait until tomorrow morning (2) we'll bring towels to soak up the water (for which they brought 2 towels).  They clearly needed to see how wet everything was to know that 2 towels was not enough.  We ended up grabbing some of the towels in the room to use.  Next, I figured well since I called about the AC, let me just also let him know about the broken remote...and his response was ""oh, then you just have to change the channels on the tv"" (Durh!) I mean I know he couldn't offer anything more and that was clearly the only solution but the feeling i got after I hung up with him was ""oh you are s**t outta luck, there's nothing we can do""  Tthe handling of the whole situation was just unacceptable and unsatisfactory.  Maybe i just had a strung of bad luck and it seems like all that could go wrong did, but had the situation been handled with more care, I would have left a happy guest.This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff was so nice at all times. We were treated so kind. Every time they saw us they greeted us so kindly. They gave us a quiet floor, the 8th floor. We slept like babies. I never heard another person in the hotel while we were in our room. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was SUPER comfortable. I must say that I usually don't sleep well in hotels and that the rooms are usually stuffy or damp, but not here, not our room. it was just perfect. and we were extremely please.  We never drove our vehicle again once we parked because they had a free shuttle that took you where you wanted to go downtown until midnight. And if you arent afraid to walk you can walk when the weather is nice. It's only about a 15 minute stroll to Beale. Nice way to check it all out.  The Breakfast there was just awesome too. Eggs, bacon, sausage, toaste, biscuits, gravy, fruit, pasties, juice, milk,  It was very good. But not cheap.    And you do have to pay 10 bucks night for parking. those are the down sides.  Over all. I loved our stay there. It wasn't cheap. It's in the Summer so maybe prices are high right now. But I got treated like a princes for the weekend and I loved it.","We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was very friendly and professional. The room was clean and comfortable.Nice rooms - great toiletries!  Pool was nice, but needed some tiles replaced etc.  Lobby etc could use some updating.  Shuttle service was nice - could call them from elsewhere in downtown and they would come pick you up... Friendly, helpful staff.At times its not about the amenities or physical appearance, but the service of a hotel that makes it quality and this is the case for the Crowne Plaza. The Crowne is an older hotel, which appears to have been renovated in the past few years. The room was nice and comfortable, there is a small on site gym and pool. However, the pool wasn't in service for a few days, but guests were kept informed of the issue and the pool did reopen as scheduled. As previously mentioned this hotel rates high in my opinion due to the wonderful service provided by all the staff! We especially thank Terry and Reginald who were the hotel drivers during our visit and they were so courteous, prompt, and accommodating at all times.","['parking', 'much', 'parked', 'street',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-memphis-at-graceland-memphis,Days Inn Memphis at Graceland,3.5,$$,37,"I've been watching too much Hotel Impossible.... and could very much pick this hotel completely apart.    HOWEVER... for the price and location, yes, I am a fan.There are some issues that need to be addressed.    There are some rough spots that could be made smoother...   paint job in the bathroom, new tub would be nice, cover up screw/nail holes....   The towels are super rough...   And - warning to the wise - the floor and walls all need a steam cleaning.     Fiance took one look at my bare feet after walking on the floor and suggested washing them and putting some shoes or socks on.     Bring slippers... or be prepared to get dirty feet.   We think its because of the dogs... and they don't have time to steam clean between guests.Ok, that out of the way...  we had a very luxurious bed... it really felt comfortable and newish, clean.   Lovely nights sleep.  Its on a wooden platform, perhaps that helped. The wi-fi signal was strong.Staff is very friendly.Parking is free and seemed safe.Lobby was interesting.   Coffee decent.For the price, it really was a good deal.   I had done some research and this really was a good selection for being close to the airport and to Graceland .At first glance this is a bargain but we got the room that made me know why it was at a low rate. I've rarely felt so discounted. One bed had a dip in the middle so deep it was obvious and the foot of the bed was higher than the head. The biggest offense is to give us a non smoking room right next to a smoking room. It subtly dawned on me that our neighbors were either smoking all night or that room must be brown with smoke residue. I'll spend more next time on a room thanks to this lesson.Love this hotel! Elvis music playing in the lobby and outside, pictures up on the walls.  Really great location - 5 minute walk to Graceland.  The room had beds with sleep number mattresses, however, the remotes were not functioning, so the firmness could not be adjusted.  It would have been awesome they worked.  Good breakfast - eggs, cereals, pancakes, toast, tea, coffee...  One star off for crappy internet, holes in the walls that were plugged in with toilet paper, and ""in case of fire"" sign listing the wrong location of the room.  It's not too way off, but the difference could be important in real emergency.Priced right, located directly across from Graceland, and with a guitar-shaped pool, this Days Inn exceeded our expectations.Rooms are small and a bit outdated, and the Wi-Fi sketchy at best, but this staff were very friendly and clientele very international: in the breakfast room we heard accents from Britain, Germany, Ukraine and Japan, and several that were unplaceable.Hip Elvis tip: from 7:30-8:30, before the tours start, the gates of Graceland are opened up for fans to walk up and see the Memorial Garden atno charge. Staying right across Elvis Presley Blvd, I got in right at 7:30 and had a private audience with the King for a few quiet moments. You can't do that if you're staying downtown.Very clean rooms, friendly staff extremely comfortable beds. Fridge, microwave and coffee pot in room!Lots of channels and 3 Elvis movie channels. 1 block from Graceland !!!Elvis week and $113 with tax !!!Pool is awesome it's guitar shaped !!!Free breakfast Breakfast could have more choices but still ok for freeI am not a hotel snob. Really. But I wanted to finally do the Elvis thing and the Yelp reviews seemed okay for this place.  3-1/2 stars come with a certain level of expectation. I think this was 2 star at best.  I don't know what was worse, the cigarette smell or the spray used to try and cover it up. In any case the room  smelled awful. The  blanket had cigarette burns, the room had no closet or anywhere to hang clothes and the pillows were maybe an inch thick. The TV could not change channels. They provided one bath towel for two people. The front desk gave me another    The staff was friendly enough but could mot make up for the  room and sleepless night.  It is not really that close to Graceland. In hind-sight, i should have stayed downtown near Beale Street and driven the extra 15 minutes to Graceland. PS. Wife said bathroom was filthy.Great location to visit Graceland. The area around Graceland is not great for sure, but if your there to visit Graceland this hotel is perfect for one night. We paid $60 each for our two rooms.  The hotel is completely decorated with Elvis memorabilia . Our hotel rooms were very outdated but the staff truly had done everything they could to make it as appealing as possible. Bring your own pillow if possible.  The front desk could not have been any nicer throughout our stay. The pool is shaped in a guitar and in decent shape. Elvis music played throughout property. There is free wifi, free parking , and a free continental breakfast. The coffee was great! Not a lot of room in breakfast area so plan accordingly. We left our car in the parking lot of hotel to visit Graceland and avoided the Ten dollar parking charge per car. The walk is frankly just as close or closer than Graceland's own parking lot. I would definitely recommend staying here for a short stay.Comfortable, clean and very very close to a Graceland. Great price too. Features TV, fridge,  microwave,  ironing and coffee/tea making facilities.  Wifi was pretty weak. Breakfast included.Heaps of Elvis themed stuff around the motel and a guitar shaped pool. The surrounding area is fine. Not shady at all. Great place. Would recommend.Great rooms. Cool pool.  Cute breakfast.  Lovely staff.  Perfect for us and our dog.  Walking distance to Graceland (it's on the next block).  Saves you the $10 to park.This place is awesome. They took us in at 1 am and made sure we had everything we needed. It's clean, and we felt very safe.Talk about Elvis overload! But it's right next to Graceland so I suppose anyone should expect that.Memphis was just a stop on a road trip. But we did get to see Graceland and LOTS of Elvis. We got a great recommendation for dinner from the night clerk here. The room was ok. The pool was worth taking a picture of. Breakfast was free and filling.I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to see Graceland!Wow! This place is an experience! You are seriously within walking distance to Graceland. Room is a bit dated but very clean. The hotel staff is super helpful and very friendly. The lobby is spotless and loaded with Elvis memorabilia. If you have the chance you should stay here for the night.Stayed 3 nights. I have zero complaints. I actually loved it.  I've read the reviews and people say its a shady area but honestly, i think the area was great. Close to Graceland and whole buncha businesses. Went to Walmart thats about 5 mins away and bought snacks and stuff. You literally have everything close by. The room was clean and the staff came in daily and changed sheets and towels and vacuumed. We sat by the pool, played some dominoes and drank some beer. Didn't feel uncomfortable at all.I didn't try the continental breakfast at all so can't say much about that. If i'm ever in Memphis again, I will definitely stay here again.$115, walking distance to Graceland, clean rooms, working A/C, a guitar shaped pool, pictures of Elvis in the room, quiet at night, Elvis radio blaring over the pool, and two Elvis movie channels, free wifi, free parking, free continental breakfast. Is it a luxury hotel? No. Is the pool grimy and overly chlorinated? Yep. Is breakfast carb filled? Yeah. Is it just what we needed after a long day at Graceland? Uh-huh. If you go to the pool, ask for pool towels at the front desk. They won't give you more room towels if you use those for the pool. The room towels are nicer than the pool towels, so you will want shower towels for the shower and pool towels for the pool.I agree with Susan K.  My friend and I stayed here a night in late November of 2013, and the room, though larger than some, was somewhat outdated and the cleanliness was questionable.  The beds and pillows were HORRIBLE.Not to mention, we were rudely awoken by Elvis music BLARING from the office around 8:30 in the morning.  I get that it's next to Graceland but as weary travelers, we were less than thrilled to be woken up.The neighborhood is not as good as some, the building itself seemed a little run down, and the bathroom was borderline dirty...Not pleased overall and wouldn't recommend staying here.Let's be honest with ourselves.  It's hard not to trust a Days Inn that sports Elvis memorabilia from top to bottom.The staff was friendly and helpful, and the rooms were clean (albiet a little stuffy), and boasted a fridge and a microwave.  My biggest concern was the wooden block we had for a bed.  Okay, so it was a legitimate bed, but really, may as well have been a giant, king-sized block of wood because when I jumped on it (expecting to bounce), I just about broke my face.  It's a good thing I went out until 3 a.m. and was tired enough to fall asleep on a bed of nails.  Also, having Elvis watch over you can't hurt. Uh huh.It's walking distance to Graceland, and very nearby Uncle Lou's, which is a must try.  If you're in Memphis to see the fun and exciting Memphis tourist attractions, this is a no-brainer.  Especially since it's half the cost of the Heartbreak Hotel, and equally as cheesy and fun.  It's also right by the highway, so traveling to downtown Memphis was easy-breezy.Overall, I had a very enjoyable stay.  Did I mention they have a guitar shaped pool?  Pretty Elvis-tastic!After our Motel 6 incident we decided to head on over here! This hotel is really close to Graceland, no reservations are needed, and is pet friendly!!! Oh and also has a ton of Elvis crap everywhere, yea!!!! They even have a freakin awesome guitar shaped pool, too bad it was humid and 85 degrees and then suddenly tornado weather when I dropped by, lol. The rooms are nice and clean with comfy beds and pillows. They also have a good sized tv, fridge, and microwave. All the decor is kinda retro and funky, and there are Elvis portraits on the wall of course. The area is not very loud since it is a few miles away from any highways, so you will sleep pretty well here. There's a channel that shows Elvis movies 24/7 but it didn't work, so fail right there Graceland Days Inn. I was excited about that after reading about it in the other Yelp reviews. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was actually pretty good. There are lots of options: waffles, toast, fruit, cereal, etc. I wish there was soy milk though, so I can eat the cereal somewhere where there's a complimentary breakfast one of these days! I know, I'm getting greedy and picky over a free breakfast. Also, the breakfast cafe is all decked out in Elvis stuff too, so enjoy while you eat. Also, when we were checking the power went out in the entire Days Inn!!! It was pitch black in all of the room and lobby, I guess this is a problem in Memphis, lol. This part of Memphis is definitely not the nicest part of town, but it is where Graceland is, and wayyyyy better then West Memphis. So if you want a nicer area stay closer to downtown Memphis and drive over to Graceland, and pay the $10 to park there. Oh yea, and how can I forget the best part of all, Graceland is walking distance, so you can wake up and walk on over to start your Graceland tour. :) There is Heartbreak Hotel right next to Graceland which is definitely closer, but way more expensive and probably only a little nicer than this place, which is good enough and only $75 a night.Very convenient if traveling to Graceland. Pretty clean.. just smelled a little perfumey in the rooms.The pool is awesome- but it was winter when we were there.. so didn't get to enjoy it.Rooms are decorated with Elvis memorabilia.Complementary breakfast was pretty weak- stale pastry items and dried out cereal.But hey..  it close to Graceland and not very expensive. Can't beat that.p.s. walk to Graceland from hotel- we drove and had to pay $ 10 parking! It's totally walkable- save your $.During our 3,000+ mile trip from Chicago to Vegas, we made a stop to Memphis so that we could visit the King's place of residence. We needed a place to stay, had no reservations, we had pets and we wanted to be in a safe place in close proximity to Graceland. Days Inn was able to accommodate us with all the above! Like Rachel H. said, ""Its a Days Inn... don't forget that..."" It isn't the Ritz Carlton by no means but it provides the essential and never lets you forget that you are across the ways from the home of the King... He is plastered all over the place. Starting with the lobby, his photos, statues and the huge photo of Graceland behind the front desk. Once we were all good to go with our rooms, we passed by the guitar shaped pool. Granted, we were there in late October so we weren't able to utilize it, but I think it's very much unique and a nice touch for the whole Elvis theme. And once we reached our rooms, there he was again on the walls and 24/7 channel of all Elvis movies all the time! We're big time Elvis fans so we sure a heck did not mind the gorgeous man all over the place :) Again, it is a Days Inn, the rooms are average but this was the nicest Days Inn that we stayed at the entire trip, we stayed at 3 and let me tell you... The faucets worked, the toilet and shower were CLEAN, though outdated-- the TVs worked perfectly, the rooms were CLEAN and there were no remnants of anyone smoking in there, yea they're nonsmoking rooms but I am scarred for life w/ other Days Inn locations with their so-called ""nonsmoking"" rooms. It's walking distance from the Graceland tours area, but if you're traveling or touring w/ the elderly I'd suggest a wheelchair or dropping them off and parking your vehicle back at Day Inn, you have to PAY for parking at the Graceland tours area as to where at DI, it's free. They offer a free continental breakfast. But don't be fooled, they say ""hot breakfast"" the only hot part of the breakfast was the waffles. The rest of what they offer are toast, fruit, juice and cereal. Don't get me wrong, it's free but if you're expecting eggs and sausage, you'll be disappointed. What they offered was enough to suffice our appetite, so I loved it :) If we ever find ourselves in Memphis again, we'll definitely be staying here, LOVE our experience.The room itself was old/outdated and the bed was hard as a rock! Also had a group of college kids above us that kept us up all night. The area is questionable. The only upsides would be proximity to Graceland and the free breakfast.","This place is great for a night or two. Your going to Memphis, your there for Graceland, this place is perfect. You can walk right over to Graceland, ignore the Graceland parking price, and the place has a cool/corny vibe. It's a fun motel. Great continental breakfast, waffles always seal the deal. 3 channels on the tv show strictly Elvis movies to keep you in the mood. Guitar shaped pool? Awesome.Great place we had a great time here and would totally go back someday.Days Inn was a great hotel if you are looking to see Gracelands. But be aware it is a $20 cab ride to Beale St and there is nothing else apart from Gracelands nearby. Rooms were comfy and kitsch with Elvis memorabilia everywhere. I didn't swim in the pool but it was a nice touch. Staff there are friendly and helpful.You've gotta love a Days Inn that has a guitar shaped pool, pictures of Elvis above the beds, and is right next door to Graceland. I stayed here a few weeks back on a trip to Memphis where my friend could see the resting place of his favorite rocker. The hotel staff that I encountered was very friendly and accommodating. The Days Inn boats a lobby full of Elvis memorabilia and also serve breakfast for free. My biggest complaint was the rock hard mattress. It was really awful. But, since was were only there for one night it was not too bad. If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel next door to Graceland, this is your best bet.5 stars for Ramanda's amazing customer service. Super friendly and helpful. The lobby is cool, lots of picture opportunities. Room was clean. No complaints at all. I would have never written a review though if it weren't for Ramanda at the front desk. This girl needs a raise!!!!Maybe better than actual Graceland.Stopped here when driving from San Antonio, TX to Hartford, CT. Perfect location, walking distance to Graceland and the only place within walking distance that accepted pet guests. Rooms were kind of rundown, with Elvis prints as decor. Beds were decent. Decent place to stay if you're in and out, passing through.My husband and I considered staying here for a night due to the proximity to Graceland. When we walked in to inquire about rooms, the desk clerk was rude and could care less if she got our business or not. We obviously decided to go somewhere else. I would not recommend this place due to terrible customer service.This place is so dirty! The bathroom had hair clumped in greasy strips in every crevis in the bathroom, especially under the bathroom door, so every time we closed the bathroom door it left a grease ball with a thousand hairs in the bathroom. Disgusting! The pool had hair balls floating in it everywhere, and the water was clearly clouded. Although it came out so cute in our picture of the kids swimming, I can't believe I let my kids in that pool, it has haunted me ever since. I am no where near a neat freak either. The blanket you use on the bed (not the comforter) is so old it feels like sand paper and it had multiple cigarette burns on it, so I chose to go without most of the night every night. The second worst thing was the smell of the rooms, some really strong perfumy smell that they apparently need to cover up something?? It gave me a headache for the first 10 min every time we came back into the room.The staff is not trying to be friendly or helpful in anyway. The housekeeper seemed nice when she came by at 9am and we asked her to come back in a bit because we were still preparing to leave, but she never came back, so our room was never serviced on our stay.I can say the mattress &amp; pillows were good, but the bad points far over shadowed the upside.I stayed in 10 inn type places rated the same as this one on my road trip and this was by far the worst. Although this was my favorite place (Memphis) to visit on this trip, I had to really try to not let my two nights here bring down my spirits. Don't stay here, its worth the drive to stay somewhere where there are more options, like near Beale Street. I heard the Heartbreak Hotel is also heartbreaking! Options are few around Graceland, but a short drive would be worth it for you!Lemme jus tell you this...Tracy helped us get all checked in, and gave us all the essential info on where to eat good BBQ, cracked a few jokes with us, and gave me extra coffee packets to brew in my room. The perfect personality to greet some weary travelers. She is all smiles and absolutely made our trip all the way from California so worth it!!! She's my new sister-friend!!! Thanks again Tracy!!!Other than that, don't expect the extravagance of the Hilton, but it provides the necessities (coffee, room safe, cable, free wi-fi) and free breakfeast. It's also walking distance to Graceland, and it is clad in everything Elvis!!! It's the perfect homage to the King of Rock n' Roll. I'd definitely stay here again. And the price is very reasonable. I'm not a pet person, but my friends are, and had we brought them, they'd be welcome as well.If you're not into frills, want something clean and affordable, this is your place to stay when visiting Graceland or the Memphis area.  The fact that it is within walking distance to Graceland is an added bonus.  Included with your stay is a continental breakfast, to the tunes of Elvis playing in the background.  Staff is pleasant and friendly.  Highly recommended.A pretty good hotel to stay in if you want to be right by Graceland (super close). If I had it to do over, I would have stayed in downtown Memphis (since I went to the National Civil Rights Museum (a must see!), Beale Street, etc. and saved myself the many taxis I took into the city. The hotel rooms were clean and updated, but the TV needed help and the towels were AWFUL (my husband likened them to drying off with jeans). They were threadbare and desperately need replacing. The breakfast in the morning was very good: yummy waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. I think this is a good value for its location for sure. As a side note, Graceland was wonderful!This place is pretty ideal. It's so close to Graceland, we were able to just walk down there in a few minutes. It has a guitar shaped pool, which was kind of nice, though it seemed a bit dirty once I got in. And it was only 5 feet deep at most I think. As others have said, there's one channel in the room that has non-stop Elvis movies. There's a bunch of kitschy stuff all over, and this is one of the cases were it's oddly appropriate. 5 stars this hotel is not, but for the convenience and price, it's a pretty damn good deal. It seemed like there were a bunch of signs saying they are not responsible for property stolen out of cars, but whatever. It seemed pretty safe, and I had most of my belongings in my car since I was moving. Wasn't a problem. Like someone else said it's kind of a dirty, run down part of town. I wonder what it was like when Elvis was still living there.wow for the money 65 bucks a night this place was awesome!! Great friendly people very clean rooms and the lobby was very cool from all the elvis stuff to the good breakfast. If your going anywhere near graceland put this one on your list .Cool hotel to stay at before you visit Graceland. Has Elvis movies and documentaries 24 hours a day and Elvis pictures up in the room. We were able to walk just a block to get to Graceland. Not super fancy, but a great place to get you in the ""Elvis mood"" We were very pleased with our stay and would recommend it.This place is tacky in the best kind of way.  It's elvis everywhere and they even have a guitar shaped pool.  If you have a sense of humor and don't want to spend a lot of money on lodging, this place is perfect.  The room was clean and we even had a little refrigerator and microwave.  This place was exactly what we needed for a three night stay and all for only 69$ a night! Not to mention you get free wireless service and free elvis movies 24/7.  People say this area is not safe, but I think people just don't understand that it's just what Memphis looks like.  Everything is run down in Memphis and nothing looks safe, but don't be fooled by the appearance, it's a perfectly safe area as long as you don't mind the occasional bum that tries to accost you for cash.  But hey, I get hassled by bums at least five times on my way to work every morning in Chicago.  If you like your suburban neighborhoods with new buildings and same looking people wearing their gap clothes, book yourself a room at the peabody in downtown Memphis and call it a day.  if you are shopping around for good hotels that won't put you over a 100$ and has good clean rooms, Days Inn at Graceland is the perfect choice.",,,,"['watching', 'much', 'hotel', 'impossible', 'much', 'pick',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-memphis-beale-street-memphis,The Westin Memphis Beale Street,3.5,$$$,93,"Stayed here for one night as a stopover while on a road trip with my husband and 2 dogs. We were able to make a last minute reservation here on a Friday night and we were fairly satisfied. The hotel offers valet parking ($25/day), which looked fairly busy on a Friday night, so we opted on self parking in the adjacent garage which was about $18/day. Check in was quick and smooth. The hotel itself is fairly modern and in a great location. It is located directly across from the Memphis Grizzlies basketball arena and one block away from Beale Street. It's super convenient to many bars and restaurants which gives you a myriad of dining options to chose from all within a short walking distance from the hotel.The staff here were all very friendly and welcoming of our 2 dogs. We opted for a traditional king room which was clean and had a very comfortable bed. Elevators were on the slow side as there are only 2 for the entire hotel. Being an SPG member we also were able to access the internet free of charge.Overall, this is a fairly affordable hotel in an excellent location and they get an extra star of approval from me since they're dog friendly and don't charge an additional pet fee.My husband and I had a great overall experience at this hotel.We stayed here for two nights while he was on business and I tagged along for fun. The rooms were clean, the beds were ""heavenly"" and you couldn't hear through the walls or hallways, so our stay was extremely quiet and peaceful. The valet service was quick and the ladies at the front desk were really helpful with directions and suggestions for the ""must see"" attractions in Memphis. This hotel is in a great location, nestled just a block away from Beale street, across fromThe Gibson guitar factory, and walking distance to the civil rights museum, and a bunch of bars and restaurants.My only complaints about this hotel are that the showers are tiny (and I'm a small girl) and I had a hard time even trying to shave my legs in the shower and that the elevators broke one evening so we had to take the freight elevator which we waited over 15 minutes for.I've stayed at this particular Westin four times now and a review is truly past due!My first (and possibly most important!) tip: if one is available, go for the rooms with the treadmill and workout equipment! I was spoiled my first time here. These rooms were going for well under 200 dollars and if, like me, you're one of those people who get cranky when a small hotel gym has even one other person in it, you cannot beat this type of amenity. Add to this, the room is so huge, you can run around it a couple times and it's like you're running around a track, only with floor to ceiling windows and your own personal shower that can fit at least 10 other people in it (I did not at any point invite 10 other people over to shower with me). Oh, the stories this shower could tell, no doubt. This *is* the hotel that houses visiting NBA teams, so I'll leave it at that.That said, I've yet to be able to stay in such a room after my first stay. The typical guest room is spacious and comfortable, up to the Westin standard. I am disappointed that you have to request shower gel, though. It's just annoying as other Westins provide it in your room and I kind of hate requesting things (even though there's a long list of things they can provide you with). That said, I really needed a damn bandaid and they didn't have that most basic necessity when I asked. Speaking of hotel gyms, the one here is fine. All the cardio equipment (3 treadmills, 3 or 4 ellipticals and a stationery bike or two) faces windows, which is cool. I've worked out in far too many hotel basements! The worst. They have two benches, exercise balls, free weights and a cable weight system that does the trick for the traveling workout fiend. The front desk staff at this Westin are really helpful and nice! I once needed stuff faxed and they did this for me no problem (who faxes anything anymore, right?) The standard of customer service is quite high. I'll write a separate review for the restaurant, but yesterday the waitress went above and beyond for me and went to the adjoining Starbucks to get soymilk so they could make my oatmeal vegan. There you have it! Until that magical hotel opens in Midtown, the Westin is my hotel of choice when in Memphis.Staying here at the Westin for a few days and I must say after my arrival today I took a AMAZING 6 hr nap, their beds are just so comfortable not to mention their pillows, ahhh and they brought me extras because I'm pregnant. Favorite part is clearly the bed lol oh and the nice view of the arena :)I had a one night stay here just before Christmas Eve. Even at 12:30 AM, the staff  downstairs at the check-in desk were downright hospitable. A warm welcome that late is always nice to have.Joi B. is right on the money. If you can get it, get the workout mini-suite. They run cheap, and are downright cavernous. The room was clean and large, and the location is good. I'm happy to see Memphis still has a somewhat modern and upscale hotel property that isn't staid, crusty, and stuck in the 1980s like The Peabody.Great hotel in downtown Memphis directly across from the Fed Ex forum and Beale St. The newest hotel in downtown it's more modern than the others. They have a case of Gibson guitars you can borrow to play in your room if you'd like. They send up a set of headphones so you don't bother the neighbors.We just stayed at this hotel this past week. We have been Starwood Members for many years and frequently use our points for free nights. We booked our stay with our points and when we checked out, we were told that we had to pay for the 2 night stay. We called Starwood Customer Service and they verified we had used our points, but the front desk personnel, Linnete refused to refund our credit card. Starwood customer service lodged a complaint for us, but as yet we have still never heard from the general manager.  If you must stay at this hotel, be sure to verify the charges if you are using points. I give it a one star because the facility and room was very nice.  On a side note, my brother accidentally left his jacket in the closet of his room. When we called the hotel, two hours later, the jacket was gone. Very disappointing that the staff is not honest.  Beware this hotel!The only reason I am not giving this hotel all 5 stars, is because they did not handle a noise complaint well.  After I called down for the 3rd time at 4:15 AM to quiet my neighbors, I still heard them at 7:00 am sharp.  I wasn't the only one to complain about the neighbor's loud behavior, per the front desk...The hotel itself is very nice and clean.  Valet service was great, the hotel bar was great (bartender was awesome but it does close early around 11:00...) and the hotel restaurant was great for breakfast.  Just one block off of Beale Street and in a great location if you plan to party on Beale Street.  The rooms were very clean and all of the staff was very friendly.Stayed here for five nights while catching games 3 and 4 of the Warriors-Grizzlies series.Pros: great location. Right across the FedEx Forum, next to Beale Street (this could be a con for those sensitive to noise, but I wasn't too bothered by it). Lots of options for restaurants and bars. Rooms are spacious, convenient parking, and a very nice gym with new equipment plus water and towels available.Cons: Housekeeping needs to be retrained on how to thoroughly clean rooms. Floors were not swept, dust had started to gather on table tops and water marks on the faucet and taps, used wine glasses were not replaced. They basically only made the beds and emptied the waste bins. The worst thing was we weren't provided with toiletries and I had to ask for more shampoo, conditioner, etc. I'm not normally very picky about these things and even opted to skip housekeeping on a couple of occasions, but for the cost of staying at this hotel, this level of service is unacceptable. Daily parking and internet charges are also pricey, but that is common to all SPG properties.If the housekeeping staff is retrained to properly clean rooms, this could easily be a 4-star review. But as it is, this Westin is not up to par with other SPG/Westin properties.Very unprofessional staff. I wanted to look at this place for my wedding. The wedding coordinator said she's not available this weekend but the banquet manager would be available and to ask for him when I come in. So I Ask for him today and the front desk girl asks if I have an appointment. I say no Lorraine said to come ask for him when I come in. She calls him and can't get a hold of him. She asks for me to sit and wait and she will contact him again. I wait about 15-20 min. I go to the front desk and ask for him again. She says I can't get a hold of him and that he's somewhere in the hotel. I ask her to call him and she says ""usually he sees people by appointment only."" I informed her that Lorraine could have told me that and for  to call his cell phone. She tells me she doesn't have it. So I say you mean to tell me no one in this hotel can contact him and no one has his cell? She says give me just a second. She goes to the back and comes back 5 minutes later and informs me that he's upstairs and I can go upstairs. Um, excuse me I'm a potential customer who's about to spend 20k+ and you tell me to go find him and treating me like I'm a child?! I go upstairs and no one's there. I go to the office and could not  find anyone so I asked if anyone was there out loud. I took it upon myself to look at the rooms. By the end of the last room a guy comes out and asks if I'm the person looking for him. I told him don't worry about it. If this is how you're going to treat me on my wedding day no thanks and that Lorraine could have told me about appointment only ""policy"". He kept asking me not to leave but I need an organized and professional hotel for my day. So disappointed. Thank god I didn't like the rooms anyway as they were too brown and stuffy, but if I did like the rooms I would have asked to speak to the manger of the hotel and let him know.Loved this place! Excellent location directly across the street from the FedExForum and Gibson Guitar Factory. Super close to Beale Street also. This place has a modern feel with contemporary decor, but the best part of our stay was they had these expensive Gibson guitars in a glass case in the lobby that you could take up to your room and keep for as long as you wanted during your stay. My 14 year old son was in Heaven! Such a great idea!! Would definitely stay here again!I'm really disappointed at my stay here at the Westin.  The only thing that it has that would make me consider returning is its location and ample size bathroom.I'm disappointed that as a preferred guest that the internet costs money.  In most other hotel that's a standard feature with the room.  The room itself had a weird oder as if something is rotten.  Finally I think I got bitten from bed bugs or a rash from something because I have unusually large scratchy swollen circles on my arms, legs and chest.  I'm not sure the cause but I don't remember being bit by mosquitos or anything else abnormal during my stay in Memphis.I stayed here for 2 nights during the summer. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It's connected to the main parking garage in downtown Memphis. It's 1 block off of Beale St. It's right near all of the excitement in Memphis.I stayed in a room with 2 queen beds. Room size was decent. Bathroom was nice (and pretty big too). Room was relatively quiet. Air conditioning worked well. The room was cleaned well.The hotel lobby and hallways were nice and clean. Elevators worked well. Staff was very good.I'd definitely stay here again. The only thing that would have probably made it better is if they had a pool and hot tub. Oh, and if they had some room in the electronically monitored small fridge in the room for you to store your own drinks.They called this the Westin Memphis Beale Street, but it really ain't on Beale; but it's only a block away.  Great location due to its close proximity to Beale and just across the street from the Fed Ex sports arena and Gibson factory.  The hotel is modern, clean and very classy.  My room was perfect and the service was top notched.  Like any other major city hotel, you got to pay for parking.  I opted for valet, but probably should have gone the self park route since the garage is next door.  The nicest feature of the hotel is the close walk to Beale and the nice rooms.  If I head back to Memphis, I would chose this place just for its location alone.Westin makes me feel like royalty and I just love it! Every time I pull up to the hotel, super friendly and funny valet teams assist me right away (awesome that they have free valet!) someone greets me and opens the door for me and everyone in sight will say hello and welcome. When I'm waiting in the lobby, staff offer me water and coffee while I wait. It is extremely clean and elegant in the lobby and the Bleu restaurant always smells good and looks full of life. While I've never stayed in a room here, I have visited one and can tell you their heavenly bed's are just that, heavenly! The location couldn't be better right off of Beale Street, plus they have tons of event spaces for locals. I recommend this hotel, 5 stars!I've stayed in Westins before, and never regretted it. First, this is one of the more expensive Westins I've stayed in personally. 185.00 plus tax, plus 18.00 parking, plus nice guys you can't say no to for helping you with your bags. Think Holiday inn express NOT luxury hotel. I didn't have a single issue with customer service like others, staff was good. But I definitely feel like I got a bit cheated for what I payed. Final bill must have been in the 250.00 range. Plenty of beat up furniture to go around and the place needs a deep cleaning. Spots, etc. Everywhere you look. Just stay at 2.5* hotel and save the money. Seriously.Enjoyable. Will stay here again.This is a very clean property and up to date.  Staff at the front desk could not have been friendlier and very helpful.My son was moving out of his dorm and he joined us for one night. He thought the guitar check out feature was great, as he was able to play a rather expensive Gibson jazz guitar.It was fun staying off Beale Street. We are not big into the party scene over there but walking over is much preferable to driving in and trying to find some safe place to leave one's car.I had to work in the room over two days.  Not crazy about the CFL glare in the room. Not really the local property's fault, but the desk needs one task light.I was under the impression that the Westin chain was a 5 star resort. After my stay, I would consider this a 3 star resort honestly. Maybe 3.5 and that's only because of the location and skyline views from our 7th floor room. The traditional room was very small. We tried to upgrade at check in but were told no rooms were available even though they showed executive suites available online. There were scuff markings on the wall and carpet was dingy with spots. The room and bathroom had a musty non welcoming stale smell. The shower could have been a little cleaner. Also, there were not enough small face towels for two guests. There were only two so that meant one per adult. The bars , one located in the lobby and the other in the restaurant were nice and stocked any and all beverages you could possibly think of...they had my Tuaca so i was happy happy joy joy! other then that i would look for a better hotel downtown Memphis next time.For my first trip to Memphis, I wanted to experience the city as a tourist, to try and get a good feel for it.  When I am traveling, I would like to be able to relax in a calming atmosphere.  That boiled down my choices to the Peabody and the Westin.  Since I am an SPGer and have AAA, I couldn't but not pass up the deals here.  I got a AAA bed n breakfast rate for $159 a night (when the rooms are normally $179, with no breakfast)- and a daily $40 credit for breakfast.  Unfortunately, the Peabody couldn't come close to offering something like that.So never being to Memphis before and having it be late at night, I just started driving til I saw some lights that would look possibly familiar- in the end, it was easy to find.  They have self parking (which I utilized) and valet.  They are $18/24 a night respectively (theres that hotel pricing I look forward too!).Since it was about midnight local time (on Valentine's day of all days), I was able to sneak in the lobby from the garage.  As I walked in, I realized how nice and how new this place was.  I also noticed the White Tea Aloe scent permeating the air.  That is an addictive scent- and this is coming from a beer drinking macho.Check in was smooth, and I was on my way to the room. On my way to the elevator, I realized the nice case of Gibsons just sitting there- apparently for the guests to enjoy in their room... I will have to keep that in mind for next time- I just didn't want to put on an improv concert in the middle of the night... When I got up to the room, all I could do was laugh when I looked out my window and was greeted with the huge letters of ""FEDEX FORUM"".  I had to remember who's backyard I was playing in (for those of you out of the know, I work for their main competitor).The room was spacious, clean, and I was shocked to see a soaking tub as well- I was just in a basic room (on the SPG floor).  I didn't have any issues getting to sleep- or staying asleep.  There was a stocked mini bar too (with that being said, not much, if any room to put anything else in there).Since I forgot to polish my shoes before I left, I called the desk, and dropped them off.  When I came back from my late drinking, my shiny shoes greeted me on my desk ($14 later!).  That was a convenience!The fitness center is being remodeled as we speak, but its cool- as it over looks the Gibson factory.  The business center is equipped with enough goods to get your email and Yelp on.  Comes in handy!  Overall, this is the nicest Westin I have stayed in, and I think it's an awesome addition to Memphis. Good call!! I was only an incident away from giving this place 5 stars- as my credit for my breakfast never went through, so having to deal with that was enough from making it perfect.  But other than that- this is a SOLID property, and I will surely direct my friends and family to stay here when they come to visit!I like a good bathroom. If I was rating the bathroom alone, it would be five stars. Give me hot water with a good showerhead and I could not be happier. My room at the Westin had a glass standing shower with a separate tub. Yippie!I had several nights of great sleep due to the comfy bedding. The pillows were fantastic and what I assume is a down duvet kept me very warm at night.Many attractions are within a walking distance from here. Beale Street is a block away. Gibson Guitars is across the street and offers daily tours. If the hotel had good internet service, I'd have gone to 5-stars. I paid for the premium service ($12.95/day) which touted 1Mbps speed but was never able to get over about 384Kbps. Poo. I had to resort to using MiFi off my iPad in order to get quality access to the outside world.If I make it back to Memphis, I'd totally stay here again.","My husband and I went to Memphis to actually go to Gibson and booked our stay at the Westin, which is located right across the street.  What a nice place.  We originally booked a traditional room but was upgraded to a suite.  All I can say is OMG.  Huge, spacious, comfortable.  The beds truly are heavenly.  We brought our dog who everyone fawned over as well.  The room service was great, the Bleu food was wonderful and the staff ever so accommodating.  If anyone ever goes to Memphis please consider staying here,This hotel probably should have been badge as a ""W"".  The location is loud and to in the middle of it all to feel much like a Westin, even with the white tea scent everywhere.  Arrival parking is sure to set things off on the wrong foot - no directional signage in a very congested location.  Room helped make up for everything but you can't enjoy the view at night because of the lighting and sound assault.  Fun for a party weekend, not a high-end visit to a city.If the Peabody is the ""historic"" classy hotel in near Beale, then Westin is the ""business"" classy hotel (or ""new/shiny/polish [insert adjective here]""). Westin's, in general, cater to the business crowd, and this one is no exception. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms huge with fantastic showers and separate tubs, and for $5, they'll give you workout clothes (did not try that, but duly noted). Though I'll still never understand why a hotel that caters to business travels charges a daily wireless rate. I suppose because they assume their employers are paying for it. Parking is about $18/day for self park. If you are there for Bourbon...I mean, Beale, Street (DEAR GOD WHY?!), some of the rooms even overlook it. Oh joy.We stayed 4 nights and it was great.  The room was big, beautifully decorated and the bathroom was very spacious.  The entire staff was wonderful.  Everyone was helpful and professional.  The location was prefect, the food was 4 star and the bars area in the lobby and lounges were well appointed.  I hate to exercise but the workout room was outstanding We are definitely staying againGood location, good beds and decent food. They don't have a pool however. It is right across the street from the rock and soul museum and also where the free shuttle picks up from. Restaurants on Beale street are steps away.What's a welcome reprieve from the neverending road when driving from Chicago to Austin? Memphis. And when stopping in Memphis, a trip to Beale Street is essential no matter how weary or anti-tourist you're feeling. I found a special for $179/night which is a solid deal considering this Westin's 'spit-and-it'll-hit-Beale' locale. Factor in a complimentary upgrade to the Starwood Preferred floor which included free bottled water (blah) and shared air space with celebrity basketball player Tony Parker (YES!) and the solid deal catapulted to remarkable status. Hint: If you're a basketball buff, book at the Westin when the Grizzlies are playing at home. Being surrounded by a small but tall chunk of the San Antonio Spurs team easily made my night!The property included all the usual Westin bells and whistles and some extras: The legendary heavenly bed, an oversized bathroom and a killer view of Beale Street. Make note that if you make a purchase at the neighboring Starbucks, it will come up as 'Westin Memphis FB' (food and beverage) on your credit card as it's technically located on their property. I called so you don't have to. Oh, and Gibson guitars straight from the factory across the street are on display in the lobby and are available for a borrow. Enjoy!Great hotel. Great staff (Brad at front desk is wonderful). Room was perfect. I always opt out of housecleaning and take points instead, so I can't comment on housekeeping services. Bleu restaurant was good (Tevin was a great waiter!). Get the caprese salad. Yum! Location is perfectly placed next to Beale St. Don't hesitate, stay here!From the moment we drove up, to the 'see you soon!' handshakes and hugs when our stay was over, the Westin Memphis Beale Street staff made us feel like family.The room was perfect, the hotel location is great, there's a Starbucks just around the corner. We walked to everything: Gibson factory, the Mississippi, Beale Street, great restaurants, so forth.Yes, it is what some malcontents call 'pricey,' but jeez, you certainly get what you pay for: lovely, quiet, clean, fresh room; professional, helpful friendly staff; a truly heavenly bed; luxurious bathroom; superb valet; excellent bar atmosphere.Five stars, baby!Perhaps, I just came during a very slow time of the season but this place seemed like a Ghost Town. I have always enjoyed my stays at Westins throughout the years especially because the Heavenly Bed is the stuff dreams are made of. (pun intended) Although, there wasn't anything terrible about my visit, there just wasn't anything fantastic either. Bleu Restaurant located in the hotel lobby was closed early each night. I tried to order dinner room service and the menu only offered slim pickings due to lack of inventory of food? I tried to order a veggie sandwich or salad and they advised me that they were lacking some of the key ingredients... I believe that it was during prime dinner time, 8:30pm?!However, the staff did offer up some other suggestions and ended up delivering me a salad albeit plain, but it sufficed. Next, I was disappointed by the size of the small fitness center as many of the other Westins that I have visited boast beautiful facilities. However, judging by the fact that I was the only person working out both times that I visited, this could explain why they didn't invest in this area. I also scratched my head as the comfy Heavenly robe was not waiting for me in my room like usual... is this a new Westin procedure?Some pros that do stand out is the convenient location of this hotel to the happenings of Beale Street, other tourism, and freeways. If you don't have your own vehicle, you can easily hoof it or take advantage of inexpensive cab fare to some of the fun that this city has to offer. I also appreciated the cleanliness of the grounds and rooms and customer service of what staff I did come across during my stay.Always a fan of The Westin, I'll continue to be a patron of this Starwood brand but I have to admit that this Beale Street location leaves a bit to be desired...Yelp365#10The Westin Memphis Beale Street is a very solid choice if you are staying in Memphis and perhaps even your best choice if you need or want to be in the downtown area.  The location is great.  It's close to Beale Street (right around the corner), and the Fed Ex Forum, Rock and Soul Museum, and Gibson Guitar Factory and Store are all right across the street.  The National Civl Rights Museum and nearby Central BBQ are within walking distance, also, but you might want to cab it there and back as the surrounding area is a little rough in spots.  Just sayin.  The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed.  If you have stayed at a Westin recently, the rooms will seem familiar, as will the scale of the hotel.  The hotel has a lounge and a surprisingly good restaurant.  The service was excellent.  The service is typically excellent at Westin hotels, but, here, you get that plus southern hospitality and manners.  Every member of the staff I encountered over a four day stay was friendly, welcoming, and genuinely helpful.  I would have given five stars but for the lack of a sundries store on site.  There are no such places nearby, so the lack of that amenity at the hotel was a  disappointment.What makes The Westin such a great place to stay during a trip to Memphis is the level of hospitality displayed by all the staff working there. Everyone had a genuinely friendly demeanor and were very attentive to our needs. Quintessential Southern Hospitality. Period.Every inch of the hotel is beautifully decorated and well maintained. The bar in the lobby was pretty cool and there was piano music on some nights of the week. What my travel buddy loved best was the case of Gibson guitars by the reception desk, which were available for loan during our stay on a first come first serve basis. After signing a lending agreement with the hotel, you get the guitar of your choice, an amp, and headphones delivered to your room. Very cool .Speaking of rooms, I adored that Heavenly Bed in the room and, if I had the extra coin, would purchase the bed for my home. I stayed in a room facing Gibson for more peace and quiet. I would recommend that you do, too, if you need to sleep as Beale Street is right around the corner. For me, the topper was the bathroom - so spacious and luxurious - with the double head shower and tub. I've stayed there twice on two separate trips to Memphis - once during the busy season in June and once during the slow season in December. On both occasions, it was a soothing experience staying at the Westin. Anytime I am in the city of Memphis, the Westin is my home away from home.Extremely friendly and competent staff, decent sized rooms, large bathroom, comfortable beds, excellent location just a half block from Beale St and they loan you Gibson guitars for your room! Pet friendly! No pool though...I think I've stayed in too many Westins and perhaps I was a little disappointed overall with Memphis.This Westin is conveniently located (across the street) from where the NBA Memphis Grizzlies play and is on the backside of Beale Street.  Honestly, I don't know how Memphis supports an NBA franchise.  There was a game on one of the nights I was at the hotel.  I walked outside to soak up some of the ambiance of an NBA crowd expecting fans, crowds, street vendors, etc.  It was a ghost town.  Beale St. wasn't much better:  it consisted of really only 4 or 5 places that weren't all too clean.Back to the Westin.  It was okay.  My room was dirty, the hallways were dirty, and the elevators were dirty.  In the morning, beer bottles were still in the lobby from the night before.  Valet service wasn't good either -- only one person was working and it took a good 30+ minutes to retrieve my car.Pros:Awesome locationNBA stays hereNice roomCons:Can't get basics right like calling an early morning cab (they never requested it the night before so it showed up 20 mins after I needed it)A bit pricey for amenitiesLOVED this hotel! Went to the Justin Timberlake concert at the FedEx Forum, and only had to walk right across the street! Super comfy bed, friendly staff, awesome shower... Very convenient  and clean stay :) Definitely recommend.JoJo loves me a WestinWhats not to like?  Giant Bed, kick ass shower - I'm currently writing this review drinking a cup of complimentary coffee I made with my complimentary bottled water whilst on my complimentary wifi wearing a westin robe.Hint: join starwoods PG kids, you get points regardless of how often you stay - if ya'll get a credit card you get more points and they give you free water.the people in memphis are SO NICE.  Seriously, so nice.  And this hotel is clean, comfortable, the food is good and it overlooks beale - which is great if you want to walk in memphis with your feet ten feet off beale, and then go into your hotel room, take a heavenly shower and fall the eff asleep.  You won't even hear the rowdy kids playing at the bars.My hotel is PACKED this week because the clippers are in town and they're staying here...so I if I wind up in LA with a new spin on Basketball Wives don't hate, I'll remember you little yelpers helped me on my way to stardom.Location...location...location....yes siree Westin is within walking distance from Beale Street where all the great BBQ restaurant are located, plenty of clubs with live music across the street is FedEx Forum home to the NBA Grizzlies, Rock N Soul Museum and Gibson Guitar Factory....the biggest surprise when we check in was we found out you can borrow a really nice guitar with a small amp for your entire stay at NO CHARGE....how cool is that.....plus our large room 231 is facing the Gibson factory which we requested....bed so comfy, clean crisp linen, extra pillows, AC kept its temp steadily...bottled water free, bathroom is very roomy nicely decorated with high end amenities....staff are super friendly like Chris Griffin who made us feel like we are her BFF...Gary at the front desk sent someone to fix the door problem in less than 5min...Jean Marie who check us in was exceptional...Ozzi the room attendant was so sweet who gave us extra water when she found out I didn't very feel good...Westin own restaurant serve healthier food...Starbucks around the corner....we were not disappointed at all....we will stay at Westin Beale Street again when we return next yearConsidering the price, the Westin Beale Street was a tremendous disappointment. For starters, my television was out of service. Practically nothing is complimentary. Would you like a bottle of water? That will be $5. Internet service? $6.95 per night for a slow connection, $12.95 for a fast connection (really?!). Oh, and if your room is on the side of the hotel facing Beale Street, don't plan on getting any sleep. It's 11:45 p.m. as I type this, and the worst cover band I have ever heard in my life is playing ""The Humpty Hump"" literally right outside of my window. It's loud enough to feel vibrations in the floor.Ah, ""The Humpty Hump,"" that timeless blues classic. Didn't W.C. Handy write that?On the upside, it's less than a 10-minute walk to the best fried chicken on Earth, Gus' Hot &amp; Spicy World Famous Fried Chicken.From the moment we checked in we were treated wonderfully.   We were upgraded because of our gold status (which doesn't always happen).   Our dog was greeted every time he passed through the lobby.   Carlos at the bar could not have been nicer.   Location was great!   Stay here, you won't be sorry.   Thanks guys!Good hotel but a little below average for a Westin.  The positives.... for starters it's a Westin which means a Heavenly bed, dual shower heads, and all the standard amenities you'd expect from a Westin.  The location to Beale Street is ridiculously close too so even if you get tore up drunk it'd be tough not to find your way home.  Also I found the staff here to be extremely friendly &amp; attentive.  As far as negatives ....this Westin seems to be a bit worn down, probably expected when a good % of your clientele are going on drunken Beale Street benders.  Upon arrival they couldn't find my reservation eventhough I had my confirmation email &amp; number on my phone.  Took a while but they figured it out &amp; upgraded my room so there was a silver lining. Also one morning we ordered in-room dining for breakfast and they forgot to put in our order then when they did bring it they had only brought half the food.  I ended up waiting about 2hrs before I actually got my breakfast.  The Boston Celtics were staying at the hotel at this time and I can bet that Paul Pierce wasn't waiting 2hrs for his blueberry pancakes!! Overall had a few glitches with our stay but I'd still stay here next time I'm in Memphis.","Like Michael K we were upgraded to the NBA floor at the Westin. However, no famous people staying at the hotel that weekend...well, except for the stars of the weekend: my friend (the bride) and her soon-to-be groom.Since I was on bridesmaids duty while in Memphis I didn't spend much time in my hotel, but like all Westin hotel rooms it was comfortable. It was on the smaller size, but I may just be comparing it to the bridal suite...which was quite large. Thank goodness cause we needed lots of space for 14 bridesmaids to get hair and makeup done.Much of my time at the Westin was spent waiting for their very slow elevators. Two elevators isn't nearly enough for this large hotel- they could definitely use a few more.  The staff here was very nice...actually everyone I met in Memphis was very nice. Gotta love that southern hospitality.I usually judge hotels based on their workout room, but didn't make it to this one since my big workout was dancing at the wedding. However, my husband said it was adequate.This was my first time in Memphis, but if/when I make it back I'd definitely consider staying at this centrally located Westin again.The in room snack bar has a sex kit...need I type more?This W is a block off Beale street so after you bar crawl you end up at the front door of this place. They even let you sober up on the huge patio and serve coffee for free without judging you as you throw up in their bushes.While this hotel lacks proper insulation if your room is over looking Beale, remind me to tell you the story about the drunk girl yelling at my window, but there is no window tint so be careful walking around in your Bday suit...hence the screaming drunk girl.This is your typical W hotel with the yummy over sized pillows, plush pillows and robes you try to steal. You have to use a key card to gain access to your room floor, which is fabulous because I have traveled alone. The concierge is smooth, getting us last minute reservations at a hard to get in restaurant yet this hotel doesn't offer valet. Memphis became my haven this Summer and after experiencing some less then desirable hotels, we always end up at the W. Did I mention the sex kit...If possible, I would have given this terribly run establishment zero stars, but that's not an option. We were here for 4 days and our room was never cleaned once. We complained FOUR times with the fourth time getting the manager involved and that still didn't do anything . We have no toilet paper, no towels, and the toilet is broken. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone who cares about any customer service. Choose this hotel if you don't want any clean sheets, clean towels or working toilets. Absolutely dissatisfied with the customer service and experience here.I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one, only because I finally talked to a manager who was able to correct 2 full days (Day and Night) of terrible service.  Props to Leigh!!!!!  She finally acknowledged our problems and gave us a comped night.  She also treated us like guests.  The other staff (except in the restaurant)  were mostly ill equipped to work in the service industry at a high end hotel.)  LEIGH was the epitome of an excellent hotel manager!!!!  Too bad she was not there until Sunday morning.I will come back to the hotel at Leigh's invitation to try the hotel again..Chronology - So many bad things happened I cannot capture them here.Afternoon Day One - No valets were at the front in an city hotel with no curbside parking.  We got blocked in the main entrance for a good 10 minutes.  It was as if there was no way to check into the hotel.  We went inside and the hotel room was not ready  at 315 pm but the desk was not overly busy.   I was told to wait and I could have a seat or enjoy the bar (that was closed) at 3:15 in the afternoon.  Little did I know they were not expecting my room to be ready until 6pm.  Went and talked to desk again and she said ""I never said it would be a short wait!"" in a very defensive unprofessional tone.  People were steadily arriving into the lobby and by 415 pm there were about 50 guests waiting to be checked in.  The front desk was frustrated and did not have the resources or ability to handle this problem.KICKER: A GUEST WHO WAS NOT TOO UNPLEASANT (above) had the police called on him by the staff and was ""BANNED FROM THE HOTEL FOR LIFE""  When I left for dinner and the police were talking to him outside,  I asked him and his very lovely wife if they needed any testimony to their behavior because it did not justify a police call.  They were well behaved but upset.  I should look on you tube to see if it is out there.Night Day One - Upon return at midnight and check-in I asked if any accommodation had been made for our inconvenience of not being able to change for our dinner party and if the manager Gary or Don was ready to talk to me.  The lady at the desk knew nothing about it and when I started to tell her the story she told me to not raise my voice to her and then when my wife came over to see what was wrong I told her there was no resolution.  The lady at the desk snapped at me ""Don't Tell her that - I said I would work on a resolution.""   Who talks to guests like that?????  My wife told her not to talk to me like that and the lady at the desk did not like that at all.  We checked into our room because I did not want to be arrested in Memphis at Midnight and noticed a piece of garbage in the hall outside our room that remained until we checked out Sunday.  Our room was dirty (see pictures with post-its)Morning Day 2 - No resolution or accomodation made to us.  Morning service much better.  Tells us she hopes we get some resolution to the problemEvening Day 2 - No resolution or accommodation.  Little better service from the front desk.   Get back to room late and Gary had called and alluded to the fact that there was some sort of perceived debacle in the lobby Friday night.  Are you kidding?  There were 50 pissed off guests hanging in the lobby Friday...Morning Day three - Sunday - Checkout.  Leigh answered.  Leigh was AWESOME and did all we wanted which was that  she apologized on behalf of the hotel.  She did not blame the large group. she did not blame anyone, she took care of business and handled it professionally.  She comped us one night which was great.  Overall - the problem was the late check in and the dirty room which was easily remedied but the hotel staff  made a problem much worse with such incredible rudeness.   Leigh and the morning staff were refreshing and well training.  I am thankful she worked there to smooth over the other problems.I am a gold preferred guests with about 100 lifetime nights under my belt at all different Starwood hotels.  This was my worst experience and hopefully it was a fluke and I will give it a second shot.The shower was clogged and I showered in several inches of water.  When I told the front desk, they said the next guest would appreciate that I told them.  And that was it. I would expect some type of credit; it was disgusting and my wife wouldn't shower after me. There aren't a lot of choices in Memphis, but we were just shocked at the lacking service- in the bar/ restaurant, room service, front desk.  I just expect a lot better from a Westin.I do love the Westin's bedding.Great stay! Check in was easy, ate at the restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner ( both days) ...I enjoyed my dinners, lunch was ok, I'm not a fan of the way they prepare chicken when added to salads, both days they were kinda rubbery :/, loved the breakfast buffets that were prepared (sweetest fruit ever!) ....awesome staff, very polite.  We were a group of 10, there on business, and we all really pleased with the service &amp; attentive staff.  Will definitely stay there again.   ps, our window faced Beale street and it was not noisy, got a good nights sleep each night.This hotel is ""okay"" as long as you don't have a billing issue. I was erroneously charged for an additional room which was cancelled 3 days prior to my reservation. After 6 WEEKS of phone calls and e-mails back and forth, I finally have this issue resolved. This ONLY occurred after repeatedly calling Starwood Resorts. It was finally explained as a ""glitch"" in their system. If you do have a billing issue, don't count on the Westin Memphis staff to be concerned enough to resolve the problem. After, FINALLY, making contact with Don Michael Norwood (Guest Relations Manager-Westin Memphis), he was seemingly uninterested and unwilling to adequately investigate the issue. After providing him with documentation proving the cancellation, I never heard from him again.In my profession, I actually instruct people in proper customer service. As a consolation for my bad experience, I now have the perfect example of bad customer service which I will be using for illustration purposes.   This has literally been the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I spend approximately 150 nights per year staying in various hotels around the country. You should not have to fight this hard to get people to do their job. I am extraordinarily sorry that I chose Westin-Memphis.The hotel is a fairly nice spot. I have to say that the bathroom is pretty nice, with a standing shower and separate soaking tub. The room itself is fairly spacious and looks modern enough.The staff here is very kind and very attentive. There were plenty of people to great us and help make us feel invited.It's close to the FedEx Forum (where the Memphis Grizzlies play) and also close to the Rock n Soul Museum.Overall, a pretty good place to stayI just returned from a  four-night stay here. We were given a free upgrade to a deluxe corner room on the top (NBA) floor. How do I know it was the NBA floor? The shower heads were installed eight feet high! I could not even reach the diverter lever for the hand shower.The bathroom was spacious and clean, as was the room itself. The bed was super-comfortable. The room was quiet, despite the proximity to Beale St., and the AC worked perfectly. The room is equipped with a decent HD TV, but wi-fi service is $7 extra per day. The staff here was polite, friendly, and helpful. We didn't eat breakfast at the on-site restaurant, opting instead for Starbucks next door. I'm giving this hotel an unequivocal five stars for this: There is a glass case in the lobby displaying ten beautiful Gibson electric guitars, products of the factory across the street. I remarked to the desk clerk that I though they were cool, and she said, ""Do you play?"" I replied that I do, so she said, ""Pick one you like, take up to your room, keep it as long as you wish, then bring it back when you want to try a different one."" Wow! With it, they loan you an ampllfier-emulating effects pedal and headphones so as not to disturb the other guests. Awesome.Was able to check in as soon as I arrived !Around the corner from Beale St. Had  a great time at the hotel! One bad thing is that there was no free WiFi!I like Westin's. They are usually well appointed, clean and have great service. The Westin on Beale is very conveniently located across from the FedEx Center and around the corner from Beale st. WHEN YOU GO- The staff at this Westin was not only friendly and professional but HOT as well (always a plus in my book). If all this has been so great, why only three stars? Glad you asked. HAIR! I checked in exhausted from being crammed into the coffin of a plane known as United Air ( that's another review) and just wanted to get out of my suit and have a drink. Upon walking into the room, I checked the bathroom and was greeted by a dozen + long, black hairs on the floor and in the shower. Now I have to pick up all my stuff and go back down to the front desk to get a new room. Staff was apologetic and moved me to a room with a better view and hooray, no hair. I'll go back...with a lint roller!Read current reviews and book elsewhere. 4 days before my stay (reservations booked well in advance and confirmation # issued) I received an email notifying me that the hotel overbooked and they could not honor their commitment.This seems to be a trend with this hotel. I have stayed at hotels all across the world and have never been told just a few days in advance that I had no reservations. If the hotel continues to do this and people continue to complain online, they will not have any business so I guess the problem with ""overbooking"" will be solved.Interesting part is, the confirmation emails state: ""Rest easy, your reservations have been confirmed"" apparently this means nothing to this hotel. I would think that a hotel would rather have a few rooms go unsold rather than overbook and have unhappy customers. Unfortunately, this Westin will give all other Westin's (and Starwood properties for that matter) a black eye.  The email notifying me that they overbooked states: ""I hope this email finds you having a delightful day. It is with regret that we must inform you that we will be unable to hold your reservations..."" I was having a ""delightful day"" until I received this notification.I called Patrick Jordan - General Manager (or that's what it states in my confirmation email) and left a message. I called Don Michael Norwood Guest Services Manager - and left a message. I emailed Mr. Norwood. I then called and spoke with Paris in reservations. After I told her that I received an email she then stated that if I received an email last night or this morning then I no longer had reservations. She stated someone from management would be contacting me today or tomorrow. As of this writing - I have not heard from anyone. I did receive a second email confirming that the reservations were no longer good and that they would contact me.   I wish I could review the hotel itself - but considering I didn't get a chance to even see the hotel I can't. Considering how it appears this hotel is managed - I can only assume the qualities of the hotel are as poor as their reservation system. It would appear this hotel management puts profit above all else leaving its customers ""out in the cold"" -  literally.The second email I received provided hotels ""in the area"" that had rooms available - BOTH IN ANOTHER STATE - TUNICA, MS - approx. 30 miles and 45 minutes from Memphis. If I had wanted to stay at a casino I would have booked there in the first place.  I did NOT book through a 3rd party (Priceline, Kayak...etc.) so that cannot be used as an excuse from Westin.Avoid. There are many other hotels in Memphis that rate much higher. Such a shame for Westin and Starwood to be associated with service like this.A reasonable 3-star hotel, but not a 4-star hotel by any means. For the price, I can only give it 2 stars. The bed was very comfortable; however, there were a number of other minor issues that in combination did not contribute to a completely positive experience.For example, the bathtub was marginally clean (hair), bathroom tile was old and stained. The front desk is very small for a hotel this size and never appeared to be staffed with more than 1 (or often 0) people, making service very slow. I requested shaving cream and a razor twice and was told it would be delivered to my room; I never received them or any explanation. We attempted to go to the lobby bar after a long day on the road, but ended up waiting 10 minutes for service from the bartender who was engrossed in a conversation with another patron. Upon checkout, we were billed for a $5 candy bar from the honor bar that we never used; this was removed from our bill.In summary, a decent experience but not great, particularly for the purported 4-star rating. Having stayed in a number of other branches of this hotel chain, this location does not seem to be up to par.I've stayed in a lot of hotels, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to service. The desk clerk got us checked in fast and was very friendly. We ended up in a high room facing Beale. The room was clean and cool and well equipped. The bed was piled with pillows and down comforters and was very comfortable. I wish my bed at home was that luxurious. The bathroom was large and I was glad to see a separate tub and shower. The shower also had dual heads with was pretty awesome. The bathroom was stocked with a full size hair dryer and all of the mini toiletries you need. We were just there for one night, but the stay was nice. I loved that they had Starbucks coffee in the room, and after a night on Beale st I sure needed it. The hotel was just steps from Beale which made it very easy to walk wherever we wanted to go. I would definitely stay here again.Location: Excellent. Just a block away from Beale but that block makes a huge difference when you just want to come back to your room and sleep after a long day of work, while others are just waking up to go party! Property: Not the most exciting, but then who visits Memphis to spend time in their hotel? Decor: Liked the Gibsons guitars in the lobby! Room: I was upgraded and had a huge bathroom, which was fabulous!I made two reservations at this hotel 45 days prior to our arrival.  Seven days before our arrival, the manager called with a ""courtesy call"" saying the hotel had sold out to a group and I no longer had reservations at his hotel.  I couldn't believe it.  At that point, every other nice hotel was sold out.  I called SPG and they could do nothing, actually, I was quite surprised at the poor level of service I received when I called SPG customer service.I really loved my 3 night stay here.  I found the staff to be very friendly and accomadating.  They even asked us before we checked in if we wanted a Beale St. side and warned us that the music from Beale can get noisy.  Sounded perfect to us.  Our room was on the top floor overlooking Beale St and the baseball stadium a few blocks away.  The music was never too loud but added to the ""Memphis experience"".  The room was spacious as was the bathroom.  The shower stall was amazing.  The only drawback (and I don't really blame the hotel) is the amount of panhandlers as soon as you walk outside.  This is a tourist driven area and every 30 seconds some one is begging for a handout.  I think that's more of a city of Memphis problem but the hotel should provide some sort of security for its guests as well.I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite, and the suite was fine. However, the small things caught my attention. Stains on the carpet, small amounts of mold in the shower, towels not replenished when they should be, all made me feel as this was just shy of what it should be. Still, having been to Memphis many times, this remains the best hotel option in town.We didn't stay at the Westin, wished we would have.   We did however, have breakfast there 2 days and found the server staff especially Donna the best.  Next time for sure we'll stay at the Westin.  Great location, very modern and clean.   Parking deck attached which is important including self as well as valet parking.As a SPG Platinum trying to stay loyal to the product, this is the only place to stay when in Memphis. In total, my July 2010 stay was probably my 5th stay here. I would have to say that this is the best location in Memphis. 100 yards from Beal Street and all the fun that goes on there... Directly across the street from the Fed Ex Forum. I've been there around New Years when the Liberty Bowl is happening and this hotel is always the headquarters for one of the teams playing in the game. The rooms are are what you would expect from a Westin... Heavenly beds, dual shower heads... Very nice. If spending some time in Memphis, I can't think of another place I would rather stay!","Prior to my arrival at the Westin, I checked the Yelp reviews and was surprised a Westin had only 4 out of 5 stars. I'd say they're all 5 stars in my book, well, then I showed up. Being located 20 yards from drunk fest silky o  sullivans bar and the fact that you can walk around downtown memphis with open booze doesn't mean the guests of the hotel have any class. We mostly shared the elevator with complete drunks. As we walked down the hall to our room, there was catsup on the wall. Oh great.  I dont think its the Westins fault, is the fact that people have NO respect at all. Poor Westin.  I also thought the hallway smelled like pot. We arrived in our room to see the bed skirt was hanging off the bed and a huge stain the carpet.  All the informational cards had stains on them or 'crinkled' , folded corners. How challenging is it to have fresh, crisp promotional materials. I just felt like the room had some parties in it. The bed was heavenly, as well as the shower, the bathroom and over all room cleanliness was good. The staff always seemed busy but nice and informative when we needed them. The catsup was cleaned up within 20 minutes of me seeing it. That made me happy. The room was quiet and overall it was an okay experience but there are plenty of other nicer Westins. This hotel is 10 yards of the Fed Ex Forum and Beale Street. You really can't get any closer.Stayed here during the International Blues Challenge and for once got a great night's sleep in Memphis. The walls are thick, the rooms well arranged to keep you away from your neighbor's noise, and the air conditioning is quiet. While you hear the doors, you don't get much hall way conversation. And the bed... very comfortable. The staff was universally friendly and professional. Only touch an item in the honor bar/snack holder if you really want it... all automated. They are happy to bring you a separate fridge for your own snacks at no charge and they did this promptly. The on site restaurant ""bleu"" has a modern menu and everything I ate was fabulous, though slightly salty - apparently a regional taste preference. Just ask for no salt added. The room is not large, there's no table, just a desk and corner chair, but it is all very comfortable. Couldn't be more convenient to Beale... we performed at Blues Hall and it's right around the corner. For the finals at the Orpheum we only had to walk 2 blocks. Highly recommended.I read some negative reviews on this place before my visit and was a little worried about dirtiness and rudeness. I found neither. It was just like the place I expected when i booked it, and better. The location is perfect and the rooms are what you expect in a Westin. I was also worried about parking, but accidently found a place next door for $15 a day, which was better than the hotel was offering. It is right past the valet and is open to the general public. So all in all it was perfect for my trip. The price wasn't bad depending on your night of choice.Was here for a meeting.  Had a room overlooking the stadium which was a bit loud on game night, but otherwise this was a classic westin room and classic westin service.  Close enough to the touristy area to visit, but thankfully not right on the street.We wanted to stay in the downtown Memphis area at a place with a King sized bed and close to Beale St.Things I loved:- The PRICE! For a King sized bed, additional tub and its location? ($132/night) It was cheaper than other hotels in its area!- The shower head... As with all Westins, the heavenly shower made me extremely happy. :)-  An additional tub! I had been traveling the past three days and a nice soak was perfect.- The parking, for the reviewer who had a problem with parking, we had gotten the $18/day deal. But every time you park, you have to get the ticket stamped so that the cashier for the lot would not charge you. It was actually pretty cheap/convenient for us.- The staff. I know that someone had reviewed a problem with the staff, but we had no such experience and everyone was super friendly/our room was very well maintained. The person who checked us (sadly I don't remember her name) was incredibly helpful! All kinds of information, giving us a choice in what side of the hotel/view we wanted.- The view! I know it isn't the ocean. But I love city lights! :) :)Things I didn't love:- The self automated snack bar? I was terrified of putting anything near the set up, because if the weight changes in ANY way, they charge you!  TERRIFIED.This hotel will never have our business again.  Stay here at the risk something could get stolen and neither Guest Services Mangers will do anything about it.  Long story short I left my purse with my wallet in it in the room for a couple of hours while we were out and one of my credit cards was stolen.   I discovered it was missing when my bank called and asked about 500 dollars in charges that seem out of the ordinary.  I looked in my wallet and saw that one of my cards was in fact gone. I spoke to Gary immediately who took a report but never filed it.  I spoke to Don the next morning since Gary said he would leave the report for him to review and that he would contact me before we checked out.   Don did not know anything so we filed another report.   We checked out the hotel that day and have heard from them once confirming that one of their staff did come in our room when we were out.  He said he would call me again after they had more information and here it is 2 1/2  weeks later and we have heard nothing.  We finally called Starwood Corporate and reported the issue to them.  They had not heard anything from Gary or Don either.  They offered us some points as a ""we are sorry this happened"" gesture and said they would try and get some answers.   We are not holding our breath that anything will be done.The noise is killing me. The loud music until 5am for the cost is terrible. The hotel location is wonderful and the hotel is lovely but I would never come here for work or with a family. Being here on a girls weekend is still so hard. No sleep is no fun.Great hotel, great staff, and great smelling lobby.I stayed here for the Memphis Marathon Weekend.  I was able to check in early and got a nice room on the top floor with a view of Beale Street.  The beds were comfy and the shower was fantastic.  If you like coffee, there's a machine in the room.  The in room coffee makers scare me, so I hit up the Starbucks around the corner.  Oh, and everything else - food, shopping, hotels, bars, museums, and the Gibson Guitar factory are around the corner.  Bonus part of the stay, there was an NBA team staying on my floor.  The Fedex Forum is across the street, so if you stay here you might see some famous faces.  Price is quite steep, but overall a good stay.We stayed here on our way home from Mississippi back home to Chicago. It was a beautiful hotel just on the other side of Beale Street. The staff was delightful and the rooms (beds and shower) clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay here again on the next trip to Memphis.Other than the beggars right outside the entrance, this place was clean and comfortable. We ordered room service one night in and they only brought out one of our dishes. I'm sure that was just an isolated incident. Close walking distance to Beale Street and The Memphis Redbirds stadium. There's a Starbucks just around the corner for coffee lovers like me. I was very pleased with the room and view. Bathroom was huge. Separate tub and shower...which was luxurious with duel shower heads. Parking garage is conveniently connected to the hotel. Very good location. I'd stay here again.Got a great deal on Expedia. GREAT LOCATION if you want to party on Beale and be close to Mud Island. As Westin's go, nice hotel, nice bar, nice restaurant, great concierge, nice Heavenly double head shower and Heavenly beds. Starbucks right around the corner. Great workout facility in the hotel. Did I mention the great location? Its also right across the street from the Fed-X Forum arena. As cities go, hate paying for garage parking per day, way too expensive. I would have given 5 stars but the hotel did not clean my room. Granted, we had the tranquility sign out till 11, they should have come back and cleaned. I did call and got a loud fresh towels right out of the dryer but I was super disappointed in the housekeeping service. My other issue was my room faced Beale so you could hear those Blues all night long. If you stay here, be SURE to request a room facing the opposite wayMy stay was Excellent!!! Just a minutes walk for the excitement on Beale street. The hotel is very clean. My room was perfect. The bathrooms are huge! My bed was Extra Comfy. This will always be my hotel of choice while visiting Memphis. It's just one thing I didn't like $24 a day to PARK!!!! WTF....Fab hotel and the best location.  Agree with others to request a room away from Beale Street.  The hotel and staff are awesome.  Always greeted you with a smile and very willing to help. The valet staff was superb.  Very helpful and gave us coupons to Graceland. Room service very pricey but their molten chocolate cake was to die for.My husband and I stayed at the Westin on Valentines Day a few years ago. It was a great little package deal. We had a private catered dinner on one floor of the hotel, with only a few other couples scattered throughout the large banquet room. A 4 course deal, with an excellent filet, fresh steamed veggies, hot buttered bread, and creme brulee for dessert. The servers were extra attentive, and the ambiance was quiet and romantic with low lights and candles scattered throughout the room. Our room itself was beautifully decorated with a comfy mattress and a great shower (I won't go into details here because many of the other reviewers already have). One of the things that I have always thought was extra clever about this hotel? One floor is supersized- high ceilings and doorways as well as extra-long beds to attract all of the out of town NBA ballers coming in to take on the Grizzlies. As the hotel is located just steps away from FedEx Forum, this concept is supersmart.The Westin Hotel downtown Memphis is one of my favorite spots to visit for Happy Hour ... I have enjoyed the great customer service, I get every time I walk thru the doors, most of the employees know my name because I always go to the Grizzlies games from there... Just recently they became one of my vendors for Lotus Energy Drink and have made it a house hold name for their customers, as the bartenders always have a new drink made with our product avail for me to try... I give the managers Lance and Lance two thumbs up for their professionalism and efforts of keeping the Westin Bar and Restaurant a great place to visit for lunch as well as dinner... Oh yeah! And don't forget the all you can eat Crab Legs on Friday night and Live Smooth Jazz music at the lobby bar as well .... As a matter of fact I'm headed there now!!!!!The beautiful wife and I came to Memphis for our anniversary, and based on rates via the various travel sites (and previous Yelp reviews), the Westin was our choice ($132 for a king)We were very pleased -- the ""heavenly"" concept for the rooms (and that great dual shower head) lived up to its name.  With the curtains drawn, you are bound to sleep like a babe (though I recommend having a fan brought to your room.  The air circulation isn't the greatest).Checkin was pretty much a breeze (though there was only one person working at 2:30, when the official checkin time is 3:00 -- you'd think they're have more people ready).The bathroom is huge -- as noted above, and in others reviews, that shower head is really nice.  The tub isn't worth much unless you're a petite female.  And the fan clears out the condensation quickly.The view isn't anything, but unless you're looking at an ocean, who really cares about the view?Upon leaving, the parking situation started to bug me.  We self-parked and paid through the hotel ($18 or 19 per day).  But then I realized the garage wasn't an hourly, it was a per-entry.  The days we were there, I think it was $5 on Wednesday and $6 on Thursday (didn't look for Friday).  So we ended up paying around $60 for $17 worth of going in-and-out.So, if you're sticking close to the hotel and not going in/out all the time, park yourself and pay at the garage gate.  Oh well, lesson learned.Except for no free breakfast, this is a lovely hotel. I got a great deal from Westin too, the first night I paid the last two digits of my birth year (hey, did you know I was born in 1925) and the second night was $199. Fair deal in my opinion considering the location (steps from Beale Street) and the high quality rooms. Very nice showers, yes, everyone likes the showers.And there was some lovely live music in the restaurant on Sunday morning from this goddess singing ""Across the Universe"".I love staying at Westin hotels because I can wallow (yes, wallow) in their lovely pillow-top beds.  This Westin was no exception, and had the added bonus of being close to everything my group would need to reach during our stay.  This hotel has decent space, very large bathrooms (another Westin staple) and friendly, helpful concierge and bell staff.  The front desk staff was a little stand-offish, which was only really apparent as a contrast to everyone else with whom I interacted.  The lobby seating space is comfortable and variable, with room for several groups to be seated without bothering one another.  The one oddity is the passage between the hotel and the adjacent garage (not owned by the Westin).  You exit the luxurious, modern lobby through heavy metal fire doors and are immediately in a cold, stark concrete hallway.  If you want to get to the garage without having to go up a set of stairs, you must exit completely outside and go up the sidewalk.  It was just a bit odd to me, but I guess the garage is also used for the sports/concert venue across the street.Overall, a much better experience than my first Memphis trip (to the Peabody).  A professional staff, good size rooms and great location will trump every time.Do not stay here. Internet didn't work - had to spend 45 minutes on the phone with a separate customer service operator upon arrival. Also, TV signal kept going out. The room was fairly nice and clean. Biggest complaint, however, is the noise and a rude manager. When we checked in we asked if they had a quiet room (meaning NOT facing Beale St.) They lied and said ""Yes, we'll put you in a quiet room"" and put us in a room facing Beale St. which was so loud all night we couldn't sleep. We called the next morning to see if they had any other rooms. Nope, all booked. We asked to check out. They told us we would be charged for the remaining night. So we spoke with a manager about checking out. His name was Don. He told us under no circumstances would they refund us for the remaining night. My husband told him, ""That is unethical, since you lied about the quiet room. If the front desk had been honest, we would have simply gone to another hotel."" The manager then said, ""Stop calling me names. I'm going to charge you with slander!"" Really?! First, Don should look up the definition of slander in the dictionary. My husband responded, ""Sir, I did not call you a name. I said ""that was unethical,"" referring to your choice of action."" The manager proceeded to argue with my husband, claiming we were calling him names. Really, we cannot believe that a hotel manager would be so rude to a customer under any circumstance. We were not refunded, but we will never again stay here or recommend it to our clients, family, or friends.Very nice hotel.  Very nice staff.  Great location!","A most disapointing stay.  They charge 18 to park in a lot that is 5- 10 dollars for the public, but they don't mention you could opt out of their charge.  They charge 3.00 for a  mini bottle of water, that they have next to to the room coffee.- in very small fine print is the charge.  The bed and location were good, but if I was to return I would go to the Hamtpon insted. For the price they continue to nickel and dime you to death.I love Westins what can I say! I stayed here with my family on Friday May 8th and held a graduation reception on May 9th in the Tennessee Room. My lil sis was graduating from U of Mphs at the Fed Ex forum - it was perfect to be able to walk right across the street the morning of the graduation. We also got a great room rate on line at $199! This Westin is great for walking down to Beale Street - less than 50 steps away!! I don't think it has a pool of spa but it does have a workout facility. Also, we had a little reception after the graduation in the Tennessee Room - let me say get the Black Eye Pea Hummus!!! yummy Marquis, Alfonso, Jennifer, Juli and Jeff all were fantastic!I love The Westin anyways, but location here is awsome. Walk to The Beale street. Visit sun studio, blues museum and Gibson guitar. We only could stay two nights there but I enjoyed every moment of it. Corner room, quiet and very helpful staff. I think overall experience was awsome.This hotel is just fine for what you're looking for!  It's nicely furnished, clean rooms and classy interior lobby, etc. You couldn't ask for a better location!  Beale street is right around the corner, and the river walk is just a few blocks away. The restaurant is very good.  Food and service.  As far as the staff goes, well, you will receive service that goes beyond and above!!!!  Amanda at the desk was so very accommodating, willing to extend the effort, and very honest and sweet!  Steven was oh so down to earth, professional, and made us feel at home, and Calvin greeted us with smiles, good conversation, and a welcoming attitude.  We can't remember the bartenders name, but he had a great sense of humor and provided us with great recommendations.  Wonderful stay!  Employees enhance the stay and care about your personal experience!  As far as price?  No different than anywhere else.  You're on vacation.  People love to complain on this site and every other site.  Everyone's a critic.  This us a positive review!Exceptional location, but the service left much to be desired.  Our room was not properly cleaned prior to our arrival - evidence included trash in garbage cans left over from the previous occupant. Strike 1.Our bedding and towels were stained - makeup on the towel and a mysterious black stain on a pillow.  Not the end of the world, but kind of gross. 2nd strike.The most disappointing aspect of our stay was the fee associated with WiFi use. Practically every hotel I've ever stayed in (including the crummy airport Hilton that I bunked at my first night in TN) offers free WiFi as a courtesy to its guests. The 3rd and final strike.However, if location is important (and you are able to look past the aforementioned issues), you really can't do much better. Its proximity to Beale Street makes it an ideal spot to hang your hat for a few days.Also worth mentioning are the valets. Extremely friendly, polite and eager to help. Not the worse place I've ever stayed in, but definitely doesn't live up to the hype.As a regular traveler to Memphis (on business), I am thrilled to have another good hotel option downtown.  The Marriott, located at the other end of Main Street (bordered by 2nd Street), is frequently booked with conventioneers, and The Peabody is both old and expensive.  My taste tends to run to the modern, the spare and the luxurious.  The Memphis Westin doesn't have the concrete floors of The Shore Club in South Beach (and thank goodness for that), but the style, for the most part, is that of understated, unflashy elegance.  I'll take it.There is some variability between the rooms of this newly opened hotel (May 2007).  While my room was spacious, well lit (ask for a high floor for both light and quiet) and had a rather extraordinary bathroom, my colleague's handicapped accessible room was a little, well, sad by comparison.  Whereas I had a gorgeous steam shower separate from the soaking tub, he had a shower suitable for wheelchair access including a pull down in-shower bench and an open closet with very low clothing racks.  Note: I'm glad, of course, that this nice new hotel has lots of accessible rooms; I was just confused by the fact that they gave my colleague one when the hotel wasn't full.Anyway.  Like other Westins I have stayed at, service isn't its strong suit.  Room service breakfasts took too long, and one day, housekeeping never did show up.  I keep my room pretty neat anyway, and there's a Starbucks downstairs; as long as the TV and internet work when I'm in the room...cool.  I'm cool.Not a fan of the hotel restaurant, an outpost of The Daily Grille.  But it's a chain and I tend to be anti-chain (other than chains selling coffee, in which case I ask ""where can I get a franchise?""), but the Memphis people seem to be enjoying a break from the barbecue of nearby Beale Street.Valet parking is expensive, but a must.  Memphis has some issues with crime, violent and not, so if you're traveling, do it.  If you're a woman traveling alone, do not hesitate to valet.Rack rate hovers around $250/night.  Not cheap so search around for discounts before bookingMy husband and I visited Memphis for the first time this past week.  As a gay couple, we weren't quite prepared for the reception we got in this city, but the staff at Westin (with the exception of one manager; think his name was Patrick) set the tone for what was to be a fabulous experience.  Upon check-in, the staff took ample time to explain the highlights of the area; even embellishing with some of their personal faves.  We are a very low-key couple, so we chose to indulge in the bar located in the lobby of the hotel; Beale Street was unbearably loud.  The housekeeping staff, Sabrina in particular were phenomenal.  It seemed we continued to get superior service from the staff even when we were not there.  One person moonlights at Rhodes College in their on-campus pub, while another moonlights at the airport.  Even on these occassions, these people were quite friendly.  Our one hiccup:  After sitting at the bar one night, we decided to venture over to Beale Street just for the heck of it.  Well, we pretty much turned around to retreat back to the hotel's bar.  Before sitting, we asked the bartender (Courtney) if it was too late for service.  He welcomed us with open arms and stated there was absolutely ""no rush"" (very conscious of this because I bartended for years).  At this time, there were two other gentleman at the bar (who did not look like us - wink).  As soon as the left the overnight manager, Patrick (?), came over with much urgency in his voice telling the bartender over and over in front of us that he had to close immediately.  The bartender was taken aback, as were we; he politely excused himself from the bar to have a conversation with the manager.  Upon return, with manager in tow, we were apologized to, and even offered a glass of wine on the house.  Although this somewhat tainted the remainder of our stay, I refuse to shave off any stars because of this one person.  As we were packing to leave, we noticed the light on the phone blinking: a message from Courtney apologizing once again.  In the words of my Granny, ""One monkey don't stop no show.""  Ooops, I almost forgot: Joan you were the bomb.Location location location.This hotel is right by Beale St (comes in handy while walking home and drinking a Diver) and is across the street from the Fedex Forum (we ran into some Utah Jazz players there during our stay).Rooms were great, comfy beds, GREAT bathroom. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. They don't have a hotel shuttle from the airport, so you're gonna have to rent a car or cough up 30 bucks for a cab.Prices were a bit high, but again, location location location.Beautiful hotel! Great location! Great bath amenities! Awesome towels! Great beds! Reasonable rates! Here is an insider tip, always ask for a room that ends in 01. These rooms have the best corner views! Two minor, minor drawbacks: the front desk staff is too lean and no concierge room for elite members.Let me start off by saying I am a Starwood Preferred Guest Gold member...which means I stay at a lot of Westn hotels throughout the nation. I am a huge fan and love Starwood and Westin.The Westin in Memphis is a beautiful hotel and the location is perfrect. You're right on Beale Street and just a few blocks from amazing Memphis attractions like The National Civil Rights Museum (the site of the Lorraine Motel where MLK was assassinated), within a mile of Sun Studios, Stax, et al.The service and attention to detail at this hotel is awful. It's pretty much the newest - and nicest - hotel in downtown Memphis but the staff leaves much to be desired. The only exception was the valets. They were great...espeially Rob. Here is what happened to us on our three night stay there:1. Staff at check in was not very friendly, and frankly, standoffish. This is your first experience with the hotel and it is not good.2. Rooms were maintained well but several things were missing in our room including pillows, coffee, soap and other small items that tell me housekeeping is not very good.3. Because Beale Street attracts all types, there are lots of beggars on the adjoining streets and the hotel doesn't try to disuade them in any way. I know they can't stop it bu they really don't have an real security that I could see.4. Our last night there, a water pipe broke and we had no water into the next morning. They did NOTHING to proactively communicate what had happened or what was happening to the guests. We paid top dollar to stay here and I couldn't even shower before my long trip home the next day. Not even an apology or ""make good"" for one of their most loyal guests. It was just unacceptable.5. Due to the water issue, the elevators were not working. When we checked out, we got lucky that a maid walked by and offered to take us in the service elevator. Had we not seen here, we would have been in the dark. Awful.Again, I am an incredibly loyal Westin customer. But this experience was awful...but in Memphis, there isn't much else.Checked in at 1 a.m. without all my baggage.... was greeted as a weary/bleary traveller should be.  Clean, up-to-date.  Slept like a baby in an uber comfy bed.  The double ""heavenly shower"" heads were an especially welcome touch the next morning.  [and i also got it for a steal through hotwire)I have to agree with the negative reviews.  This is a hotel that charges $260+ a night for luxury beds, bedding, and decor.  But the staff is cold (a lot like the modern decor) and there is no way in the world I would ever spend that kind of money again on a hotel room.  For that kind of money, I expect to be greeted warmly and treated like a guest -- not just another number.Very clean and up to date as most all Westin Hotels are. We stayed here because it is ""very"" close to FedEx Forum; like across the street close. If you are attending an event, such as a concert like we were, staying here is perfect. It books up quick, so reserve your room(s) early! Expect to pay the ""quality price"" that Westin asks for. Staff was pleasant and attentive. Even though you are in downtown Memphis, there are some safeguards such as having to use your key to get to a floor when entering the elevators. My wife and I did not venture downstairs to eat at the Sole Restaurant that is on property. We were just enjoying the moment of being away from the house and kids and getting ready for the concert we were attending. However, we did order room service from the room service menu. The food comes from Sole Restaurant downstairs. Food was great, room service was fast that early in the evening. Later that night, the wait was up to 45 minutes for a piece of cheesecake. We opted out of that one. Self parking for $18 or valet for $25? WAY easier to just valet for the few bucks extra.","['night', 'stopover', 'road', 'trip', 'husband', 'dogs', 'able', 'make', 'last', 'minute', 'reservation', 'night', 'fairly', 'satisfied', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-memphis-downtown-memphis-2,Doubletree by Hilton Memphis Downtown,3.0,$$,85,"It was a nice hotel. But I couldn't understand for the life of me why most of the channels on the tv didn't work. And I was in a Hilton Honors room. But besides the tv it was nice. Parked on the street for free so I didn't have to pay $25 valet. The lobby was slick depressing. It didn't look bad it just made me sad. Personal problem right?  I'm used to the Westin. But seriously they should consider making it brighter and add contemporary furnishings. And there should be a lobby bar. The TGI Friday one doesn't count.  If they had a bar I think they could have cool nightly entertainment on the stage in their lobby. But you know no one is really thinking about the lobby when they go to a hotel except me.  It was a nice hotel.  I can't say how it compares to other Hilton properties. But it's not a ratchet place.Let me preface this two star review by saying that this review does not reflect the staff inside the hotel. Upon check-in and throughout our stay the front desk to housing keeping was friendly and polite. With that said, Hilton needs to strongly consider renovating this hotel. Our floor, the 10th, smelled funky, the carpet dated, and our room was small with obvious ""repairs"" made, primarily in the bathroom. The room was clean but the bed uncomfortable and the tv had a very limited channel selection. I found all of this odd as a Silver HHonors member, I stay in various Hilton partners hotels often and Double Tree is usual very nice. This two star review would be a one star if it wasn't for the inside staff. What dropped this hotel is the fact that the valet dented the rear bumper of my rental car. When informed, they did not argue this and wrote it up. As of right now nothing has come of it and I'm hoping the rental company doesn't notice the damage. I'll update this review as needed.Pros: comfortable and clean room. Nice staff who checked me in at 11pm on a Tuesday. Cons: called for room service breakfast at 6:40 and 7am, and no one picked up to take my order after a good 1-2 minutes of ringing.  (The menu states room service starts at 6am) I pre-ordered 3 large bottles of  water ($2 each) to be in my room upon checking in, and there were two tiny bottles of Nestle water.  Lastly, when I woke in the morning I discovered there's a window A/C unit in my room. There's no central air/heat even though, oddly enough, there's a control on the wall.  But there are no air intake or returns in the room.  This wasn't a problem since the room temperature was fine, but worth noting for the review.If this hotel represents the Hilton Hotel brand, then Hilton is in trouble.  We are Diamond Hilton members and stayed on the Hilton Honors floor.  The room on this ""special"" floor was anything but special.  Good grief--I wonder what the non Honors rooms look like?The hall had a weird old stale cigarette smell.  In our room, the curtains did not match, did not close and had holes in them.  The HVAC had issues--we could not turn on the heat.  The room did not go above 63 degrees!  There were leak stains on the ceiling.  The windows were old and thin and you could hear everything from the street outside from our room on the 8th floor.We valet parked the car.  It took us 40 minutes to get our car.  While I was waiting, I noticed that the valet attendants left the car key rack/box unattended and wide open.  I could have had a field day stealing cars.  We decided to not valet park our car on the second night of our stay.  We let the front desk and the valet people know that we would not valet our car but it still showed up on the bill.  Frustrating.We asked if we could check out a day early.  This hotel is the pits and we wanted to move to another hotel in the city.  They told us there would be a $50 early checkout fee.  It was 9am when we asked.  I thought you had until 6pm to cancel.  Whatever.  So much for that Diamond status.The breakfast for the hotel was offered by the TGI Fridays adjacent to the hotel.  THAT restaurant was a disaster.  The hotel should be embarrassed to be affiliated with that restaurant.If you are in downtown Memphis, don't bother with this hotel.  The only good thing about it is the location.  Other than that, stay at The Peabody across the street.Nothing bad during my stay! I admit after reading some other reviews I was a bit nervous to book a room here! Service was great at every level. Let's talk about the parking situation. Valet only- yes pretty weird, however it works. Yes at 5pm I decided to circle the block a few times until the very small driveway had enough room for my tiny car. If you prefer to skip the whole scene, park at a nearby lot (I counted 6 reasonable lots within a very easy walk, even at the other Hilton property Hampton Inn) and just roll your luggage to this Doubletree. If you go valet, they are fast and friendly. . .don't be scared, Memphis is teeny-tiny. The room, nothing special but certainly nothing terrible. Noise- not an issue. I am a terribly light sleeper, on the 10th floor (Rm 1019 on a corner) and didn't hear anyone ever. Not a great view (but who cares, Memphis is not known for its skyline!).The room was acceptably clean and well maintained. (Here during a tremendous heatwave the AC was able to keep up while in the 100's outside). Even with the parking issues I like this location more than the other Hilton property downtown Hampton Inn. You sleep in a hotel but otherwise go outside and listen to some great Memphis music! (This review applies to International travelers, very good safe location and Memphis is super hospitable to Euro travelers. . .yes even you Brits ; ) )Spent the weekend in Memphis, Tennessee for a conference. I cheated on Marriott, it was worth it for the cookies. I'm just kidding, but the cookies at check-in are delicious. All of the front desk staff were friendly and very accommodating.  We were given our breakfast buffet coupons and when we needed a cab they had our driver there before we even got off the elevator.I like the location of this hotel because it's so conveniently located to Memphis Cook Convention Center and also to Beale Street. When I called down to the front desk about toiletries that I had forgotten, I was just about to offer to go downstairs to pick them up when the clerk told me it would be delivered right up. And it was, there was a knock on the door from housekeeping in less than 3 minutes. Excellent service all the way. The only disappointment was Sunday breakfast in the TGIF. Our used plates were never cleared and the coffee was never refreshed. I like this hotel and would stay again.Terrible service! After staying here for every week for 3 years straight, my misfortune that I was stuck in the Hospital and wanted to extend the room for the family, but was turned down because of "" March Madness"". 3 years of putting up with ""bad rooms, cockroaches in the roomFor a doubletree I was kind of disappointed. The room was kind of falling apart. From the blinds not opening to the hole in the closet door. The floor was sticky. The positive is its down the block from beale street. The only block with entertainment it seems and the hotel lobby isn't too bad. Staff was nice. Just had problems with third party booking with this hotel. If I had to stay in Memphis again (which I probably wont) i don't think I would stay here.This hotel has a pretty lobby and friendly staff, but the rooms are run down and not well kept. The house keeping is what really lacks here: mirror has smears, there are stains on the wall, stains on the bathroom door, and scary mold or dirt in the shower tile grout. I want to stay in a clean room with no sign of anyone there before me.At the price point it's OK. The desk staff were welcoming and courteous. Housekeeping people could not have been nicer to us. Warm cookies were lovely. Valets were fairly prompt.  I thought that the HHonors app was pretty nice the way it lets you choose your room like a seat on a plane. And the confirmations and info by email all great. The location is great. Essentially same convenience as when staying at the Peabody at about a third of the price. Much more convenient than the Madison, which is only a few blocks away but seems isolated from the restaurants, etc.  Short walking distance from Tamp &amp; Tap, which is a huge deal for coffee people.Room was clean. Re-purposed historic building, so some rooms have lots of windows, which is cool.  The historic facade rebuilt in the lobby was cool.  We aren't really TGI Fridays people so didn't check out the morning breakfast buffet but it looked OK. This property caters to a younger clientele than the Peabody across the street, so the service level is going to be different. In the porte-cochere you're more often than not seeing people unloading and loading their luggage themselves. Also, on a Saturday night, the lobby can be rather boisterous at times. Parking: $22 per day is just wrong. I'll tip the valet. But $22?  Yeah I get it that this extortion is common throughout downtown Memphis. But this ain't SF  or NYC.  That it's widespread doesn't make it right. It's not that desirable to be down there. If the public garage operators lowered their day prices to 10 you might see a renaissance of interest by the locals who don't like to go down there now because of astronomical parking rates. I suspect that those structures would be filled.Lighting.  Some of the wood blinds in the room appear to have been intentionally disabled so that they could not be raised. I need natural light. Especially in this era of ugly blindness-inducing fluorescent bulbs. My God how I detest CFL lighting. Especially first-generation. I get all stabby. Like the rats in the famous experiment with yellow and pink fluorescent tubes back in the 60s.  If this is the future, it's going to be a dim dystopian one indeed. And the lobby. Come on. It's the best feature of the hotel.  I really wish that the lobby was lit in something other than cold-blue CFL. The lobby and public areas are attractive and the designer's work is just ravaged by ugly cold lighting. I get that there is an energy saving connected with those hellish lights, but must people never come first in this brave new world? I had the same complaint about the Westin Beale St. so you're in good company.Noise.  I asked for and got room 433, which overlooks the ball park and the intersection of Union and Third. Cool idea in concept. Never again. Go for the highest floor available. Something higher than 7.  This is a historic building so not soundproofed the way a new property might be. So, OK.  Just be aware that if one tries to work in a low-floor room during the day, one learns very quickly that Beale Street is visited predominantly by Harley riders and fools in exhaust-mod pickups both of whom feel the burning need to rev engine three to four times during the stop light and then burn out when it changes to green.  And they all head out of town down Union St.  The windows don't block out that noise, so just be aware.Working in the hotel: This place is fine for partiers, vacationers and casual visitors.  I would not stay here again if I needed to work in the room. I had to work this weekend but was really frustrated by weak wireless. No ethernet connections.  At all. There was a prop ethernet connection on the desk. It was a prop because it was not connected to anything.  Wireless was so weak in the lobby and in the room that the signal was crowded out by the much stronger ones from other users' hotspots and the Holiday Inn across the street. We were dropped every two minutes.  I had to connect through my iPhone to get usable vpn.  I walked around looking for signal and found that it was very strong on 10, but there were only rooms up there so, if you have to work try to get a room on 10, or go to Tamp &amp; Tap.Finally, I think that the Hilton flag implies a little higher standard of physical plant upkeep. Light fixture in bathroom had come undone from its anchors and was drooping down over the sink; Windows were filthy on the outside, really smeared and covered in grime.  Wireless strength needs to be punched up. The A/C is really loud. It vibrates at a low frequency,  Until I realized what it was, I thought they were sanding a wood floor upstairs.Lets start off, its not a terrible hotel. On the plus side, its in a super great location right downtown Memphis and across from the ballpark and the Peabody hotel. the lobby is very nice and I personally found the desk staff and valet parking folks very helpful and cheerful.On the down side, the A/C-Heater in my room as pretty noisy and the room was only just clean enough. the room size was good and the rooms all seemed to have what you'd expect from a Hilton. The TFIG Fridays that in the lower level of the hotel is pretty terrible and although it hard to believe, breakfast was at best mediocre, for sure not worth the $12 for the buffet, better choices can be found nearby. Be warned, DO NOT TAKE A ROOM THAT FACES SOUTH unless you want to keep the window blinds closed tight all night, there is a giant LED sign that flashes all night long across the parking lot and its super annoying.I stayed here for a business trip so the price did not sting too much, but if I had the choice, I'd have stayed at the Peabody.Disappointment is the only word I can use to describe this Doubletree.  As I walked into the lobby I grew excited because it looked like a really nice hotel. When I got to my room the disappointment grew with every step I took into the room. From the bathroom that we in need of a good cleaning (rust) to the doors and walls needing fresh paint. It was just one let down after another. To make matters worse for those of us business travelers beware. There is NO desk in the rooms in which to work on. The resturant (TGI Fridays) attached to the hotel is HORRIBLE. Bad food, worse service, and even worse attitudes by employees.The lobby is decent, the staff is friendly, but my room was awful. There wasn't enough light in the room, the blinds were broken, the curtains didn't close, I was in the 3rd floor and all night I heard the drunk people walking on the street, the cars passing by, the outlets in the bathroom were crooked, the bathroom door didn't close... What a nightmare! I basically could not sleep in 3 days... Don't stay here!I will kind of echo a lot of reviews posted about this hotel.The location is great . The staff is great. The room is spacious and clean. The cost is high and it's not that special of a place. I would stay here again only if rates weren't as high. I don't think you get what you pay for here. The only extras we got were 2 cookies when we arrived and 2 free glasses of wine on second night of stay.We were very disappointed in this property, for a variety of reasons. I will say that the valet &amp; bellmen were spot on when we arrived &amp; the front desk staff were so friendly &amp; helpful. It's definitely these 2 groups that earned the 1 star I gave. We were there on business and took a client out to dinner &amp; came back to the hotel lobby to have a drink and wrap up. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel was remodeling so their bar was set up in the lobby, along with the only entrance to the restaurant. There was a girl who was obviously inebriated being given drinks by security &amp; talking loudly and obnoxiously to everyone walking through the front door. She caused more than one scene throughout the hour we set there and was finally escorted out after she dropped a glass on the floor. (The one security had given her minutes before.) I was embarrassed that we had brought anyone here on business, much less that this was where we were staying for 3 days.The walls are PAPER THIN. Our neighbor rocked out on Beale Street his first night in town &amp; I could hear him crying around the next morning on the phone. However, just to paint a solid picture of how thin the walls are, I could also hear the woman he was talking to clearly &amp; she wasn't on speakerphone.Housekeeping skipped our room on the first day &amp; on the day we left, it had begun raining sometime in the night &amp; a waterfall had commenced in the downstairs hallway from a leaking ceiling. Nobody seemed concerned about it either. I was glad we were getting out of there. The room was dimly lit &amp; the curtains wouldn't close all the way, so the morning sun was sure to get you up with it. The shower dripped so much that there was a constant puddle in front of the tub.I hope we never have to stay here again. Ever.Nice use of existing building in the lobby for a great architectural aspect. Paid valet is a down side for me. Location is great.Easily one of the worst Doubletree/Hilton-affliated hotels I've stayed in. I've been to other Doubletrees in the country and they have always been awesome experiences so I was excited to find out we would be spending a weekend here. However, I was left very disappointed. The only reason this place deserves a star is thanks to its location. Conveniently right in the middle of downtown Memphis, this hotel is across the street from Autozone Park, the Peabody and the Children's museum. Only a few short walkable blocks from the very popular Beale Street and Sun Studio . Also the staff was very courteous and accommodating but they could not make up for the shortcomings of this hotel. As expected, DoubleTree typically charges for parking, but I found the $22 required valet parking to be very excessive in a city with plenty of parking areas and generally very uncrowded. The lobby was maintained very well but unfortunately that did not translate to nice rooms. The first room we stayed in was a very cramped standard room with an awful smell that just lingered. No personal fridge was available. There is a $15 buffet breakfast option located at the TGIFridays within the hotel. From what my friend told me, the selection was not very good and nothing tasted fresh. Now, what completely grossed me out of this place was when we were moved to a King room and found a huge yellow stain on the comforter. It was NOT something you could easily overlook. After staying in two different style rooms here, it appears they need to renovate with a fresh coat of paint and deep clean the carpets. This place just did not live up to Hilton-standards and my overall stay was very unpleasant. Would not recommend.A little dated and overall cleanliness needs to be improved.  Valets were great.  TGIF attached is dirty and service is poor.  Only had breakfast there and would not recommend it.Good locationGreat hotel. Service at the front desk, at valet and at breakfast was friendly, pleasant and helpful. My traveling companion is an Honors member, so that may be why we had nice service but he can be a pokey lil Honors guy, asking for corner rooms, upgrades, free water, rollout beds, free breakfast, more free breakfast, etc.. and still. Great time.It's right on the main road in to downtown Memphis, just a few blocks from Sun Studios (wow!!), next door to The Peabody (see the ducks!!), attached to a TV I FRIDAYS and across from Denny's, and across from the minor league stadium. Oh wait there's more. It's a two block w alkaline to Beale Street, FedEx Forum, and Rendezvous Ribs. Score!There is valet parking, but it's expensive: I think over $20 a day. And this was the day before the big concert at FEDEX.  The morning buffet breakfast and omelet station take place in TGIFridays. More great service and a ton of delicious breakfast basics: multiple eggs, multiple sausages and bacons, cereal, bagels, a toaster, etc.The Hotel Atmosphere and lobby are rad. Definitely recommend staying here.DoubleTree's always have good service, but the staff here is exceptional! Very nice and accommodating.","Refused to make us an omelet with real butter. I offered to get him some from another part of the restaurant and he refused. I was denied the right to safe and healthy food.  Not to mention the poor attitude and lack of hospitality.The staff varies greatly as evidenced above. Good location. Valet parking is $22.My friends father, hooked my crew up with a hotel room here, for our first night in Memphis.  The room, though we were not there long, (stayed up pretty late on Beale street and riding around Midtown) was great!  I wish we could have stayed here the whole week but we had to leave after one night!  The staff were all super polite asking us how our day was, and they even had an awesome piano player playing awesome Jazz/Blues Standards in the lobby when we arrived!  The location of this hotel is 2nd to none, right across the street from the Memphis Red Birds Stadium, a couple blocks from Beale, and within walking distance of Sun Studios!  If you are going to stay down town Memphis, I would reccamend the Doubletree to anyone!Fairly safe place to stay in downtown. I was given accommodation here during my interview here. People always talk about the Peabody next door but this is a good hotel. Interesting thing is when you walk in, you will notice a wall with windows preserved from the original building. It gives a nice touch to the interior. I was very happy with the room service. They had live music in the evening. Happy hour was really something with drinks and live jazz. I would recommend this place to anyone who is staying here for a game, just want to walk to the night life or just enjoy Memphis.Not horrible, but would look elsewhere when visiting again.  Here's some things that I experienced that I felt were not typical for a Hilton. I added  a rooming partner to my reservation. I called and confirmed she was on the reservation since I was arriving very late after her.. When my room mate tried to  check in - she was informed she not listed on my room. She ended up having to show the front desk my email re: the confirmation as they had NO INFORMATION noted about her. The shower leaked (we could not shut it off) and had to call for maintenance (which came promptly). Also our room  (509) was very dimly lit.. we had to request extra lamps/ and a table. I tried to call for room service one night around 8:45 pm on 1/24 -   no one ever answered. I gave up and went out. The restaurant for breakfast was understaffed. I showed up Wed. trying to get a seat/find a menu - only one waitperson seemed to be working? It was IBC week - surely the hotel could have had another person working. I gave up and did not eat in the hotel at all  the entire week.This hotel is not what one would expect for a Hilton branded hotel, nor what you would expect paying $200 per night, nor what I expect as a Hilton Honors Member. We stayed 4 nights, Wednesday-Saturday for the IBC. When we arrived our room was OK, nothing special, and really needed a good cleaning. It wouldn't hurt to reattach the curtain rod to the wall either! Thursday housekeeping never came, I called down to the front desk and they did send up clean coffee cups and fresh towels. Friday, housekeeping never came. Called down and requested cleaning, towels, and coffee cups... None of that ever arrived.Saturday when we were headed out for the day, we stopped by the front desk and related our concerns and requested... Well maybe demanded... Housekeeping service. The lady at the front desk apologized and said that she would comp 2 days of valet parking for our troubles. And our room would be cleaned.Thank goodness our room was cleaned that day and we had fresh linens and cups. However, Sunday morning when we checked out our valet had not been comped and we didn't have time to wait for a manager to fix the problem. I did request a phone call... Which I still haven't received. Do yourself a favor and look into other hotels!I tend to judge hotels by their amenities. Their body stuff is lovely. The towels are plentiful and large. The pool is a hidden gem on the 2nd floor roof.There was nothing that stood out about this place.  My girlfriend booked it because of the pool.  The pool was nothing special, but during the day it was a very quiet place to chill out and have a drink or two before getting the day started.I'm with some others on here who think that, for roughly $200 per night, you should get a refrigerator....without having to pay extra.  Not so.  The room was your everyday standard room.  Nothing special about it.  If nothing else, it was very clean.Note to those going, do NOT get room 425.  The toilet runs forever, so unless you feel like playing the fun game of lifting the back top off of it and trying to use the handle to flip the little rubber cap back over the pipe drain so the thing will fill up again, make sure to avoid this room.  We were in the room, probably longer than most, recovering, recouping, etc., so this particular fact was noticeable.  By the time we realized what was going on, it didn't seem worth it to try and switch rooms.Oh yes, and as far as the WiFi, it's free, but it's awful.  It's not super important when you're in a great city like this, but if you need it for something, you can't count on it.The staff were very friendly and it's location is decent.  But for this kind of money, you could probably find a much better option.For the great expense of the rooms, which are not anything special, you'd think they wouldn't charge for amenities. Almost $200 a night, and you want another $15 from me for a refrigerator? No thanks!We checked out early and got a room near Graceland for almost 1/4 the price for a comparable room WITH a fridge and a microwave. The staff was nice enough, but this hotel's policy is not very appreciative of their guests' patronage.Extremely helpful and pleasant staff. The hotel is well appointed, room was clean and service was good.  We had a corner room and the windows were a little small. I would have also liked to have had a refrigerator in the room and when we arrived we could hear the TV in the next room. Maybe because it was an adjacent room and the sound was coming from the door.  But, the beds and pillows were comfortable.Pretty glad I booked this place to stay overnight as we were passing through Memphis. Hotel staff was really friendly, and of course the cookies were delicious (cookies are a thing now... you can rate hotels on their COOKIES)! Lobby was nice and felt safe. Yes, the valet parking is steep, but I assume they park your car in a secure garage, which means it's worth it. The actual room didn't feel too dated, was clean, but the biggest complaint I have is that the room was TINY! Really, really small. Probably another factor of the tiny room - the toilet was so loud, it could easily wake someone up. Great proximity to Beale St. We got there super late and were able to walk there. It was a little sketchy - but then *any* city after midnight can look a little sketchy. Never felt unsafe on the walk. The next morning, I walked alone to Beale St to buy some souvenirs, and it was super safe and touristy.Noisy room.  I stayed on 5th floor on the east side.  Rooms are ok, nothing fancy.  Good location but if staying here stay in a room on the south sideI love Doubletree Cookies with a passion!! Delicious! The best perk for staying at a Doubletree!This is a nice hotel, right across the street from the Peabody and in the heart of downtown Memphis. This hotel was very clean, modern with nice rooms. I didn't have any major problems or concerns when I stayed there. The only thing that really sucked was that they only had valet parking so you had to pay 20 bucks I believe per night and you couldn't have regular access to your car to get something you forgot. The staff was friendly and helpful, and it is only a 5 minute walk to Beale St.Great location within a short walk to Beale St., and across st., from the Peabody Hotel. Friendly staff.  However valet parking - - too long of a wait, rooms we're just ok, window blinds didn't work, very noisy to street traffic and bathroom needed lots of work.  Picture included of poor patch job on the wall by the tub.  And the worst part, now that we're home we both have large blotchy rashes over a large portion of our bodies...could that be BED BUGS?....I'm not sure what I can say negatively about the hotel (TGIF as the hotel restaurant was kind of lame, I guess).  The people there were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The lobby was very modern with a touch of classic (large brickwork structure) and had a cool glass elevator overlooking it.  The room was very clean and bed comfortable.  Not much more you could ask for! Oh, and they give warm cookies when you check-in, but that might be Double Trees everywhere.Stay here if you have no other choice.  Location is good for access to downtown but way to much money.  The staff is fantastic that's the biggest part of this hotel.Great location, nice lobby, great staff, mediocre rooms, terrible smell.I spent last week at this hotel and will not be going back. Every day after returning from a long day at the client the last thing I want is to be hit by a wave of stench on entering my hotel room. But that's what I experienced all last week.What did it smell like? It smelled like a combination of damp musty towels and dirty fishtank filter. Or maybe just a drainage ditch. Wait, I got it, it smelled like a gulf coast tidal pool at low tide on a hot day.So no matter how nice the bed was (and it was really nice) or how excellently the air conditioning turned the room into a meat locker (and it really did), every time you would go near the bathroom the stench was almost enough to make you retch. And I'm not alone in this, three of my peers all had the same experience, although they also complained about the rooms being dirty in different ways.So that's four of us that will be staying at the Courtyard by Marriot on subsequent trips to Memphis. And I will be advising my other coworkers to do the same if they end up visiting Memphis.Oh, one other thing... I was not driving this trip, but if I was I would have to mention the entirely too small valet/parking area in front of the hotel. It's the size of a postage stamp.Compared to other hotels &amp; other Doubletrees, this one needs a facelift, dye job, and SPANX!!! Good:The beds were comfy - no complaints there. :-)The A/C works well!Free cable (obvious)They have a complimentary happy hour for Hilton honors members. If your not a member, sign up! It's free &amp; u earn points for hotel stays or goods. from 5:30-6:30 p.m. which is pretty sweet.Normal check-out is 11 a.m. &amp; late check out is 12 p.m.Right next to the Peabody &amp; Baseball Stadium.Within walking distance to restaurants, bars, and a couple little stores.  Do not go to Beale street alone at night, women.There's a mediocre chain restaurant (Friday's) connected to the hotel.Neutral:Stairwell is in a weird location - u kinda walk into the back of the kitchen (right next to elevators) &amp; then to the right.Free computer use in lobby - only thing is that the monitors face EVERYONE!Bad:Bathroom was annoying - toilet had flushing issues. No complimentary breakfast. Poop heads! j/k, I'm not name calling! :-PYou can hear the motorcycles driving around late at night on Wednesday nights.When I am in the Memphis area (which is often) and don't crash a friends couch I stay here.Great Location to do some day drinking on Beale Street.Three blocks to the Main Street Trolley.TGI Friday's on the premises.Peabody Hotel is right across the street so you can go see the ducks at 11AM or 5PM.DoubleTree Cookies-YUM!The rooms are roomy and decent. I didn't get this smell everyone seemed to get when they walked in their room.Staff was friendly and got us checked in fast.Just an overall solid hotel.Hotel was nice, but fairly expensive. Didn't think hotel staff was that helpful. Requested towels (when housekeeping failed to leave enough) and waited over an hour. There was construction going on in the lot next door which woke us up about 5:30 am. Staff didn't really help explain parking or other amenities. Best part about the hotel was its proximity to Beale Street.Clean and comfortable and in a great location. We had no problems with the room. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The lobby is beautifully styled and seems recently renovated, however the upstairs rooms are a little shabbier, with faded walls and carpets. Nothing terrible, but could definitely use a pick-me-up to match the lobby. Free cookies upon check in, and valet parking (for a fee). The TGIF hotel restaurant seemed atrocious though why would you eat there when Beale st is a two minute walk away! In fact, it's the location that bumps this up from 3 stars to 4 for me.","This is a very good hotel. nice room, great staff, perfect location and nice amenities. Its really hard to fault this hotel. Security is present 24 hours which is a good thing, but they spend a lot of their time indoors instead of just on the perimeter which is where it needs to be. I had a few issues checking in, which the lock on my door did not work but they sent someone up pronto to fix it. the other problem was that they didn't give me my breakfast coupons and should have known I was part of the group on check in. Still thouhgh Staff is wonderful. Everyone from the TGIF staff in the restaurant, to the house keeping to the bell man. Lobby is great and there is happy hour and breakfast each morning. Free internet all throughout the hotelYou are literally 20 steps from the Peabody, a few more steps to Beale and Rendezvous, basically, anywhere downtown you need to go you can walk in 10 min or less. Cant fault this hotel at all. They have a sign out front that says ""Parking, only $22 a day"" Really? ONLY? Stay a this double tree if your travels take you to downtown Memphis. You will be glad you stayed here over the Peabody next doorWell... this hotel certainly has improved my Tennessee work trip! Though I suspect my contacting the hotel and posting on Yelp and Twitter helped. Either way.... for the moment, I'm still happy I became a Hilton HHonors member and ditched Marriott Rewards (despite my status, but no biggie, I travel so much I'll be an HHonors Diamond member by October. Back to the hotel... it's pretty fabulous. Literally every single person who's passed us has welcomed us and asked how our stay is... southern hospitality or cranky travel writer perks? Either way... it's nice. It was easy to get to the hotel and parking was fairly easy, once I flagged down a valet (took about 15 minutes). The location is IDEAL, for visiting downtown Memphis. Beale Street is just 3 blocks away... and very walkable. The hotel allowed us to check in around 1pm, which was much appreciated and we're perched in a HUGE room on the 10th floor (top floor and an HHonors floor). The lobby is very grand and has a very cool vibe to it. They have comfy sofa's and a piano, along with some cool art work. Also attached to the hotel is a TGIFridays. I'm not a fan of the chain, but it's convenient for a snack or a drink. Our room is VERY spacious, VERY clean and nice and cool (making it a nice respite for the humid streets of downtown Memphis... it may be April, but it feels like July). We have tall ceilings and a view of the baseball stadium. Our bathroom is quite spacious with a separate tub and shower. Much nicer looking that your standard hotel room bathroom and appointed with some cool Memphis posters. We took a stroll to Beale Street right after checking in, and came back to a surprise.... our blinds were open (I had tried to open them, but they were broken, I didn't complain because it wasn't a big deal)... but apparently they just knew and fixed them. Our carpet was also wet, which was alarming... we called maintenance and Rome came up to investigate. Funny enough he'd said hello to us as we were walking back from Beale. He let us know they came in to deep clean our carpets while we were gone. A little weird... but OK. Rome left and came back a few minutes later with a little goody bag for the ""inconvenience""... it hardly was one, we were just concerned there might be a leak. Either way it was a nice gesture and Rome was very friendly. All in all the experience here at the DoubleTree by Hilton Memphis Downtown has exceeded my expectations and has left me impressed with the brand. A real ""save"" from my last two nights at the DoubleTree in Jackson, TN. If you're looking for a nice hotel with friendly service in a great downtown Memphis location, look no further than the DoubleTree by Hilton Memphis Downtown! You can tell them the Snob sent you :)Now, I'll just cross my fingers that the rest of my Hilton stays emulate THIS level of service... Homewood Suites in Cannonsburg, PA for three days next week and Hilton SF Airport Bayfront the week following (and pretty much every week after that in various locations across the US until October 2012).I came to Memphis with a group of friends, primarily to see a Memphis Redbirds game. The Doubletree is directly across the street from the Redbirds' stadium, plus they offer ticket packages if you book directly with them. It's also an easy walk to Beale, tons of restaurants, FedEx Arena, etc. Our room was very clean and we had plenty of room for four adults. The cherry on top was the hotel staff; Sheila was so accommodating at the front desk, Willie (bell hop) was so helpful and even filled our cooler with ice, and Janae (marketing) went out of her way to make our stay pleasant. We'll definitely be back!I have always been a fan of the Hilton chain and I am a Hilton Honors Member.  The best description I can give this place is that it is located close to Beale street and the customer service was very good but our room was horrible.The bathroom door was kept together by nuts and bolts holding the panels to the door. The hotel is loud with TGI Fridays attached to the lobby with the hostess yelling out for names on the waiting list.There was a college fraternity in many of the rooms and it seems the management and hotel security did nothing to control their behavior.Very disappointed and will stay at the Peabody on my next visit to this great town.I won't stay here again. It didn't feel up to par with the classy Doubletree I'm used to experiencing.Pluses: attentive, friendly, polite valet and desk clerkMinuses: ambiance and valueWhen I checked in, my room wreaked of cigarette smoke and my eyes started itching immediately. The bathroom sink would not drain. While this was annoying, the hotel agreed this was unacceptable and moved me to a room with no smoke odor and a working sink.If you're looking for friendly hotel staff alone, then stay here.I want a great room and posh experience from 3.5-5 star hotels. This was more 2.5 than 3.5. Maybe a 3 star hotel but bit shouldn't be a 3.5.Next time I'm going back across the street to The Peabody.  Don't care if it costs more.I booked this place very last minute for one night at the government rate of $93 (total $107).  People who work here are friendly and helpful.  The room was not big but acceptable.  I found the beds with lots of pillows pretty comfortable to sleep on.  The bathroom was also not spacious but in a good condition.  Amenities were lacking but you can call to get whatever missing.  The location is definitely the best!!  I would be a returning customer if I ever go to Memphis again.Very slow and angry service.  I was very calm and nice during my 20 minute check in process.  There were 3 of us in line and one of us was being checked in.... 20 minutes.  No ""sorry"" for the delay but just a pissed off attitude.  It turns out I was telling her sorry the management left her with all this work.  She said ""yeah, it always turns out this way"".  Here I am being the hospitality toward the person in the hospitality industry.The bar... well.. more of the same. I'm not looking to be coddled and fawned over but the service was ""angry"".Bed was nice and they have ESPN U.  Upon checkin she let me know of the breakfast and that ""...it is not complimentary"".  I said ""Pardon?""  She said ""Breakfast isn't part"" of the package....The hotel was great but if you use you honor points for a free room you will be treated as a 4th class customer.  Got there at 1:00..Valet said ""no issue- your room will be ready by 2:30!  Came back at 2:30 and made me wait until 4:00 just because.  Saw 7 other people check in - I guess they were not using points.  To me 4:00 is ridiculous for a check in time in the first place.  I travel every week and NEVER have to wait past 2:00.  But then again- I was a paying customer.  Not a very customer first type of operation that is for sure.This was our second and third trips to the Doubletree in downtown Memphis.  We stayed there on our way through from Chicago to Dallas and then on our way back a week later.  We previously stayed there 2 years ago and had no complaints.  I love the location.  Maybe because we're from Chicago but walking around at night down there was not an issue for us at all.  We walked to Beale Street, we walked around, we walked to the market a couple blocks away.  It's a really central location and super convenient.  The one down side is easily the parking.  $24 a night is steep.  Yeah, it's nice to have valet but I would rather pay like $10-$12 and have to park it myself.  But, whatever, we got a decent room rate so we couldn't complain much.  The staff at the front desk were super pleasant every time we had reason to speak with them.  Love the Doubletree, it's our go-to hotel when we're staying in Memphis.Stayed here for 2 nights and kept visiting the Peabody next door wishing we were staying there! Let me start by saying the staff here is very helpful and friendly. However, the rooms are small, and just not super clean, look clean on the surface, but the baseboards, corners, are dirty. Our air exchange was very noisy so we turned it off. Our room faced the Peabody hotel and what looks like their loading dock. One morning I was woken up at 4:45 AM, across the street by the loading dock a man was throwing palletts into a truck making god awful noise for quite some time. So , guess the rooms/windows are not well insulated. Would love to stay next door at the Peabody if we visit Memphis again...sorry. Oh, and called the front desk as we did not have a clock radio in the room...never arrived.Cookies are epic. I prefer the residence inn.  However if they are booked the Doubletree is always my 3rd choice. In Dwntown Memphis areaIn town for a concert and was very disappointed in the length of time to check in. The staff running the front desk seemed to be in slow motion. When it was my turn, to find out that my room was not ready did not make me happy. It was 6pm. Late check out? That makes no sense to me. Rooms should be ready by 3pm. We greeted housekeeping as she was leaving the room after insisting we be allowed to take up our luggage because we needed to head out to the concert. The room was ok, dated a bit. I would have preferred a comfortable couch versus two chairs in the living area and two in the bedroom. It was nice that the suite had two full bathrooms. The one attached to the bedroom was spacious except for counter space, it basically had none. I hate that. Getting ready and washing your hands or washing your face just gets everything wet. On the plus side, the bed was ok, valet was quick, the shower had great water pressure and got steamy hot, the AC worked wonderfully-like an icebox and its a great location, just a block off Beale.Best hotel to be location-wise if you plan to stay in downtown Memphis on vacation. Walking distance of everything! Free cookies and nice staff. Only downside: no airport shuttle. I booked the hotel through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a>Stay here when visiting downtown Memphis!OK is the best I can do...   We were traveling to Memphis on the motorcycle to experience what the city had to offer (i.e. Beale Street, Blues, Graceland, Etc..)  We specifically chose the Doubletree due to our previous experience while traveling last summer.Two factors kept this review from being a 4: #1 - the parking garage, unlike the other comments, I noticed that parking was going to cost extra, it is clearly stated on their website, and I was also pleasantly surprised that motorcycle parking is 1/2 price of a car (which makes sense when you consider you can park them in less space).  The problem is the garage is a MESS (you won't see this if you just have the valet park your car).  There are some great opportunities to utilize some unparkable space, but you have to move the trash people!!!  There was old carpet, boxes, and most disturbing SHEET METAL SCREWS on the ground where they wanted us to park the bikes.    How much trouble would it be to spend some quality time cleaning up the place.#2- no shampoo.  Not a big deal if you know that ahead of time, but when you are traveling very light on a motorcycle, you only bring what you need, and when you expect shampoo, and they don't have it (and when you call the desk you get a myriad of excuses).If the location and the quality of the rooms were not of normal doubletree standard, this would have rated a 2.  If I go back, I will be trying another of multiple options in the area.Proximity to Beale Street gives it the third star, otherwise it'd only be a 2-star. The lobby is nice with a pianist playing. The staff is super nice and cordial. The rooms are clean and quiet, but the hallways need updating. The gym is TINY and a bit smelly. Their dumbbells have rubber grips which make them slippery and dangerous. The treadmill was broken AND had a towel under one of the foot pods to even it out. It was too cold to check out the pool so no comment there. The only parking they have is valet so prepare to pay about $20/night unless you want to chance it in a nearby open lot. The TGIF (accessibly via the lobby) is the room service provider.A lazy, second rate Doubletree. I've been to many and this one is moldy and the service is sub-par to say the least. When it comes to downtown Memphis hotels, there have to be better stays. When I visit again, the Doubletree will not be my option.Rooms were in disrepair, no hot water, bad location. The staff was responsive and pleasant to me however. The hotel desperately needs updated.Beautiful lobby but pool was closed.  Our toilet didn't work and we changed rooms and got a dinner voucher. The town was nice and we would go back.For the price we paid, about $200/night, what we got was less than what we expected.  First, on the positive side, the location was excellent: very easy to walk to Beale St.  And the room was spacious and well tended.  However, the service here was never friendly or proactive.  Asking for something seems to provoke annoyance rather than friendliness, and, even once you ask for help, only the minimum possible response/action is provided.  For this price, I would seek better value elsewhere.The location near Beale Street is ideal for walking around Memphis. The rooms are new and contemporary with Internet access. The addition of the Fridays that is attached is nice for socializing while on business. Plus, all you can eat warm cookies. I'm in! There is no parking other valet which is a little annoying.","The lobby of this hotel is beautiful -- but I wish they would have spent some of the money on the rooms. While it didn't necessarily feel dirty, the room was dilapidated. The carpet was stained, the ceiling in the bathroom was brown and sagging, and the stopper in the bathtub was broken so it kept falling closed. Yes, these are little things, but they do make a difference. No free breakfast here, which was a surprise as all of the other Hilton hotels we stayed at on this trip offered it complementary. Apparently there was a Hilton Honors member happy hour, but we were not told about it at check in, and when we asked about it in the restaurant (TGI Friday's), no one knew what we were talking about (even though there was sign right outside the entrance). Does anyone else find it strange that the ""famous"" DoubleTree cookies all have nuts? Ours went in the trash...By in large, this hotel is ok, but the one killer is the very loud AC unit in every room. It woke me up three times the first night and twice the second night. Since the key feature of a hotel room is usually to provide you a good night's sleep, I can't give this place a very good score.I didn't notice it the first night, but on the second night, the room was musty. The drop ceiling over the entrance looked like it could cave in any second. I felt like Indiana Jones dodging into my room to avoid the impending cave in.By in large, the rest of this hotel is fine, but it was hard to get drink vouchers for the free cocktail hour.Great location... just a couple of blocks from Beale.  TGI Fridays attached.  Rooms just ok.  Pool was closed.  No maid service the day we were there.I really can't understand the poor reviews of this place. The rooms were fine, the building was nice, and the location is fantastic. Within walking distance of any place you'd want to go in the city. Yes, I did notice staining and wear on the carpet in the hallway, but I could have cared less. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this place again. Even if there were more stains in the hallway.We booked this the weekend before Thanksgiving for $99 a night on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>... and I was not disappointed. Yeah, the extra fee for the valet sucked. But it was valet. Yeah, there is a Greyhound bus station across the street. But I didn't pick this hotel to just sit outside all night. We picked it because we could walk to Beale Street. A nice, short walk. Super convenient. We had no problem checking in. No line and had a room within 5 minutes of stepping up to the counter. The beds were comfy. The room was clean and updated. Do I just have lower standards than everyone else here? Maybe. But we were pleased with the room. My one complaint... it took FOREVER to get our car back from valet when we checked out. Check out early and avoid the nonsense.Okay, so the room I stayed in (two double beds) was a bit dated and not as polished as I like- buy the staff and the ambience of the hotel make up for it. Friendly people, manager's reception (aka free beer), live piano until 8:30- overall a nice value. Tip: skip the TGI Fridays breakfast- over priced. Valet parking is $22/ day but the attendants are fast and nice.As a flight attendant, we don't have a choice where we stay, and our company puts us up here in Memphis.  Location, Location, Location...  This place has it going on.  This is a mid priced chain hotel.   If you want style and elegance, and pomp and circumstance  stay at the Peabody.  I like Double Tree because of the warm cookies you get upon check in.  The rooms have been renovated recently., and the amenities are a little better than average.  You get more than just shampoo and soap.  You also get facial cleanser and face lotion which is a nice touch.  The beds are rather comfortable.Historic building with a GREAT LOBBY....with a free HHonors Happy Hour.....located right across the street from an excellent AAA baseball team and park (make sure to go) and 2 blocks from Beale Street - which I think is WAY over rated.....can be a scary walk back to the hotel later at night.....Service was excellent at check in, I was in room #433 on a prepaid rate....room was large and bed was great....only issue was the bathroom is HOT - must be no a/c in there.....and the place is a little ""beat up"" but I believe that gives it charm.....Didn't take advantage of the breakfast - its served in a TGI Friday that is attached......but I liked the place....very quiet at night!Total - $136.50 + 12.63 + 6.83+2.32 taxes = $158.27I was able to Priceline this for for $72 so I really can't complain. However if I spent much more I would feel pretty cheated. The entire lobby and atrium was under renovation which was a bummer as I'm sure it would have looked cool otherwise. The waiting area downstairs as a result was very small and cramped. The room was nice but the bed was certainly not comfortable. On top of all that parking was $21 a night. In this area you best pay for parking and not go on the street. Who knows they may have just parked me on the street anyway. All I know is my car was covered in snow so it wasn't in a garage. I found the interior space nice and clean as expected but just not as nice as other doubletrees I have been to.Another stay in a cookie cutter corporate hotel. The good:Great location (I could see the outfield of the baseball stadium from my window);Comfortable bed;Powerful air conditioning (every day I was there the mercury was 90 to 100);Decent water pressure and toiletries.The computers seem to have been upgraded in the business center (they were fast)The bad:Poky front desk service when I was checking in;Peeling wallpaper in the bathroom;Scattered bleach stains across the carpet just outside my door.If my travels take me to Memphis again, I might consider a second stay.Perfect location in downtown Memphis. Safe distrance from Beale Street. And across from a Denny's for a late night treat.The rooms were nice and clean. And the service, for the most part, was really good.Room service is TGI Friday's full menu.Would definitely stay again.The only reason I won't tag a ""five stars"" on here is because their hotel lobby bar is a TGI Fridays - not my idea of a good time. I feel like they could venture out a bit with that, or at least add a little stand-alone bar in the lobby. Other than that, everything was lovely. The staff was very polite and friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The lobby is spacious. The location is excellent. We were within walking distance to Beale Street and a lot of fun bars and restaurants South of Beale. The hotel is next to a Greyhound station, which can bring about some creepy characters (not judging! just stating the facts!). When we were unloading our car we were immediately approached by someone begging for money. Living in New Orleans, we are used to things like this, but I could see how someone might be freaked out or feel uncomfortable.On the bright side, the Doubletree is located directly across the street from the famed Peabody Hotel so you can walk right over at 11 a.m. to see the ducks walk the red carpet into their fountain (all without the ridiculous price tag of the Peabody Hotel!)Great location.  Great staff.  Wonder if cleaning staff actually knows how to clean.  Bathroom was disgusting. The walls in bathroom needed a soap and water cleaning. Filth from previous guests everywhere. Gross.  Mirror in closet was disgusting. Curtain rod was broke, blinds were broke and tv kept turning its self off.  Glad we got such a great rate and only stayed one night.Location is all this place has. Room is small, dark, but clean.  Was guaranteed a nonsmoking king which was not available when I arrived.  They did however offer a double bed, handicap accessible room (no tub).  Halls are hot and carpets very dirty, and look like they should have been replaced years ago.  The hallways seem to have no air conditioning - you can work up a sweat just waiting for the slow elevators.  The hotel is right next to they Greyhound bus station, and I was woke up several nights by patrons arguing on the street below, as well as several hours of loud cars passing by each evening.  Not sure I'd stay here again, there has to be better options for the price.We stayed there over spring break.  It is close to everything.  The free breakfast buffet at TGIFridays was very good.  Beale Street is about 2 blocks away and the FedEx Forum is only a little bit further.  The rooms are roomy and the staff is friendly.  We had a great time and I wouldn't hesitate to stay ther again.The Doubletree Downtown definitely has the location, but not much more. My room had a view of the Greyhound station and bright lights from the baseball stadium were piercing through the broken curtains of my window. The room overall was comfortable, but the AC unit was loud. The joint operation with TGI Friday's is not good for the hotel. Really- who wants to eat at Friday's for breakfast (or at all?) Parking will run $15/day and they must park the car far away because it takes a while to get it. So I recommend calling ahead to get your car in the morning if you are in a hurry. Bottom line: I think the hotel is overpriced for what you get.Very pleasant place to stay. I've stayed at a couple throughout the United States and have always had an ejoyable experience. Close to everything downtown. Not to sound redundant to all the other reviews but yes gotta love the cookies.I ended up staying at this hotel after being stranded in Memphis during one of Chicago's recent spring snowstorms.  The location of the hotel was excellent, walking distance from Beale Street but far enough from the noise and across the street from the Peabody Hotel.I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the hotel and quality of the rooms.  First, their business center was pretty crappy.  They had two incredibly slow computers.  The rooms were pretty shabby.  The walls were paper thin and the room looked kind of old.  Overall pretty low quality for a Hilton hotel.  I was pretty disappointed and will just stay at a neighboring Marriott next time.Very nice staff. Even got a free tix to a Redbird game (just for asking). Parking at valet for $22 is only option. Ask for a corner room if your a HH member. OH and amazing govt rate.Location is great, and the building is very neat (modern rooms in an old building).  Staff is great, etc...I'm a financially-driven traveler, and this was worth every penny.","The good: Is right near Beale St., the ballpark, and a lot of happening places. The rooms are nice, beautiful fascade when you walk in, and you gotta love cookies with the room.The bad: internet connection clocked in at the slowest wireless I've ever seen (ex. I bought an episode on iTunes, and it was going to take 23 hours to download....yikes). The staff didn't know what an ethernet cable was, and said they couldn't give me a receipt for my room after checking out since I booked with Hotwire (? maybe this is legit, just seems weird).For the price &amp; the fuss, I'd still go here again.I'm a frequent business traveler to Memphis and stay at most of the better Hilton properties in the city on a regular basis.  Of the major hotels, the two Doubletrees in Memphis are unfortunately at the bottom of the list.  The downtown Doubletree has a very modern and smart interior, with a very cool historic building facade making up one of the atrium walls.  The rooms, however, are small, dark, and often in various states of disrepair.  Stained walls, ceilings, and carpets are the norm, as well as ragged fixtures and appointments (the room I was in while I wrote this had a shower curtain torn down the middle).  The worst part of this hotel is definitely it's parking, which is valet only.  On workday mornings there is frequently a 15-30 minute wait around 8am, which made the Doubletree impractical for me until we discovered that parking on the street next to the hotel is free at night.  The best part of the hotel is obviously it's downtown location, which is somewhat of a saving grace given the disappointing choice of TGI Friday's as the hotel's anchor restaurant.  I'd suggest walking a few streets over to Monroe St and dining at Flight or McEwen's.  If you can help it, stay somewhere else instead, such as the Hilton in East Memphis (my favorite) or the new Hampton Inn on Beale Street, which I've heard is very good.boyfriend &amp; i stayed here for 2 nights/3 days 2nd wk of this june.did not have a rental car so am unable to review their valet service.however, the service elsewhere we recieved was amazing.impeccable bed/ bath rooms..&amp; the daily housekeeping did a great job.neutrogena sundries.wolfgang puck coffee &amp; coffee mate creamer.(only 1 regular coffee packet though.. but im sure if i would have requested more, i would have gotten them!)the staff members that held our luggage while we waited for check in time were very polite &amp; professional.the front desk associates were also great.for example, we arrived around 9 am &amp; check in time is not until 3 p.m but the lady at the desk said she would call us if a room opened up, &amp; alas, we were called before noon to let us know our room was ready!&amp; on our last day, our return flight departed at 7 pm &amp; check out time is at noon, &amp; guess what?we were allowed to stay until 3 p.m!the lobby is spacious &amp; comfy &amp; stylishly decorated.the elevators big &amp; clean.the pool is very small!&amp; only 2 tables!&amp; 3 reclining lounges!but no problem.. i can barely swim anyway!but i was able to sun bathe in the southern sun for a couple of hours with no problem!&amp; their complimentary pool towels were always stocked..the adjacent restaurant is unfortunately, a TGI Fridays (for those of you who are not familiar with this chain of restaurants, it is like a Dennys w/ a full bar) but they are open untill 1 a.m on fri &amp; sat nights, so thats good if you want to take some food to go up to your room.though we did not use room service, i did peek at the menu, &amp; their food items are reasonably priced ($10 or so for a burger &amp; fries) &amp; the charge is $3 plus a 20% gratuity.. that is a lot less than the Hiltons we've stayed at !all in all, we were very pleased with this hotel.NO rude staff at all.in fact, we were greeted by chipper ""good mornings!"" by about 3 different associates just from the short walk from our room to the elevator!the rooms were a tad bit small (the ottoman was strangely placed between the bed &amp; the chair, so if you are kind of on the bigger side, you might have to move the ottoman)the closet was very big!the tub/shower also big.unfortunately, the toilet is right next to the shower, as is the sink &amp; mirror so i could not do my makeup &amp; hair while my boyfriend was in the shower..if we ever return to memphis, we will for sure stay here..3 blocks from beale st (where blues city cafe &amp; bb kings is) its very close to beale st.. i was able to walk back in 4 inch heels after lots of cocktails w/no problem;)directly across the street from autozone park (baseball games, i think?)&amp; directly across the street from..................RENDEZVOUS BBQ !!!so you can place your name on their hour long wait list, &amp; return to your room &amp; have a couple of beers &amp; walk back in less than an hour!thanks, doubletree staff for making our stay so comfy!oh, &amp; the wi-fi is complimentary!I agree with most of the other yelpers.....its not the Ritz, but it will certainly do! We only stayed for two nights, so maybe if youre going for a longer vacation you might want to upgrade, but we had no problems with it. We also booked it on hotwire for around $70 a night as opposed to the $140 a night on other sites; I dont think it is worth $140. The room and bathroom were clean and pretty spacious, as was the lobby. The ac was a bit noisy but didnt bother us; it could have been a little cooler though. The location is the best perk; walking distance to whatever youd want to see in downtown Memphis including Beale St. which was the highlight of our trip. Ive read complaints about the valet service and they were fine for the most part, but we lost our ticket upon check out and it took a little too long for them to bring the car around. The front desk staff was really nice and helpful. All in all, if I was going for another quick trip I would definetely stay there again. Just an FYI-Rendezvous is closed on Sunday and Monday so we missed out this time =(I stayed at the Downtown Memphis Doubletree with some friends on a weekend trip. The location was excellent--we were across the street from The Peabody and seconds away from Beale St, which was great for a trip during Elvis Week.  So, if all you want out of a hotel is a centrally located building, have no qualms about booking a reservation here. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere. One of the first things I noticed was a TGIFriday's in the lobby. My first thought was, ""Hey, how convenient""--but then I realized that this restaurant was replacing my free continental breakfast. It was a great way for those businesses to promote each other's interests, but what did I get out of the arrangement? Well, I got a cookie. To quote the wax-paper bag that my cookie came in: ""Why a cookie? Simple. Cookies are warm, personal and inviting. Much like our hotels and the staff here that serve you.""  Despite the friendliness displayed by my cookie-wrapper, we never received new towels or had our beds made. Additionally, when we called the desk about extra blankets, they responded that they would see if they had any and hung up before we could inquire further. When my roommate asked if they had any complimentary coffee for guests, (which you can find at many banks and grocery stores)  the woman at the desk reminded her of the coffee pot in our room with its one-serving bag, which, by the way, was never refilled. I might not be so annoyed if it weren't for the cookie wrapper, which, unfortunately, I had actually read and not thrown away. Along the way, the cookie wrapper gained a sarcasm unintended by its creators. But it's so well written, so I'll leave you with their carefully chosen words: "" [the cookies are] a symbol of our unique kind of hospitality and commitment to comfort. In other words, we think cookies are the perfect way for us to say, 'Welcome.'""  In my opinion, that's a lot of responsibility to place on one little cookie.","['nice', 'hotel', 'understand', 'life', 'channels', 'work', 'honors', 'room', 'besides', 'nice', 'parked', 'street',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-peabody-memphis-memphis-2,The Peabody Memphis,4.0,$$$,314,"We went to the Peabody to see the famous MARCHING PEABODY DUCKS....but the place was so PACKED !!!!...It was so packed, it was hard to get a glimpse of the ""infamous waddle"" as they emerged from the elevator and made their way to the fountain the glizy lobby of this gorgeous hotel.But, at least we can say we were in this amazing hotel from the HEY DAY era, and we can say ""HEY, we once went to the Peabody in Memphis"" I love to have little moments like this that are forever embedded into our memories. I have always tried to do this for my children growing up...tons of fun memories to remember their mommy by!!!The Peabody of Memphis is the South's Grand Hotel, a blast from the glitzy glamorous past.  It is conveniently located only about 2 maybe 3 blocks from Beale Street, so its extremely easy to hop over from the jazzy melodies on Beale to the quiet lobby of the Peabody.  I would love to have the extra money to spend the night in this Elegant Jewel of Memphis !!!!This is a beautiful hotel just two short blocks from Beal Street. We stayed in a suite on the 11th floor, and were disappointed by a few things. First off we were right next to the elevator which can be heard at all hours moving up and down. There was no real comforter on the bed, and the maids seemed a little lazy (not putting things away ect). However, what really got to me was how crappy the valet service is. I had called down ten minutes before arriving in the lobby to have our car pulled around, got down to find out that no one ever ""got the word"" the valets were lazy and slow walking around and showing no hustle. Otherwise, the hotel is gorgeous, great location, and friendly front desk and suite personnel.Okay, I am an animal lover, so I might be bias, but I just adore this hotel. I mean come on... ducks that ride an elevator!! Plus, the hotel is pet friendly! If you are traveling with a nonhuman family member, they give you a bowl, a cute poo baggy holder for your leash, and a list of animal-friendly activities in the area. Some people might find this frustrating, however, I REALLY appreciate it, but they require vaccination records for pets. What a relief that you don't have to worry if there was a weirdo in your room before you who let their poor dog contract kennel cough and then subsequently pass it on to your furry family. They do charge a pet fee for cleaning purposes but it's exponentially cheaper than boarding or a pet sitter, plus you know you're not gonna be sleeping in someone else's cat's hair. They also allow you to leave your pet unsupervised in the room (which most hotels don't), but if for some reason your neighbor's bird or  puppy goes psycho, they have security take them to the hotel's kennels so you can sleep, or sleep in, or drink in peace :) Also, I love the character and charm. It's on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as many other registries. I feel like this is what all hotels should be. It's updated but Romantic and cozy (notice I used a capital 'r', in 'Romantic', not a lower case one.. if you don't know the difference, you probably won't get it). EVERYONE that works here is awesome. I've never had a problem with anyone anytime I've stayed here. Let's face it, any big city comes with its fair share of crime, but I love how diligent they are here (without being obnoxious or making you feel sketched out). PS. Room service/ in-room dining is pretty darn good. I really like their little pizzas. Also, pretty great location, you can basically walk anywhere in Memphis from here; unless you wanna walk like Jesus, on the water, across the Mississippi, you can't do that from here. But you can walk alongside the Mighty River. You might even find a prairie dog... probably not though.*High five* to The Peabody Memphis!If you are just visiting Memphis, or if you've lived here your entire life, then you already know The Peabody is synonymous with opulence and class.Originally built in the 1920's and later purchased by the Belz family in the 1970's and restored to its magnificent current style, it is a place that you must visit if you are in town. You will regret it if you miss the experience so just do it. Everything here just oozes luxury without being pompous or untouchable. For instance, when I used to live in Memphis and worked downtown, I'd run across the street and get my haircut at Gould's in the basement of the Peabody. It seemed so special to walk in here and kind of a treat in itself just to do a mundane thing as getting a haircut over a lunch break.We recently stayed here for the first time during a quick 2-day trip to town. So glad we splurged a little for the special occasion! The rooms are small, but pretty special. The main enjoyment is the actual lobby, the ultra cool bar, the duck fountain (of course!), absolutely spectacular and gorgeous floral arrangements, and the fun shops. Go to Lansky at the Peabody. Mr. Lansky was the personal clothier to Elvis Presley himself! I had the pleasure of meeting him many years ago when stopping in the shop and once buying a tie for my boss. There's now a hip and trendy Lansky addition which features a fabulous selection of clothing for women and men as well. If you have kids (or you're a kid at heart) then make sure and visit in time for the duck march! You will not be disappointed!We did not stay at the Peabody but we did walk through and grab a drink and dessert in the lobby. Based on our lobby visit, we'll definitely return when in town and stay a night or two. The hotel is beautiful and well kept. The service was a slow to be served but they were also busy. Drinks and dessert were expensive but no more than you'd expect in any other fancy hotel. The staff was polite, friendly and helpful. A+If you want to see the definition of Southern charm and hospitality, The Peabody is for you!I had the pleasure of being a guest recently and couldn't have enjoyed my stay more. The property is classy, historic, romantic and is the home to some adorable ducks. Yes, there are really ducks in the lobby fountain.  The rooms, while not huge, are well-appointed (I am a sucker for a bed with LOTS of pillows) with everything you need including very comfortable bathrobes for your lounging enjoyment. One caveat - the walls are a little thin so you may hear a dog or two barking at odd hours since the hotel is pet friendly.Grab a seat on a comfy couch in the gorgeous lobby lounge and see the Duckmaster give an entertaining history of the hotel and their famous feathered residents during their march (each day at 11 and 5). You can also visit the ducks at their palace on the roof during their 'off hours'.All this and a great location with easy walking distance to many fun restaurants and bars?  YES!We walked in planning to stay one night, took one look and decided to stay two nights and extend our long road trip. Beautiful property, excellent service and just gorgeously decorated for Christmas. The room was spacious enough for two double beds. And like a number of these older hotels, the bathroom was tiny but beautiful and well appointed. The robes were lovely. I find that this is always the trade off between classic old hotels and the modern monstrosities. The bathroom and internet. Peabody wifi is really poor. Our family has a nightly ritual of watching TV shows on Netflix or Amazon but the wifi wouldn't support it. We got the breakfast package but the breakfast buffet itself was insipid and uninspired. I wish I had just ordered breakfast from the regular menu. But the coffee was outstanding. They serve French pressed coffee which is wonderful. We ordered room service both nights, once for a late night snack and the second night for dinner (we were watching the democratic debate in the room) and both nights, we enjoyed the food very much. If you are in the mood for indulgence, do order their freshly baked cookies with milk. Just divine. We also enjoyed hanging out in the lobby bar. A place for people watching and a place to be seen (I presume for the locals). We ran into a lovely librarian couple who were in town to take in a Tony Bennet concert and had a nice chat. Overall, we were happy that we stayed here. It was definitely lovely. One little complaint . We left a few things behind and I called the hotel to have them mailed and they wanted me to pay for shipping. It is not an unfair request but I once had a Holiday Inn Express mailing something for free. No, we don't leave behind things routinely :) But wealthy people don't become wealthy by giving money free away. The same logic applies to rich hotels as well!The hotel is beautiful. I made the mistake of going on the Friday after Thanksgiving to see the ducks go up for the night and the Christmas tree lighting. Wow, lots of people. Most likely their busiest event of the year.  It was all lovely but holy wall to wall people...The Peabody Memphis is gorgeous and historic. The chandelier in the main lobby was stunning and the ducks are quite something to see. How is it that those ducks are even more well-behaved than other children?I read somewhere that the hotel was one of the hotels (if not *the* hotel) where people went to see and be seen, especially for the uppercrust crowd. I do not think that was an exaggeration, as it really does exude elegance, charm and everything one would attribute to Southern aristocracy of old.Had I been given a choice, The Peabody is where I would have stayed when I was in town, as they are also located near other famous Memphis landmarks (Beale Street, National Civil Rights Museum, and Auto Zone Park are all within walking distance).Guess where I will be staying at next time I am in Memphis?It's the Peabody - it's classic Memphis. If you don't stay here, at least take in either the morning (11:00) or afternoon (5:00) duck walk.  Google for details. If you miss the ducks, the bar is still worth visiting. Good drinks, great coffee and pastries.  Lobby is gorgeous.  Everything about the Peabody is first rate.The first time I was here at this hotel was almost 20 years ago. Twenty years later, the ducks are still doing their march to the fountain. This place is such a nice hotel. Rooms are modest, but comfortable. The swimming pool and hot tub are clean and other amenities are up to par with the best (spa, gym, etc.) The lobby bar was pretty cool because you get to sit 5 feet from the ducks by the fountain (at least until 5pm).There is also a coffee shop, two restaurants, and another corner bar. The service is great and the souvenir shops have all things ducks. If you get the opportunity to stay here, please do! You won't regret it! Oh and it's also about 15 minutes from the airport and 1 block from Beale street. GREAT location!The duck March is awesome but in actuality it's only a few minutes long. So it's getting four stars. It's awesome and the ducks are super cute but not really worth five stars. And if you got lots of other things planned in Memphis then I guess it could be something you miss. The guy who leads the duck March is really nice and will happily answer your questions. I learned a lot about ducks and I hope that he was truthful in that they go to the nights farm and not the scary farm that we tell our children their pets go to when they die.Staying here is all about the charm of staying at the oldest hotel in Memphis.  With that... It's the oldest hotel and although very clean and well Maintained the Rooms are very small and furnishings old world. I prefer a larger room with a large bathroom and updated furnishings.  Seeing the ducks March on Sunday mornings is fun but you can do that for free without a $436 night stay.* see ducks and have a drink in the lovely lounge bar area and take a pic next to Gorgeous fresh flower arrangement in lobby!The lobby is always buzzing and the shops are nice it's definitely a place to visit for the experience of it but doesn't require a nights stay.The holiday brunch is always delicious, where there's always a huge spread of food, from breakfast brunch food  (eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy) plus Thanksgiving dinner food, plus a large variety of desserts  (cookies, M&amp;Ms, cake bites, and brownies). The wait staff was very attentive and always made sure you had drink refills if needed. The brunch is about the only meal you can eat for Thanksgiving based on the spread of food :). The only downside is the price,  so it's not somewhere you can go on a budget.Was a great stay until check out. Our room was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The check in staff and concierge were friendly and helpful.  But that's where the good stops.  The valet are horrible.  We called down 15 min before checking out to get our car - then checked with the valet desk when we got downstairs.  We checked back with the valet every 10 min and were repeatedly lied to and told our car was on its way - after 30 min standing in the cold I asked how many cars were ahead of ours. It was then that they looked for the actual key and found it still hanging on the board.  When you spend $400 per night on a hotel they shouldn't be so shoddy and lie but tell you really how long it will be. If I hadn't kept checking with them I would still be standing there in the cold waiting.  Now we have to rush to the airport to hopefully make our flight.We stopped in solely for the morning duck march. The entire presentation was wonderful. Anthony, the duck master, did an excellent job of engaging the audience and answering their questions. Sit in the mezzanine level for a better view of the march. Definitely worth stopping in if you're in town. The ducks march at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily.TennesseeI have bin in this state many times. I have bin their, over their, and here. I have also seen this great state during the winter. Every time I have enjoyed my visit. This time it was extra special, because of my stay at the Peabody Hotel. This hotel not only had fascinating history, it also had music history.  The atmosphere was classy, and fun. They had a duck theme. At the end of my stay I became duck crazy. I wanted everything that had a duck on it. Including the towel's. But at the end I walked away with one free bar of soap shaped like a duck, and my great memories of this great hotel. Everything that is amazing about Memphis is in walking distance. It's centrally located.Our journey to The Peabody started on Priceline a few weeks back. After reading many reviews on Yelp I decided to try my hand at bidding for a room through Priceline. Bid was accepted and I couldn't wait. There are a couple of things you only try once or twice in your life and staying at The Peabody for me is one of them.. I couldn't wait to check into my room and get out of the sweltering heat and humidity.  I could see my hair was already turning into Monica's humidity-ridden mane from that one episode where they are in Barbados!  Ugh! The heat!The moment we drove up we were greeted politely  by the bell-hop and directed to check in. It was all sunshine and smiles every step of the way :)Check in was smooth, nice polite hotel agent. Sad I didn't catch her name she did a great job and had a welcoming smile!  The walk to our room was very easy.Unlocking the door to our double queen room, which I was counting down to, was met with beautifully ice-kool refreshing air! Aaahhh!! I was in heaven!!... ok, ok.. onto the room... the view..the sites....the bed..The Duckies.... duckie soap, duckies to purchase and take home..duckie labels on the tissue roll ... I was loving the duckie motiff!Now onto the:Upside: Brilliant decor &amp; architecture.Such amazing attention to detail throughout the building that started off in 1925 at its 2nd location. Marble all around the lobby with gorgeous columns lining the area.Comfy beds I didn't wanna wake up!Wonderful downtown location close to Beale Street.The charming hotel is famous for the matching ducksPool and hot tub on lower level were quite cozy and yet spacious at the same time. 3 areas conforming around the pool make up the workout areas. Downside: 3 phones in our room. The only working phone is the phone in the bathroom. *pic below*Shower head for a 4 hotel I would think should be better and a higher grade from the lower end it had.Low water pressure Self Serve Parking $18.00 a night which is doable however the parking structure is not a hop, skip &amp; a jump away it's more, like a hike through Mt. Rainier. Going in and out of buildings and up and down elevators through a few different corridors until you've realized you are at the end of Beale Street. Picture to be added but before that we will need to prepare for the journey by packing a sack lunch and taking a few changes of clothes lol!Over all our weekend stay was great. No complaints as my vacay comes to an end.The Good: I was in Memphis for work and I have to say the Peabody is a very nice hotel. The room was very big and lovely. The ducks are also a nice touch. Also, it is in a fun area. I didn't have a car but found it easy to walk around. The Bad: I was not pleased with the customer service. I had a nice j crew sweater that I did not end up wearing and never left my room. At the end of my stay, I could not find the sweater after looking up and down for. It was white so I figured it could of easily been mistaken as a towel or sheet. I called the front desk and they said they would alert housekeeping and security. They were unable to find the sweater before I left the hotel but said they would follow up with me. A few days later I never heard from them. After calling the hotel and leaving a message with security, I never heard back. Pretty upsetting since it was a new sweater and didn't really feel the hotel was accommodating with following up and helping me locate it.Carved &amp; painted wooden beams adorn the grande lobby, rivaling any palatial gathering spot.Strangers cannot help but enter and be amazed by its beauty.  Be a fly on the wall in the lobby bar and take it all in: conference attendees, international tour groups, and groups of Memphians.Majestic fountain with cascading flowers in bloom; Sonorous Trickling overflow of water.Fowls swim in lobbyOdd tradition hatched years pastNo duck on menu#NOLA_Haiku #Haiku#Memphis #PeabodyHotel#ElvisPresley #Graceland#GreaterMemphis#MidSouth #SouthernCharm","I love happy hour at Peabody Memphis!!  Red and white wines alike  get Happy at Happy Hour 5-7Great hotel with great atmosphere! Historic hotel with cute duck themed decor due to the trained ducks you can watch in the lobby. Really very cute. My room was a double room and the room was very cozy and comfortable. Beds were fluffy and not too springy, blankets were thick and heavy. Bathroom was on the smaller size, but still very comfortable and clean.The location is prime. Close to the Mississippi- could take a jog along the promenade. Right near Beale St., civil rights museum and main st. Easy to find.Bar and lobby are very charming. Ballroom and conference rooms spacious and lovely. Make sure to check out older photos of the ballroom! Since it is a historic hotel, it is of course older and some of the neighbors could be heard. Not that big of a problem though.On a side note, I read the Shining before staying here, probably not the best of ideas because it is also about a large historic hotel and terrifying.First off my review is based on the hotel itself, and not a stay. I stopped in to enjoy a drink and watch the famous Peabody Ducks whom swim in the lobby fountain during the day before they receive the grand exit treatment. Yes, this hotel takes these ducks seriously and they are ushered back to their private quarters for the evening as part of a grand presentation which fills the lobby and balcony of people wanting to get a look at the ducksWhile waiting for the ducks to make their exit I explored the lobby and open area of the hotel, which is very interesting. There is so much history to the hotel that it will take you a while if you stop and read about everything. Next time I am in Memphis, I am planning on booking a night here to experience the history and take in more of this amazingly historic hotel.As far as the ducks, it was an interesting concept however once it was said and done I was a little disappointed that I waited around to watch a grand presentation of some ducks walking out on a red carpet into an elevator. I understand the history behind it, however it just seemed a little silly. I appreciated the architecture and rich history of the hotel more than I did the ducks. Overall it was an experience and I can check it off my list.My wife chose to book this place, as she found a killer deal called home for the holidays or something and she said it was about half off or something like that. I'm not too sure but I think she found the deal directly through their website. Anyhow, upon checking in, we both realized what an amazing place this was right off the bat. The front desk staff was kind, and courteous. And I've never/rarely seen a hotel lobby this lively. They had a live piano going with a very nice Cocktail bar, and lounge smack dab in the center of the lobby. The place was very tastefully decorated all around. In the very center of the lobby was a big fountain with a great big amazing fresh flower arrangement, which was very beautiful. Everything was very elegant, and tasteful.So we get to our room, and it was awful... HA gotcha! Just kidding!!!So we get to our room, and it was gorgeous, and spacious. A big soft bed, nice flat screen TV, and all the decor was beautiful. My only complaints would be that both my wife and I agreed that the walls seemed a bit thin as we could hear our neighbors a bit too much. And the bathroom seemed a bit too small. Besides that everything was great...Went to a wedding reception and valet parked. After 1 hour at the reception they charged me $20.00. Robbery and low class.Stayed at this hotel a few years ago on a trip through the south.  We were excited to stay in this historic hotel with the famous duck march.  We were planning on staying 2 nights but after checking in and seeing what poor condition the room was in we decided to checkout the next day.  What a huge disappointment!! Our trip consisted fn many other historic hotels and they were all beautifully restored or maintained so there is absolutely NO reason this hotel should be so neglected.  The amount of tourists that frequent this hotel should be incentive enough to take pride in ownership and not let this place go so downhill.  Sad, sad, sad!!My stay at Peabody was one of the worst I've ever experienced. Giant bedbugs ate my foot. I posted pictures of it. I would stay away go find any other hotel this one's infested with bedbugs it was disgusting. A terrible experiencesThis place is a wonderful place to visit while you are walking around discovering so many of the wonderful places Memphis has to offer.  Almost every time I am in the area, I at least stop by to enjoy the history that is the Peabody.  They have done a great job of maintaining a lot of the history that surrounds the Peabody and some of the visitors that have spent time living in this beautiful historic hotel. You can see Francis Scott Key's piano. (He wrote the Star-Spangled Banner for those that did not know.) They maintain a beautiful reception area with a bar and a beautiful fountain. Daily you can watch the Duck Master bring the ducks to swim in the fountain and then take them back to their suite. If you are feeling romantic and want a very nice French restaurant, I highly suggest Chez Phillip, but don't expect to get Duck a l'orange as the Peabody will never serve duck. I have not yet tried any of the other cuisine you can get here, but I am sure the Peabody does a wonderful job.My first Thanksgiving in Memphis was spent alone as my husband was participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. A co-worker and I went to the late seating of the Thanksgiving dinner buffet. The food spread out along the entire second floor would have been suitable for the gods on Olympus. It was divine.The staff made you feel like family, couldn't do enough or refill your champagne glass enough for you even though they were obviously exhausted from the early seating masses. Glad I wasn't driving. The Peabody is a must for all. The ducks, John Phillips Sousa's square baby grand piano, Chez Phillipe and they are on the register as one of the historic hotels in America. The Peabody was my first check off my bucket list of historic hotels and will always hold a special place in my heart.My wife and I decided to spend one random night in Memphis as a mini-vacation. The Peabody was running some Expedia specials for 15% off, which made this historic hotel decently affordable, especially when combined with a $25 Expedia hotel credit I had earned.They have an attached parking garage with a covered walkway. It's pretty convenient, though it is $18 overnight. The official check-in time is 4:00, but we had no problem getting our room at 3:15. The Peabody's location makes it perfect for hopping around Beale Street.We had a traditional queen room, which was very nice. It wasn't overly spacious, but there was still plenty of room. Best of all, it was perfectly clean! The Tiffany-blue walls and the chandelier definitely added a touch of class that you don't find in a lot of hotels. Our bed was also decently comfy, so we slept well. They have complimentary tea and coffee in the morning, but we didn't partake. We did, however, make good use of the complimentary wifi in the room.Obviously the duck march is something you have to do when you stay at The Peabody. This happens twice a day at 11:00am and 5:00pm, but make sure to stake out your viewing spot at least 30 minutes in advance, if not sooner.The staff members here were all exceedingly friendly and helpful. The Peabody is more of an experience than it is just a place to sleep.What an amazing hotel.  Takes you back to the late 1800s when the hotel was built.  From the time you pull your car up, to check in, to the entry into your room, it was all amazing.  The feel of the hotel immediately takes you back to where everyone would dress for dinner.  Extremely royal feeling and very welcoming.  The hotel is excellently located within walking distance of everything.  The most interesting thing about the hotel is all of the history.  Below is just a tidbit of one of the key items (For all of you Elvis Fans) A receipt dating back to 1955 was sold at auction in 1999 for a reported $65,000 - close to 15 times the amount of the transaction it represented. It was piece of rock and roll history, a one-of-a-kind piece of memorabilia typed on The Peabody stationery and signed by Elvis Presley and his father, Vernon. It documented the receipt of a $5,000 bonus for signing with RCA, along with a smaller sum from Presley's publisher...minus Colonel Tom Parker's commission. The fact that the document was typed on a piece of The Peabody stationery makes it all the more valuable. Elvis' ties to the hotel date back to his teenage years when The Peabody was the location for his senior prom.Wow!!! This place is amazing and the duck show was very interesting as well. Hotel employees are very nice and friendly. A definite two thumbs up!Beautiful hotel and lobby, definitely worth walking through even if you're not staying there. The duck walk is adorable, however, the staff was surly and overbearing, and really tarnished the experience for us. The lobby security/duck Gestapo took their jobs a bit too seriously, and were very rude to anyone standing, talking, moving, doing human activities, etc., even the children. They're ducks, not Bengal tigers. Relax.I loved my stay at the Peabody Memphis. I've always wanted to stay here since I came to see the ducks as a child. I'm happy to report I'm not too cool to be impressed with the ducks, the duck master, and the overall spectacle of the whole thing. Beyond the ducks, I loved getting to stay at the Peabody. It was outside of our company limits, but then I found a deal on Kayak that put it in just the right range. I was so happy I could make it work, and I was not disappointed. The hotel itself is just as grand, perhaps even more so than I remember it being. The nice restaurants, the hotel bar, the full-service staff at every turn, right down to the duck designs inlaid in the marble inside the elevators. I loved my room. The bed and the linens were wonderful, and the room itself had everything I needed. I felt safe and secure, and the room was quiet in the way only older hotels seem to be. The housekeeper did a nice job, and there's not much better in life than a room service breakfast, IMO, and this was no exception.Love the hotel, but if you stay there, make sure NOT to stay to stay on the 4TH FLOORwhich is the ""pet friendly floor. I've never heard so many dogs with separation anxiety from their owners in my entire life and I surely would not have expected that at The Peabody.This hotel lobby is beautiful but there is no coffee makers..microwave or fridge in the rooms. The bed was comfy. The carpets in the room are filthy. If u do self parking u have to walk forever to get to your car. I m not sure why it got 5 star rating.We had desserts at night by the fountain. All decedent! Lovely sophisticated atmosphere with a piano player playing requests. Wish the Ducks were in the fountain, but they leave at 5pm. We didn't have food ( just desserts), but would like to try some day. I would also recommend seeing the duck March at 11am and 5 pm.We booked this hotel because of its location, and of course, The Ducks. The Peabody and the ducks did not disappoint. Located in the heart of downtown, the Peabody provides easy access to any of a number of things to do in Memphis:  A short walk to Beale St., Sun records, or Gus's Famous fried chicken. The rooms were good size for a downtown city hotel. The room was clean and decorated nicely with a large flat screen TV, a desk and sitting area. The bathroom was a little small but had all the necessary amenities. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and was nothing short of spectacular and had one of the largest indoor Christmas trees I have ever seen in my life. The ducks perform each day at eleven and five o'clock, and the show is an absolute must see.  The staff was very pleasant and provided any assistance necessary. Regardless of why you go to Memphis, be it for business or pleasure, you can't go wrong at the PeabodyOkay first off...this review is for the entire building itself, hotel rooms and lobby, etc. The lobby is gorgeous, no doubt about that. The ducks are fun, everyone knows what that's like. Get there early, everyone knows that (I will say though that if you go in the evening when they go upstairs for the night, it's much less crowded than in the morning - but still packed). There's shops which are nice.The rooms though...it's an old building, I get that. Unfortunately, it's got everything bad about older buildings and nothing good. It's really loud in the rooms. Throughout the day, the chatter of the people in the lobby makes its way upstairs and echoes and amplifies, so it sounds like everyone is right outside your door. It's a little annoying at 2 pm but it's very annoying at night when you're trying to sleep. It's noisy in the hallways, you can hear doors slamming. Ugh.The water pressure in the bathrooms is terrible. It took me upwards of 20 minutes to wash my hair, and I'm still not sure I got all the shampoo out. It takes me five minutes at home. I don't expect insanely strong water pressure that'll peel my skin off, but that's just unacceptable.And the price. Unless you luck out and get in on some sale, you're looking at $200+/night. Given the sad state of the rooms, that's a huge rip-off.That said, the lobby itself is gorgeous, as I said. It's definitely worth it to go and have a drink by the fountain and check out the ducks. The food is pretty good, too. The whole lobby area is very classy and there's also some sculptures to look at if you're either waiting for the ducks to come/go or just wandering around.Great rooms! seriously I had no idea about all the ducks etc! It was a great surprise. The staff is friendly and there is of course great valet parking which is always awesome. Prices are 5 star hotel prices ! Cool deal!","This review is for the umpteenth duck viewing and lounge martinis.  Great entertainment for free and great value and quality for supping.  I love this lounge especially as Christmas.  Elvis had his prom here and if it was good enough for the King then 'nuff said.  Have said here long ago, rooms were small - due to age of hotel and pricey.If you're unlucky enough to have to be in Memphis, this might be the best place to be. Historic hotel that is a must just for the ducks. If you're unlucky enough to have an adjoining room to some other guest, beware you can hear everything. Everything is overpriced and touristy.The hotel is beautiful and we visited the bar area. We spent a nice evening relaxing on the couch, people watching, and sipping on wine. Would recommend to all.Top notch place, top notch staff, and exquisite dining. I have been here twice and have enjoyed it both times. I love the ducks and the story behind them, and I love just sitting in the lobby doing some writing for a couple of hours while I people watch. I come here almost once a year and I have a great experience each and every time, I have never had any kind of experience less than perfect.We stayed here for one night on 9/8/15. The lobby was absolutely gorgeous, there was live piano music,  people in the lobby, great atmosphere.  We ordered a Mississippi mudslide,  so good! We got there kinda late so hubby and I had to get a room with two queen beds.  I liked the decorations, everything has ducks, from the pillow,  to the soap and even the toilet paper. We stayed to watch the ducks walk down the red carpet and swim in the fountain. I loved everything in the hotel except for the grill restaurant, it was a bit lack luster and eggs benedict were awful.16 stays here now. We are always treated like royalty. Thank you so much to Graham in VIP services.Beautiful place. Stop in to see the ducks and (if you're lucky!) the duck march!The Peabody is an experience not to be missed, and agree completely after spending time here. I had heard that the hotel is a landmark in Memphis, and indeed it is. First of all the lobby is exquisitely decorated and the beautiful detail is best enjoyed while enjoying a drink or snack in the lobby. I was lucky enough to meet Doug, the GM who made sure that he added a special touch to make the visit memorable. The main attraction of the hotel is of course the ducks, who parade down each morning at 11am and up again at 5pm. During business hours you can see the 'Duck Palace' on the roof of the hotel, where the ducks hang out when not in the lobby. This roof deck also has a spectacular view of the city. Overall a landmark and experience not to be missed!We did not stay here but, we always go down to the Peabody whenever we visit Memphis. It's the happening place to be anytime. We love to go to the bar and have a drink and just people watch. it's also great fun to see the Peabody Ducks either come down in the morning or go back up in the evening as they walk the red carpet and follow the Duck-master. One of the best times to visit is also during the holidays. They have a huge tree all decorated and blazing with lights as is the entire lobby. It's also a great place to park and hang out before a game or a visit to Beale Street. The Trolly is currently not running but, when it runs again, you might also be able to catch it and go over to the Pyramid.The Peabody is a beautiful hotel.  The lobby is gorgeous with an ornate ceiling and amazing woodworking.  The staff are all, every single person, warm and friendly and welcoming.  I loved the whole duck parade/ducks in the fountain thing they have going on.  Nice to see a large hotel giving in to a sweet piece of whimsy.  Location can not be beat - it is walking distance to Beale St., quite a few museums, and many delicious restaurants.  I visited two of the hotel bars, and while expensive, both made a good cocktail.The room was nicely decorated.  Beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen.  You could actually soak your feet in the bathtub while sitting on the toilet (if you were so inclined).  And would it cost that much to add at least one towel bar in the bathroom?  Sure would be helpful!  Oh yeah, and add a coffee machine to all the rooms, too, instead of offering that as a perk if you ""upgrade"" your room (for $85).Finally-it was SO noisy in our room.   Between the staff bustling about in the hallway, and every few minutes the SLAM! of a room door, it was not a room conducive to sleeping.  Oh well.  I would stay there again, but I'm definitely bringing earplugs next time!They should really serve free breakfast considering the price you pay per night.  They offer free coffee, but take it away sometime before 10:30 a.m.Additionally, their pool is indoors and their rooftop seems to always be booked with events, so there's nowhere to sit and get some sunshine.The rooms are small, but pretty.I love the Peabody, they moved me to the celebrity suite ..and wow! Bigger than my first apartment, I also love the architecture and the ""they don't build them like that anymore"" lobby!Pros- great location, clean, cool duck soap, comfy bedCons- overpricedReceived an email for an upgrade. Called to get the upgrade and was told there wasn't an upgrade to give us. As we checked in, was offered an upgrade for the second time for $90. We decided to accept it only to be told it wasn't available, but we could have the Romeo and Juliet suite for an additional $300. No thank you! Our room was next to the service elevator. That's all we heard all night! Received a hotel service fee ($11.95)on our bill. Was told it was for the water and newspaper. Wth?Nice place to visit, but not worth the money to stay.Great place for a company conference.  There are so many meeting rooms of different sizes that can accommodate any size crowd.  Hotel accommodations in addition to meeting space, restaurants and shopping within walking distance of each other is a huge plus.  The staff is super helpful and accommodating! The price of course a little on the higher end but it is worth it.The hotel is very nice and the room was clean. Everything has the charm one would expect from a historic hotel. Unfortunately the lone problem was a serious one. We ordered barbecue sandwiches from room service and one had a 1 inch piece of steel wire, probably from an old grill brush. I'm glad I bit it instead of swallowing it. Scary. We spoke to a woman at the front desk who took our information for her manager who would ""be in touch soon."" Two days have passed without a call. It's sad to have to give one star because of a simple problem.Very special place, wonderful, helpful people - without exception. Nice room, comfortable bed, good quality in everything. Expensive, but you get what you pay for. My only issue - very poor wifi in the room, erratic service, which I depended on for this trip, frustrating. Avoid the lobby at Duck Time, unless you haven't seen it. It get noisy and chaotic. Otherwise the Lobby Bar is a great place to relax and people-watch. Check-out the roof, great views and the Duck Penthouse. The Peabody will be our first choice, should we return to the wonderful city of Memphis.Didn't stay here just came for the ""famous"" ducks... give 3 stars because the hotel was pretty and the Ducks were cute but I almost pied my pants when i saw the ""show"" we were told that there was this duck show very important to see.. and that we had to get there an hour before to have a good spot to see. So we were there 30 minutes before and it was packed.. we had an ok spot and everybody was waiting for the big events. Then at 5 pm some ""duck master"" started telling this long ass story about the hotel history which nobody could hear because he spoke so soft and then after about 7 minutes talking he went up to the Ducks who were swimming in the fountain in the lobby and with 3 man with a stick they leaded the 5 ducks out of the fountain towards the elevator.. that was it...... what a show !!! Oh my... everybody was like.. did we miss something ????? We just laughed about it... I mean like for the kids maybe it's fun but they make it seem like it's something super extraordinary... well I got ducks in my garden that will do the same thing when  I let them follow me with food and a stick but ok... they were cute though hahaOur first visit to Memphis was rich with history and it started the moment we pull up to The Peabody! This place screams elegance and tradition the moment you walk through the doors! The staff was friendly, rooms were nice and we were within walking distance to the places we wanted to visit.  The March of the ducks was fun to watch. When you stay at The Peabody make sure you stop at Lansky's! The store and it's owner are first class! I would recommend this place to a couple, family or someone in town for business. We will be staying here again without a doubt!My husband is in the Navy and we booked a room here on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> just a few days before he leaves for boot camp, so we could have a romantic evening together alone, before he's gone for 2 months. We also made dinner reservations at Chez Philippe. When we arrived the girl at the counter told us to wait for a minute and the manager would come talk to us. The lobby was packed with Arkansas fans so our hearts fell immediately. When the manager finally came we were notified that we no longer had a room. She was very sweet and obviously felt terrible, it was clear that she cared. She had found us a room at another hotel and would transport us there free of charge and offered a return stay. We went to our dinner reservations and the staff and food were incredible. Never in my life has anyone treated me so much like they really cared about me as an individual and the inconveniences. In the end we didn't end up getting a hotel room anywhere because everyone was fully booked, except the heartbreak hotel, which didn't appeal to us, but they offered a few different things and most definitely redeemed themselves. For this they get 5 stars. The service and care was greatly appreciated, I was amazed at all they did for us, if I could find the manager now I'd give her a hug for being so sweet. We haven't had a wedding yet, but when we do we will be returning to the Peabody, hopefully we will still have a room next time.As I understand it this is the last one and the original one.  THis is a great hotel, a beautiful hotel. This is what you think of when you think of a hotel.  Aside from the ducks - and the ducks are a grand and original perk - the hotel is lovely.The Peabody is not cheap, but if you look at hotels local to the area it is absolutely comparable and I wish there were more of these hotels all around.The hotel is beautiful.  The rooms are fantastic.  The lobby bar is gorgeous.  I think it is worth going back to Memphis just to stay here.","I've been coming to Memphis on and off now for about three years and had never stayed at the Peabody. Was finally able to book a room and now see what we've been missing. Love the atmosphere in the lobby bar and the general liveliness of the place.The duck thing is worth seeing just for the buildup. The rooftop has a great view and should not be missed esp when they have concerts up there. Very pleased with the level of service and will return.Check in - the hostess was rude. She was very unfriendly and she acted like she was doing us a favor. Eeeeerm I pay your salary *****Ambiance - unfortunately this place is open to the general public. So from the get go, the lobby was full of people, it was very noisy and on top of that there was a guy playing a piano....who was even listening to that. Honestly it was worse than Times Square. There were a couple of times where we waited for an elevator for more than 10 minutes. Why?! Like I said, it's open to general public and crowded. Food - I use yelp all the time and fortunately it can tell me which restaurants I should avoid based on people's reviews. All restaurants located at this hotel do not have review of more than 3.5!!!!!!! That's says a lot.Rooms - the bathrooms are tiny. See my photo. I mean you can't even have space to place your toiletries bag. Fortunately I liked the room.Internet - they don't have one. I mean if you ask they will tell you there is one accessible in your room. However, it does not work. The times it worked it was very slow which is frustrating.Gym &amp; Pool - it's very nice but for a hotel so big you would expect something much bigger. Downside - they close at 9 weekdays and 10 weekends Pricing - whether you get a tiny room with a double bed or a spacious room with a king size bed.....you will pay same cost. Experienced it first hand. Me and 2 colleagues booked for 7 night stay, they both got much bigger rooms in king size beds. I slept in a tinny tiny double bed and still paid $259 per night. And this was AFTER they confirmed my reservation for a king size bed. Overall - I will NEVER stay at this hotel. The rooftop is great and the bar downstairs is good. The hotel service is TERRIBLEParking - don't park here unless you want to have another 1 mile walk to your car. I mean depending on which floor you park and where your room is, it can literally be a mile apart. I parked here the first night then the rest of the time I used the parking lot across the road, opposite Tamp &amp; Tap on Gayoso street. It's easily accessible and very close and it saved me $3 parking fee per nightOne of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed in. Luxurious surroundings coupled with old-fashioned Southern Hospitality make for a wonderfully enjoyable stay. We loved shopping at Lansky's (aka Clothier to the King)...and who doesn't love the ducks!Exceptional place to stay! Truly a hotel with a southern charm. Everything from the front entrance to the lobby is beyond beautiful. Really makes you really want to just sit down and unwind with a glass of wine. The rooftop deck has the best view of the Mississippi River! Loved my stay here..would definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting Memphis. Make sure to valet your car..because their self parking situation is a little bit inconvenient.I was very unhappy with Valet and customer service.  We were told that if we went into the hotel they would validate the parking and there would be no cost as long as we made a purchase.  That is not true at all.  We spent a lot on over priced drinks and they would not validate.  Even talked to the Manager and she was not professional at all.  Her name was Linda Green.  We asked for someone above her and she said she was it.  I would never stay there if they treat customers like that.  I travel all over the world and stay at amazing 5 star hotels and never have been treated like this or lied to.Ahh, the Peabody.  Besides the famous BBQ and Blues, this was the only landmark I could really ever associate Memphis with.  The ""Grand Hotel of the South"" was originally created in 1869, and its current location has stood since 1925.  It is one of 3 AAA 4 diamond hotels in Memphis, and I had a lot of high expectations.  In fact, I would rather want to stay in a hotel built in the beginning of the 20th century than something more modern.  I like the history and the grandeur associated with places like this. My travel plans for the weekend got derailed at the last minute, and I noticed on expedia I could find get a room for either $179/189 a night.  Rooms usually run $240 and up ($233 with AAA).  I figured this would be a good excuse to jack up my review count.Upon entering the parking deck, you go left for valet ($26), and straight for self park.  Now here is a tip- if you have trouble walking or need help with luggage, my advice to you is to spend the extra $$ for the valet.  The walk to the deck can be quite long if you get winded easily, and there is no bell boy out in the deck.  For someone with a backpack, it wasn't too much of an issue (except the humidity).Also, one thing that is kind of annoying- the famous ducks.  Well, it isn't their fault.  Hell- I love the ducks.  They rock.  Unfortunately though, they come downstairs at 11AM (the same time as check out) and go back up at 5PM (an hour past check in time).  What am I getting at?  The elevators and lobby get hellish at the 2 most important times of the day.  Check in was easy thankfully, but waiting for an elevator took about 15 minutes, as everyone lined up (as there were 4 elevators for the hotel) wanting to go see the ducks on the roof.  They should time that differently, IMO.I got room 1111, which had 2 double beds and a decent view of Auto Zone Park (could see the jumbotron from the room).  The room was on the smaller side (one of the smaller rooms I have stayed in), but it got the job done.  The bathroom had marble inlay, and tons of towels too.  The toilet flushed quietly, and there was a phone in there to multitask.  The shower had light pressure, but got the job done.  Overall, the room wasn't too bad.  One thing I did notice too, there was not a coffee maker to my knowledge in the room.  There were robes though, and there were thirsty robes.  After taking a shower, I would be dry within minutes- a nice touch.After getting situated, it was time to walk around the lobby and whatnot- to find the pool and other things.  So we (my roomie and I) went to the M floor and walked around.  There is a history room, that I shocked not more people were in- hell, we were the only people in there!  It documented the entire history of the Peabody.  2 highlights included a Babe Ruth signature and Elvis' first recording contract bonus with RCA.  Cool shit.  A nice place to check out if you have the 5 minutes.The next thing was to look for the pool that I kept hearing about.  I was told it was 24 hour fitness center for guests and club members.  The pool was nice, but small- I really wanted to jump in, but the place was filled.  The locker room was somewhat small, for a 464 room hotel.  2 showers, 1 stall.  We knew would would come back later.After getting drinks in the lobby (which we have done plenty of times before) and getting nice and fuzzy- it was time to venture out, as we didn't have to drive anywhere and we were located in the backyard of Beale St.  We came back a little after midnight, and much to our dismay, we couldn't get into the fitness area.  So much for 24 hours?  So we went back to the room to retire.  I realized that they had the breakfast thing, so I decided to get 2 breakfasts set for 920-940AM.  I had placed it on the door before the 2AM deadline...  As when I woke up the next day and saw the bill on the ground, the bfast thing was taken.For whatever damn reason, I waited, and waited.  Breakfast never came.  That was some horseshit!  I hope it doesn't show up on the updated bill, because my breakfast wasn't until 5PM today unfortunately...When it was time to check out, the elevator situation sucked again, as this time, one of the elevators was cutoff for the ducks.  When we got down to the lobby at like 1045, the lobby was full.  And then the new duckmaster was telling the story of the ducks.  We watched for a few, then got the hell out of there.  On the what seemed to be a mile long walk to the car, there was a pay station that said to PAY here before leaving.  If you are paying with a CC, ignore this- as a CC reader is at the exit.  Also, I noticed that you can tap your hotel card to exit, but I didn't even think of using it out of bad faith.  It never listed anything about free parking for guests, unless I overlooked that completely.  Well, if the room key gets you out, then hell yea.  If not, it is $18 a night.  If I were you: stay at the Westin and come to the Peabody for drinks and entertainment.The Peabody has a history in Memphis and probably the most recognized high end hotel.  A few blocks from Beale, it is a good location in Memphis.  Across the street is the minor league baseball team as well.  Walking in the lobby alone gives you the feel of this eloquent hotel.  Come here, rest in the lobby, order a drink and watch how the other half lives.I love this hotel.  True southern elegance and charm.  The ducks just addTo the character.  Staff is always super friendly and the lobby bar is one of the best in America!The Peabody's beauty is in it's history. Oh yes and the duck's are a cute touch too. The room we stayed in for a conference was fine, nothing special, but fine. They do, however have a ton of great bonuses such as:1) Rooftop Parties in the summer2) Happy Hour at The Corner Bar - $2 wine on Wednesday! 3) Shopping! Lots of shopping4) Convenience as you can litterally walk across the street to the Redbirds, Beale Street, and many great restaurants4) Lobby Bar with live music (pianist)5) Salon in the basement - Gould's offers massage, facial, hair, and nails6) When you're always working like me, FedEx becomes your bff and there is one connected to the Peabody LobbyHeck, maybe I should give them 5 stars...I'm giving this hotel a four star on the lobby alone! Really happening lobby bar with lots to look at. The service in this area is top notch. Love the ducks on the fountain. We were on the concierge floor (12). Very good service at the lounge. Food needs to be worked on though. More variety, quantity and quality food. Also, real brewed coffee! Enough of this instant coffee that kuereig spits out!!Our room was small but nice. Bed very comfy. The bathroom needs updating. Not enough lighting and tub needs to be replaced with a shower. The toilet did not look clean by the floor. Noise was a problem. You can here every door closing and people talking. Oh Helio 6am!This review is for the Peabody Ducks only! I did not stay at The Peabody, but I did stay in Memphis down the street. I had never heard of The Peabody Ducks before this short trip, but my traveling companion declared we had to see two things in Memphis (besides Pearl Jam at FedEx Forum, and Beale Street that we had visited the night before.) One was Graceland, of course, and the other was The Peabody Ducks. Two times a day this happens. The Peabody Ducks march in and out of the Peabody Hotel's fountain watched on by many people who stay in the hotel, people who don't stay in the hotel, people who are taking a bus tour and, I assume, people who are just sitting at the bar trying to drink in peace. Since there is a bar right there. They literally roll out a red carpet for these little guys and the whole process takes about 5 minutes. That is, unless you get there super early to get a good seat. The Duck Master, in like, a tux, comes out and announces the ducks and this fancy, official, royal-sounding music plays. The elevator opens up and 4 little guys waddle out and down the red carpet to hop into the fountain. It is adorable. They are brown ones that look like they came out of a park lake, but I heard these lucky ducks actually have some very expensive apartment at the top of The Peabody.There is no charge to get up on here and you can watch from the first or second floor. If you drink, why not show up a little early and enjoy yourself, I guess! The Peabody Ducks are a cute must-see at least once if you are in Memphis anyway. :)The Peabody Memphis is an historic hotel located in the heart of Memphis, just 2-3 blocks from Beale Street.I stayed here for a work conference and felt that it was one of the nicest, most unique hotels I have ever stayed in. Because the hotel is in a historic building, the decor is grand- with mahogany paneling, thick crown molding, marble floors. The marching of the Peabody ducks in to and out of the hotel lobby fountain twice daily is a major tourist attraction and makes staying at the hotel that much more unique. The service is absolutely top notch. The staff are cheerful and helpful.The rooms are beautiful! Even the basic rooms (which I stayed in) are richly appointed. The bath products are also unique, with soaps in the shape of ducks.This is an absolutely beautiful hotel.  Beautiful.  It has that old school, old money mahogany feel that you don't really get in hotels anymore.  In the very center is a beautiful fountain surrounded by a great bar...where the ducks do their walk twice a day.  If you're ever in town, I suggest you check it out - its a fun little touristy thing to do, and they do put on a great show.Plus...its fun to squeeze (or attempt to squeeze) ducks cause they're so cute!There are a number of stores and restaurants here, and the room was comfortable (albeit...quite small, must remember to upgrade next year).  We were also consumed by the overwhelming number of republicans here for the convention...odd.  The gym was small but nice, decent equipment and the people working there were very friendly.  The one thing I did note was the insane...insane...prices of the food and room service here.  I mean, I know I'm in a hotel...but I'm also in memphis.  37 dollars for a small pizza and a bottle of water?  That's ridiculous.  AND I'm from NY where I expect to over pay for things.That being said, I decided to walk across the street in the middle of the night for water and some lovely local followed me back to my hotel asking me to buy him dinner. You're not in the nicest neighborhood folks, so if you don't have your stun gun, your donk, or people with you...don't wander off by yourself.  For the most part, people in the south are very sweet, but there are criminals everywhere!PSA done for the day.My favorite Frank Sinatra quote is, ""I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.""I like that quote because there is just something old school glamour about it. Maybe that is why I like the Peabody? It is, without a doubt, my favorite place in Memphis to get a drink. It has the best people watching plus it defines what Memphis is to me - at least all of the best parts. I've had holiday meals here with my family, debutante balls, met celebrities, drinks with my loved ones, and spent numerous special occasions here. I guess ""special"" is the best word I can come up with to accurately describe it, even though that seems totally lame. Someone once told me that a limo could make even the most boring night interesting...I think drinks at the bar by the fountain applies here too. If you're in town, even if you don't stay here, get a drink and watch the ducks splash around!!We booked this place based on a great recommendation, sadly we weren't sold! The bathroom is extremely small. There was no room to put things aka contacts, makeup.... The lobby is loud and super crowded most of the time. The staff at Duck Time are less than friendly, but seemed in good sports aside from that. The room was clean and the paint color really did brighten up the area. We could hear the roof party from our room, so if you like music that's good! The location is great, close the Beale St. The idea of ducks in a fountain is really exciting but not worth that lobby rush or the elevator ride after! All in all, three stars- great location, great sight seeing, loud lobby, over priced eateries!We came into Memphis late friday afternoon and checked into the hotel. On a BFF/sister road trip.  The hotel staff Charles (the valet), Laporciea (forgive the misspelling), Jeffrey (bellman), Justin (engineering) all pleasant individuals and very helpful. However things took a turn when the toilet began to clog (later clearing itself) Jeffrey alerted engineering and Justin checked it out for us. Hotel is beautiful convenient location.Later, my sister and I headed out for the evening and when we returned about 11-11:30 pm. I went to use the rest room and the handle to the toilet did not work.  So my sister, (being the room is registered in her name called down to the front desk.) Janice offered to change our rooms and have someone contact us with the change. Enter Ladonna who confirms the room change and is sending someone to assist in the move. The gentlemen arrives with no luggage cart and had to leave to retrieve one. By this time I am heated and annoyed. (Heated because something weird was going with the AC that the room never truly became cool. Something that did not become evident until the room change).Back to the situation... we are finally moved to the new room and the room has shrunk. (Tight fit in the first room to begin with.) So Ladonna is contacted and a compensation for inconvenience and reduction in room space is sought, maybe a waiver of the valet fee. My sister was told this couldn't happen because they focus on the service attached like wifi (when we checked in we were told it's free) or coffee and tea services (we don't drink coffee and it""s 80 degrees outside at almost midnight!) At this point Michelle the night ""manager"" steps in and things went from bad to worse. To the tune of..1. We can move you again...you said needed two beds in your room...2. We are unable to offer a discount because of third party booking.3. No complmentary valet because she doesn't have ""authority"" because that's a different department and it requires money to change hands.4. Offered a free buffett???5. When asked about her boss we were was told, ""he is in here tomorrow, oh he's not here tomorrow."" ""I know there not going to be able to do it.""6. Provided information. That free valet is offered to 5th and 6th floor residents.My issues with this conversation,  1. Any upgrades for the inconvenience of your hotels lack of working equipment, the offer should of been extended before the room change. I shouldn't have to pick up the luggage and etc. that I am traveling to 4 states  with back and forth through the hotel hallways. I need two beds because that is what I ordered and paid for and that as a customer is what I should get for two people.2. Your statement of third party vendors is not only insulting to your affiliates, partners, and the travel agents that supply business but to the customers that depend on your professionalism and care. So your customers who are booked ""third party"" do not deserve the same respect, care and attention as your direct booking customers????3. Short answer figure out how to apply the best customer service methods for the customer. I'm not interested in your departments or problems. No one on a vacation is.4. I have planned out my itinerary with my travel agent and eating at the buffett is not one of them, especially after this ordeal. 5. Bad customer service form to add to the rest of the above.6. You know if complimentary service is offerd to those floors and you moved us there erasing the valet fee we would of never known and I would of thought the world of this hotel and staff. It was comunicated with the initial move that floor choice wasn't a issue.In closing we were in Birmingham,  AL the night before at the Hilton Garden Inn in a suite that was 1 1/2 times as big and half the price. A hotel I did not give enough credit to before I arrived and thought that if the room at the Hilton was awesome Then the  Peabody should be extraordinary,  sadly  that was wishful thinking, right now at 1:29 a.m. I wish I was at the Hilton Garden Inn.I couldn't find where it was worth $250 a night to stand in line to watch 5 ducks walk to and from an elevator...but it did at the Memphis Peabody.It's a nice old hotel, with tiny motel-sized rooms ($250/night) and 5 ducks.We stayed at the hotel this past weekend to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary..thought something special was in order...turned out only average accommodations with not special staff.Friday night we went to the Memphis Redbirds baseball game (across from the hotel) and returned about 9:00 to find a message on the phone from the concierge stating we had a package at the desk (11 floors below) back downstairs we went to find a vase of flowers sent by my daughter...this hotel that boasts of southern charm and quality service couldn't send someone up to our room with the vase of flowers...the concierge desk at that! Extremely disappointing and disappointed...send someone up and leave them in the darn room for our surprise...'ya think?Won't return to the Peabody!The Peabody is a grand 'ol beauty. Somehow we were upgraded to the ""Peabody Club"" floor which requires placing your key card over a special reader in the elevator while you look down with disgust on the ""common"" people on their way to the roof for the great and totally free view of the city (make sure everyone is watching when you do it so you look like a super posh jerk).Not certain how we qualified for this privilege but I do have a [ridiculous] theory. I have a dead cheap piece of junk IKEA garment bag, which oddly is super-luminous blinding white. Since I was too cheap to valet park, I carried all my clothes in this bag at once and draped my weird jacket over the bag (has sort of a nehru style collar). The combo looked like I was carrying some royal garment from a faraway land with deep pockets for my meeting with Memphis investors, thus the upgrade! (it is just a theory) In reality they thought ""poor idiot, just look at his cheap crap garment bag, let's give him a thrill for once"".The heavily mentioned Peabody Club 12th floor is nice. Benefits of this exclusive concierge level are: ""complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the day, a welcome cocktail, and honor bar"". So, basically not too many benefits.Recently renovated, the room was fresh and new. Modern comfortable furniture, cool lighting (little motion sensing LED nightlights under the furniture to avoid late night toe stubbing). This ""swanky"" floor includes a couple nice lounge areas and a healthy dose of superiority. For all the hype, you won't feel any ""Ritz-Carlton"" awkwardness here. Though the historic building is beautifully decorated and dripping in brass, hardwoods and red velvet, this is still the South. Once you leave the lobby, rooms are pretty average.  My rating of the Peabody is on a regional curve. It is the most luxurious hotel, in Memphis. Full of friendly middle class families visiting the big city from rural Arkansas during my stay, you'll just have a good time here and receive good service. It is close to all Memphis attractions. A short, safe walk to Beale, FedEx Forum, etc. Even if you choose to stay at one of the many acceptable lower priced options in the area (the Peabody is honestly not a good value) stop in to enjoy a drink in the beautiful lobby, say hi to the ducks and head up to the roof for a few photos. FYI check-in and getting around is a bit of a nightmare during the very popular daily duck march.Well, where to start?Self parking never worked right. Even at 18$ a day. They forgot to tell us to make reservations for breakfast, and wouldn't seat us. The only other on property restaurant was a counter of cereal and muffins- that's not going to happen! Fortunately we went to The Bon Ton. It's close and good, and the concierge offered it up after she decided that the place further away would be too busy because she sent everybody else there.In retrospect they're challenged as far as being able to feed their guests and that's probably because there are plenty of decent food locations nearby. Even the bar was waitstaff challenged. The ducks are fine but I think they focus too much on them and not enough on us as customers. My biggest complaint is that someone took clothes out of our room and no one ever offered us any help or offered anything in return. Maybe it was just a tough weekend, maybe the good managers were on vacation, maybe the bad weather drove the employees to act in a not very helpful manner. I don't know, but at the end of the day we had things taken out of our room, and the Hotel and its staff didn't care. I say lock up your valuables and go off campus for every meal.$9.50 for a mimosa??? $6.75 for a Bloody Mary is not too bad but the other prices are way too much. I'm not sure why everyone loves the ducks so much but they are worth seeing once I guess. For the price of this hotel: I would never stay here.","Beautiful hotel with excellent lobby, and rooms are thoughtfully decorated. I want to sell my house and move into this hotel.I came here when about 15 years ago during a spring break trip and came by. My how has the place changed. It is so built up now. It was overcrowded and seeing the ducks were incredibly hard to see. I'd have rather they limit the amount of people that can see the ducks to guests and those buying drinks at the bar.Get here at least 30 minutes early to get a good viewing spot.  You can also sit in the lobby/bar and order some coffee while you wait. We got there about 15 minutes before 11am, and it was crowded and the place had filled up already.  About 10 minutes before 11am, the duck master comes out and gives a talk on how the Peabody ducks got started.  Then he goes up the elevator and everyone patiently waits for the elevator to come back down with the ducks.  After the ducks come down, it takes them about 10 seconds to get down the red carpet and into the fountain.... the whole thing went by in a blur... literally (as seen on my camera)!Beautiful architecture, but absolutely minuscule bathrooms, which are surprisingly dark and impractical. Cleanliness wasn't fabulous either. Room was tidy, but not well vacuumed. Debris and detritus from previous guests is never a good way to welcome new guests. Front desk clerk was rather surly and lacking the hospitality so often associated with the South. However, the other staff members were positively delightful. The ducks are cute, but this Grand Dame is resting on her laurels. There's an element of faded glory. That said, there isn't all that much competition. I suspect that's what allows them to charge room rates that are disproportionate to the level of quality and service. With a refresh and greater attention to detail and courteousness, perhaps The Peabody can regain its former stature. Until then, this big fish should hope no more competitors crowd this pond.Absolutely beautiful hotel. The staff is tremendous, so friendly and willing to accommodate you. William is the best, he really went above and beyond to make our stay better. Very appealing ball and conference rooms as wellGood service. This place is a time capsule. It looks like it did in the late 1800s. Beautiful.Currently staying here on business from NYC so I can't speak to the prices of anything in the hotel, but the building is beautiful and full of historical value. The duck parade, while fleeting, is charming and a nice touch of fun history for all ages. The staff are friendly and polite: everyone greets you with a smile and ""have a great day.""The lobby is impressive and you will get the best view for photos from the mezzanine. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable, toiletries smell nice and water pressure is good. The biggest complaint I have about my room (located on the 10th floor) is the noise. I am located right next to the service elevators so I can hear what sounds like the elevator moving up and down and the elevator cables rattling. This happens close to every 5-30 seconds. SECONDS. It's not terribly loud, but when you can hear it that often, it becomes downright aggravating. The walls are fairly thin overall. Luckily I didn't have to spend much time in the room except to sleep at night. If you're in Memphis and can afford it, I would still recommend the Peabody over nearby motels for its grandeur and charm, but you may want to bring earplugs if you're located by the elevators or sensitive to recurring noises.I LOVE this hotel! It's a beautiful hotel and the staff is very welcoming. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the view we had was incredible! It's definitely worth that pretty penny to stay here. If you're touring Memphis and not staying at the Peabody, you at least have to stop by!Peabody brunch for Easter was nice,  orchestrated well, our server was wonderful.  Two stars for the following,  though an opulent spread odd food was presented,  the taste and quality was not up to part for the $85 price tag.  There were some lightlights, but unless it was a popular dish., it was not refreshed from what I observed walking around.  Was a nice visit,  but failed to meet my expectations based on all the press.Grand old hotel. We Pricelined and got a great deal and then upgraded to a suite on the club floor. Martini's at the bar, the Duck March at 5:00 (get a seat early!), shrimp and grits at BB Kings, walking on Beale Street, sitting on the rooftop at night at the Peabody made for a nearly perfect one night visit to Memphis. Excellent, friendly service.Hotel is a national treasure. Rooms were lovely, Italian restaurant there was very good. Concierge service was excellent. Highlight of Memphis for me was the parade of the ducks and visiting their penthouse. Great experience. I would recommend some priority be given to hotel guests for the duck parades. We had to elbow it out with the hundreds of outsiders who come in to view this.Housed in the historic Peabody Hotel main lobby, the duck march is worth the trip. Cute, funny and smart, the production put on by the hotel for visitors is worth the visit.Hint:It's gets very crowded in the lobby while the big crowd of visitors waits for the show. Go upstairs to the balcony level for a better uncrowded view.While I did not stay at the hotel, we did enjoy our visit at this classic historic hotel.I'm here at the Peabody for a summer conference.  While the interior of the hotel looks nice, and the room itself is ok, the services are certainly lacking. I have a double bed room, the bed itself is ok, the pillows are a little soft for my liking.  The room however, has a smell to it, more of a funk, not something I expect from a supposed 4-star hotel.  It all seems old and needs renovating, badly.  The walls are absolutely paper thin, you can hear everything from inside the room, the elevators, the neighbors, people going down the hall, etc. The wifi at the hotel is non-existent.  For hosting a summer conference, you need wifi, and it is ridiculous that in 2014, the wifi at a 4-star hotel is non-existent.  They offer complimentary coffee at their in-house restaurant, it is sub-par, barely palatable. Again, I expected more.  I'm just totally let down by this hotel, did not meet expectations in any way.I will not be staying here again.If this hotel was a woman it'd be a grand old dame in a splendid ball gown with big hair and a southern accent carrying a parasol and duck under her arm. Go check out the duck parade, held every day at 11am and 5pm. It's kind of a big show over very little, but it's weird and its fun and the kids love it. And the lobby, man, it's opulent. It's in the style of the grand old hotel lobbies, and the bar pumps at night. The other giant drawcard? The rooftop. Grab yoself a martini and watch the sun go down over the Mississippi. And congratulate yourself for winning at life.An historic hotel in Downtown Memphis, right by Beale Street, The Peabody may be best know for the ""Duck Walk"". At 5 pm daily, there are 5 ducks that will walk from the fountain in the middle of the atrium in the lobby to the elevators, on their way to the Penthouse. This has been a tradition at this hotel since the 1930's, and it is very cute! Quite a show, and very popular, especially for the kids.Check-in was fine; I was a bit surprised my room wasn't ready when I came at about 5pm (so I watched the ducks), but this particular weekend in Memphis was extremely busy with a major NCAA Basketball tournament, so I figured no worries. I did get my room within about an hour, not so bad considering the craziness!Rooms are fine, well-appointed, clean, and outlets everywhere! Comfortable beds and pillows.  Shower has great water pressure.42-inch flat screen TV in the room. TV is also equipped with the ""Mobile Remote"" option. If you don't know about this, GET THE APP and PAY THE .99 cents a year for the TV guide. The app is called STAYCONNECT, and it basically makes your smartphone a remote for the TV. MUCH nicer than touching a remote used by thousands of other folks, and with the TV Guide option it is a no-brainer if you travel more than 10 times a year.I chose the option to self-park, cost me $18 bucks/day. Not horrible.A real classy place. I got lucky and scored a corner room looking at the river. The rooms were very clean and the mattress/pillows were super comfy. My favorite part though was definitely the staff. This was southern hospitality at its best bWhile the hotel is really nice, I wish we had stayed somewhere else. They were so busy that we couldn't check in until 4:30pm, then it was so noisy from being so close to Beal Street that even though we were very tired from walking the whole day, we couldn't even get a good nights rest.What a wonderful experience to stay at the Peabody in Memphis. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. They do the running of the ducks into the fountain twice a day and that is quite an experience The hotel rooms are luxurious and the food is good. Definitely a treat to experience in the southern hospitality.I love the Peabody. It's not often that I go in here, but the atmosphere is just enjoyable. Come for the people watching and to see a piece of Memphis history.  This is a Memphis staple, so check it out!This is the classic hotel to stay in while in Memphis. The rooms are nice and the lobby area is outstanding! You can enjoy drinks and small food in the lobby while you wait for the march of the Peabody Ducks (either in the morning or evening).The staff are courteous and efficient too. You'll have a nice stay here.","['went', 'see', 'famous', 'marching', 'ducks', 'place', 'packed', 'packed', 'hard', 'glimpse', 'infamous', 'waddle', 'emerged', 'elevator', 'made', 'way', 'fountain',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/graceland-memphis-3,Graceland,4.0,$$$,540,"This experience was everything I have heard it is and more.  Considering you are walking around inside someone else's personal home,  the tours of the mansion are very well organized and put together...it is really an amazing welcoming, unexplainable feeling when you first open the front door and step inside the house.  Also, being a creative person myself, I was really able to appreciate so many of the decor details.I'm so glad that because of all the ""guests"" that go visit every year, the Presley family have been able to keep this beautiful gem of land and keep Elvis' legacy alive for all the new generations.  All other tours are worth seeing too and very informative.   Wonderful friendly staff everywhere.I really couldn't help fallin' in love with Elvis' mansion and home. I mean, we're in Memphis here, and it really does seem like the ""thing"" to do. But my parents never listened to Elvis (sorry, we never tapped into that country side of America) and my only real exposure growing up was through random Napster downloads just to fill my playlist. As full as my fandom may be, it was still a great experience to visit Graceland and see the home of this legend....at least for the free garden tour from 7:00 - 9:00 on select days!Yep, that's right. We're guilty of not shelving out $40 each to the Presley estate for a tour inside the home itself. We really didn't need to. Our mission was to visit Elvis' home, pay our respects, and enjoy some of his classics while driving down to the Graceland area (which really can be sketchy at night).The garden tour allowed us to visit his gravesite, admire the beauty of his home, and avoid the rush of tourists all for free. It was a tranquil and beautiful visit, and we were satisfied with being able to at least be 'this' close to Elvis. Afterwards, we ventured across the street to the makeshift Elvis theme park and took advantage of the free photo opportunities and wall art, since it was practically deserted in the early morning.Graceland itself was a great visit for the short hour we were there, so I'd definitely recommend it for both the casual and diehard Elvis fans out there. It's something not to miss.When I'm travelling and I tell people that I'm from Memphis, it's either they sing me a song or ask me if I've been here. And I've never been until this week. I felt like I just had to go. I have to see it, to see what the fuss is all about.Honestly, I'm not a fan of Elvis. When I was born, he was already dead. Even though my dad had a collection of his albums and has gone to some of his concerts.Anyway, so this place is a good experience. It feels like you are walking in a place entirely dedicated to Elvis, because it is the home of Elvis so some of his stuff are still there. It's good to be transported back to history for at least a few minutes or an hour. It's a museum nonetheless. And the good thing is the tours are organized. The tour guides were really friendly and accommodating.I love the decorations of the house itself. I can't describe it. All I can say is, to each his own. The friend who was with me didn't really like it, but I did. After the tour, I at least appreciated Elvis more, and I might keep and treasure some of Dad's Elvis memorabilia.The food was a bit pricey for me, but my friend said that it's a normal thing for places like this where things are unique to them. So this is Elvis' home, you only see these here, so we'll charge you more. But it was worth it, worth a once-in-a-lifetime visit.For history buffs, music enthusiasts, and most especially for Elvis's fans. And also, for the kids of this generation that we can also appreciate the music of the past and the people who made music the way it is.Is this a tourist trap? Obviously. But is this still worth a visit? Of course.Coming into this place, I wasn't really a big fan of Elvis. The music really isn't my cup. But after coming here and seeing what this guy was about, I can at least appreciate the guy. Bring your wallet, because this place can get pretty pricy, really fast. Between the food options and the parking, you'll walk away with a much lighter wallet than you thought you would. Cool exhibits and some cool history to be found here.I'd always wanted to go to Graceland - my family are massive Elvis fans, and when I'm at a karaoke bar, it's Elvis all the way.I really liked the way the tours were run - each person was given an iPad with preloaded audio content (narrated, bizarrely, by John Stamos), meaning you could take it at your own pace.The property itself was so much fun to explore. It's totally garish and gaudy, but great - it's always fun to have a nosy in someone else's home, and the touches that would've been cutting edge in their day were hilarious. Three TVs next to each other, on at the same time? Sure.I also had a look at the inside of his private jet, his collection of cars, and his iconic headstone, too. A must-see if you're in the area!No cheesy Elvis jokes. No crazed fandom in this review either. I tell you what though; I was skeptical at first but Graceland was a lot of fun actually. I was also skeptical about the iPads and yet they ended up working great. Sure, you walk around looking like an octogenarian getting used to technology gadgets but they were full of insightful tid-bits. Cool. My favorite room was the trophy room because it was full of media and fun displays. The house itself was really cool to see too. Man, I would have tumbled down that mirrored  stairwell, Elvis. The automobile museum was the next best thing. Hang out here and watch the micro short film while you wait for your tour. After having visited Elvis' home in Tupelo, I surely appreciated Graceland more than I anticipated. Get here after 2pm so you don't have to wait in gas-shortage-pandamonium-long lines. If you buy your ticket elsewhere (visitor centers, etc.) you still need to stand in the ticket line to exchange it for your tour pass. So it saves you money, not time. Alrighty. I didn't bother visiting the airplanes or tasting the restaurant food.Honestly, I'm not an Elvis fan but everyone says 'you can't visit Memphis and not go to Graceland.' Trust me, yes you can.It is ridiculously expensive. I really wanted to see his airplane, but for that, you're spending about $70. So we opted for the cheapest ticket (almost $40 WITH a student / AAA discount) which just includes the Graceland Mansion / property. You can't go upstairs in the house. It's cool to see the rooms, and I suppose that if you're really into Elvis, it's more interesting to learn about him. But I'm not a fan of his music and I honestly don't find him that interesting of a person.You have been warned.If you love Elvis or are in Memphis for some vacationing, its a must see. We did the VIP tour which got us the access to the additional areas of the property. I'd say it was definitely worth it. The tour gave a pretty insightful view to his and his family's life. There was tons of memorabilia, we were able to see all his cars, and see his private jets. I was pretty impressed with how well kept the mansion was. Its definitely a life-size time capsule from the 70s.One negative thing i'll mention is that the place is definitely like a theme park as far as prices go, so be aware of that when you go. We came prepared so it wasn't too much of a sticker shock when stocking up on souvenirs.This is a difficult place to visit. At some point I felt it was wrong to be trampling through Elvis's home.  He had very little privacy, nothing sacred left when he was alive, except for Graceland.  And now thousands upon thousands (including me) come to be nosey.  I didn't enjoy the experience too much. It's chaos at the check-in/shopping center across the street. It's also ridiculous how you have to be shuttled from one spot to the next while at Graceland, even though it's walking distance from one point to the next.  They provide you with huge tablets that are video &amp; narrated by John Stamos.  Most people are trying to deal with the tablet and looking at the tablet rather than paying attention while in the house.  They need to get rid of that and just allow people to be ""present"" in the home. I left feeling very sad.Elvis's spirit is everything and everywhere. There isn't anyone that can compare. I hope the Elvis Presley Estate tones it down a bit and goes for longevity and sacredness of a beautiful human being, rather than just raking in the money over a deceased loved one.I feel like part of American culture...everyone should visit Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee. After spending a couple days in Chattanooga, coming over to western Tennessee to see Elvis was a great transition.The lines were not as bad as I thought they'd be. Also, what I really enjoyed was...they give you headphones and you take a self guided tour at your own leisure! I loved this! After taking a short bus trip to the actual house, you visit almost every room including the backyard where Elvis is buried as well as his horse stable. All of Elvis' records, awards and honors are all hanging in parts of Graceland. It's truly an up close and hands on experience. The tour lasted 1 -2 hours...but take your time...being at Graceland is a surreal experience as Elvis is known as the greatest entertainer/musician of all time.I really enjoyed being at Graceland and I recommend everyone visit at some point in time. Also, the city of Memphis is great as well including Beale Street, The Peabody Hotel, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, Sun Studio, The Pyramid, Mud Island and FedEx Forum.Enjoyed visiting Graceland Manson-Elvis house. The house is like no other. The way they decorated back then was very different. Very interesting to see how he lived. Pretty neat. We got to see all the cars, Hawaii tour and all the awards and costumes. We ended up getting the VIP pass. The only negative part is that is a choice of restaurants. The places that are around the tour and shops are really gross. You have to go to downtown on Main in  Memphis for a decent place.We had pre-planned this trip thoroughly, as we had quite an extensive itenary. Started in Pigeon Forge, then onto Memphis, Tn, Nashville, Tn. I know sounds crazy, but we had specific dates set for certain attractions we were going to go see! We had a blast throughout our trip.""I'm going to Graceland, Graceland, Memphis Tennessee. I'm going to Graceland....(cue the bass strings)""--Paul SimonSorry I had to do it, and you better bet your blue suede shoes that Graceland is a place that should be on everyone's bucket list to visit at least once in their lives. So, in honor of the 38th anniversary of the death of the King of Rock and Roll here's to the King, who god willing, will never die!And why should he? His house alone exemplifies exuberance and overindulgence on so many levels. Somewhat Gothic, grandiose but intimate, and unapologetically tacky with a seventies motif that is captured in time, Graceland represents what was and what still could have been. How many other personal mansions of deceased rock stars are open to the public for tours? Didn't think so. Much credit of what Graceland has become must go to his former wife Priscilla Beaulieu Presley and daughter Lisa Marie who cultivated and monetized what could have been a sad place and turned into an amazing bit of American ingenuity! So bravo to them for even considering it.Graceland is really a huge campus where the actual mansion and other supplementary buildings, with it's guided tours through audio headsets, is on one side of Elvis Presley Boulevard and the actual Visitor's Center, Restaurant, Auto Museum among others are on the other side of Elvis Presley Boulevard. In fact, it is at the Visitor's Center, otherwise known as Graceland Plaza, where you start your journey from the parking lot and get your tickets and walk through the huge gift shop and then you get in line to be handed your listening devices and board the shuttle buses that take you to the front door of the actual Graceland mansion.After a short five minute shuttle ride to Graceland, everyone can get off and take pictures in front of the house as they please. From there, everyone enters and takes a tour of the grandiose mansion. Graceland is kept in the exact same state as it was in 1977 when Presley passed away. Speaking of which, upstairs is entirely cordoned off so no one can see where Presley actually passed away. But you can see everything on the first floor, from the kitchen to the dining room to the living room to the music room (i.e. the ""Jungle Room"" and it really is a jungle in there!) and the basement. It was all fascinating to see the areas in which Elvis and his loved ones once roamed around. Throughout all of this area, you are guided to walk through pressing a number on a box that's attached to your headsets.  From there you walk to the indoor racquetball courts, which was ingeniously converted into my favorite part: the ""Graceland Archives Experience"" which featured his gold records, awards and memorabilia like his various stage outfits. Your headset tour leads you through every portion of each artifact. It was so interesting. From there you can walk around the grounds seeing the pool and the meditation garden that holds Elvis and his family members' final resting places. From there you wait back in line to get back on the shuttle back to get back across the street. Everything is so well organized, I have to give them that. On the Graceland Plaza side of the street, besides shopping and restaurants, there are more exhibits including the auto museum where you can see Presley's impressive auto collection and the two planes he once owned including the ""Lisa Marie."" We had a fun time in the roughly four hours we hung out on the properties enjoying all of the kitsch and nostalgia. It was very hot and humid the day we visited and they also had an ice cream shop called the ""Shake, Split and Dip"" where we were able to enjoy a nice treat. Thankfully we passed on getting the banana and peanut butter sandwiches that Elvis loved so much at the other onsite restaurant.Like I said, everything in Graceland seems trapped in time. Is it gaudy or tacky inside the house? Sure but that's why I think it's so vintage! Do you need to be an Elvis fan to really enjoy it? It would help for sure, but if you're a history buff like me and love museums in general, coming to Graceland was just as interesting. One year, I have decided that I am going back to experience an annual memorial service on August 16th, the day of his death. That sounds like an odd almost quixotic experience to be with all of those superfans! Trust me, there is no way Elvis is leaving this building anytime soon.If you love Elvis then you'll love Graceland but this place definitely isn't for everybody.  Nothing new in this review when compared to others so I'll bullet point it. Pros:- Well organized- Great for Elvis buffs- Good for rock music fans- AAA, military and student discounts available- Property well maintained- Staff friendly- Tickets can be bought onlineCons:- EXPENSIVE- Long lines for tickets and shuttles - Can't see upstairs of mansion- Costs extra to see cars, planes, etc. - $10 to park across the street- Crowded inside mansionThis is the quintessential Memphis tourist activity. If you are only going to do one touristy thing in Memphis this should be it. I'm not even an Elvis fan but I think it's worth seeing. Keep in mind you are going to wait in plenty of lines, spend more than its worth, be there a while, and get dumped into lots of gift shops.  My two favorite parts were the mansion and the room of cars. The whole thing is a time warp to the 1970s.  It is often an era that is overlooked because of it's cheesiness (good word, right?) but they pretty much nailed it here.  Elvis Lives (especially here.)Whoah! Be prepared to spend some serious cash. I am not a huge Elvis fan but still a fan. Husband and I bought the house tour with the audio iPad guide. It was an exceptionally  informative tour. Seeking the house and memorabilia was really neat. I thought the shag carpet was just the craziest thing ever! So 70's!Overall the trip was neat and I am glad to say I have seen where the famous peanut butter banana sandwiches were prepared!I stopped by here this past Friday morning with my wife.  We were going to be in Memphis for the weekend and so this was one of our top places to visit.  I will be the first person to admit that I don't know too much about Elvis.  Even so by the time that I was finished this ended up being a really pleasurable experience.  Of course it started out with me griping about pricing though.  You see it costs $10 a car to park before they charge you $36/person to see the mansion.  If you do the platinum package like we did then it's $40 a person although our AAA card did get 10% off.  Once we purchased our tickets we headed out through the door and boarded the shuttle to cross the street into Graceland.  We were also given IPads that were preloaded with a tour from John Stamos.  I was a little leery of the IPads at first but they ended up being pretty awesome and gave us a nice tour of the mansion and surrounding buildings.  Heading into the tour I thought it was going to be somewhat cheesy but it ended up being really well done although it did paint quite the rosy picture of Elvis.  With our platinum passes we were also able to enter a few more places like the car Musuem (guy owned a lot of expensive cars), sincerely Elvis (artifacts accompanied by pictures of him wearing them) and finally the archives which were literally every day artifacts from Elvis.The bottom line for me is I would recommend Graceland to any visitor to Memphis.  I thought that even though it was a bit pricey it was very well done and did a good job on giving Elvis' history.The Mississipi Delta shining like a National guitar...We're goin' to Graceland, Graceland, Memphis, TenneseeI'm goin' to GracelandAs Paul Simon sang, so my son and I went to Graceland. I had made the pilgrimage twice in my lifetime, and it's just something you do at least once in your life. Having been there as recently as 2011, it was easy to see some recent changes. We got there as early as we possibly could, 10am opening bell- and still things moved very slowly in getting to Graceland, and moving our tour of old people and invalids into and through the building (yes, a visit to Graceland seems to be a last dying wish for many with walkers and on life support).We were all given iPads to strap around our necks and put on headphones. In the words of my 13 year old son ""the iPads were distracting, and it would have been better to have a real tour guide."" Couldn't have agreed with him more. I did get a nice photo of Elvis playing bass that was only on the iPad, but between Graceland staff having to constantly train the old people on our tour how to use the iPad, and the fact that the iPad recording keeps the content you're hearing very basic and ""squeaky clean"",  the iPad tour ain't all that. At least beef it up with some more content to drill down into.Once you're done with Graceland you'll have to wait, wait, wait for a shuttle back to the Visitor's Center, and the rest of the tour. So many people lined up complained about this. (I'm just the messenger!). I did learn a few more things about Elvis, Memphis, but I think I'm good for awhile. Perhaps I'll be back with my walker in a few decades.So I didn't really know much about Elvis before coming here but I have to say that I am now an Elvis convert!Shell out the extra few dollars for the airplane and auto show experience, it's totally worth it. You are ushered onto a bus with a self guiding audio tour. The bus will take you straight up to the door of Graceland. The audio tour does a great job of describing each room's use and how Elvis lived in it when he was there. What really got to me was the amount of awards he won. They are all lined up in the trophy room - a huge hall of gold and platinum records. The amount of charity work he did was also news to me, and I hope that Graceland contributes some of it's income to continue his work. It was pretty amazing to see his grave and pay tribute to such a legend. The auto section was amazing! He had such a distinct and eclectic taste in cars. A real treat to see them all. The airplanes were also super cool. 24karat gold plated seat belts! Whew... this guy had taste.Had a super good time here and got to learn a lot more about Elvis. Highly recommend if you are in the area.It's Graceland!  It's Elvis!  Yea, a bit kitschy but if you are even a little bit of an Elvis fan - it's a must see. This is my 4th visit over the years and I joy it every time. It's become more and more commercial, programmed, regimented - and expensive, but it takes you back to a wonderful time in music history.","Really enjoyed this placed.  It was fascinating to see how Elvis Presley lived. At the time, he bought this place at the age of 22 for $100k! Are you kidding me!?! This guy was living large.  The tour consistented of his house, backyard, office room, gun range, record room, racquet ball room (now filled with even more records), archive room, vehicle room, his burial sight, and more.  What you get to explore depends on the package you purchase. During the tour, they gave you iPads w/headphones that acted as your own private tour guide, so you can walk the premises at your own place.  Tip: If you a bit of a germaphobe, I recommend bringing your own headphones. At the end of the tour, you have the luxury of visiting some of the souvenir shops and restaurant on the premises. Definitely a place you should visit in your lifetime if given the opportunity. Enjoy!!!Going in, I knew Elvis was the King of Rock N Roll, but wasn't a huge fan.  It just seemed like something you had to experience if you were in Memphis.  Overall, I am glad we took the time to take the tour.  We only toured the house and grounds, and did not do anything else, as we had a couple of 8 yr olds with us and they were getting hungry and a little bored.  You can order online and pick up your tickets at will call, which save a lot of time waiting in line when you arrive.  Basically online, you choose a time, and you can show up anytime on or after that time to do the tour.  Once you have your tickets, you head outside and get in line for the shuttle across the street to Graceland.  In line you are provided headphones and an iPad which you use as a self guided tour through the property.  It is narrated by John Stamos, and was actually pretty cool, and added to the experience.  They even have the option of a 'youth' version for kids and it definitely helped keep the interest of the kids during the tour.The tour basically takes you in the front door, and through the living room, dining room, kitchen, 'jungle room', basement media and game rooms, and then outside.  The inside of the house is definitely a time capsule full of all kinds of 70's kitsch, and is a good snapshot of his life at home.  Once outside, you get see the 'office' where family and employees worked, the Racquet Ball court he built (which now houses some of his sweet jumpsuits and awards), and then a building containing movie memorabilia and all of his gold records.  While not overly exciting, this area certainly captures just how big of a star Elvis was.  It was pretty eye opening.  The end of the tour takes you out past the pool and to the meditation area where Elvis, his parents and grandmother are buried.  While I am not an Elvis freak, and this wasn't my nirvana place, but this was a cool stop and I am glad I experienced it.  If you are coming to Memphis it is worth taking the tour.I am not a huge Elvis fan or anything. But we were in Memphis and so went to Graceland. But very glad we went there. I learned so much more about Elvis and his influence as a cultural icon and more importantly, about his philanthropy and charitable efforts. I really enjoyed the tour. Extremely well organized, it humanizes the man behind the myth and the pelvic gyrations. He was truly an interesting personality and a decent man. It was also quite sad and heartbreaking to learn of his rags to riches story and the untimely demise which could have been prevented through proper medical intervention. We also toured the auto museum because we love cars. It was really a fabulous collection.How could you come to Memphis and not go to Graceland at least ONCE??? The most iconic house in America? I mean, come on. Elvis was and still is one of the most famous and influential musicians of all time.You really get a sense for how big a deal he was as you walk through his house and see all the records and awards lining the walls. What really impressed me was how generous of a person he was, always donating money and helping people out when they needed assistance. What a guy!Tickets can be expensive so look out for discount deals that are offered every once in a while! The other aspects of the tour aren't as cool as the house, but the ones worth going to are the car museum and the airplanes.Our recent trip to Memphis included Graceland. Our family are Elvis fans so the occasional pilgrimage to Graceland is on the list. The prices have really gone up since our last visit. That is why I gave 4 stars. The good, is seeing the Presley home as a time capsule. My favorite rooms are the front living room, the parents bedroom and bathroom. I would have loved to see pictures of the rest of the house before the 70's re-do. The trophy room is an impressive display of awards by Elvis while he was alive. Almost more impressive is the awards in the racquetball court from after his death. The meditation garden allows guests to pay their respects to Elvis and his parents. For improvement, I would like the option of a live and personal tour guide instead of the iPad and headphones. All the employees at the mansion and in the gift shops were pleasant and helpful. They truly seemed to love their job. That makes for a great atmosphere. We will be back.Must-see for Elvis fans! I definitely enjoyed my visit and, as an Elvis fan myself, found every part of this tour interesting and fun! Elvis' Graceland is surprisingly smaller than I had imagined but it was spectacular nonetheless, especially when you consider than you're through the home of the King of Rock &amp; Roll himself! The place gets crowded, as you can imagine, which can be frustrating as you go through the self-guided audio tour and the outdoor parts of the tour can be difficult in the summer time (Tennessee heat...wow!). The gift shop and other small stores on the property could really use a remodel! I recommend buying tickets in advance.Unless you are huge fan of Elvis, avoid this place. The entrance fees are in a word 'outrageous' and slowly approaching Disneyland prices. There is no guided tour by a live person; you are paying for an iPad that plays an audio tour by John Stamos that you will tune out shortly once you enter the mansion; but you can't just walk up to the mansion. You will have to pay for parking, buy an overpriced ticket, then wait for potentially over an hour to be herded into a shuttle bus across the street, then the monotony of the John Stamos audio recording, then to be herded back across the street in another shuttle bus. Save yourself the hassle and your money; buy a picture book on Amazon.Worth every penny! This was my 2nd time back to Graceland and my husband's 1st. To be in the home of the King is so special.  Very cool that everything is as it was when he passed away.  My favorite part was the hall of records room.  So many gold records and awards and the famous outfits! You have your own iPad and earphones to listen to John Stamos telling you all about Elvis &amp; Graceland. Great tour!This was really a surprise for me.   After flying into Memphis at night, and driving to the Days Inn, just past Graceland... I was sad at how run-down the area seemed to be.   I saw the Lisa Marie jet just steps from the main road... and expected the rest of the estate to be as...  commonized.I was 4 when Elvis died.   What I knew of him was that he was a rock 'legend' who then turned into a bloated man with issues, Liberace style, and cheesy music.      The Graceland tour changed my opinion of him completely. He was an icon of his age.    His estate is an icon in the US.   How could we not visit when in Tennessee?The bad:It is a tad expensive, and every place on one side of the street leads to a gift shop. I really liked the iPad tour, but there was a learning curve, and I could see how some may not appreciate them or be able to use them to their full extent.   They weren't completely synced up with the pace of walking through the different areas...   it wasn't super obvious that you can move to different parts of the video for the area without waiting, etc.   (I think we were there on a slower day...   but the volume of visitors even on that day wouldn't allow for the best possible, live person tour that would also allow people to go at their own pace)It would be nice to have a live guide and a small group of 6 people with the mansion all to ourselves.   That ain't happening.The good:They are very well organized.    I can see how the shuttle might be annoying, especially if you have strollers or wheelchairs (not sure if there are other accommodations for those situations... can't imagine there wouldn't be).   But, I imagine that this in part is how they're controlling the volume of folks at the mansion.The iPads with Lisa Marie's recorded anecdotes really brought the feeling of this being her home with her mom and dad...    The rooms, their subdued opulence, and 70s funkiness were well-preserved - or seemed to be...   I could care less about the gold records in all honesty (although impressive)...  but hearing Lisa Marie say how generous a person he was, and listening to snippets of his various songs while looking at so many photos and other memorabilia made me rethink my experience of him.   Maybe they had a psychologist involved in the tour organization... maybe it was something else...   But I found myself crying towards the end of the tour, starting when I was ready to leave the racquetball court.     Like, I couldn't stop.     They really did a very nice job in portraying him as a real human being who did extraordinary things.My husband is a die hard Elvis fan and had been here before, he wanted to take me for our birthday. It was AMAZING! I loved every part of it and was able to capture a ton of photos. Great experience and highly recommend the VIP tour.The most famous icon of the estate is the front gate, shaped like a book of sheet music, with musical notes and a silhouette of Elvis. It has come to symbolize the estate more than the mansion itself.There is nothing I can say about Elvis or Graceland that any diehard true fan wouldn't already know. I personally had a nice time on the tour, no issues or rudeness on the staffs' part. I think they currently are deteriorating in several areas, such as, customer relations. I like looking at nice things that money buys. As I have no money to make large purchases, I live vicariously, through visiting car museums, Graceland, Pink Palace and Botanical Gardens. Graceland is a part of Americana. It needs to be savored and preserved for future generations to enjoy. I was too young, when he passed, to really appreciate who he was and what he became. I did develop a great appreciation for his music and especially for his love of Gospel.Drugs and gangs are taking over Elvis Presley Blvd  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.memphisrap.com%2F2014%2F08%2F08%2Fmemphis-mayhem-drugs-inc-season-5-episode-5-video%2F&amp;s=47341f7bdfe4fa712ff92bc46d8de3c4030a2c7b1d0c4871871d5aae7a829e69"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">memphisrap.com/2014/08/0...</a>  Elvis was definitely known for his drug use, but he stuck to using legal drugs, such as uppers, downers and diet pills to keep him up and going for his rigorous schedule. The drug scene in Memphis is on a much different scale nowadays. I have a fear of Memphis now. I want to visit it's zoo, museums and numerous diners and restaurants, but am not up to taking the risks of going back to Memphis.We visited for the first time and were pleasantly surprised at the tour, the grounds, and the overall experience. We purchased the full ticket package minus the airplanes. We loved the exhibits!The house was a great tour, but we felt a little rushed. The scheduling of the groups is a little close together, but it is truly a ""go at your own pace"" tour. So if you're ok to let people from other groups pass you up, then go as slow as you want! The iPad's are loaded with info and definitely im-personal. I would much prefer to have a tour guide lead the tour and interact with a person. However, the iPad had a ton of information that a guided tour probably would not be able to provide because of the amount of time it would take to lead a tour.The Archives part of the tour was fantastic! This requires an additional ticket, but was great. There are a lot of artifacts and such to browse while waiting for a 15-20 minute video presentation. The video included interviews, snipits from concerts and flics, and some peaks at old furniture from the house, etc.The Automobile Museum was a good, short tour of some of Elvis's cars and other motorized things. While everything was interesting, we were disappointed that the iconic pink Cadillac was not present because it was out as part of a traveling exhibit. Bummer!Those were the exhibits we visited, and it took approximately 4-5 hours for all of that. One could easily spend longer if they went to all of the exhibits, and/or ate while on-site. Overall, it was a good experience, but the tourist area could use some updating. Definitely a fun stop for tourists and Memphians alike!Elvis, I grew up on his music and had a crush on him as a small child. I found the information on point.  I enjoyed the displays of his records and events in his life. This is very pacific place to visit. Only if you're an Elvis fan will this be interesting or if you are a music buff on 60's music. I say a visit is in order for you. I want to go back again at a later date and take more time to read everything.I was pleasantly surprised by the history here. The king is more my mom's generation but no doubt I appreciate early rock n roll too.   The tour does a nice walk through his life and features some incredible artifacts. I enjoyed the early history of this place most - The Presley family and their children. Amazing to.see photos of the king as a boy. Poor, dirty, but uniquely elvis. Remimds me to wonder what place my children will take in this world.The sun records history and music was also fantastic.  That was Elvis at his best. I started to feel a bit sad as the Hollywood elvis took over - typecast supreme artists are an immense waste. Rooms in the surprisingly modest mansion were Shagadelic, man. And the trophy room is frankly mind blowing. His music was truly loved by fans - he didn't write songs but was clearly the entertainer of the century.  Seeing the last place he carried a tune was solemn. His dad wrote his epitaph. Reminded me how fragile things are.But in the end its a great celebration of rock n roll and a legend. It's expensive and they charge separately for parking!!! . But for two hours do the basic tour, immerse yourself,  buy a tschotske for your mama and check it off the list. You'll be glad you did.Why the high reviews? A few big problems I had: The lines were awful, the price was steep, the tour is virtual, really, you can go on the same tour online, and you can only tour the first floor of the mansion. No peeping in on where Elvis slept!I am by no means an Elvis fanatic, but my wife really wanted to check out Graceland during our short stay in Memphis. Realistically, I think she just wanted to sing ""Blue Christmas"" over and over.We were planning on a 2-3 hour visit rather than a full-day Elvis extravaganza, so we opted for the Graceland Platinum Tour, which is still $40 a person. Parking is another $10, with shuttle service from the lot.First on the Platinum Tour was a multimedia iPad tour of the Graceland Mansion and grounds. This was a really cool way to tour, since they give you the iPads and headphones. The GPS in the iPad knows when you've entered the next tour area and starts that portion automatically. It's narrated by John Stamos for some reason. The upper floor of the mansion is off limits, but the open tour areas and the rest of the grounds were great to see. I especially liked seeing his personal firing range. Keep your wits about you, because some ""guests"" take Graceland waaaaaayyy too seriously.Next was the Graceland Archives Experience. The Archives are also really cool. They have everything from water bills and grocery receipts to cowboy boots and sunglasses. It gives you a glimpse into who Elvis was as a regular person.My second favorite part of Graceland was the self-guided tour of Elvis' automobile museum. His car collection is really awesome and very impressive. Unfortunately the pink Cadillac was on loan elsewhere when we were there. Sad.We also squeezed in a self-guided tour of the Elvis: Live from Vegas exhibit. There's a plethora of ridiculous jumpsuits, but not much else. We skipped the Elvis' Tupelo exhibit, mostly for time.Last up was a self-guided tour of the Elvis' Hawaii: Concerts, Movies and More! exhibit. This one was kind of hard to find; it's off by itself behind the Rock n' Roll Cafe. For the most part, this ""exhibit"" is just a gift shop with some movie and concert memorabilia thrown in. If you're short on time, don't feel bad about skipping this exhibit.All in all, it was a really enjoyable experience.We were in Memphis so we almost felt obliged to take the Graceland tour. We did but to be honest, we weren't expecting much. We thought it would be touristy and possibly cheesy.  We couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, it's touristy and expensive, but not cheesy in the least.The tour is basically self-guided, but with first class accompaniment. With your ticket, you are issued an iPad with earphones. The iPad provides a tour narrated by John Stamos. Along with the narration, a picture of each room is displayed which can be swept around a full 360 degrees. Additional multimedia is provided -- camera and video icons are display at various locations which, when tapped, show historic pictures or film footage.When you get to a room, Stamos describes the room, how it's furnished and decorated, its significance and how Elvis used it. At any time, you can pause the narration and spend more time looking around or viewing the historic pictures and film. When the narration for the room ends, a chime sounds indicating you're ready to begin the narration for the next room. Swipe to the left from the tab on the right side or double tap the tab and you're ready to go.The narration nicely describes the house and grounds and how Elvis used it. I particularly liked the story of Elvis' music success in the hall with his gold records, the story of Elvis' film career in the hall with his film posters and the story of how he resumed live concerts in the room with his wardrobe.  Fittingly enough, the tour ends at the site of the Presley family graves.All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend that you take the Graceland tour if you're in Memphis.Not worth the $40 per person admission (plus $10 in parking).  They don't allow tours in the top part of the mansion.  You only see the  basement and ground floor.  They insist you ride the bus across the street to and from the mansion (a very walkable distance) and yet they offered no assistance with our baby stroller.  It was a real hassle to cram it onto the over crowded bus, when we could have very easily walked across the street.The iPad guides do not allow you to move forward until it is done speaking, so you have to listen to the whole thing even if you are ready to move onto the next room.The trophy room was really impressive, and at least we can say been there done that.  Without this I would have give the whole experience one star.After becoming a resident of Memphis, I felt it was my obligation to visit Graceland.  I do like Elvis and his music and I truly did enjoy visiting Graceland.....once. Although  I think that one visit in a lifetime is enough for anyone, I feel that if you are an Elvis fan, you must go at least that one time. We toured the grounds and it seemed to go on and on.  I didn't like that fact that you really didn't have much of an opportunity to tour at your own pace due to the large crowd and the constant flow of customers through the narrow hallways and limited access routes. Overall I am glad that I went, but I won't go again.Graceland was great, the staff were helpful and it was very informative. I very much enjoyed being able to walk around and see something I thought I'd never see. The tour is done with iPads so if you are brining a little one with you Id bring earphones that fit them because they do not offer different sizes, my 7 year old had to deal with falling earphones the entire time.My open complain about this place is that people smoke everywhere. There is no designated smoke area and I find it inappropriate because of the children around. Other than walking though smoke the entire time. I have no other complains.","Ok i have to give varios stars.. 5 stars for the house, elvis grave, everything that has to do with elvis.. just the way it is... I loved to experience being in the place where the king has lived and seeing his stuff and beautiful house and range.. amazing !! Also really loved being able to pay my respects at his grave and from his parents.. now on to the bad part... what a money hunting operation goes behind this.. 10 dollars for parking????!!! Prices are overall wayyyyy to high... I took platinum tour payed 40 dollars a person that's not a problem but then on top 10 dollars parking???? And super cranky personal... Damn of all the personal only saw one older lady smile.. The rest rude rude rude and super uninterested!! Don't botter asking them any questions... they will just give you short rude uninterested answers and they dont serve you anything... bad bad bad... people spend alot of money and come from far away so a bit more interest in the people that come and make you have a job at graceland wouldn't hurt people.... Also after each ""attraction"" you directly enter a super expensive gift shop... wanted to buy a phone case... 40 dollars + tax! No way Jose.... oh yeah and at the beginning they make you a picture which you can pick up at the end.. 35 dollars + tax !!! Damn people who aren't rich aren't able to buy any souvenirs.. it's ridiculous!!! I ended buying a key chain for 10 bugs to at least have some souvenir... came a long way for this and seeing that people take advantage to such heights of elvis death is shamefull i belief. From what I have learned from elvis was that he was a giver to his fans... I'm sure he wouldn't be happy about the way his fans are treated.. i understand you have to pay entrance fee but all the other extras and the way you are treated... OH !! AND I HAD THIS COUPON FOR 4 DOLLARS OFF A PERSON ON MY PHONE FROM THEIR WEBSITE.. THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T PRINTED OFF SUCH CRAP!!!! REALLY DISAPOINTED. would give 5 stars if it was only for elvis but damn im so disappointed i just can't give 5 stars for it all..There's been a saying in Memphis that only out-of-towners go to Graceland but as a lifelong Memphian I've been to Graceland over 20 times. I've seen many changes over the years from an actual person in every room giving descriptions and telling stories, to everything being said on headphones and tape to now being on an iPad. Through their revitalizations/restorations and new things that popped up over the years and want is coming in the future Graceland is definitely a five star attraction. I've never been a huge fan on the restaurants that are located at the Graceland Plaza but that definitely does not impact me whatsoever when it comes to the shops, museums and Graceland. If you're in Memphis you HAVE to visit Graceland!Wow! Elvis was the man. Mad props.I'll admit I wanted to go to Graceland because it was on my quirky bucket list. I was beyond impressed. I learned a lot on this tour about the king of rock and roll. The mansion is a true time capsule of the mid 70's. Funky colors, jungle room, fabric on the walls, private jets, tomb stones, 100's of gold records and dozens of caped suits. If only the fabric walls could talk. If you're on the fence about this tour. GOOOO!I was only 12 when he died. So I really wasn't aware of his true impact of pop culture. He really did change the world on entertainment.A disclaimer up front: I'm not the world's biggest Elvis fan, so if you're obsessed with all things Elvis, feel free to ignore this review.When you first get to Graceland, you'll choose which tier of ticket you want to buy. The lowest tier, which we bought and includes only a tour of the mansion itself, is $36 per person. (The prices only go up from there of course, reaching an absurd $77 for the whole shebang.) While you wait a little while for a shuttle to pick you up, you can peruse the giftshop for various keychains, magnets, t-shirts, etc. When the shuttle comes, you'll get a an iPad with headphones and hop on the bus to head across the street to the mansion itself. There are no in-the-flesh tour guides anymore. Instead, you listen to some celebrity on your iPad. This is a neat idea and has some benefits, but I found myself tuning out our celebrity, John Stamos, because he really wasn't saying anything interesting most of the time. Lead by Uncle Jesse himself, we were herded through the narrow halls like cattle, briefly looking at each of the rooms but not actually entering them. They looked... well, pretty much like you'd expect -- like tacky, opulent '70s rooms. By the end, my wife and I were both ready to call it a day and picked up our pace through the final few rooms.Bottom line: Unless you're a rabid fan of the King, stay away from this overpriced march of tedium.Obviously you cannot go wrong with Elvis! I visited Memphis for the first time and decided to go to the home of Elvis. There is definitely tons of information and the tour is about 2-3 hours, depending on how deep you get into all the information provided. The tour is self-guided once the buses drop you off and you can go at your own pace. They give you i-Pads that give you information on each section of Elvis' home. The idea behind the i-Pad is good, in that it gives the visitor tons of information and things about Elvis. The downside is that you have to carry it around your neck for three hours and keep you headphones on so it is hard to have a conversation if you are with someone. Still..definitely worth the visit! Graceland also features Elvis' home in a time line fashion so you go through each section as though it was a different time period in his life. Truly a fun experience for all, especially especially especially Elvis fans. This is a must see if you are a visitor to Memphis.This was the most awesome thing I have ever experienced! The platinum tour was well worth the money and the wait. It was amazing and informative and in my opinion, priceless! I have wanted to go to Graceland my whole life and it was everything I hoped and dreamed it would be. There were plenty of opportunities to take pictures and soak up the Elvis goodness. Please stop and take this tour. You will not be disappointed!I did not know much about Elvis before visiting, being born in 1986 means I haven't been that exposed to his music, so I did not know what to expect of his home. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Regardless of who lived there, it was very fascinating to see what a home from the 70's looked like, especially one with state-of-the-art entertainment equipment and appliances. I loved the old-school black and white CRT television sets and the wooden panels in the kitchen. Old-school American kitchens are awesome.Everything about Elvis himself was very interesting as well, his rise to fame, his philanthropy, his acting career and his return to music. I was, however, quite disappointed of how biased and one-sided the telling of his life story was. Nothing about his death, nothing about his substance abuse, nothing about his weight gain and troubles late in life. I don't see these things as anything that belittles or makes his life worth less, it just makes him more human and his story much more interesting. He was, after all, human, but the tour makes him out to be more of a demi-god.We bought the $45 tour, meaning that we had access to the studio archives, his cars and his private jets. Honestly, the mansion tour was more than enough in itself. While fun to see some of his cars (his famous, pink Cadillac was unfortunately on tour) and his jets from the inside, it wasn't worth the price jump.If you come to Memphis, you have to visit Elvis' house. We had a VIP tour and dinner here. The house is well maintained and the tour is good, there's a little place to eat here but didn't try it, during the VIP tour we had very good BBQ and they were showing some Elvis' movies.Definitely a nice and entertaining exhibition. The premises are well kept, and the iPad guide blends nicely with the physical tour for a very good experience. On the downside, the tour is rather short, you are not allowed into Elvis' room on the second floor, and the add-ons, which are bought separately (car museum, archives and others) are not worth the money or the time.All in all, I would leave feeling I had a positive experience had it not been for the fact that it is a super expensive tour (the second most basic tour is over 40 dollars!).The trip to Graceland was spontaneous. We had attempted to go before but were chased away by prices. We decided to take the plunge this time and it was worth every penny. It blew us away. For anyone that is a fan of pop culture or hey for anyone- this was an amazing experience. I am going to want to return one day. It is indescribable.What an absolutely wonderful self-guided tour of the mansion where Elvis lived. This was a bucket list item that I'm glad I did. The cost was a bit high, but why not? So close and would've regretted not doing it  a must doI love Elvis and had always been intrigued by the thought of walking through Graceland -- my boyfriend and I were staying in Nashville and I would have never forgiven myself if we didn't take the trip out to Memphis while we were down there :) There were a few different tour options (going to see his cars, his planes, etc.) but we were just interested in seeing the mansion. It was really neat to see the Lisa Marie standing right there in the parking lot though. We were given a tour time and number, and waited to be called to the shuttle buses to head onto the Graceland property. The gift shop is cute, lots of fabulously tacky trinkets for sale. Fast forward to waiting in line to board the shuttle, each guest was given an iPad and a set of headphones so they could listen to corresponding information as they entered each room/area of Graceland. I appreciated all the information available on the iPads (plus who doesn't love a good John Stamos narration) and it was interesting hearing from Lisa Marie and Priscilla; however at times I found it distracting. I felt it took away from really taking in each room and feeling the true spirit of Elvis.I was disappointed the tour did not take us upstairs but I completely respect the decision to rope it off. As we learned on the tour, Elvis was a private person (bit ironic considering we were all invading his house) so I think it was tasteful to keep some of the house private. We were able to see most of the house and the grounds, as well as an entire building which housed all his golden records, awards, famous costumes, and iconic outfits (so cool!). The tour concludes with a stop at the meditation garden, where Elvis, his mother, father, and grandmother are laid to rest. There is even a commemorative plaque for his twin brother who died at birth (buried in their hometown of Tupelo, Mississippi) -- I didn't even know he had a twin brother! I turned off my iPad when I walked into the garden and it was very moving. The entire experience was very special and I'm so glad I had the chance to visit this iconic house.As a Memphis resident for the last 29 years, taking visitors to Graceland is like Jury Duty; a civic responsibility you try to skirt out of. I've toured the house from the times tour guides had to memorize their lines. This is the first time visiting in the summer time.PARKING: $10 You have a variety of tour packages, from the basic house stroll to the all encompassing visit, planes and all.THE HOUSE TOUR: you get an IPad and headphones. The narrator is John Stamos. Uncle Jesse does a good job, and with the tablet, you get video snippets and photos to compliment your Graceland Experience.With smartphones, true fans go crazy taking photos in the house. Outside, an addition lets you see Elvis trajectory, from records, to Hollywood, to Vegas and touring...some of these accolades used to be crammed in the racquetball court, but now his jumpsuits take center stage there.Seeing the faces of wonder in fans, old and young alike, it's worth the price of admission.It's not the Biltmore, but it's Memphis Royalty preserved, and hopefully improved for future generations.Long live The King!I came here at 4:00 PM on a Tuesday after realizing I had a day to kill in Little Rock with nothing to do and I'm glad I made the trip. There was barely anyone there that late in the day, I got to move at my own pace which let me cruise through faster than most would, I also got some really great decorating ideas for my new house. I'm thinking about a jungle themed living room?The Elvis stuff was pretty cool, but I thought we were going to a Jeff Buckley theme park.Five stars and my 5th time visiting.  Swanky new ipads since last time with added video clips.  A lovely home for a lovely King, I've seen grown men with tears in their eyes here, it never gets boring - just a great deal and great gift shops.Graceland was better than expected.  Takes about 5 hrs (+/-) to see everything and has lots of great info to learn on the King.  The only downside is there is little to no info on the later years of Elvis, especially near and at the end.  Tours range from $36 to $77 per person, depending on how much you would like to see. RECOMMENDATION:  Bring a fat-tip Sharpie to leave your mark on the wall for the King.Now I'm not a big Elvis fan but touring Graceland reminded me of his incredible impact on the music scene. I was also not aware of his humanitarian side. He gave a great deal of money to less fortunateThe house is kind of small and very much overdone in the 60s/70s style. The tour is based around the use of iPads and like others who have reviewed GL I would have preferred a human tour guide. The tour is crowded; they need to cut down the size of groups. It is also somewhat claustrophobic in there. The most interesting thing to see was the Trophy Building. Dozens and dozens of various awards, outfits, and props. The only thing restraining me from a 5 star rating here was the price. If you are not a total Elvis fan you will leave feeling you didn't get value for your money.Soooo much fun! Although, I've never been a big Elvis buff as I am 33 years old and didn't grow up in his time period. My family talks about him &amp; very much loves him. While I was passing through Memphis, my friend &amp; I did the mansion tour. It was a blast! It's an iPad guided tour, go at your own pace with John Stamos as your audio guide. So much fun! Would love to go back &amp; explore more of the property. Too bad you can't go upstairs but that's ok it's still worth the trip!!Although I'm not a huge fan of Elvis, I feel this is a must see while in Memphis, so I went. The line was ridiculously long, so as other reviewers mentioned, be sure to arrive early! The mansion itself isn't what I expected it to be in terms of size. The original 1970s decorations are absolutely fabulous though! The jungle room is really neat to see in person. It's disappointing that they don't let you go upstairs, but I do understand they are continuing to honor Elvis' wish, as he did not allow guests in his bedroom while he was alive. Another downside is that you are herded through like cattle in a single file line, and there isn't much time to stop and take it all in.Regardless of the negatives, I would definitely recommend Graceland. It's a piece of rock and roll history, and if that doesn't interest you, the psychedelic decor should be enough to motivate you to go!","I would have never thought I would be leaving Memphis this soon, and that I would leave with 849 reviews under my belt (I won't lie, I kind of slacked off recently).  With that being said, I think it is only appropriate to write this review the day I leave Memphis.Given the fact that Elvis is one of those people that is somewhat popular, having almost full access to the grounds he lived his adult life can be pretty busy.  Hell, they have a hotel, a $5 per car parking lot, and blocks of touristy things all things Elvis.  What am I getting at?  This place can get BUSY.Except the day I went.  I have no idea when it was exactly except it was a Friday afternoon, it was cold, and it was rainy  (hell, it was around Christmas, since the decorations were up)- for me- that is a perfect recipe to go to a touristy place.  Upon entering, please take note they have 3-4 different ticket levels- and you can utilize your AAA card to get a few bucks off.  I went all in, and got the VIP entourage.  I assume that it would REALLY come in handy on peak days.  It was still fine with me, because I got full access at my fingertips.As I boarded the VIP shuttle, they brought me across the street (where Graceland is actually housed, on the north side Elvis Presley Blvd) to the side of the house.  I felt real special.  As we (when I say we, I mean the shuttle driver and I) approached, I noticed the decorations were up for the holidays.  They told me those were original Christmas decorations- I thought that was cool.  Then it was time to go through the house.  One thing I think is cool is that you start the tour at the front door.  And you can take as many pictures as you want (sans flash).  The house is something else I tell you.  You are not allowed upstairs though (I hear that is sacred ground).  It is one of the most unique houses I have ever been in.  I could only imagine the amount of drugs and debauchery were done on this property.After the main house, you go through other buildings, and you see were the King and his family are buried (near the pool).  Gives you chills, I tell you.  I spent a lot of time there.  While on property, it is amazing the amount of awards and memorabilia are on property- it is crazy since it is just for one man who accomplished all of this.After going back to the side of the house, I saw one more exhibit, which had a bunch of Lisa Marie's child hood toys and stuff.  I was then greeted by another shuttle.  They took me behind the scenes, and then dropped me back across the street to the rest of the exhibits (that came with my primo ticket).  One of these tickets included Elvis's cars.  That was pretty cool if you like that sort of thing.  I did find it funny how after each exhibit there was a gift shop unique to each one.  Damn they try to milk the King's fame to the max!Then there were a few other smaller exhibits, a central gift shop, restaurants, and even 2 planes you could walk through.  Those were cool as well.All in all, being able to see how the King of Rock n Roll lived in his adulthood is truly fascinating.  The way they have persevered everything is even more fascinating.  Even if you are not an Elvis fan seeing this stuff is iconic to American culture.  This is a not to be missed, and try to plan it when everyone else is NOT expecting to go (sunny days, weekends, ETC)I am not an Elvis fan and have never professed to be. But on an American road trip that goes through Memphis, it is virtually a cardinal sin not to visit the house of The King!During our visit, I was pleasantly surprised &amp; very much enjoyed the self guided tour of his property, his aircraft &amp; his car collection. Having the audio guide may be a little boring in spots for a non Elvis fan, however is well worth it to get a perspective of areas of his house and leaves an impression of what he did for the music industry. Well worth the visit if you are passing through, fan or not...I am not a die hard Elvis fan - came to Graceland out of interest, to see the spectacle - and it really is exactly that. Expensive in comparison to other tourist attractions it is but a well maintained and presented museum. The bus service from the visitor centre to the mansion and back was a bit over the top - surely a foot bridge or underpass would suffice. Tablet tour guide was good - and enabled best use of multimedia (matching music with various eras of Elvis' career). Museum felt very sugar coated - didn't cover whole life, just recording career, and didn't cover artistic influences, divorce, drug use, health problems or cause of death. I guess some people want to present a particular idealized image of Elvis even to this day - not allow him to be understood warts and all. See it for the spectacle it is, but don't expect to get away cheaply. (Parking on site was an additional $10!)If you are going to come here, get ready to spend a lot of money, wait in lines, and just wait in general. First, the parking is $10 and the cheapest ticket you can get is for $36.00 for adults, $32.40 for seniors and that's just for the mansion tour. It says on the website that it comes with the Tupelo exhibit but the ticket I ended up purchasing also said the same thing, however, the physical ticket did not have the Tupelo exhibit listed on it. I purchased the platinum tour ticket which was for $40 and included the automobile exhibit tour, Sincerely Elvis (not listed on the website or their boards as an exhibit included with this ticket), I Shot Evlis exhibit, and Elvis Hawaii exhibit. Note: the website and their signs outside the ticketing area did say that the platinum comes with the Tupelo exhibit but I guess that was replaced with the Sincerely Elvis exhibit. We went and checked out the automobile exhibit first which turned out to be pretty cool. You then exit right into a gift shop. Everything here exits right into a gift shop except for the mansion! Next stop was the Sincerely Elvis exhibit which consisted of Elvis' jumpsuits and other clothing items. Then it was time for I Shot Elvis exhibit which housed some interesting photographs and the stories behind them, the photographers, etc. Last, we searched for the Elvis Hawaii exhibit but I have to say, don't waste your time looking for it. I have read some reviews stating that this exhibit was nothing special and I should have listened. It is located kind of far off the other main exhibits, amidst 4 gift shops and a restaurant but the ""exhibit"" room was  small, consisted of some screens playing Elvis movie clips, some posters, and awfully cheesy ""Hawaii"" decor.Finally, it was our turn to take the tour of the mansion. You stand in line when your number is called and they do photos before you continue to the line where they hand you your ipad and headphones and usher you to the shuttle that will take you across the street to the mansion grounds.  You don't have to purchase these photographs but in case you are wondering, it comes with an 8x10 (I believe) and 4 wallet-sized photos for $35+taxes which comes to about $38 and change. The mansion tour itself was nice. It was the best part of the tour. You get to see the luxurious way Elvis, his family, and friends lived their lives. Although the decor were very outdated, you can tell that they are high quality and most likely the best at that time. You get to go down the basement, tour through the media room as well as the pool room with the ceiling and the walls decorated in some funky patterned cloth. It's the best I can describe it. You then go up the stairs and to your right is the jungle room -- the decorations are once-again, very 1970s with carpets all over the ceiling and walls as well as the floors. There was also the carport, his dad's office located in a smaller building just outside the mansion, a building with his awards, and the Racquetball building. Of course, last but not least the tour takes you to the Meditation Garden where Elvis, his mom and dad, and grandmother's remains currently reside.Last thing was the Achieve. This is where you can see some items from his day-to-day life. There is also a 15-minute condensed film of his career as a musician. I thought it was very interesting and informative.Overall, it was a different experience. The staff were fairly friendly and if you are an Elvis fan, it is worth the trip.This is my second time here in 5 years, and it was same this time as it was the last. It has some great history to it, but it is also very, very sad. Whats even sadder is that his grandmother outlived everyone! The wait to get over to the house was pretty long, and it sucked standing out in the heat, but it's worth it in the end. If I were you I would go ahead and spend the extra 5 bucks and get the airplane tour as well. But, if you want to shell out $70 bucks a person, then you can get the full tour with the car museum as well. They not have iPads that are a lot more interactive than the old way that they use to do things. It's pretty cool and worth the money.T C B ! I will be back. Very impressed with  graceland. All the employees were nice and respectful. The only thing was i needed more of the tour i did not want the day to end! 998I wasn't a big Elvis fan until I visited Graceland. I didn't dislike him but I didn't particularly like him either. I was ambivalent. Well, one visit to Graceland changed all that and now I truly think that a visit to Memphis is incomplete without a trip to the King's residence. Yes, it's expensive but it's worth it. Of course, there's the outlandish decor, the racy cars and all the awards but what surprised me was how behind it all was a down to earth, humble &amp; generous man who gave so much to his friends, family and the Memphis community. I'm proud to say I'm now a fully-fledged Elvis fan!We always try to go to Graceland when we visit Memphis. We really enjoy going back in time and seeing everything about Elvis. What many people don't understand is that this house sat out in the middle of nowhere back in the 50's and at the time it was a huge house. Most people think of it in todays standards and think it quite small. I'm glad that they have opened up some of the other areas that years ago were closed to the public. Try to imagine you are Elvis, who came form a poor upbringing, lived in a shotgun house in MS. when you view the rooms in the house. Can you imagine having 3 TV sets to watch each major network? Be sure you take your time looking at all the memorabilia in the show cases. parking is easy and so it the shuttle that takes you over there.No visit to Memphis is complete without a visit to Elvis' home.  You need to allow 3 hours to fully view the mansion, car museum, studio archives, and airplanes.  I suggest going as early in the morning as possible and purchasing the Platinum tour. Allow an additional 1 hour if you plan to browse gift shops and gallery.  I've been here twice and haven't been bored.  My favorites are both trophy buildings which hold his numerous awards and stage costumes.  There were plenty of fellow Americans here as witnessed by license plates from every state in the parking lot.   We were outnumbered by British, German, Australian and French tourists which was neat to see because Elvis worried that he might be forgotten.Maybe I got lucky, but I visited the mansion on a Wednesday around noon and flew through the tour. The line for the shuttle bus was short. I didn't listen to the iPad interactive/Uncle Jesse narrated tour. Those IPads are annoying. I just walked around the pad and read up on what interested me and breezed through the whole thing. I was done in about 45 minutes with the entire house tour. The planes and cars took another 20 minutes. The info center and places to eat are way outdated and reminded me of a bad '70s tourist trap time warp. They also take a green screen picture of you and your friends before you go on the bus. They'll try to hustle you for $35 after the tour. It's a rip. Overall nice afternoon well spent for this out-of-towner.Can I give this place 6 stars??? So I came here when I was about 13 yo with my brother and parents during a spring break trip to New Orleans and natcheze. I completely did not appreciate this place when I first came. We got the package that also included the car museum and the planes as well as the archives. The upgraded tickets are nice but not a must have. We went around 1 and there was not an open tour until 230 so we drove to ms to check that off my wife's list and then just sat in our car with the ac on charging our phones.We were greeted to iPads that had uncle Jesse from full house giving the tour guide. I am a big fan of true rock n roll - Johnny cash, Clapton, Dylan, winwood, Morrison, but will say I have not listened to much Elvis and am rather ashamed of it after the tour. Ep was such a techie. And the house shows it. I teared up at the grave site. Stamos you ass, why do you have to be so sentimental.I will say - and this is a bit odd - but Graceland has some great bathrooms. After 2 meals of ribs in the day before, I tried out 3 different ones during my visit and they were all nice and clean. This is a great place to come, but I do feel one needs to be of a certain age and certain interest in music to truly appreciate it.Took my mom on a trip to cross the top thing off her bucket list.....shes a huge Elvis fan.  She saw him in the 70' and has XM radio just to get the Elvis channel !!  I think Elvis is ok, I don't mind most of his songs, but would never buy one of his cd's and I think some of his movies can be kitchy fun.  But I didn't know if I was going to like the tour and even thought about dropping my mom off and picking her up later.  But I went and I am glad I did !!!     My mom got the most expensive package so she could see everything, I got a cheaper one and couldn't go on the planes but got to see most of the other things.  The car exhibit was decent but you can walk through pretty fast, some of the other exhibits for me were overkill....but obviously my mom loved everything.  But the thing that made me give it a 4 star is the mansion tour, yeah I loved it !!!  All but the 2 main rooms as you walk in the house have a late 60's early 70's kind of look but were much cooler then what I grew up with cause obviously he had a lot of money.  And with that money he really made some fun rooms, the jungle room was cool and the whole down stairs basement rocked !!!  The rooms they converted into awards rooms including the racketball court building are pretty fun, especially seeing all his old sequined costrumes.  Just a really cool experience !!     So if you are like me and are not the biggest Elvis fan, then just pay for the cheapest ticket so you can see the mansion and if you like 60's and 70's stuff you shouldn't be disappointed.  It was one of those things where I wasn't expecting much and really was surprised....oh yeah we spent like 6 hours there !!!This Place Is Amazing ! A Must If Your In The Area !the tour takes awhile but you won't know it cause time flies by herethere is so much to see.i was not the biggest Elvis fan before coming here and after seeing this tour i have a whole new Respect for the late king.all in all this is just something you must experiance WARNING: Some Of The Staff Here Is EXTREMELY MEAN !When I think of Memphis, the things that immediately come to mind are barbeque, blues, and Elvis. I will not claim to be a big Elvis fan, but I have been known to hum along to some of his songs. I love New Orleans and Hawaii and those places love Elvis. And you know, a woman in love needs must investigate everything that her beloved loved before she came along... So when I made it to Memphis, it simply was a matter of course for me to check out Graceland.The most glaringly obvious has to be said right off the bat: it is touristy. But Memphis and Elvis are kind of like peanut butter and jelly, so it is to be expected that tons of people -- big Elvis fans, casual Elvis fans, and/or people looking to kill some time alike -- come to Graceland to pay homage to The King. Across the street from the mansion is a museum that holds his prized automobiles. It is not very big, but it does offer an insight to Elvis' big love for cars and is perfect if you missed the shuttle that would take you to Graceland. There are also planes but we chose not to pay the extra bucks for it, because as mentioned, we are just casual Elvis fans. Once you make it to Graceland, the opulence is inescapable. The classic columns and the majestic lions bid you welcome, and inside are the elegant chandeliers and the luxuries of 1970's America. I particularly loved the Jungle Room, which would be called ""kitschy"" if found elsewhere. The rest of Elvis memorabilia are also quite neat: gold records, awards, Elvis suits... I imagine a true Elvis fan would have been at least three times more excited than I was.Graceland is indeed a must see when in Memphis. After all, we all know how big of an influence Elvis was to music history and pop culture. It is really neat to get a glimpse of this great man's life.I visited the home of the King in February..it all started with a concert nearby on my birthday to see Jerry Lee Lewis..i decided to have a rock and roll birthday trip and see Graceland as well.  I also happen to share a birthday with his daughter Lisa Marie.Just driving onto Elvis Presley Blvd, my sister and I (blaring Elvis tunes in my car) were so excited!!You walk from the parking lot into an airport like area for ticket purchasing..we had decided to go with the VIP option, as it offered a few extra perks, and lets face it..how many times will we go to Graceland??You then get a headset device that will talk to you thru the whole tour and play music that is timed with the rooms you go into, and get on a little bus to drive up to the mansion.  When you get there, you almost cant believe the front door youre actually standing in front of..and then you walk in.  I instantly got a chill..with the second floor of the home being strictly guarded and no access allowed, the stairs blocked off..it begs the question..is he alive in there? will i see a door open mysteriously, a shadow cross in front of me..?The house was restored to the decoration style of when Priscilla lived there, so its all kinds of fun 70s themed colored and patterns and fabrics..the tour is very informative, showing all sides of this legendary man.Theres soooo much to see here..from the clothes to the records to the cars to the picutes and personal belongings..it really is awe inspiring.You go from building to building on a little bus and see all that you want, as a VIP we couldve gone back and seen things more than once and even skipped lines, but there are serious hours of history here..ending up in the old raquetball room, which now houses countless platinum and gold records, you are told this is the last place he was alive..and you hear a clip of Priscillas reaction to the news of his death..my sister and I were in tears..the music playing on your headset really sets the emotional tone also..we got to tour his planes, which were out of this world awesome..also all the cars..really neat..the gift shops are amazing, everyone on the whole compund was really friendly, it was such a fun experience! i will add that all the merchandise there says Graceland: where Elvis lives..not LIVED past tense..im just saying..I did start to feel like, maybe i was intruding..so many times in the tour, and in the book I bought there, they said how he was such a private man in his personal life..would he really want all these people in his home? Visiting the graves of him and his family..which are very beautiful..?Even if this isnt on your bucket list..if you find youreself walking in Memphis..please go see Mr Presleys amazing home, all the history, and I dare you to not feel like hes right there with you.I am the biggest Elvis Pressley fan 70 and the first time I got to come to Graceland I was 10 years old and I was in all as we entered the music note gates famously seen on TV and on the news so many times as we drove up the drive and saw those pillars to that big white house I imagine being Elvis the king himself. It's probably not as big as someone expect but it's the history and the essence of Elvis from wall-to-wall a truly original experience and a couple of things that really shocked me where his horse that we're still out there in the pasture and the display of all of his outfits The rooms of the house which there are certain sections that are cut off from the public because someone in his family actually still lives there, then there is The collection of his cars and motorcycles, the Lisa Marie private jet and August of all is the whole family buried in their graves by the poolside. A few years ago they had the one night movie theater event of the Elvis concert tour remastered and I was the only person in the theater that was under 65 years old and I was shocked but every time I go to Nashville this is a spot that I must stop and see again!I really enjoyed my visit to Graceland.I loved the mansion itself. I thought it was interesting that John Stamos is your virtual guide on the iPad they give you for your tour. I was skeptical about it but it actually enhanced the tour. I learned some neat things about Elvis that I didn't know. He is buried there &amp; I was surprised to see people crying while gathered around his grave. He truly had a big impact on a lot of people. I'm very glad I had the chance to go.You can pick up free shuttles from Beale Street that will take you to Graceland. They're sponsored by Sun Studios. I think it took 20 minutes to get there.The shuttle drops you off across from the house and you buy your tickets. It's worth it to do VIP. Otherwise you'll spend all your time waiting in line for everything. There are LITERALLY thousands of people. You get your own private shuttle to the house and immediately start your tour. We got to go through the house twice. The package includes all the exhibits which are located across the street from the house--planes, cars, costumes, his music and movie awards, etc. We couldn't finish everything in one day and we asked if we could come back to finish it and they let us, with absolutely no hassle. My favorite parts of the tour were the house (he has a TV in every single room, even the kitchen) and seeing a large case with hundreds of his checks to charity (major philanthropist!). I also liked seeing his jewelry and costumes.  Bradford is the Elvis fanatic, so I thought it would be cheesy, but I honestly had the best time. Elvis is such a big part of popular culture--so it's fun when I hear him brought up now, to have a visual connection to Memphis and Graceland.This was my 8th trip to Graceland in my 33 years of being on this planet- seven times as a child and once as an adult. So glad we decided to spend our last afternoon in Memphis at Graceland. I grew up listening to a lot of Southern rock-n-roll and as a kid I adored Elvis. It's pretty cool that his estate is open to the public like this.I liked the addition of iPads to the tour. I was not sure about it at first, but after walking into the mansion, I really appreciated being able to go at my own pace and take in everything that was around me with the help of John Stamos. Being inside of the mansion is so surreal. Priscilla and Lisa Marie add commentary to some rooms and it gives you the chills. Walking through the backyard, I stopped and just stared out at the horse pasture. I had lost my BFF inside the house and I ended up being way ahead of her. It was a good 5-6 minutes of silence and imagination while I stared out. It was a beautiful time and the serenity garden made me a little teary eyed. Maybe I should have put the iPad away at that moment! The land is beautifully maintained and you can tell the employees actually like being there and mingling with the guests. Thanks for that!The rest of the tour package I purchased included the car museum, the airplanes, the Hawaii exhibit, and the archives. Out of all of those the archive movie was my favorite and from what I understand it is a new(ish) addition to the tour. It was really nice to be able to take all that in and actually see, through the years, how fame got to Elvis- as macabre as that may sound.Overall, I was very happy to go back there and I will do it again next time I am in town. You cannot pass that up. There is no reason!Unbelievable. Go immediately. Fabulous tour. We stayed for 3.5 hrs and would've stayed longer. Don't expect to get any decent food in the area. Highly recommend this tour.","Graceland is a must when visiting Memphis. My parents and I had it on our list of things to do from the get-go.  Upon our arrival, we purchased our tickets and saw that our tour would be self guided with the aid of an iPad and headphones. I was intrigued by this and thought it would be good to go at our own pace. As we went through the tour, I found it to be impersonal and would have actually preferred to have a tour guide. The iPads were a bit of a distraction and congested up the viewing areas in the mansion with guests who were having trouble operating the technology. As far as the staff that is currently there, most if them seem to loathe their jobs. When standing in lines for the shuttle buses, the staff members give directions like they are herding cattle. After the tour of the mansion, we got on the shuttle to go to the archive building and the girl in the front seat simply shouted ""iPads"" and we gave up our tablets. During the ride, we were given scripted directions that were said in a very exasperated tone. After the archives tour, we boarded another shuttle and the guide on that bus gave directions again and did not get out of his seat and address the guests. He talked towards the front of the bus and no one was able to hear him. As far as security guards, we found them sitting in their respective golf cart and SUV chatting under the shade of a tree in the far end of the parking lot. While it was interesting to see a great part of history, our experience was soured by poor attitudes. It may benefit to have an option of self guided tours (with the iPad) or personal tour guides. A change in the attitudes of the staff is a MUST.No regrets having visited.  The thing that strikes you when you go in, is how ""small"" it is, compared to what one visualizes in one's mind (before visiting).Other than being an incredible musician/performer/actor, Elvis was a humanitarian as well - not sure if that is well-known.  Listening to the interviews made me realize that even when he was very rich, he always donated money to the less fortunate.  He never forgot his very humble beginnings.Seeing the living room (which I had seen in pictures), and other areas (i.e. the ""jungle room"", the pool room) made me realize that I was walking in the footsteps of someone who made a lot of people happy.We couldn't go all the way to Memphis and not go to Graceland, so we had to check it out. They have different tours available from $36-$75. You have options of just touring the mansion, the mansion with planes and museums, and they have some VIP options that allow you to cut the line (if there is one). We went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all. We waiting about 15 minutes in line to take the 2 minute shuttle ride to the mansion. The tour was self guided with an ipad and headphones. It was a little creepy that the ipad knew what room you were in. I personally thought the house felt a little haunted and after being in there for about 5 minutes, I was ready to get out. Some of the rooms are really interesting and wild. There is a lot to see and if you love Elvis, I highly suggest checking it out at least once in your life. I wasn't a big Elvis fan but it was still interesting to tour the mansion. $75 dollar is a little steep for VIP. I wouldn't pay more than $45. They also take AAA discount.My boyfriend and I went to Graceland on a long weekend in Memphis.  Neither of us are really Elvis fans, but I think it was worth the time to go and see a place this cool!Thanks to the pouring rain, and it being Superbowl Sunday, Graceland was a ghost town, which I think really helped us to enjoy the experience.  I think there was a total of ten people at the estate while we there.  The house was really neat, and the decorating (mainly done by the King himself), is downright bizarre, but gives you a sense of the guy behind ""The King.""  An entire building of awards and charitable causes he supported was one of my favorite parts of the tour.  My favorite was the planes, though.  I'm glad we added that to our tour.  The inside of the Lisa Marie is just mind boggling.  I mean, gold plated seat belt buckles.  The extravagance at that point in Elvis' life is so redneck crazy.  The next best part was the section in the car museum that talked about all of the ""toys"" that Elvis' entourage rode around in/on while on the grounds.  Ridiculous golf carts, super trikes, motorcycles, and more.  The one thing I will say (and what keeps this from being a 5 star review), is that the cost is EXORBITANT.  $45 per person for the tour, and unless you're a super mega fan (and I know that Elvis has more of those than anyone), the tour takes a couple of hours all told.What a waste of money!Prices range from $34 to $72, not including the $10 to park.It was interesting to see, but definitely not worth the money.  Only one third of the profits actually go to the Presley family.  And after every exhibit you have to go through a gift shop.Too bad some of the profits don't go towards helping out the Memphis locals.Honestly, kind of a let-down and a shakedown. -- It's like DisneyLand, get there, get nickel and dimed for extra features, be forced into their concessions and leave with a bunch of tacky pictures. Okay, actually DisneyLand actually has fun rides and Mickey.After you buy an over-priced ticket for about $35 dollars, you will have to wait about an hour to simply cross the street and begin the tour of Elvis' house. To some degree I understand since there's limited room inside Elvis' love-den but don't make us stand in lines for an hour of wasted time. They should just call back group Y at say 1:15 for the shuttle so you can view the other exhibits rather stand there idly. Poor planning.After you check out the crib and see the shaggy sex decor the rest of the grounds is basically gold records and outfits. I'm not that much of a celebrity freak that I gush to see something Elvis once touched or sat in. I guess if you deify his worldly possessions like his classic cars then bow and snap pics to your heart's content.Maybe this is the wrong place, but only by slow-absorption osmosis do you begin to get a sense of who Elvis really was. I wanted to learn more about how he learned his talents, his musical inspirations, his personality and what he was all about. But it's more showy to the life of extravagance Elvis had than a meditative experience of whom Elvis was and the impact he had.It is a classic Memphis attraction, but unless I adored Elvis, to this Suspicious Mind I felt that it was more of a tourist trap than culturally enlightening.Graceland was everything I expected it to be. There was a lot to see and I can say that after 3+ hours I learned more about Elvis than I ever cared to know (can you tell I was dragged there by a friend?). The planes were the highlight of the trip, so go for the package that gives you access to them. But, there is no need for the super deluxe skip-the-line package, because the lines were never long.While very interesting , the tour is not a guided tour. You hang an uncomfortable contraption around your neck with headphones , which I can't help but wonder, are they sanitized when returned. The snack stand is robbery , as is the souvenir store. If coming here by bus, pack a lunch.Worth the wait. The experience was amazing. Stopped by on my road trip to Austin. The interactive tour was very informative. Should definitely stop by if you're in the area.We were told we HAD to go. We paid the $10 parking fee, took one look at the lines and the prices, and RAN OUT OF THERE. Felt like idiots, so slowed to a trot and then when we were passed by another couple running the hell out of there also. I think I'll just watch a documentary instead.Graceland is, well, my Graceland!  For anyone that loves music, you'll know that Elvis has in one way or another had an impact on today's music industry.  And has since he first plucked a guitar string. Graceland is what every Elvis fan and those that are curious about him should go and visit. It is, WOW!  Now, if you want to know what inspired him, his personal everyday life activities, the father, husband and belongings, then forget Graceland.  For that info, go to Wikipedia.  Graceland is Elvis the showman, his home, outfits, awards, gold records, etc.  This is the wow factor. Make sure you get the tickets that give you access to the airplanes (which I hear are not going to be there for much longer) and the car museum. The car museum is pretty good. He's pink caddy, limo and other personal cars are there.  There are about three or four other separate exhibits which are worth checking out. You'll have to pay for parking, there are gift shops everywhere and the food is generic.  And everything is pricey.  People everywhere, some long lines.  And we weren't being forced to purchase any pictures they took of us.  What we bought, it was our choice to pay that sum here in Graceland over buying them in the drug store down the street. So, for a tourist attraction, it's everything you'll expect.  If you're tight with your money, forget it.  Go visit a public park.  But if you're visiting the city of Memphis or the state of Tennessee for that matter, and you're a fan of music and it's history, go to Graceland.  The only reason why I don't give four stars is because the tour of his home could have been more organized.  Once they drop you off at his front door, it's everyone for themselves.  You can't get a good grasp of what your seeing because there are no lines and they are dropping off people every so many minutes to start the tour. They give you an iPad and earphones to listen to John Stamos narrate the tour and your off!  You can't really listen to John and keep up with what you're seeing.  So, I listened to a couple of seconds and walked ahead to next part of the house. Overall, I got a good look of everything. And remember, Elvis is alive!I once asked my Spin/Yoga instructor to play Elvis songs for the Yoga class instead of the usually Himalayan Yoga music. After my husband told me that he planning to trough Memphis on our road trip to Arkansas, I told him that we must make a stop in Graceland. We arrived around noon on a Sunday and there was almost a 2-hour wait before we boarded the bus to tour the house. Just before boarding the bus, we were given an iPad and a headphone so we could listen to the tour narration. Being Elvis' home, the way it looks on the inside does not match the exterior of the house at all. I think Elvis' personality really came through in those rooms. Even though they are very flashy, I could see that it was also comforting to the family. I enjoyed the narration by John Stamos, Lisa Marie Presley and Priscilla Presley. The narration brought Elvis' larger than life persona to a down to earth level. I like the music that they used in the audio tour. I couldn't help not singing along.I am a huge fan so yes I am biased. I loved every second there. The staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable. The grounds were spotless. I will be back I loved it. This trip only made me more of a fan!I did not have the full Graceland experience, as I was with a private group that had rented out the space, but I did enjoy the parts I saw.Touring his home was so fun.  Such a great idea to use the audio tour, so one can take one's time.  Seeing the cheesy expensive decor which was probably the ultimate back in the day was so cool.  And how many people are fortunate enough to have their own jungle room, complete with waterfall?  Just Elvis, that's who!   Seeing all his gold records and awards really brought home the fact that he died way too young - he was only 42, and to have already accomplished so much in his career is amazing.   Even though I am not a 'true' Elvis fan, it still brought tears to my eyes to see his grave in the Memorial Garden.We went and explored his two planes next, quick tours, and then spent some time, and money, in the gift shop.  Then to a great exhibit that covered Elvis and his Las Vegas experiences.  Fun to see so many of his jumpsuits there - nobody loved a good jumpsuit like Elvis.Finished up our visit with a catered BBQ dinner in Elvis' Automobile Museum.  What an awesome collection of cars.  Neat, too, that they had personal videos of Elvis and Priscilla playing in that room on televisions.I think that love him or hate him, you will still find a visit to Graceland fascinating.Definitely worth a trip.  It was awesome to see how he lived and his accomplishments. You dont get to go upstairs,  but you get a good feel by walking thru the rest of the home.Couple things i was disappointed about relates to their service.  Look staff - it is expensive having spent $100 for 3 of us - is it so hard to be courteous??  Several times we asked for help and the response was cold and unfriendly.   (One time the staff person responded by pointing;  yeah really!)One other thing was we felt rushed while in the house.  There is so much detail but because it is small they try to ""cattle herd"" everyone thru there as fast as possible. The ipads are a great idea, but a little distracting when you are trying to take pics, see everything in the rooms, and listen to your spouse. ..Definitely a must see.Loved it!!!! We did the package deal and stayed at the Heartbreak Hotel. kinda had to, as the Graceland tix are $72 each, but the package including the room was only $175, so it's like getting the room for $30 ! Not that the room was so great or anything, but c'mon, it's at the end of Lonely Street! You might think it is pricey, but there is no other place like this in the world. Graceland is the ultimate Elvis experience, totally renewed my love for the King once again. So much to do, we took 2 days to see everything. I like how all the folks that work there are young people that are local to the area. Elvis keeping it in the hood! If you even are a casual fan of Elvis, this place will entertain you like no other! I will return again and again to visit the home of the one true King of rock and roll.First time here. Nice tour of the mansion using the iPad. Any fan of the 50's 60's genres can't miss this.While passing through Memphis we decided to stop at Graceland. We had never been here. After driving over we found the parking lot empty and thought we had ""cornered the market"" visiting on a Tuesday in freezing cold weather. Unfortunately, we discovered that beginning in December Graceland is closed on Tuesday to clean the mansion. You could still visit the stores, and the plane (we chose not to). Not being Elvis fans we decided to move on!Magic. So wonderful. Absolutely surreal. On a cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York, my fiance and I stopped in Memphis overnight, and had to visit Graceland. We both grew up listening to Elvis, and have wanted to visit for a long time. You really get a sense of Elvis, the man, touring his private home. It's an intimate look at his life, the estate left as though he still lived there. It's fascinating to see how he decorated. The ""jungle room"" and the basement were especially unique. The tour was incredibly well done and far exceeded our expectations. I also like that you can see just the mansion, or go beyond and see everything. We chose to see the mansion and cars, which we felt was worth paying extra. Next time, we stick around to see the ""Lisa Marie"" private jet!We were in Memphis, so we HAD to go check out Graceland.  Whether or not you're an Elvis fan, this is a bit of history and should be taken that way.  I mean, the house itself is not exactly swanky for today's standards.  You need to put yourself back in that time and see it through those eyes.  The tour was fantastic.  To be right there, where it all happened.  The Jungle Room where songs were contrived... the media room, the billiards room... oh the history!  Take your time and really soak in the sights.  The grammys.  The awards.  The outfits.  The uniforms.  The cars. The airplanes. So much to see.  So much to think about.I didn't have the kids, and that was probalby a good thing.  They'd have no clue what we were looking at or what the big deal was.  It takes a little understanding to get the full effect.  Otherwise it's someone's big old house in need of a renovation.I was so greatful to have made this trip.  It's well worth the admission and time.  Get there early and plan to spend several hours soaking in the history!","['experience', 'everything', 'heard', 'considering', 'walking', 'around', 'inside', 'someone', 'else', 'personal', 'home',
