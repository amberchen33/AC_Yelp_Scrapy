http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-jacksonville-i-295-east-baymeadows-jacksonville,Hampton Inn Jacksonville-I-295 East/Baymeadows,4.0,$$,19,"Stayed here a couple of weeks ago for business in JAX , being at a Hampton is pretty enjoyable regardless of the location but I appreciated the customer service and friendliness of the staff of this specific Hampton- especially Blake R! Kudos to all!I recommend staying here if you're in the area; great people, great experience!First comment : Don't pay  ahead of time !I made the mistake of paying in full and reserving ahead of time and when I had a friend offer me to stay at her home I called the Hampton and they said as part of the Hilton policy and the rate I received I could not get a refund for canceling ahead of schedule .However , that being said my stay here was great!  . I arrived around 8pm exhausted from a full day of travels .  the front desk staff was very attentive and nice . My room was wonderful . Very clean and comfortable . The next morning the free breakfast was not bad . I appreciated how they had fresh berries and Greek yogurt .I would only suggest making the pancakes a little better .  Overall , I would book this hotel for any of my relatives !This hotel is just your average hotel set up but with some freebies (free parking, wifi, breakfast, extra cable channels) that aren't always free with the larger chains. There is a lot less crowded area since the hotel is smaller. It's a good in and out hotel but I've have been to other Jacksonville hotels with a better pool, ect...The hotel service is wonderful. Jacksonville seems to have some of the friendliest people. The service from the front desk to the housekeeping were happy and sweet any time I saw them. There isn't a restaurant on site but there is a place next door that delivers to the rooms. Also, there are a handful of other businesses which makes this standard hotel a little more active if a guest gets bored. The free breakfast was not so good. A lot of things were gone---fruit bowl, orange juice, and some other empties that were once filled. Cereal, waffles, toast, yogurt were available along with no so good looking eggs and potatoes. Free is free though. The rooms come with a good amount of space and a fairly large fridge with microwave. I had a few things missing though: my luggage rack (I always use mine), my do not disturb sign (housekeeping woke me up), my clock was 2 hours late (I panicked once because I thought I was late for something). The room was clean and supplied the average hotel items.The pool was small but no one was out there. It could seat 6-8 people on the deck comfortably and 3 people in the pool. There was a lot of shade though. The gym was a good size and had the average set up. My room view was not bad! I expected a nasty parking lot (yes, I had that) but from my room I saw the city and right in the middle was an American flag (nice!).Returnable: 30% because there other hotels I'd use. A good price for your value of stay though. If it was the only hotel in the area it would have been an 80%.I am very happy with my stay at this hampton inn.  People at the check-in are nice and friendly.   The room was very clean and comes with a nice comfy bed, flat screen tv, microwave and big fridge.  The bathroom is spacious and has a big granite countertop.  The shower head has many different water streams.  The complimentary breakfast has several different cereals, bagels, muffins, and hot items (omletes, maple sausage and oat meal).  They are not bad.  I recommend this place if you are looking for a basic clean hotel with good service and in a good location for a reasonable price.So far so good. It's 7:30, we checked in at 5:15.I was able to take a cat nap and shower. Comfy bed, decent water pressure and the a/c blows cold.I stayed here for 5 days because I was working in the area. Overall, the stay was just ok. The rooms need to be better maintained as the first room I was placed in had several holes in the sheets as if it had gotten caught on something in the dryer and the refrigerator was leaking so badly that It could not be used. (Needless to say I requested another room)The decor and furnishings of the hotel need to be ""updated"" as it had a late 1990's feel to it and was stained badly (at-least in my room the furniture was so stained that I didn't feel comfortable sitting in it or even placing my things on them) Here are some pros and cons in a snapshot:Pros: The front staff was very friendly and helpfulThe staff did a great job keeping the hot beverages actually hot in the lobby area (and their coffee actually tasted good)They have a laundry room on site with one washer and one dryerTheir business center is actually decent as they have two computers, one printer, a hole punch, and stapler The rooms were spacious They have a recycle bin in the lobby Cons:The rooms don't have a rack or anything to hang your hand towel to allow it to dryI noticed fruit flies throughout the hotel (including my room which made me uncomfortable leaving my fruit out)My room had a weird smell to it when the A/C wasn't on and the shower wasn't properly cleaned as it had hairs on the wall, shower curtain, and shower floorThe breakfast was just ""ok"" definitely nothing to write home about (they offered your typical cereal, fruit, juice from the machine, yogurt, and breads like most hotels to name a few)I didn't see a sign stating what floor the laundry room was on and once in the laundry room, no sign was posted to tell you how long the wash &amp; dryer cycles wereAlthough the business center was decent, the printer kept malfunctioning stating there was a paper jam when there wasn't onethis is an update to my previous review. I just want to say that Andrea Spencer the general manager here stepped up and contacted my wife and made the situation right. my wife is there now and has been treated like royalty and its customer service like this that retains a loyal customer.thank you Andrea for fixing the problem and not letting it go by the wayside.it is much appreciatedThe staff was extremely helpful and the hotel is very clean.  The room was very clean and comes with a nice comfy bed, flat screen tv, microwave and big fridge.  The complimentary breakfast, beautiful lobby and an outdoor pool. The bed was super comfy and the room was extremely quiet.I stay at a lot of Hampton Inns and this is as good as it gets.  Fantastic staff.  Clean and quiet.  Nice pool.  Well stocked and hot full breakfast.  Nice location.  Really hard to beat.  Bed was comfortable.  Really would not ask for anything more.  Will stay again.Clean hotel with easy access to restaurants and the local beltway around Jax.  The rooms are spacious and the staff are very friendly, very typical of Hampton Inns.Great hotel! I stayed here for 2 nights, and the front desk was helpful and friendly. When the business center printer was jammed, they let me use the front desk computers to print out my boarding pass!The Wifi is FREE and works very well, unlike most of the hotels I've ever been to. The TV is a flat LCD TV and there's also a refrigerator and microwave. The rooms themselves are very clean and nice and the whole building and area seem pretty new. The plaza that the hotel is in contains many restaurants, so you'll never be hungry.Continental breakfast was way more than I expected, not just your simple danishes and coffee. There were eggs, bacon, potatoes, sausage, milk and cereal, donuts, bagels, all kinds of juices, yogurt, and more. The breakfast potatoes were amazing! Oh yeah, how could I forget...they have waffle makers too!I think the only thing I would complain about is that it was difficult to keep the bathroom floor dry during showers. I realized on my second night there that the bottom of the shower curtains have magnets that you stick to the inside of the bathtub. Genius! The floor was dry that night. :)There happened to be a Santa convention (yeah you read that right) staying here at the same time as my group, and that really made our day. We even took pictures with them sitting on their laps at breakfast. I know they're not part of this hotel, but the fact that they're staying at this hotel must mean the hotel is on the ""Good"" List! :DHey, this is a really nice place with great front desk help on all shifts.  I enjoyed all of the amenities of this hotel. It was 15 min from downtown (which is were I a was working and 20 min from the beach)  The breakfast was good and hot, with waffels, eggs, bacon. They also had hot and cold cereal with a juice bar.  The price was pretty good plus I booked on my phone and got 16% mobile discount.   There is a Publix and a package store across the street, also Sneakers Bar, Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's and a Broklynn Pizza.My out of town friends stayed here recently and they enjoyed it a lot.  They loved their room and said the hotel staff were very nice.  I loved their lobby, it is all new and comfortable.Stayed here for business. Beds were not your typical Hampton Cloud Nine (pretty hard) but overall the stay was comfortable, room was clean. Hotel was slightly dated but internet worked well. Location was very close to 295, within walking distance of an Outback and Carabbas and less than a mile to a Publix. Breakfast was annoying, there is a very small room and an awkward set up for seating, you're probably better dining out than fighting the morning rush.I have stayed there 5x this year. Same staff every time. There is comfort in consistancy.Kelli does a great of running the front desk and keeping all of the guests happy. Rooms are clean and adequate. More importantly it is quiet! Breakfast consisted of cheese omlets, bacon and french toast.. Other morning was scrambled eggs, sausage and  potatoes. Both mornings there were home made waffles, and the usual bagels, breads, cereals, etc. Three coffee choices. The scrambled eggs were overcooked and the french toast was nothing to write home about but everything else was delicious. When you stay here there is no need to drive anywhere to get to a restaurant. Plenty of offerings right actross the parking lot.Clean, quiet, and convenient. This location was very easy to spot off 295 outside of Jacksonville. I would have given 5 stars, but I was really disappointed that we had a handicap room without a bathtub. We requested a tub when we were booking the room, but when we arrived they didn't have another room to give us. The employees were very friendly and apologetic, but I was still disappointed after having driven for  7 hours from Charlotte. The bed was super comfy and the room was extremely quiet, except for the AC unit that rattled a bit when it switched on. The complimentary breakfast was decent and the coffee was hot and flavorful.Here on business in October.  Not a luxury hotel, but above average for Jacksonville.  People at the front desk for helpful and nice.  Clean room.  Quiet room.  Nice bed.  Can't go wrong by staying here.Stayed in a room with two queens. It was a standard room with a clean bathroom stacked with towels and a tray of complementary toiletries. There was a small LCD TV with 30-something channels and desk. What left a lasting impression and a 4 star review is how plush and amazing the beds were. The mattress itself was very comfortable (it was on the softer side, but still firm enough) and I haven't felt such soft blankets and pillows since my last trip to Vegas at the Bellagio.  The breakfast buffet they serve when compared on an absolute scale something I would be pissed to buy, but considering it's an average hotel with a small breakfast area, its not all that bad. For the two mornings I was there, they served a continental type breakfast with fruits, cereal, and an assortment of juices. They also have a new waffle maker if that tickles your pickle.So, in the past year I have been traveling a lot. When you are literally living out of a carry on you come to appreciate the little things, and this place has got it down. It has free wifi, clean sheets and room, decent gym, good continental breakfast, etc, but these usually come standard in most hotels these days. What sets this place apart in customer service. Maybe its just me, but they remember my name and things that we last talked about. Take one of my experiences as an example. There was a trip when I got in at 9:45pm after spending most of the day traveling. I had a really bad day, I was tired, in need of a long shower, and had a craving for milk and cookies. As I was checking in what was on the counter you ask. A PLATE OF COOKIES! I was as happy as Little Timmy was on Christmas morning. Unfortunately Big Bertha and her side kick BIGGER Bertha were in front of me. Needless to say, the dynamic duo took ALL of the freaking COOKIES!!!! They were complaining about a lack of restaurants in the area and how the portions were getting smaller. I couldn't remember exactly what she was saying. I was focused on all the cookies the duo had in their chubby fingers. I remember thinking to myself, Lady, the portions are the same. It's you who has changed.  (Yes, I know I am going to hell) There had to be at least 15 good sized cookies on that plate. Yes, I was mad, but I was just too tired to get angry. So, I guess I came off as super sad: think of the faces of the starving kids on the commercials where they ask for donations to help support the hungry kids. The young brunette receptionist who was also studying for an exam witnessed the injustice. I asked if they had anymore cookies to which she replied they were all out. She asked if I was okay, I responded with a smile, I guess it's too much to ask for a guy to get some milk and cookies after a bad day or something to that effect.  After I settled in and took a shower. I heard a knock at the door. Turn down service with a happy ending? Even better! It was room service with a glass of milk and a stack of oatmeal raisin cookies courtesy of the receptionist! I am definitely coming back to this place for the extra effort that they always provide me with.Note: I have nothing against big ppl. I just have something against ppl (big or small) who TAKE ALL OF THE COOKIES!!!!",,,,,"['couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'business', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'regardless', 'location', 'appreciated',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-orange-park-orange-park,Fairfield Inn Orange Park,2.5,$$,10,"The biggest win for this property is it's staff- they are fantastic! Jessica (Jessika?) at the front desk checked me in and she was AMAZING!!!!! SO friendly, she made great conversation while she checked me in and was still quite efficient! She also offered to provide area recommendations and she promised to call to check on the condition of my room. She ended up seeing me walk through the lobby about 10 minutes later and followed up on if my room was okay. She was the epitome of hospitality. Besides, Jessica the rest of the staff I interacted with, which was limited to a maintenance man outside who went out of his way to hold the door open for me, and a phone operator who set up my wake up call was super nice. The location for me was convenient for the work travel I was doing. It is closed to 295 and located just off of a main road with lots of food, gas stations, grocery and convenience stores nearby. This hotel also offers a free hot breakfast. I thought the menu was decent- make your own waffles, breads and pastries, yogurts, fresh fruit, oatmeal as well as scrambled eggs and sausage. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and water are available around the clock. There were also cookies at the front desk when I checked in which was nice!The lobby is well maintained and features a business computer and printer if you need it!The hotel features a fitness center which is open 24 hours. It only had a few machines, but good variety. There is also an outdoor pool available, although I did not use it. The only ""meh"" part of the stay is the room. I felt my room was clean, but it is clear that this is an older property. The rooms and hallways could use some refreshing as decor does appear older and warn. Compared to similar comparably priced properties I feel the rooms are not on par with the competition.'Real"" rating: 1.5 (but Yelp does not allow ""1/2 stars"").The ""good part:  But, it was not all bad.  Both employees at the front desk were quite pleasant and reflected positively on the owner.But there was muuuuch more bad than good:  1.  The room was really, really small.  Maybe a booking error?  I don't know.  But the room was the size one might expect in a Microtel, Red Roof Inn, etc.  Double (not Queen) bed.2.  The bed was really uncomfortable.  Really.  The mattress felt like it should have been replaced years ago.3.  The pillows was pretty much useless -- also should have been replaced long ago.4.  The HVAC, which was right next to the bed in this tiny room, was really noisy.  Really noisy.5. When we left the toilet was running; never shut off the entire time we were there.  (Wonder why the housekeeping folks don't report things like this -- or maybe the owner does not care?)6.  The breakfast, such as it was, was quite poor.  I thought Holiday Inn Express facilities were bad (they are), but this was worse.7.  The HVAC system was dusty and our allergies started acting up.  (See the photos -- the dust was plentiful -- and obvious.  It's rather clear they're seldom or never cleaned.)Would we return?  Absolutely not!   This facility is an embarrassment to the Marriott system.The Good:-Location....right off the highway and easy to find-Customer Service....front desk employee, a manager, and even the employee stocking and cleaning the breakfast buffet...all EXCEEDINGLY friendly and customer-oriented-Cleanliness-Nice bed linens...soft &amp; clean-Free breakfast (pretty much the basics-fruit, muffins, bagels, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, and make-your-own waffle station)-Nice breakfast area-Free WiFi-Lobby smells really niceThe Bad-Rooms have very bad, musty odor-Carpet in room feels damp to the touch-Air conditioning in our room was very loud and actually started malfunctiong-The property is obviously very dated and in disrepair-Maintenance workers where making awful noise in the crawl space above our room for 2 hours after we checked in-Crack in window to our room-Broken furniture in room-Uncomfortable bed-The water (both shower and sink) has a strange odor to itUnfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives and I can't say that I'd return to this Fairfield Inn.I wish I could rate this higher based solely off of how friendly the staff was but I cant. The exterior of the hotel is clean and we'll maintained. There is also plenty of parking spaces and the lot suitably lit.We got a room on the third floor. The room had an overpowering odor, closely resembling a basement.  The room had an odd setup,  making watching TV from bed very difficult. And onto the bed, which was disappointing.  We got the king sized bed, which was lumpy and inconsistent in firmness in different areas of the bed. They were also doing maintenance right outside of our room a large part of the day, making relaxing after an eight hour drive insanely difficult. As I mentioned earlier,  the guest service was the best part of the experience, but due to the quality of the room,  I most likely will not be returning.Staff at the front desk American and speak English!!Rooms are brand new and still smell like a brand new house. Very clean and odor free. completely updated thruoutRooms and hotel in general seem to be dated. Marriott should take more pride in not letting their properties falling behind on the times. Musty odor and overall not very clean. Disappointed is an understatement and I wouldn't recommend this property to anyone. Do yourself the favor and pay the extra $ for one of the other hotels, get what you pay for couldn't be a truer statement. Thumbs downIf you are on a strict budget, probably not the worst place to stay. On the plus side, the place is clean, free wi-fi, and it includes breakfast; on the negative side the rooms are old and my room felt damp.The place is in need of an upgrade.  If you can shell out a couple of more bucks, the Courtyard across the way is a better option.Although we received a confirmation email, and we called this hotel multiple times to confirm our reservation, the hotel totally messed up our reservation. I won't stay here or another Fairfield again.I paid what I would have paid at a Motel 6, but this one is so much better! Friendly staff, no problems. The free WiFi has a weak signal, but no big issues.Older hotel, friendly staff,",,,,,"['biggest', 'win', 'property', 'staff', 'fantastic', 'front', 'desk', 'checked', 'amazing', 'friendly', 'made',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-hotel-and-suites-orange-park-wells-rd-orange-park,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Orange Park - Wells Rd.,3.5,$$,13,"Super clean hotel, from check-in to check-out was a great experience. King bed room was very large and spotless. We checked in and then received a call from front desk to make sure everything was OK. Exceptional Customer service!Super nice  decor inside and outside . Free beer when you check in . They have a huge pitcher of fruit water as well at all times in lobby .Only one onsight laundry room , 3 floor.Plenty of vending machines .Fridge and microwave . They have a nice out door pool and patio area . Located around a lot of restaurants if your willing to walk a tiny bit.Awesome , friendly staff !!!!I finally made it to try this buffet that was on my to do list. Being Fathers day I figured it would be packed and the price would be higher but I called for a reservation and asked if the price was the same and they stated no price change. The menu for the meat on the buffet included Ribs, Chicken, Honey ham and a carving station. There were fresh salads and fruits plus numerous desserts. I was very excited that there was no overcrowding and that the food was up to the HIH standards. I will defiantly be a Sunday regular for this well priced feast...We had a room here last weekend after our friends wedding.  The hotel is pretty new and very clean.  I thought the rooms were very nice.  We hung out at the lobby bar and they were extremely nice.  Mandy was awesome tending to all our needs.  They didn't even mind when we orded pizza after midnight and dirtied up their plates with outside food.  Great staff and a good clean hotel!This is the first and only hotel I've ever stayed in that hands you an ice cold bottle of beer at the registration desk! (or bottle of water if you prefer). I found this pretty funny.The hotel is very nice and VERY clean with a friendly and helpful staff.  I didn't use any of the amenities but I did check out the workout room and pool areas and found them to very nice as well. They have a restaurant and bar which I didn't have time to check out.The hotel is in a nice area of town. Although there were not many restaurants or stores in the immediate area, there were many to choose from not far away.I highly recommend this hotel.::SIGHS::  Spur of the moment trip to Jacksonville to visit dying grandmother landed myself and my family in this dump.  My dad made the arrangements.  When we arrived (myself, two brother, dad and his gf) the place looked decent, dare I say nice?  The woman offered us a free beer with check-in (ok whatever) and that is where is ended.  The would not allow us to put an extra cot in the room my brothers shared so that I could avoid the awkward room sharing with my dad and his gf.  They said it was because of fire code.  Ok fine, whatever.  I accepted this answer.What I really dislike about this hotel, other than everything, is the rooms.  They smelled so bad, like mold and musty air.  The sheets were really scratchy, and the pillows were very hard.  They also kept a spare pillow on the floor behind a chair (I'm pretty sure this has to be some sort of violation).  The GROSSEST part was the bugs.  As I crawled into bed I noticed there was a dead flying ant next to my pillows.  My brother had two cockroaches in their room.  One in the bed, and one the next morning in their clothes.  Finally, day one - the complimentary coffee was awful, almost see through, day two no coffee at all.My mom is in a small little Florida town called Green Cove Springs.  There's not much there, and as for hotels it's kinda feast/famine.  So, staying in Orange Park is a good choice if you need to get in/around Jacksonville (to the north), or GCS (to the south).  I've been to Orange Park, and around that area for several years now, and have tried the various hotels there.  All were, basically, Motels.  Nothing special.However, this hotel is just off-the-charts great compared to where I'd previously been.  Spacious rooms.  CLEAN rooms.  A fantastic bar/restaurant built right into the lobby.  Even a nice pool/jacuzzi as well.  Did I mention the FREE nightly hors d'oeuvres and EVEN MORE FREE ice cream?  (Well, it's a bunch of ice cream in a freezer that you can pick out for yourself around 8pm, but still).The only negative is this place claimed free Wi-Fi, but most of us did not find that our devices could ""sniff out"" the network.  Bummer.  But still, I'll definitely be back here.  It was a great stay, and well worth it.AWSOME place stayed there a Monday and  Tuesday couldn't stay for one more day because they we're booked but definitely love this place and the balcony is nice tooThis hotel is making inroads on going green by reducing its use of detergent back into the environment and giving its customers the option of recycling the towel and sheets. Brilliant! This is just the beginning of great things to come. Apart from that, it has switched the energy saving bulbs and much more. This is a step in sustainability that most progressive organizations have included into their business model.The staff is friendly and attentive to your needs. Plus you get a complimentary breakfast for two. You have access to the business center, gym, pool and hot tub.Booked rooms for a conference months in advance. Arrive at the hotel to find out they over booked themselves and kicked out 15 reservations from our conference this weekend with no notice until we arrived.This is my second visit here. Last was for business but I was so impressed that I brought my hubby with me. Room was clean and quiet. Bed was spacious and comfortable. Room service was fast and had great food. Staff was beyond awesome!This a newer hotel with full restaurant and bar . Rooms are super clean and staff is very friendly. Not much of a work out faculty two treadmills and a electrical bike but other then that it's a very nice hotelThey have a strict --not well publicized NO REFUND POLICY.  So if you change your plans, you pay for your room anyway.  When I called to make sure I understood this correctly, their response was ""that's the policy.""  I will never use this hotel ever again!  I think anyone who is handed a beer at the counter is expected to write a good review!",,,,,"['super', 'clean', 'hotel', 'check', 'check', 'great', 'experience', 'king', 'bed', 'room', 'large',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-by-marriott-jacksonville-butler-blvd-jacksonville,Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Jacksonville Butler Blvd.,4.0,$$,11,"My stay was for business over 2 days and the location was convenient for my purposes; right at I-95 for getting around quickly and on the southern portion of the city for heading back to Tampa when finished up.The rooms were clean and the staff was very nice...exceptionally nice in one particular case: the lady  servicing the breakfast was VERY helpful and I almost felt like I was being waited on at a diner. She prepared my waffle fresh for me, refilled my OJ when it was low, brought a paper to me, and encouraged me to eat a banana because it would ""get me through the day."" All of that with a smile at 6am!The only knocks I will give on the place is that in the room- the heavy curtain only covers 1/4 of the way on each side...leaving the middle 1/2 portion only covered with a shear cloth for light to get in. I improvised and used a clothes hanger to clip them together.There was a fridge, microwave, and coffee &amp; single cup maker in the room...you expect those these days until you run into a few that leave them out. The free WiFi was also appreciated, as many still charge for that.Enjoyed the stay.I am a current guest, checking in for a week for a continuing education class.  The first night of my stay, much to my dismay, no hot water.  I contacted the front desk and was told there was no issue and that most people most likely shower in the morning. The next morning, no hot water again.  I let the front desk know and they informed me that I should let the water run for a few minutes and it would get hot.  Didn't work.  I've read through many reviews and this is a documented issue.  Apparently this property does not care.  My classmates had the same issue.  I woke up at 5am sharp on Wednesday morning to ensure a hot shower, which I got. Wednesday evening after my run.. NO HOT WATER.  This morning... 6am... NO HOT WATER.  This is completely unacceptable.  There are many other great options within walking distance of this hotel.  I would suggest them first.  Hampton Inn, Courtyard by Marriott, Townplace Suites, Ramada, and a couple other properties.  DO NOT STAY HERE!!This hotel was phenominal. I did have a issue that was turned around 100%. The most impressive part about staying here aside from the outstanding comfort in the rooms was the breakfast. Fresh eggs and potatoes! A special shout out to Annastasia and Ashley. The both were personable and professional. I hope to see them promoted one day. Also Uriel Castro was great helping turn my issue around! Highly recommend and will return!Cannot believe I have not reviewed this place yet!  It's really quite comfortable, clean, and relatively new, or it feels that way at least.The staff is very friendly and helpful. . .always!  My rooms have always been super clean, well appointed with frige AND microwave.  In addition, there is a pantry area where you can buy items if need be.Breakfast is included, but not really fit for my dietary needs.  There is a lot pre packaged items like biscuits, yogurt, packet oatmeal and grits and small cartons of milk.It is perfect for business travelers like me, and it really feels like home.  No brainer to choose to stay here!Great location just down the street from the expansive shopping and restaurants at St. John's center. Central to the city and local businesses nearby. Fairly new location with updated furniture, flat panels, desks and decor. Great breakfast service and staff were extremely nice and accommodating. Rates very reasonable. Only real complaint I would have is with the age and condition of the workout equipment (treadmill and bike). Other than that, great place to stay!Great visit.  This hotel was very clean and their continental breakfast offered tons of choices.  Rooms are nice and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay.Clean and a nice staff. The bed is not impressive. Also a big pet peeve of mine- no easily accessible outletsArrived late at night, got great rate and wonderful service. I love me some MarriottI originally gave this hotel a poor rating because of the poor night sleep I had. I felt the need to change the rating because the people here are amazing. They went out of their way to fix my problems and made the rest of my stay quite nice. People do make a difference!We usually stay in other locations when in this area but decided to branch out.  The Senior discount was best but they also give a Mayo discount for those going to the Clinic.  Finding the place even in daylight was a chore since you follow a street sign down what appears to be a side road and THEN you see the big motel sign.  Upon check in we asked Eric, the night clerk, for a quiet room.  Started to unpack when next door the family we all dread arrived.  You know the type, no idea of common courtesy, yelling down the hallways to the rest of the clan, kids banging the walls, etc.  Assumed they would fall into a quiet stupor after a big supper out but did not want to take the chance.  Informed Eric who quickly gave us a new room with no nonsense about ""I am sure they will quiet down, etc"".   Luckily they have big brass carts for moving luggage smoothly.  We had an extremely quiet night.  So we saw 2 rooms, both well appointed, frig, microwave, with nice touches like an attractive valance over the window curtains, very clean, no odor.  Sadly this motel and probably the chain has gone cheap on the flat screen TVs and the ports do function to allow plug and play which we enjoyed just recently at a La Quinta.  We prefer streaming video versus the commercial ridden regular TV so we missed being able to run our picture through the flat screen.  Another common feature missing is 110 power outlets on the desk lamps.  We carry a 110 ext cord but it is a pain to get under the desk to plug it in.  However, the internet connection was excellent!  Breakfast was OK with lots of microwave stuff like sausage and biscuits which are actually fresher than some of the prepared items I have had in the past.  This is a keeper.super clean hotel in a great location just off 202 in Jax,,,friendly staff +great breakfast (free)...can't wait to return",,,,,"['business', 'days', 'location', 'convenient',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-suites-baymeadows-near-butler-blvd-jacksonville,Comfort Suites Baymeadows Near Butler Blvd,3.5,$,8,"Comfort Suites on Baymeadows in Jacksonville Fl is excellently located right off of I95. Lots of shopping and restaurants to chose from. Staff friendly, room comfortable, beds very nice plenty of fluffy towels, pillows , iron, mini fridge, microwave. The air conditioner was blowing cold air but it had a moldy mildew smell to it- made room stink- they need to disinfect it or change filter or something. Also outside of hotel right by front door were groups of men together - like from a truckers convention- all smoking- the cigarette smoke was getting into the hotel and made lobby reek- my shirt smelled of cigarette smoke just getting into lobby. They need to move smoking area to side of building instead of right by front door. Also only one working elevator- took forever to get to third floor- got tired of waiting and took stairs. Overall worth the price$79 with AAA discount. Also one final nice touch was the clerk noticing my diamond elite status and gave me a free bottle of water at check in- little things like that go a long way.In Jacksonville the night of June 30th, I arrived at 12:25 a.m. on the 1st of July, 2015.  Having obtained this booking through Priceline, I was given a room with a king size bed and sleeper sofa.  Male clerk was nice and polite. My room through a negotiated price was $52.00 - $37.00 less that the hotel itself. Great deal.  Hotel is aged, but not dirty in the sense of trashy. Room was bigger than what I'm used to and had a divider between the large king size bed and sleeper sofa.  A refrigerator, microwave and mini-coffee maker were available for my use. I used the fridge and microwave - they worked.Bathroom was clean, but aged. Water in shower could have been hotter, but it was sufficient. Plenty of towels, and a single set of shampoo, conditioner and lotion.  Neither the bathroom or room waste basket had a plastic bag in them.Free breakfast with all the basics found in a Comfort Suites. Coffee was good and hot - I had the Bold.  Well stocked and a busy area first thing in the morning. They were out of butter for my English Muffin so I enjoyed a generic strawberry jelly.Convenient to I-95 off Baymeadows in South East Jacksonville. Lots of area convenience stores, restaurants, fast food joints, and gas stations close to the hotel./s/ William E. Lewis Jr. , Fort Lauderdale, FloridaMy family needed a room quickly and this hotel had what we needed. We had a king room with a pull-out couch, so we were able to get four people to sleep comfortable. The pull-out couch mattress was kind of gross. The bathroom left a bit much to be desired - we couldn't properly turn the bath faucet off. This hotel includes breakfast, but you're better off grabbing something in the go unless you're all about bread. Overall, we got a place to sleep for a night that didn't break the bank.It's decent. Considering I'm I am here for free with a friend who's on a business trip maybe my vision is a little clouded by the rose colored glasses of the fact it's FREE but I still think if I had paid 60 or 70 bucks a night I would be happy with it it's clean it's in a decent location very close to lots of food and shopping have a good free breakfast with actual real food (and excellent coffee)  they are friendly they have a little mini market in the lobby t..he wifi is free the rooms are kinda half-a$$ suites (they may have real suites too...I don't know)  with a little half wall but still it's much bigger than a normal hotel room and it has a microwave and a mini fridge it seems clean the bed is comfortable there are enough blankets and pillows.. the air conditioner works really I don't have any complaints its a good mid level hotel. Nothing fancy...but not a thing wrong.The beds are really comfortable BUT the hotel need to do a lot of cleaning up! Hallways are really stuffy due to the floors being completely carpeted. The pillows had stains on them, hair from last customer was still in the shower, sink was clogged, and nasty ROACHES on the room. This made me feel as if I was in a Motel.I stayed here during the summer. The room was clean the bed was fluffy and the breakfast wasn't to bad.Awesome breakfast area, lots of food, waffles, sausage and awesome service, staff was very friendly and rooms were nice and clean. Also call the hotel direct for the best rates, skip the hassle of <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and expedia, this is def a great place to stay with a buffalo wild wings down the street!Stayed here while in Jacksonville, Fl (J-ville) for a medical conference. My company had me on a budget, which was not much. When I walked into the hotel it looked very new. While checking the GM was very helpful and lowered the rate to fit my budget, no questions asked! Through out my 3 days stay all the staff was nice and helpful. Room was cleaned everyday and the free breakfast was GREAT! I will def. stay there again!",,,,,"['comfort', 'suites', 'excellently', 'located', 'right', 'lots', 'shopping', 'restaurants', 'chose', 'staff', 'friendly', 'room', 'comfortable', 'beds', 'nice',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-jacksonville-mayport-beach-jacksonville,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Jacksonville - Mayport / Beach,4.0,$$,13,"My 4-star rating takes into account that this is a Holiday Inn Express - assume nothing remarkable, but expect a clean, reasonable well-appointed room and a decent continental breakfast.  This hotel meets expectations, and after a few stays here I'll give it another star for the helpful staff I've dealt with.  (I know that's not in keeping with everyone's experience, but I'm starting to feel it's more the norm than the exception here.)I'll echo someone else's comments about the thin walls (not uncommon among the more budget-oriented chains), but I've not found noise to be an issue during my stays (luck with neighbors, I guess).  The hotel is on a moderately busy road, but I'm normally on the side away from the street and have heard no neighborhood noise at all.I landed four hours later than anticipated last night coming in from vegas. Almost midnight and I was beat. First of all thank you for having an actual front desk number and not some call center in India as I experienced with some competitor hotels on here.  Gary answered the phone when I was calling from the airport and was incredibly friendly and welcoming. He explained the UF vs Georgia game Gator Bowl is this weekend hence the rowdy atmosphere in town and there were only two rooms left.  Gary assured me he'd reserve one for me and I advised I was on my way.  Friendly easy check in. My room was spotless with clean crisp sheets and comfy bed. The gym was decent enough for a morning work out before the complimentary breakfast that included eggs and turkey sausage. Great stay I would recommend and stay here again. Thanks Gary!!BEWARE OF THE OTHER HOLIDAY INN DOWN THE ROAD.Knowing that our friends had already checked in and were in the room, when we arrived we headed straight up to our room. We knocked on the door and called out for our friends. Several moments passed and finally the door opened up to an elderly man. Needless to say, we were not spring breaking with the geriatrics. Whoops-- i take back that check in on Yelp.Moral of the story: if you are staying here, make sure you have the address for the right hotel.The hotel itself is nice. It's very clean and the front desk was quick to help us out with extra towels and what not. There is an outdoor pool (that may be turned into a memorial for the raccoon that died there our first night) and a fitness center.The location isn't horrible, especially for the price. It's about 20-30 minuted from the beach and nice shopping/eating centers. Also, there's lots of free parking in the area.Very nice hotel! Came from Virginia visiting with my family at Thanksgiving. The room was super clean and neat. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. Clerks were friendly and willing to help. I'd recommend staying here for sure.Hotel was very clean. Front desk clerk was very polite...Had to give a $50 deposit when we checked in for incidentals...Front desk clerk checked our room when we checked out then returned deposit..We stayed in a queen suite...it was very spacious &amp; the tv was a good size...pool was small &amp; no hot tub...ice machine was on the 2nd floor on the other side of the hotel...I would think they would have one downstairs but they didnt..breakfast was good considering it is a hot breakfast I'm just not a fan of powdered eggs...but the pancakes &amp; coffee were good. Hotel is about 5 mins away from Atlantic Bch..we left a pillow and called about 4 hrs later to see if they had it they did it was waiting at the front desk for us. I will def stay again when visiting Atlantic Bch.@HolidayInn I'm writing this review from my room at the HolidayInn Express-Mayport.  After an overbooking at another hotel in Jacksonville, I bid on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> and was given the HI-Mayport. This was fine by me, as the location and reviews were good for this property and my past experience with HI Express normally left me pretty happy. Unfortunately, I now have a very sour taste due to this particular hotel and am ruing having even stayed here. Knowing how Priceline assigns rooms and that my wife and son would need need to check in without me, I called the hotel yesterday evening and requested an early check in for them and stated I needed a room that would accommodate three people. The person answering the phone was quite helpful and stated there would be a room available anytime after 1pm for them.Today, My wife called and said they didn't want to let her in early and all that was available was 1 king bed w/ no additional pull out. They also wanted $10 dollars for a roll-away. I told her not to worry and I'd deal with it when I arrived, that I was sure they would accommodate us as promised.I immediately when to the front desk when I got to the property and brought up my concerns. An understatement would be that this fell upon unhelpful ears. The clerk dug in on her position and it was at that point that I realized the greed and ego of the hotel management must supersede the need for proper customer care and following through on what was promised the evening before.Will I stay at HI Express again? Of course. Will I stay for more than one evening here or ever again. No way.As a final aside, we purchased to go food from the Greek diner down the street and when we brought it back to the hotel and ate in the dining area, no one turned on any lights for us or showed us where the switches were, so we were basically left eating in the dark. See above regarding Greed.The room was spacious, and nice. I got excited when I saw the jacuzzi in the room. (Until my partner noticed that it was not so clean.) we didn't use it. Bummer. The worst part of the stay was that we could hear our neighbors next door talking, and then  snoring. The walls are paper thin. The free breakfast is the typical unhealthy  sugary stuff. It was no where near the beach, so for $75 per night, I wish I had stayed at a Marriott in downtown Jacksonville. Live and learn.It's a holiday inn express not a Ritz Carlton people. Great Hotel, great price.  The hotel is clean, the suites are new and large and clean.  The Breakfast buffet is suprisingly full of many options, hot and cold.  Overall this is a great hotel and the service was fantastic as well.  I am taking off a star because I booked 2 suites and we were not even on the same floor... I mean, come on!We stayed at this wonderful hotel over Memorial Day weekend for my nieces wedding! I can't say enough about the staff and accommodations ! Everyone was so helpful and friendly! Breakfast was great every morning and there was coffee available all day. The extra help and attention from Heather at the front  desk  was greatly appreciate! We had a great experience and would definitely stay there again!I am very unsatisfied with the service that we received here, especially one woman who works at the front desk.When we checked in, we were given a handicapped room.  First of all, the front desk lady did not mention that this was going to be a handicapped room.  Then when we saw the room and asked whether there was anything else available, she said that there was nothing else available that night.  I understood that part of it and did not expect to get a different room the first night.   However, when we asked whether we would be able to change our room the next day, she immediately said that it was not possible.She told us that since we just booked a ""standard room,"" we did not have an option to select the room type that we wanted.  So, we were only allowed to stay in ""whatever was available.""  So if other people were checking in the next day, they would basically get a regular room (non-handicap room), but we would have to stick with what we got the first night because we had no option to select or change rooms if something opened up later.I then asked if I could pay the higher rate for the second night to get the room type that we wanted - anything other than a handicapped room.  Then she said that we could not switch rooms because what we got the first night is what we got.....and that was the situation when we checked in, so therefore, we could not make a change.   She said that she had spent the entire morning trying to arrange rooms for that day, so it was asking too much to change around the rooms at that point.  She even said that if we were not happy with that, we can just go to a different hotel!!  We would have gone to a different hotel, but we had friends that were joining us from the 2nd night, so we pretty much had to stay at this hotel.  Otherwise, we would have gone to a different hotel after a front desk staff says something as RUDE as this!I have stayed at various other hotels (Marriott, Hilton, Westin) and have never dealt with anyone so rude and unaccommodating! At other hotels, when we asked if we could change rooms if anything opened up at a later time, they would respond with, ""Sure, please check back with us the next day, and we will see what we can do.""  This lady's response was basically, ""No, you cannot switch....you got what you got, and that is it.""  According to her, it was because we got a ""standard room,"" and we did not select a room type....plus, we got it at the lowest fare.  But if that were the case, I think we would have been able to change if we were willing to pay the extra fee to get a room of our preference from the 2nd night.  It was obvious that rooms were opening up from the 2nd night because we checked online on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholidayinexpress.com&amp;s=60d9778a66ebb0f73f067bc008328a952af5376afed50fc03947b30efce00681"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">holidayinexpress.com</a> to see room availability, and we saw that it was indeed booked up for the 1st night, but there were rooms available from the 2nd night.  Because of the experience we had, I will never stay at a Holiday Inn Express again, especially this location.  The handicapped room was okay, although we had to deal with water splattering all over the bathroom floors because of the barrier free showers.  That is something we could live with.  In the end, our experience was TERRIBLE at this Holiday Inn Express because of one VERY RUDE front-desk personnel.On our recent trip to Florida, we started in the Jacksonville suburb of Mayport, which I guess is considered somewhat ghetto by the locals who clearly have never been to a real ghetto before. This place was a no-brainer for us to stay at because it was brand new and it stands not 200 feet from where my wife's mother lives. We got to visit the family and BONUS: we can also escape them!This place is beautiful. The rooms are gorgeously decorated, the bed is fluffy and comfortable beyond words and the price was right. For our $79 nightly we were rewarded with not only a nice bed to sleep on and a great shower to shower in, but a free breakfast that while certainly not a gourmet tour-de-force, was definitely on par with fast food and oh, did I mention? Free?The people that run the place were unobtrusive and friendly and being brand new of course, it was immaculate. Five stars. Here, after everything is over, I find myself wishing our hotel in the Keys was this nice at three times the price.To be honest I've hated every Holiday Inn I've spent the night in. So I was really pleased with the Mayport branch. The location is conveniently located near the base and exchanges with shopping centers a short drive away. The hotel looks new so the rooms were very clean with a great cable line up. The hot breakfast bar was top notch. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and plenty of cold cereals and pastries. Can't complain for 86 dollars a night. Highly recommended.This place is great!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-jacksonville-i-95-south-jacksonville,Hampton Inn Jacksonville-I-95 South,2.0,$$,7,"After reading previous trip reviews, I knew not to expect a five star property.  The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, we received an updated room.  The room was nice, but we had two complaints:1.  The air conditioner is extremely loud.2.  The ceiling above our bathtub leaked, bad.  We let the management know about the leaking ceiling in our bathroom and he assured us he would credit our hotel stay back to my husbands accounts (we used points for the room).  Standard continental breakfast but the hot items switch from day to day (western omeletts &amp; bacon one day, scrambled eggs and yummy potatoes the next).  You can make your own waffles, customize your oatmeal, eat some fresh fruit or try some danish.  Pool is located out back  - did not use  because of the amount of crepe myrtle flower buds floating in the pool.Location is ok.  If you don't have a car, you're out of luck.  The only thing within walking distance are other hotels (the two next door  have restaurants) and there's a Dave &amp; Busters.  You can drive to St. John's Town Center or downtown within minutes.I checked out after 1 night. .was planning on staying up to 8 nights. Hampton inns usually very nice.  This place is an old hotel not renovated.  Lobby is small and dank.   Rooms were musty and humid.  Wall paper in bathroom peeling w rust showing.    Vending machine broken.  No water in cooler in the small dark gym. List goes on.Transfered to a courtyard inn for remainder of stay and I feel like I'm living in luxury. What a dump!I just got here and really wish I would have researched this place a little first.  It is in a terrible location with pretty much no restaraunts nearby.  It is pretty old and smells very musty.  The staff at the front desk were not friendly at all and pretty unprofessional.  The room smells terrible!!!  Verrrrry musty and mildewed.....the bed is as hard as a rock.  I can tell this is not going to be a good experience but I'm only hear a night so I guess I'll tough it outI did not give star... One of the worst Hamptons I have ever stayed at. . I do not recommend it. .dirty dirty... we got to our first room and there was construction all around us. Both rooms on either side construction. . And ac was not working. . Moved to another room.  Trash in hallways and by elevator.  Room ac was noisy. . Had to get a plunger for the toilet. . Have to use plunger every time we flush.. and got woken early this morning maid opened door and we were still sleeping. Do not disturb on door. . Do not stay here..What I like about staying at Hampton is that the chain is so consistent. I never really have to do any guess work as far what to expect. Now, this one is located in Jacksonville, and it's rather old. There needs to be some updating here. The hall ceilings are low and I feel somewhat crowded in it. The room is clean and adequate, but not anything extraordinary by any means. It's just OK.Pretty decent. Continental breakfast in the morning.Firm beds, not a big fan.Thin walls, so you can hear everything in the hallways if you are a light sleeper.Other than that, it was clean and service was friendly.I thought the King Room for $59.00 was great value. I was road weary and and it was very convenient from I-95. The lobby had been remodeled recently. By the looks they went to Ikea. Actually its a nice layout. They had a bar that served light fare like salads and sandwiches. The room was clean but not as up to date as the lobby. Some of the wallpaper was peeling of the wall.  The bed was comfortable, It had a plasma TV and free high speed internet connection.",,,,,"['reading', 'previous', 'trip', 'reviews', 'knew', 'expect', 'five', 'star', 'property', 'hotel', 'currently', 'undergoing', 'renovations', 'received', 'updated', 'room', 'room', 'nice', 'complaints', 'air', 'conditioner', 'extremely', 'loud', 'ceiling', 'bathtub', 'leaked', 'bad', 'let', 'management', 'know', 'leaking', 'ceiling', 'bathroom', 'assured', 'credit', 'hotel', 'back', 'husbands', 'accounts', 'used', 'points', 'room', 'standard', 'continental', 'breakfast', 'hot', 'items', 'switch', 'day', 'day', 'western', 'amp', 'bacon', 'day', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'yummy', 'potatoes', 'next', 'make', 'waffles', 'customize', 'oatmeal', 'eat', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'try', 'danish', 'pool', 'located', 'back', 'use', 'amount', 'crepe', 'myrtle', 'flower', 'buds', 'floating', 'pool', 'location', 'car', 'luck', 'thing', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'hotels', 'next', 'door', 'restaurants', 'amp', 'busters', 'drive', 'john', 'town', 'center', 'downtown', 'within', 'minutes', 'checked', 'night', 'planning', 'staying', 'nights', 'inns', 'usually', 'nice', 'place', 'old', 'hotel', 'renovated', 'lobby', 'small', 'dank', 'rooms', 'musty', 'humid', 'wall', 'paper', 'bathroom', 'peeling', 'rust', 'showing', 'vending', 'machine', 'broken', 'water', 'cooler', 'small', 'dark', 'gym', 'list', 'goes', 'transfered', 'courtyard', 'inn', 'remainder', 'feel', 'like', 'living', 'luxury', 'dump', 'really', 'wish', 'researched', 'place', 'little', 'first', 'terrible', 'location', 'pretty', 'much', 'nearby', 'pretty', 'old', 'smells', 'musty', 'staff', 'front', 'desk', 'friendly', 'pretty', 'unprofessional', 'room', 'smells', 'terrible', 'musty', 'mildewed', 'bed', 'hard', 'rock', 'tell', 'going', 'good', 'experience', 'hear', 'night', 'guess', 'tough', 'give', 'star', 'worst', 'ever', 'recommend', 'dirty', 'dirty', 'first', 'room', 'construction', 'around', 'rooms', 'either', 'side', 'construction', 'working', 'moved', 'another', 'room', 'trash', 'hallways', 'elevator', 'room', 'noisy', 'plunger', 'toilet', 'use', 'plunger', 'every', 'time', 'flush', 'woken', 'early', 'morning', 'maid', 'opened', 'door', 'still', 'sleeping', 'disturb', 'door', 'like', 'staying', 'chain', 'consistent', 'never', 'really', 'guess', 'work', 'far', 'expect', 'located', 'rather', 'old', 'needs', 'updating', 'hall', 'ceilings', 'low', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'crowded', 'room', 'clean', 'adequate', 'anything', 'extraordinary', 'means', 'pretty', 'decent', 'continental', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'firm', 'beds', 'big', 'fan', 'thin', 'walls', 'hear', 'everything', 'hallways', 'light', 'sleeper', 'clean', 'service', 'friendly', 'thought', 'king', 'room', 'great', 'value', 'road', 'weary', 'convenient', 'lobby', 'remodeled', 'recently', 'looks', 'went', 'actually', 'nice', 'layout', 'bar', 'served', 'light', 'fare', 'like', 'salads', 'sandwiches', 'room', 'clean', 'date', 'lobby', 'wallpaper', 'peeling', 'wall', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'plasma', 'free', 'high', 'speed', 'connection']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 10), ('pretty', 4), ('day', 3), ('like', 3), ('musty', 3), ('old', 3), ('door', 3), ('hotel', 3), ('nice', 3), ('lobby', 3), ('clean', 3), ('rooms', 2), ('feel', 2), ('location', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('guess', 2), ('amp', 2), ('morning', 2), ('night', 2), ('small', 2), ('back', 2), ('expect', 2), ('really', 2), ('hallways', 2), ('smells', 2), ('use', 2), ('terrible', 2), ('place', 2), ('first', 2), ('wall', 2), ('within', 2), ('bathroom', 2), ('next', 2), ('continental', 2), ('ceiling', 2), ('construction', 2), ('hear', 2), ('bed', 2), ('dirty', 2), ('plunger', 2), ('breakfast', 2), ('located', 2), ('staying', 2), ('star', 2), ('peeling', 2), ('pool', 2), ('light', 2), ('walking', 1), ('humid', 1), ('chain', 1), ('planning', 1), ('king', 1), ('still', 1), ('speed', 1), ('previous', 1), ('yummy', 1), ('remodeled', 1), ('hall', 1), ('going', 1), ('adequate', 1), ('looks', 1), ('plasma', 1), ('sandwiches', 1), ('updated', 1), ('good', 1), ('around', 1), ('means', 1), ('far', 1), ('big', 1), ('showing', 1), ('floating', 1), ('dark', 1), ('walls', 1), ('five', 1), ('know', 1), ('desk', 1), ('front', 1), ('little', 1), ('disturb', 1), ('vending', 1), ('cooler', 1), ('potatoes', 1), ('list', 1), ('try', 1), ('bad', 1), ('paper', 1), ('either', 1), ('served', 1), ('went', 1), ('side', 1), ('luck', 1), ('recommend', 1), ('inns', 1), ('dump', 1), ('staff', 1), ('consistent', 1), ('hard', 1), ('bacon', 1), ('flush', 1), ('myrtle', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-by-marriott-jacksonville,Courtyard by Marriott,4.0,$$,12,"This was the best hotel we stayed in our 11 day road trip. We almost switched hotels everyday.  The rooms were very clean, staff was very welcoming and helpful. The hotel had a decent gym and the breakfast was very hearty. They provide vouchers for in house bistro which had a decent selection for make to order items. This was a decent change for us from all the continental breakfast buffet that we had where a lot of items served seem frozen. I wish Marriott did this for all their hotels.OUTSTANDING...staff, customer service...room was nicely furnished, clean and smelled fresh.I arrived on Christmas afternoon - upon my arrival I was greeted by Annie (front desk associate) and Lindsay (front desk supervisor) both ladies were friendly, efficient, and very helpful. Checkin was very fast and was provided with the layout of the hotel...gym, business center, etc.   The lobby area appears to be newly renovated...guessing within the last year or so...everything is very clean and well designed. There is a Bistro and Starbucks in the lobby. There are quite a few TV's in the lobby and breakfast area, always displaying the weather and traffic conditions nearby. There is a pool behind the hotel, nicely fenced and very well kept.My room was located on the 5th floor on the West side...very nice layout...the bed was very comfortable, it was not too hard and not too soft. The design of the room is perfect as well which reduced the noise heard from the hallway. The room was nicely furnished, clean and smelled fresh. It came with a one cup coffee maker, but no microwave. The bathroom was also clean and very nice. The free wireless Internet access worked fine. I was impressed by how little noise I heard from other rooms. As for food there is a Cracker Barrel shares the parking lot space so you can walk to Cracker Barrel, Applebee's, or The Waffle House. . I would recommend staying here if you want a nice clean convenient hotel. As a business traveler I get the opportunity to stay in various hotels. I have to say this has to be one of the best I've stayed at in awhile. The thing I liked most about this hotel is the convenience factor of the location...right off I95 and JTB so easy on and off the highway. If you are traveling with family or needed snacks that are not in the Market store in the hotel...there is a   Publix store for groceries a few blocks away from the hotel (not walking distance) Overall I had a wonderful experience at this hotel.No room service????? 3.5 star rating. Did I wakeup in a different country? I must say everything including the $2.50 small bottle of water was good but you loose points for no room service, come on man. ...I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel! Top notch customer service! They really make you feel like you are a GUEST, and not just a customer. Always clean, always friendly - the perfect stay, if you are in Jacksonville! There are plenty of hotels in this area and this is a little hidden gem! Kudos to this hotel!From California. Stayed for a week for USATF Junior Olympics.  Staff was awesome considering we had our entire track club here! Pacific Coast Shockwaves! Over 85 kids and family! They handled it perfectly! Always polite, and courteous even with all those kids running around.  Hats off to the staff! Thanks for making our stay awesome!This is apparently the new design of Courtyards, and it's fantastic. Modern and stylish. Nice lobby and reception area. Bar and Starbucks. Free super-fast wifi.Stayed at JW Marriot flagship in Chicago last week (which was terrific) and I was snobbishly disappointed to see ""Courtyard"" on this week's itinerary. But I must say this place has completely exceeded all expectations (I've only been here 20 minutes so there may be some surprises, good or bad, to come...)I plan to promptly join Marriot's loyalty program.Late Christmas Eve arrival, had a wonderful greeting front desk attendant.  He was friendly and courteous. Will definitely stay here again.I love the hotel staff and they are very accommodating.  Daniel at the front desk is one of the nicest concierges I've ever worked with.  The rooms are nice and spacious.  The cleaning staff is very efficient.  I've always had great stays here.  Sometimes the wi-fi is a little slow, but at least it's included with the price of your room.The staff at the hotel have been great to work with.  We have stayed here at least 10 times since November. Each time the staff was accommodating and the facility very clean. Love that this is on the beach.This was a pretty nice Courtyard.  The lobby area has been updated to the modern look and feel; however, the rooms still have the older 90s look to them.I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks in a row (minus the weekend). The front desk staff was very friendly and very helpful with whatever I needed. Housekeeping however, was not that great. I was usually up and out very early every morning, but on 2 occasions, I had late morning appointments so I was able to get up post-dawn, where unfortunately, my slumber was disturbed by the housekeeping staff being pretty loud in the hallway. Also, they were not always good about taking the garbage and the beds looked like Goldilocks may have slept in them while I was gone!The room was pretty standard (I requested to stay in the same room for both weeks). I forgot to request a refrigerator, but they had already placed it in my room when I arrived (yeah, front desk staff!). The TV is a good size, and the bathroom is a pretty good size as well.This is the first Courtyard which I have encountered in a long time, which does not offer (complimentary) continental breakfast. I am not a big breakfast connoisseur, but the occasional bagel, yogurt, hot chocolate would be nice. They do offer however, offer a breakfast buffet and other selections, starting at $7.95. I did not have breakfast, so I cannot comment on this.The lobby is nice. There is a computer/printer available. I did some work on my laptop out by the pool one night, it looked nice, nothing extravagant, but still nice. They also offer a small bar of liquor, which can be billed to your room (again, did not partake, but noticed each night in the lobby). Complimentary copies of the USA Today and the Wall St. Journal were also available on the table, once off the elevator. They also have snacks and a cooler of soda/water available (to purchase) in the lobby.The pros for this location, is that 95 N/S are right up the street, St. Johns Town Center is only 15 minutes away, and the Jacksonville Beach is about 20-25 minutes away.There are many stores/restaurants in the area, so it is very business-traveler friendly...if only they could fix the housekeeping issue, and they may earn a 4th star next time around..Well i realize this first reason is not fully the fault of the hotel, but my experience at the hotel was rather 1-2star, and this is why. When I arrived at the hotel, it appeared there was a convention of tween cheerleaders. My only problem is that they were running up and down the halls, banging on doors and screaming pretty late into the night. I had worked a 14 hour day, and going to a business traveller hotel, that did not fit my expectations. 2nd reason: the internet did not work. the employees kept asking me if i had wireless, yes, i said, and i pulled the card out of my computer. after an hour i gave up and went to bed to clear the mind. in the morning- it was still not working, and the employees made me feel as if it were my fault. they gave me a new room, still both my PC and my Mac were not able to connect to the internet, not in my original room, not in my second room. After over 3 hours of working on getting it to work, i asked if i could just check out and go to a different hotel. i cannot afford to not be productive in the few hours i have in the hotels. so i left. when i left, i believe they still thought it was my fault the internet was not working on my computers. when i checked into the Marriott Sawgrass resort later this evening, my PC worked just fine as i plugged it into the ethernet- so i don't think it was my computers, i think it was the hotel. anyhow- a very unsatisfactory and very uncharacteristic Marriott night's stay! ( I am a Gold Elite member of Marriott, and have been in a few Marriott hotels to say the least, with no problems connecting to the internet whatsoever- across brands)",,,,,"['best', 'hotel', 'day',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-jacksonville-east-jacksonville,Holiday Inn Express Jacksonville East,4.0,$$,7,"Was traveling down 95 for Christmas and could tell with traffic it would be late before we could stop. Read the reviews and all sounded pretty good, so called to make a reservation. The 800 number was confusing so hung up and tried the local #.  A lot more efficient!!  When we finally arrived exhausted , they had everything ready, sitting on the counter waiting for us.  I have never been checked in any hotel so quickly.The beds extremely comfortable and large rooms. Breakfast was very nice the next morning before finishing our trip.  Could tell by all the employees that they were on top of things!!!  Highly recommend!!!!I've stayed here several times each of them being pleasant. complementary breakfast and a one time $40 pet fee (theres also a doggie poop spot with complimentary doggie poop bags). The rooms are clean, the noise level from adjacent rooms is minimal and the staff is friendly The only negatives are that its kinda in ""the cut"" situated off of a main road.... In the boonies, and the ice and vending machines on the second floor were non existent. Other than that I'm a fan. And this is my go to hotel for quick family visits. Also there is a waffle house one block away (before the A1A overpass that is AMAZING!)When I am visiting family, I often decide to stay here and every visit is great. There are many pros to staying here:  It is located right next to I295, it is tucked away so the sound of the interstate is muffled and there is no other buildings or hotels where it is located. The hot breakfast includes sausage, turkey sausage, eggs, biscuits, gravy, and there may be a variance in how the eggs are prepared. There is cereal, bagels, muffins, fruit, juice station, coffee station, yogurt and more. The dining area if off the check in counter and it is very spacious with tables and a ""living room"" style set up with couches and a tv on one side. I always get the single room with king size bed. This room has a small sectioned off area with a love seat, recliner, coffee table, microwave and mini refrigerator. Very spacious room. The hotel staff are always friendly and accommodating. The property is well maintained. There is ample parking and grass around to take dogs for a walk or to potty. I have not gone to the pool or used any other amenities to provide a review on those aspects of the hotel. The free wifi is very fast and what I liked which was not in effect the last time I was here is that the net doors of the hotel require key access to enter after a certain time at night. If no key then there is an option to ring the doorbell. So, here is why this is a 4 star review. The shower head for this particular room was mediocre, the water is hard (just Jacksonville area in general), the toilet flushed but I had to press the lever all the way down then manually lift it to the upright position if not it would run all night. The location is good but hard to find because it sits right between a Mitsubishi car dealership and the interstate. It's easy to miss but there is a light shortly nearby and a U turn can be made with ease. There is repaving of the roads so the street is more difficult to see right now. Also, there is no sign near the street with a sign die ring you to the hotel but there is a large billboard with the word ""addicted""  above the street sign that can be used as a clear landmark. There is a one time pet fee of $40 but many places have one. This is my hotel of choice in Jacksonville.This was one of the nicer Holiday Inn Expresses that I have been to. The room was huge, clean, great pillows, and you can never go wrong with a whirlpool tub in your room.  The breakfast was good, considering what it is.  The cinnamon rolls are so good!Clean room and great contential breakfast. Elevators are a little slow. Staff is friendly. Plenty of parking.We were planning a trip to Jacksonville and I have a special discount link so I tend to stay at the Holiday Inn chains. This particular room, because I booked early, was booked at a great rate. I was booking for 5 people so we had two double beds and a pull out couch. The couch area was separated by a short half wall so the room was a good size! It had a microwave and fridge which was handy as we were in town for a long weekend (4 days, 3 nights). A huge pet peeve of mine is a crappy exhaust fan in the bathroom. After a steamy shower, it's annoying as all get out if you can't use the mirror in the bathroom because of being steamed over but this exhaust fan was PHENOMENAL! I even tested it and didn't run the fan until after my shower. By the time I put my face cream on and brushed my teeth, the exhaust fan had cleared the mirror up completely. This particular location also served a free hot breakfast with several options such as bacon/sausage, eggs, biscuits, sausage gravy, yogurt, cereals, muffins &amp; bagels, fruit, coffee, juices and a pancake maker that pops out two small pancakes. No issues with the room or the staff, very pleasant stay, and the beds were so comfy that it was easy to rest well during my stay. Also even though right behind the hotel is a poor area, that didn't take away from the great location because we were 10 to 15 miles from everything we were going to (downtown Jacksonville, beach, etc). Not a whole lot in that area as far as nice places to eat or bars/clubs, but we just drove into the downtown area for all of that. Two thumbs up!!Friendly staff, nice breakfast, good hotel, but The housekeeper didn't come to our room :$",,,,,"['traveling', 'tell', 'traffic', 'late', 'stop', 'read', 'reviews', 'sounded', 'pretty',

The people that works there are very nice . I would definitely come back .Big lobby.  Breakfast isn't free.  kids who are 11 and younger are free.  Swimming was small but nice.  Jacuzzi was warm but did not work.  It was located in the cuts, but there was a Cracker Barrel within walking distance.  Overall, it was nice.Rating:Clean:  4Price:  2  (it was expensive)Service:  4Overall:  4Would come back and stay here.Great staff, nice hotel. Reasonable. Pool is ok..has hot tub too. Pancakes at breakfast are tasty. Breakfast is not included 9.95 per person extra. Would go back. Rooms are clean and bed was comfortableClean rooms, good size bathrooms. Very comfortable bed. But what I was most impressed with was the staff. From the people at the front desk, to the wait staff at breakfast, they just couldn't be more friendly. Thank you for making my stay so enjoyable.The hotel appears to be recently remodeled and is very clean. From my experience, the staff is very helpful and does whatever to make your stay happy. For instance, the front desk unlocked the pool for my boys an hour early on a Sunday morning. Room was spacious and it's nice having the afternoon snacks downstairs. Side note, there is a lot of construction around the hotel at the moment, but the hotel itself is in great shape.Don't eat their breakfast.  I had a bowl of the box cereal and was charged 10.65. You might as well go next door to Cracker Barrel, and eat for 9 dollarsgreat stay.We had wonderful service and rooms were very clean will stay again if we pass throughWe stayed here for two nights.  From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty.  Everyone that worked there was very friendly and very accommodating. My daughter was sick one night and they offered ginger ale and crackers and asked if there was anything they could do.  The staff was always smiling and ready to help in any way. They even called me after I had left because I left a card behind with a check in it. They found it when cleaning the room.  Now that is service.  Honesty is a virtue  that you do not always see.  They went above and beyond to get that check back to me.  Clean, comfortable and good food.  What more do you need.  We highly recommend you check it out.Very nice Hilton! Very clean and well maintained.  The staff was great.  Able to answer questions about places to go near by and with just general things you may need while in a hotel.   The room was very spacious and the bathroom was roomy.   I liked the fact that you could open the room windows.  It would have been nice if it had a restaurant or bar attached like most seem to.   Breakfast was available for 9.95 but didn't explore that option.  Hot Tub outside kept at 104 and was very clean.   The only thing I didn't like was the air conditioning unit vents in the hallway were on full blast and it was only 65 degrees outside. The hallways were freezing!I coordinated a stay here for the parents of an ill service member who had been flown in due to their child's condition.  The staff was very compassionate and accommodating and really went out of their way to help us out.  The lobby was very classy looking.One of the good Hilton's that I have stayed in the Jacksonville/Orange Park area.  The hotel is pretty clean, the staff is very friend, rooms are cleaned on a daily basis.  There are no bugs to fight like I have experienced with other hotels in the area.  The only con to this place would be the gym, they say it opens at 6 but you can get in before 6 as well.  They only have treadmill and one elliptical machine which makes it hard for a person like me (not motivated at all) to wait around if it is already taken.  Apart from that this is a pretty good hotel to staty at in the area.I like this hotel - I would recommend it and I'd stay here again.  Here's why.  The hotel is very clean; my room was comfortable; the staff was very nice to me - and - the hotel food is actually very good and not over-the-top price wise. (obviously, it's still ""hotel"" prices)I spent a couple of nights here and basically have no complaints.  There were not many guests, it seems, this particular weekend and it was nice and quiet during the night.  In my room, the bed was comfortable and the room had the usual amenities: coffee, frig, satellite TV with HBO, iron, etc., etc.They have a breakfast and dinner option in their dinning room which is located in their main lobby.  I did not notice a ""free"" breakfast option.  As I enjoy a quiet setting for both, I decided to sit there and have dinner one night.  On this night - I was the only person there. I can't imagine this is the norm. There were two LCD TV's and they were very willing to give me the remote control to change the channel how ever I saw fit.  The dinner staff was very friendly and I enjoyed a relaxing evening watching TV.  That's the type of stuff that makes staying away from home - in a hotel - enjoyable: Warm and friendly; laid back; no stress.  I enjoyed my stay.If you stay here, I hope you enjoy it as well.My husband and I had our wedding at nearby venue, the Winterbourne Inn.  My husband contacted several hotels in the area to set-up a block of rooms for us and our guests.  The Hilton Garden won out easily, due in no small part to the amazing customer service provided by their Head of Sales, Becky Schaeffer.  Becky was incredibly responsive throughout the whole process and gave us an unbeatable deal.Aside from the wonderful customer service, the hotel itself is very nice.  We had over twenty rooms in our block and I didn't hear one negative comment from any of our guests.  The rooms were clean and furnished nicely.  The lobby turned out to be a great spot for our guests to mingle before and after events.The breakfast in the lobby was a great value.  All the guests received $5 vouchers, which cut the costs virtually in half (originally $10.65).  Even at full price the breakfast would be at least on par in terms of both cost and quality.Good hotel &amp; staff.I stayed here a year ago for a conference and I would rate them a 2-3 on the staff experience I had, but after I notified the manager and the way he handeled the situation I would have to rate them no lower than a 4 star. The hotel is newly built and very clean (the surrounding area is a little sketchy...but it's mainly military). My first night I was hanging up my clothing and there were about 5 hangers in the closet, I needed about 4-5 more, I called the front desk and asked if it would be possible to have more hangers, they said I needed to come to the front desk to pick them up (it was 8:30 pm), I went down and picked up the hangers. The next night I couldn't find a remote in my room, it was maybe 10 pm, I called the front desk and explained the situation...they said I would need to come down to the front desk to pick up the remote...I said no way...I was in my pajamas and I was not about to go down there at that hour, I would just manually change the channel (they brought up the remote in 3 minutes). The very last night I was SO thirsty and did not have cash, I called room service and said I wanted to order a bottle of water and 2 sodas (I would gladly pay the room service fee also), they explained that room service could not deliver drinks, only food, and if I wanted the drinks I would need to AGAIN go to the front desk...I declined and drank tap water. The next week I wrote to the manager of the hotel and explained the type of service I had, but I thought the hotel was very nice. He was very apologetic and explained this would never happen again. He even offered me a free night on my next Hilton stay, I said that was not necessary and I just wanted to bring it to his attention. All in all, I WOULD reccomend this hotel to someone who needs to stay in this area. The manager was VERY helpful and seemed very customer friendly.Not a place you want to go if you want to watch TV. we told the front desk our TV didnt work and they gave us another room and that TV didnt work. and there was nobody on the property that could fix it. spoke to Manager and request a new room to no avail.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-hotel-jtb-southpoint-jacksonville,Best Western Hotel Jtb/Southpoint,2.0,$$,27,"This hotel wasn't bad for the price. You get what you pay for. When we checked in we were able to get our room fairly quickly. We noticed that previous reviews are still current in regards to the slow draining shower. The continental breakfast was decent nothing fancy but better than pastries. Not a bad place and pretty close to restaurants and beach.Never ever would I return! I booked this hotel for 5 nights and already had my first bad experience with the check-in. 40 minutes later i got my keys, went to the room and saw how dirty it was. Napkins and straws were laying on the floor and the painting was not on the wall, it is (even after 5 nights) just sitting on the floor. One evening (6.30) I came back and the room was not made! The reason:They were fully booked! Is this a joke? This is a hotel, if you need more help then hire more people! The shower was terrible, as the water does not go down you are basically taking a bath! As they have a sign for not changing sheets daily, unless you request and put the note back on the bed. I did so the 4th night as i scratched myself and had a little blood mark on the sheet. I came back in the evening and the sheets have not been changed although requested! Never ever again!!! Spend your money somewhere elseThis is a great place if you are an insomniac or a vampire. Rooms are not soundproof- mine is practically in the elevator. Bathroom so small you fall into toilet getting out of shower. Free breakfast awful. Do yourself a favor, sleep in your car.We stayed here in March 2015 when going to the march madness basketball tournament. We wanted a cheap place to stay because we weren't in town long. Unfortunately it didn't even meet up to those standards. I've stayed at best western's before and this is below par for their quality. The bed wasn't very comfy and the hallways and room had a funky smell. It kind of smelled damp. Blech! Glad we only stayed here 1 night. One plus is that it was in a fairly convenient location to get to from the highway. They do offer free breakfast but its not worth it.Price ok.  Pet friendly.Stay away if you wish to shower.  There was standing water in the tub when I thought about taking a shower.  Skipped shower.I dont normally run the shower for 20 mins before getting in, but when I do I hope the water gets hit by then..... Nope, not happening. Stay away if you like to shower.Out dated hotel. Towels are like sandpaper. And can hear everything thru the walls. Seriously hammering woke us up....renovationg they need to close while this work is being done.     I'm only here one nite!Time to check outThe hotel was clean. The bed was comfortable. The tv system was new. Staff members were nice and went the extra mile to make certain our questions were answered. I would recommend this location.The service was very nice and timely, I believe the person  that helped me was Barbara and she may have been the Supervisor.The sheets where not new.. Found hair on the pillow. The water in the shower was actually slimy.. Soap could not remove the slippery feeling on your skin. I've never experienced this before. wow. ""Do not disturb"" door hanger apparently means: please disturbed me with house keeping. It did no good to say do not disturb.. Management take note and get this place into gear.. I would not stay here again.Take a trip back to the nineties! This hotel needs a definite makeover. What I will start out with saying though is that the staff is very nice and professional. It was the first time I received a phone call to my room asking me if everything was acceptable; however, service can only do so much for an outdated and old-minded establishment. The other reviews here are correct in stating that this hotel still has smoking vs. non-smoking rooms. I opted for non-smoking and we didn't have any of the cigarette smelling issues the other posters had. Yet, that's about all I can say for the rooms. From the stained dingy green carpets to the nineties headboards and 'mod-contemporary' art for that time period, these rooms do not generate any sighs of relief after a long days drive (check out the images I've attached). Your bathroom will have the bare amenities, along with your antiquated chipped nineties tub. Everything is thin, from your towels, to your carpet, to your sheets. And though you won't find any (because the dated flourescent lights probably keep them away), you'll be wondering where the buggies are hiding. I was surprised that this hotel had a three star rating, though, after checking the hotel rating system, I see that they barely scrounged by. They advertise a workout room that has your basic weight machine and cardio equipment, but one look at the sweat covered machines, dusty carpet, and bare walls may scare you away. All in all, you get what you pay for. If you need a cheap place to stay for one night and don't care about the room, feel free to stay at this place. D&amp;B's down the road for some mild entertainment. Don't think you're getting a steal though for a three-star hotel. This place barely cuts it. If you do happen to find yourself at this time machine back to the nineties and are in need of some grub, check out Thai Spice Kitchen. It's 8 minutes away and some of the best Thai food you'll ever get for cheap. Two can easily eat under $25.Yuck. My nonsmoking room, even though surrounded by nonsmoking rooms as well still reeked of smoke in the bathroom in the mornings and evenings. It was so strong that it gave me headaches. I recommend that nonsmokers DO NOT book here. The front desk lady is a sweetheart and the hotel itself is quite nice. The hotel should really take a page out of other chains books and switch to an entirely nonsmoking hotel. This is the only reason for the lower rating.Stayed there this weekend. Rooms might have been updated since some of the previous posts, but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable, and I am a little snobby when it comes to hotel rooms, lol.Breakfast was rather blah, however. The ""scrambled eggs"" that the front desk told us about were not scrambled really, but just an egg ""patty"" that looked like it had been around a while. No bacon (horrors!), just sausage, gray gravy to accompany, dry biscuits, some yogurt and fresh fruit to round it out. I went to Waffle House after that. Each night when we would return, we parked in the back lot. Many times there were multiple smokers crowding the rear entrance, so you had to weave your way through a bunch of second hand smoke, yuck. Not sure why they don't put up signs saying not to smoke so close, but oh well. On a side street, but there is a Dave and Buster's just down the way. If D&amp;B is not your style, then you do have to jump in the car to find something more entertaining.I stayed here this past weekend, let me tell you, what a disappointment. The room was clean but when I went to make coffee in the morning, the coffee maker was still dirty from the previous guest. I decided to get some coffee downstairs and wasn't good for the first cup, second cup apparently the machine didn't have anymore coffee. Breakfast is included with the stay and the hours of operation was from 7am-9:30. My boyfriend and I arrived at 9am one morning and 8:40 the other morning and there was nothing. Only thing left was grits and bread, I'm surprised there wasn't an employee to constantly be checking the breakfast room. I ended up spending money on breakfast anyway. I specifically chose this hotel for the free breakfast to try to save some money. Moving on from food, one of the key cards that was given to me wasn't programmed correctly, when I tried to enter the hotel past 1am I couldn't get in. I had to wait for an employee to open the door for me. Overall, it was a very unpleasant stay. I won't be staying in a Best Western again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.Modern building with clean rooms in good condition.  AT check-in I was not asked if I wanted a room with two beds.  I forgot to ask.  Got to room, it was a bit small with only one bed.  I was told they didn't have any more rooms with 2 beds.WiFi signal was very fast.  Desk Had multiple power outlets.  Clearly good things for business traveler.Room had no ""Do not disturb"" sign.Got to breakfast toward the end.  OJ was watery.  Coffee was weak.  No cream.  No whole milk.  No bagels.  No English muffins.  Not sure what they had at the start.In an isolated area with only other hotels nearby.  Nothing you can walk to.  No restaurant in building.The Bellboy needs to learn / train to be courteous. We were waiting for the elevator for a few minutes when the bellboy showed up with this cart and a customer just as the elevator opened. He practically pushed his way into the elevator, with his cart and a customer and filled up the elevator with total disregard of those that we were there before him.  A guy like this shouldn't be working in the service sector if he has NO manner. He reflects badly on the business. Other than, it was an OK quality as far as the cleanliness of the room goes.I stayed here during their construction time and had a good overall experience, clean rooms, classy setting and smiling staff. It was a little noisy but that's something you cannot control during construction. I look forward to revisiting the newly renovated Best Western.Clean room, but what I enjoyed most about this hotel is the staff. The staff here is so nice, I wish I remember some of their names to list them here. Their friendly and attentive, I had left some stuff in the room and they let me in the following day to pick it up. If I am ever back in the area will definitely be staying here again.I was supposed to stay here for 3 nights during memorial day weekend but left after the 2nd night. I really tried to keep an open mind here but this hotel was gross. First they gave us a room that was supposedly non-smoking but it smelled like a fresh cigarette. We asked for a new room which they gave us right away, explaining that the floor we were on was sandwiched between smoking floors. Well the new room they gave us didn't smell smokey but it certainly had its own funky smell. We decided it was no big deal and didn't feel like complaining again.Eventually I noticed how yucky the new room was though, the bathroom was rusty looking and my husband felt it was pretty unsanitary. The carpet was so gross and muggy, in one spot it was noticeably wet! Like a puddle. After stepping in that I didn't want to take off my shoes at all. We noticed the funky smell started to change, it kept getting worse and by the 3rd night it smelled completely rancid. Which is what prompted us to leave so abruptly. My husband and my 6 month old son were coughing and so congested they couldn't breathe properly, non of us were getting sleep! We did try switching rooms again but they were all booked. At the least they did refund our money for that last night.The full breakfast was disappointing. Food was pretty unappetizing and there wasn't much selection. The coffee sucked. Also I don't know what was wrong with there elevator. It was not only slow but disobedient. This computer had a mind of its own, I swear. It would just open up wherever it wanted to and not on command. I think I sat watching it go up and down past my floor like 3-4 times before I couldn't take it anymore and took the stairs! Plus it came pretty close to closing on me at one point.Nice and clean on the outside and in the lobby.  Not so much on the room.  AC didn't work very well.  Pillows were terrible.  I would not recommend.","If you like the incessant noise of jackhammers,then this is the place for you. Plenty of other hotels in the vicinity.Go somewhere else. We have stayed at this place three times on our way to vacation. This place is showing it's age and is in disrepair with no work being done to improve it year over year. Last time we went to check in the servers were down and had to wait over a half hour with no compensation offered. Every time we come here there is not enough luggage carts and you have to wait a long time to get one.The rooms need a big overhaul. The carpets are stained, floor tiles are cracked, doors hinges are rusted and noisy, poor selection of TV channels, poor lighting, beds and linen suck.The breakfast area is a disaster. It is very small and poorly set up.I am done with this place and will not return. We were suppose to stay on our way back home but cancelled and stayed in a much better place.For the price it was hard to beat. Thank God for Hotwire. Front desk was GREAT. (Go Noles). I can't remember his name but I noticed the Seminole pin on his shirt and said ""it's great to know I'm not the only one in the city"" and he said he would give me the Seminole hook up! On top of that there were signs posted saying they were 95% non smoking. Got off the elevator and onto our floor and I smelled ?!? I just assumed it was old smoke? But was extremely thankful that we had a non-smoking room. SO I still have no idea what the smell was but after a few days I forgot all about it. (Even if you are a smoker - NO ONE wants a smoking room.)The rooms were a good size with a pool view (not much of a pool) but there was a fridge but no microwave. Then there was the old school big box TV which would have been just fine if the picture quality wasn't so bad. It looked like I was watching a movie from the 80's. Then there was the curtain that was broken BUT the bed was great. The bed was like a bubble bath with nice dark chocolate and champagne. I slept in a way that felt sinful in that bed. I refused to guess how many people have left in it before me I just hope they had as good of an experience as I did. Bathrooms a little awkwardly placed?So the hotel says they have a ""continental breakfast."" Nastiest thing in the world. Eggs that tasted like Styrofoam. (SO SERIOUS). Cereal, mini muffins, dry waffles, juice, and coffee. I think that was about it. They could have saved the food and just lowered the cost of the rooms by $1. So we headed to Waffle House the 2nd morning. But it all not a bad hotel.Pretty average. Decent price. Small pool. Breakfast was here to be eaten but not so much enjoyed. The food was cleared away promptly at 9:30. It's isolated if you don't have a car. I good place if you are just using the room to sleep in.I stayed here for one reason and one reason only: it was cheap.  The old phrase ""you pay for what you get"" holds true.  It was in a decent location for me because it was close to where I was doing some work, but when I go back I'm staying somewhere else.  Check-in was painless and the front desk guy was nice and knowledgeable about the area.  The room on the other hand was pretty crappy.  I got a smoke-free room.  I was a little shocked that the entire hotel wasn't smoke-free.  The decor was outdated and the bed was uncomfortable.  I don't know why all the hotels are using these little pillows now.  Instead of having two normal sized pillows on each bed, they have four small pillows per bed.  I don't like that.The TV reception was poor.  It had about 20 channels to choose from, but they were all slightly fuzzy and the TV was old.  The AC worked well and so did the iron.  I didn't hear any noise from the other rooms, so the sound proofing was decent.The continental breakfast was pretty lame.  It is held in a tiny dining room with about 10 tables.  The food is cooked and set out in serving trays.  It is not placed in warming trays, so it will sit there and get cold.  There is a microwave in there, so I believe the guests are expected to reheat the food after dishing it up.  This is a pain because the microwave is right next to a table and it blocks traffic.This hotel is completely and totally... Fine. It's pretty unremarkable in every way - which is both good and bad. It's clean enough, the beds are fine and the staff was very predictable and normal. It's a bit out of the way and the breakfast was barely edible - even for a 2 star hotel breakfast. That's my only real complaint. There is nothing special here but nothing to rally my rage against either. It's mad cheap though, so go through Priceline and save some Ching-Ching...Rooms smell like disinfectant and rooms are barren. You can feel the springs in the bed and the rates aren't worth it. The only redeeming quality is the helpful nature of the service- excellent front desk workers who are knowledgeable and really try to get you the best rate.",,,,"['hotel', 'bad', 'price', 'pay',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-jacksonville-14,Hampton Inn,4.0,$$,12,"I loved this stay, I checked in on the way back from our trip, we were extremely tired and this is exactly what I needed. I highly recommend this hotel! Amazing bed and the breakfast is delicious.Came in at midnight. Front desk person was friendly. Room exactly what I expected.  Neat, clean, and bed was heaven. Today I woke up refreshed and in a great mood. Breakfast was great and the entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Only passing through but great spot thanks to the concistancy that the Hilton brands are known for.Hampton Suites JacksonvilleVery good location.  About 7 minutes driving away from the airport, ample parking spaces, and across from the parking lotare the restaurants Ruby Tuesday and Longhorn Steakhouse.  Publix supermarket and more restaurants is about 10 minutesaway by car.Room was spacious, quiet, and clean, what I have come to expect from Hampton hotels.Front desk was courteous, and the morning breakfast had hot food: eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns.There are enough hotels in the area so I'd suggest passing on this one. The same B.O. smell that another reviewer noted 7 months ago was very strong in the lobby.   Room had an older floor heater/ac unit that didn't easily regulate. The airport shuttle also stops at 2 other hotels so when they are busy it takes more time than you might expect. I will say that staff were very pleasant and that is appreciated.Room was very clean.  As was the lobby and the fitness center.  I used the stairs mostly and there was a strange B.O. Type smell on that end of the first floor... But the place is well appointed and had recently been renovated.  I would stay here again when visiting Jacksonville.TV very dim without adjustmentBeds little lumpy but still comfortable Pillows very soft and need all 3 for one personBreakfast spread is actually pretty good as they have lots of options.Eggs though have this weird cheese inside- no buenoYou can make your own fresh waffles a+ there I guessNice, clean and 3 minutes from the airport. Very friendly staff.Hotel is clean and comfortable.  Front staff was welcoming, even when checking in at 11pm.  Would stay here again.  Breakfast was actually pretty goo:  make your own waffles, eggs, etc.Nothing wrong at all here.  Clean.  Comfy. Convenient to airport.  Quiet.  Will definitely stay here again if business calls.Wanted something close to Airport. This was perfect. Hospitable, friendly and a quick and easy check in.  Room was comfortable and very clean. Morning breakfast looked nice, but an early morning flight left me taking a very nice ""Breakfast on the Go"" to the airport. Great place to stay if you need to be close to the Airport.Quick and easy same-day reservations by phone.  They have a big parking lot right out front.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly woman at the desk and given our room keys and some cookies!  Room was clean and smelled good.  Towels were really soft and shower has good water pressure.  Bed is soft and a bit bouncy with lots of pillows.  Breakfast is free and served from 6-10, but I left at 5:30 so they gave me a bagged breakfast (brown bag filled with an apple, cereal bar, bottled water and blueberry muffin).  Free airport shuttle is 24 hours and the ride to JAX is only 5 minutes.  Definitely a great place to stay!Hotel is nice - seems like recently remodeled.  Rooms are clean and bathroom is spacious.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-jacksonville-2,Country Inn & Suites,4.5,$$,12,"I just completed a 5 night stay at this hotel (booking through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, my rate was less than $100 per night), and I will absolutely be staying here again the next time we are in Jacksonville.  Why?  1. Location- It's within walking distance to a Starbucks, Panera, Harbor Freight, and several shopping plazas filled with useful stores.2. Amenities- This hotel gives you everything you need to feel at home- without charging for any of it!  Wifi, huge continential breakfast each morning (this morning was scrambled eggs, potatoes and bacon, plus a waffle maker, 3 kinds of juice, yogurt, oatmeal, grits, tea and coffee, plus one of those fancy coffee makers like they have at wawa that makes french vanilla lattes, cereal, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, english muffins and toast and bagels, and all the fixins for everything... oh yes and fresh fruit), bottled water in the rooms, a refrigerator in the room, cookies and fruit in the lobby at all times, extra toiletries like makeup removers provided daily... truly, I can't think of one thing we needed that we didn't have available in the hotel.3. Comfort- Our room was spacious and comfortable.  It was close to the lobby but quiet, the bathroom was older but very clean and well-kept, and the beds were comfortable.  I'd also be remiss if I didn't point out that the staff was uniformly great.  The front desk sent around a note giving guests the option to forgo room cleaning on Thanksgiving, so housekeeping staff could leave early for the holiday.  We thought that was super nice, and did opt to forgo service.  Our room attendent was Kelly, and she was great- asked us if we needed more toiletries, left our daughters bed all laid out and ready for her each evening... just very welcoming and friendly service... and my daughter loved the lady doing breakfast each morning- she stopped and chatted with us, and was super helpful and kind in the mornings.  Everyone who helped us was great, and made our stay memorable.The bed and pillows were super comfy. The room smelled of mold and carpet was damp. There were some black moldy spots on the ceiling. The staff was super friendly. Starbucks, Panera, amd Applebee's are steps away. Ice machine and vending available. Breakfast and cookies available.Very inexpensive...clean, neat, great breakfast. ..staff is unbelievably friendly!!!!! We were there 7 nights and we will be there again next week for another 7... Fridge and microwave in room..As other reviewers stated, walking distance, literally across the street and next to several restaurants, Starbucks.. and right off the highway...LOVE these folks.... we are going back!!!I have stayed here on many business trips. The rooms are quite nice and the service is friendly and prompt.After experiencing my worst nightmare down the street from this hotel, I was pleasantly surprised at the kind, caring customer service representative who greeted me.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.  What a joy to stay in such a welcoming place!After coming in from a really horrible hotel experience, I was warmly greeted and informed that there was food (including wine) on the house. I was upgraded to a beautiful room with a big tub for free. Beds were super comfortable, everything felt clean... Down feather pillows... Thank you for this!!!!Wow. To be greeted by hotel staff and also have them say, ""Oh, there's wings, beer, and, chili in the dining area. On the house, too,"" was enough to make me a fan of this place. The rooms were cozy, the price was fair, and all was as expected. Nothing to complain about at all. The only thing I'd offer as a change is the bar soap they have in the bathrooms. My goodness. Please change it. It's the kind of slimy soap that doesn't wash off of your hands....or at least feels like it doesn't....ever.All in all a cozy stay!Comfy king bed - clean room - books to borrow-take at the front desk- we couldn't find a room from above savannah till we got here and I was afraid of what we were gonna find but was very pleasantly surprised- great place!!Courteous, friendly staff. Weird temperature differentials in the room - a bit humid. Small pool area. Nice amenities. Walking distance to Starbucks, Ted's, Applebee's and more.Great hotel. Cheap, bars and restaurants are in walking distance, its clean, friendly staff, good shampoo and conditioner, pillows and mattresses are wayyy nicer than any ramada and complimentary alcohol and food on wednesdays from 5-7 only reason its not 5 stars is because its not some fancy hotel...Staff was great. Rooms were nice though very humid. I had two rooms for our party and both had the smell of men's cologne. I didn't use pool or business center, but breakfast was pretty good. Wifi with my iPad was not very strong, but good with computer.Clean and courteous. Relatively affordable too!",,,,,"['completed', 'night', 'hotel', 'booking', 'com', 'amp', 'target', 'rel', 'hotels', 'com', 'rate', 'less', '100', 'per', 'night', 'absolutely', 'staying', 'next',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-jacksonville-south-jacksonville,Holiday Inn Express Jacksonville South,3.5,$$,8,"It is unlike me to write a short review, but it feels like whenever I write a Holiday Inn Express review (and I've written a few), they all seem to say just about the same thing. Why? Because Holiday Inn has thoroughly taken their 'Express' brand of hotels and made them all so similar and consistent that you absolutely know what you are going to get. Sure they all look different inside, but the room sizes (especially the suites), the modern decor, amenities and that fabulous hot breakfast are something you can count on every time you book a stay at an Express.It baffles me that the Express brand is actually nicer most times than a regular Holiday Inn. Since it's conception in 1952, this hotel chain has been designed to make family travel more pleasant and affordable. Legend has it that Kemmons Wilson was unhappy with the choices in hotels after a family vacation in 1951 and wanted to create a place that didn't surcharge him for his children and offered a pool for entertaining them. So he created Holiday Inn.Since 2007, Holiday Inn Expresses across the country have been under renovation to improve the look and image of the brand. It became our go-to hotel for family road trips until about 2012 when the cost of all those renovations began to creep its way into the room rates. Prior to that year, I could get a room for around $79 per night, then it jumped to $89, then $99, then $109 until I found myself paying $189 at one of their premier locations. It was then we decided to part ways with HIE and switched our loyalties to the other Choice Hotel brands such as Quality Inn and Comfort Inn. Everything Holiday Inn stands for is important to me, but so is the price. We have to be savvy as a family when budgeting so that we can get the max out of our vacations. We are not the go to the beach all day every day sort of family. We are explorers and want to see everything a new destination has to offer. The only way we can do that is choosing a hotel that keeps our nightly rates affordable, allowing us to splurge elsewhere in the budget on adventures. For us, HIE has lost its affordability factor, but we still love the brand and will occasionally book rooms when our budget is a little healthier.FINAL THOUGHTSThe Double Queen Suite os the only way to go for a family of four (+ a baby)! Two Queen beds and a pull-out sofa give plenty of sleeping space. Breakfast at this particular location was exceptional (considering it is complimentary):Scrambled EggsBoiled EggsMake your own pancakesHamSausageSausage gravyBiscuitsPLUS a variety of cereals, yogurts, fruits, juices, and coffees as well as those famous Holiday Inn Express hot cinnamon buns. Okay, so maybe this wasn't a short review. I had more to say than I thought I did... LOL! In summary, I'd just like to say we are always pleased with our stay at Holiday Inn Express, even if we aren't always pleased with the price.2016/49Staff was very friendly when we checked in. Accepts pets. They don't have a designated spot for dogs to do there business, bring your own bags. There do have grassy areas. Clean rooms after we removed to a different room. The first room we went into smelled like cigarette smoke. The lady said that the whole hotel was non smoking. So that was weird but once we got to the room it smelled clean. The outdoor pool was really nice, perfect to fight off summertime Florida weather. It's really clean. I didn't use the gym. I saw it though, just cardio machines. The free breakfast hit the spot. I would stay here againstI checked in 6am and Jamie ( the staff member) let me stay until the next day. It was very honest and kind, most hotels would me do the check out at noon and would have to pay one more night . The breakfast was good, small with couple of options. The room was reasonable , clean and organized. Would stay here again.Fancy? Hell no. Clean, quiet with nice staff? Hell yes!No bells or whistles (unless you count complimentary mouth wash, which is really nice in this age of plastic baggies on plans for your liquids) this is a clean, calm, humid site to do whatever you have to do in Jacksonville.Pretty basic room, clean, with fridge &amp; microwave: 2.5 stars.Again, I found the front desk staff amazingly awesome.  A colleague and I arrived from our respective red-eye flights from SF at 10 am and the front desk upgraded us to mini-suites to make up for not having rooms available when we tried to check in at 11 (their check out is late--12 pm!) and the woman was gracious and incredibly polite despite our very early arrival. A+ + 1 star.This ain't a plush hotel, but unlike you a plush hotel, you get free wireless. +1. But it sucks. -1. Still, I've paid nearly $20/day for horrible internet, so final score: +0.5Tucked away in a business park, this isn't, um, happening Jacksonville (if such a place exists) but it gets the job done at a very reasonable rate. Unsolicited &amp; slightly random review: if you find yourself in the Jax area, check out 96.9 The Eagle. The most awesome, cheesy-ass 70's-80's power-rock station I've ever heard. Our entire crew was rocking out to it until we lost it on our way to Daytona Beach. I cried a little Foreigner-Bon Jovi-REO Speedwagon-Journey-Queen tear. The awesomeness overwhelmed me. I need to find out if they have an Internet feed.Never again.It has a funny smell that's not really funny.  It's kinda old.  The air system is loud in the rooms, and well, my cable quit working during the visit.I mean, it's not God awful.  It is clean.  It does serve its purpose.  Nothing more.  If you just need a place to crash for sleep, then ok.  Pets are allowed, so if you hear barking during your visit, know that it is real and you're not crazy.If you want a little bit more, keep on moving.Stay was OK. I think this is the older styling of HI expresses. Check in was a bit difficult. Pet friendly but pretty much NO PLACE to walk a dog. At all. Staff didn't seem overly friendly. Housekeeping started banging around really early in the morning which made for a rough start. Overall, I wouldn't return for a second visit. There's a ton of hotels in that area and I wasn't given a good reason to want to return again.This hotel made me a believer- in Holiday Inns that is. My last few hotel experiences have not gone well, so I was pleasantly surprised with the price, beds, rooms, staff, and everything. We booked online, so we got a better deal, however, Holiday inns are now my go-to hotels!!!Just another hotel, nothing special. My upgrade was to the handicap suite.",,,,,"['unlike', 'write', 'short', 'review', 'feels', 'like', 'whenever', 'write', 'holiday', 'inn', 'express', 'review', 'written', 'seem', 'say', 'thing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/jacksonville-marriott-jacksonville,Jacksonville Marriott,3.5,$$,24,"Staff was exceptional and accommodating after a bad experience with the Radisson next door (where I was supposed to be staying). I was able to walk up and get a room and sympathy for my situation (with my 2 children).Hotel was clean and comfortable. They even provided umbrellas at the door for guests because of the rain. I would only expect it from a higher end hotel so this was definitely a plus.The worst Marriott ever.  Very outdated and over priced.  Old televisions and bad odor in some rooms.  Very unpleasant experience. I wouldn't let my pet stay there.   Someone needs to report this hotel to the better business bureau!!!This is a ghetto Marriott! Sad since the place looks nice and they have an indoor and outdoor pool. Who does construction at 6:45 AM on a Saturday!!!! This is unacceptable. I didn't pay money to stay here so I could hear power drills and tape being pulled and ripped every 5 seconds. Called the front desk and they didn't do a damn thing but say we will tell the manager to contact you. When will that happen? The damn manager isn't even here yet. Went downstairs and they said sorry they aren't suppose to start construction until 12. Then how come you haven't told them to stop yet?! I will be calling corporate.LOVELY! I walked in and was immediately impressed by the interior design. They have their bar right in front as you walk in the main entrance, along with free citrus water and mint cucumber water right as you walk in. The staff is very courteous and their customer service is top notch. I came here for a business meeting and was impressed by the cleanliness of the hallways, bathroom and the conference room. The outdoor pool is absolutely GORGEOUS! I wanted to jump right in for a night swim after my meeting, but that might have been a bit unprofessional... but that is how inviting the pool looked. Overall, I haven't stay in any of the rooms, but if you're looking for somewhere to have a business function, this is a great place to do it.Service in this hotel is outstanding! Staff truly cares about guest needs. Rooms are clean, spacious and up to date. Two pools indoor and outdoor. Fitness center has plenty of different equipment. If your in the area would certainly recommend this hotel.Super nice!!! Clean rooms!!! Nice beds super comfy. Front desk super nice. I'm here for work and was super tired and they got me all set to go in my room. If I come back to Jacksonville I will stay here for sure!Had an event here and the staff was exceptional. Pricing was very fair and competitive for the space. If I had the choice I would use them again for any event as they made sure everything was covered and we were accommodated through out our time thereMan at front desk laughed at me when I told him I had a reservation because he said their rooms were full! Also said that since it was past midnight there was no way that the reservation line could make me a reservation for the night before; turns out my reservation was legit and that they turned me away with a one-year-old child at 2 AM and with no place to stay. Every place nearby was full and my family and I drove for hours before being able to check in someplace. The only person willing to help us find a place was a lady at the front desk of the Holiday Inn. Sad that we've been Marriott rewards customers for so long and not one Marriott worker tried to help us in anyway.Called and booked a reservation at 10:00 pm for (2) rooms, had to cancel the reservation, and called back at 11:30 pm the same night.  Was told they booked (3) rooms in my name and that all (3) rooms were subject to a late cancellation fine, as their policy stated such fines would occur after 6:00 pm.  This policy was not relayed over the phone, before the reservation was made.  Seems like important information to pass.After some debate with a customer service representative, who spoke to the manager; I was told that (2) rooms would not be charged a fine, but (1) would ""have to be charged"" as the manager ""didn't want to get in trouble for canceling (3) without a fine,"" and that, ""the policy's the policy.""What?I've stayed here many times. It is a fine hotel, but age is taking its due on the property. I doubt it has ever been remodeled, my best estimate is that it was built in the late 70's-early 80's. The staff is polite and helpful. The gym has a great selection of equipment. As a platinum member I grade hard on the concierge room. This one is very low quality. No meats for breakfast, only eggs and oatmeal. This Marriott is no longer providing bottled water, one of the largest benefits to me personally. Does not offer Starbucks coffee where all most all other Marriott's do.We had a wonderful stay here. Pool was great, gym was complete, restaurant was good, and the service was excellent. My room blow dryer broke while using it and immediately they replaced it and even gave us complimentary gifts for our slight inconvenience. Truly a great experience.I was very impressed with this property. Check in was super speedy, staff extremely friendly and the room very tidy-all the furnishings looked and felt brand new but overall that bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.  Way more comfortable than the Sheraton and the Crown.The bar staff is a friendly and very accommodating team. I was having a late night craving and didn't want have hot wings or a quesadilla or fries so when I asked for something off the menu, my bar tender was super eager to help. She ended up frapping me up a banana, pineapple, blueberry and 2% milk smoothie. It was exactly what I needed to settle my hunger pangs for the night.I will be checking in here again real soon.Posted our stay back in the summer.  The 5 stars go to the staff at this hotel!!!!  Awesome from the time i walked in to the time I left.  Everyone is happy to be there!!  If you have not been to this hotel, you need to.  The hotel itself needs work.  From July to now, I can see the changes.  Still more is needed.  But, Staff is just awesome!!!!!The place is riding the goodwill of its stellar employees.  Without them, the place would need to be shut down.  A complete ---and total---remodel is sorely needed at this location.  It is clear that the ownership has spent next to nothing on the place in years. Outdated as hell, hasn't had a good coat of paint even.  Only reason for two stars is the five star employees.  Come on owners...give this great team a facility to be proud of.Conference center staff were great and the overall staff were great as well. Not much to this hotel and those facilities were a bit outdated. However they had great rooms that were nice and up-to-date. For the offerings in the area, this hotel hit the mark. Once again - I will say it - Dear Marriott, you should not have to pay for wireless!!!!!I have never stayed at the room but have had meetings here.  Staff is very professional, prompt and quick.  Even though the hotel is huge, it's not hard to find the help you need when you need it.I never have any issues with set up or with anything being done well in a timely manner here.Like everyone stated, the staff here is awesome. My little girl had her birthday when we got there.  Once the staff found out, they showered her over and over with treats and gifts. Everyday was good morning Mr. Lee, how are you today, can we help you with anything. I am a Marriott person thru and thru. I gave bad reviews to some high end marriott hotel. This staff should be awarded by Marriott for beat service in the worth shape hotel in the marriott family. Management really need to update the place!Very nice.Used this hotel as it was the host hotel for a function we attended on a weekend. Check in was fast, room was spacious, bedding comfortable, bathroom adequate size, room was clean, no noise, staff friendly. The bartenders in the lobby were great. Ate breakfast &amp; lunch in their bistro &amp; service &amp; food were top notch. Parking was ample too. There is a Dave &amp; Busters within walking distance (2 blocks). We didn't venture out during our stay, but it seems close to most things--good location. Would use this hotel again.For the price I did not expect that this hotel was going to offer what it did. Room service, indoor pool and onsite restaurant.  Will continue to stay here in the future if I'm looking for a quick stop in jax.","I've attended several Special Events at this Hotel. Their main ballroom is very large and the food and service was very good. The parking lot is very large and it's easy to get to off of Salisbury Road. The rooms are clean.Hotel is OK, no problem. I'll come back again. I became a bit miffed at the concierge who steered us to a poor choice for dinner because of his incentive arrangement with the restaurant (I suspect.) This left me with an overall negative impression, though it certainly was not a bad recommendation, just not what we had in mind. Should have relied on Yelp instead, but sometimes its late and you get tired of having to look everything up. So, got what I deserved in this case!Stayed here a few times. Rooms are ok...they seem old. the restaurant did not have much for vegetarians (except salads). Salads are not a meal...they are eaten prior to a meal. I cant get my nutrition by eating leaves...especially lettuce.Anyways, the hotel is in a complex where there are a number of other hotels. you need a rental car or taxi to get here from the airport, which is quite far away.some restaurants in driving distance.Nice rooms, great staff, nice pool. Convenient quiet location. Food's good. Nice lounge for the Marriott rewards folks.If you've got business in the area or your just on holiday you should enjoy it here.",,,,"['staff', 'exceptional', 'accommodating', 'bad', 'experience',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-jacksonville-downtown-southbank-jacksonville,Hilton Garden Inn Jacksonville Downtown Southbank,3.0,$$,23,"Hotel staffing put this hotel in the 5 star category for me. Everyone was so eager to please and make sure my husband and I had everything we needed. The rooms were spacious, but the bathroom was a little on the small side. Both of us couldn't be in there at the same time without bumping each other. The lights were a little tricky in the bathroom too. Make sure you turn the light switch on while showering or else the sensor will think you're gone and turn the lights out. All in all, it was a great stay!This HGI is a comfortable and convenient spot to crash close to Downtown Jacksonville.  The rooms are standard HGI... Decent space, Kurigs and mini fridges in the rooms, comfortable beds.  There is a small bar in the lobby, and breakfast is good here.It's an additional charge to park in the garage next door.  There are a few parallel spots for free just outside the lobby if you feel like saving a few bucks.There are plenty of places a short drive away to eat and drink, but not within walking distance.  Check our Aardwolf Brewing a couple blocks away.  A local brewery within ""stumbling"" distance is a plus.The hotel is fine and the rooms are standard Garden inn. They have a nice bar in the lobby area that serves food and drinks. I don't know the area well but you can tell it's close to downtown. The downside is parking, where you have to pay $10 bucks even if you park in the street that is considered part of the property - I asked the front desk about it and he said that the city owns the hotel and street so that's why they charge the same fee from the parking garage across the street... interesting huh? Overall is a descent choice if you want to stay right downtown.I stayed here recently while I was on a business trip and was satisfied with my experience. The location was convenient to downtown and a few other areas with restaurants as well as the museums.Pros: standard rooms, Keurig coffee machines, coin laundry, well stocked breakfast and large breakfast areaCons: $10 parking in a secured garage where your key working was spotty at best, uneven service from the front deskPro tip: as noted in other reviews, this HGI is on the same property as a Homewood Suites and you can totally crash their evening happy hour.I hope my experience was a unique one off and does not happen to other travelers. I came to Jacksonville for a business trip and checked into Hilton Garden Inn. To my surprise my hotel key opened a room that was occupied by another guest. Luckily the guest was not in his room or that would have been an awkward story. This is alarming as they can easily give my room key access to another person. Probably would not stay here again if I had to come back.The location is perfectly fine. I had never been to Jacksonville, but found the area nice and easy to walk to a good selection of restaurants and shops. This was the only high point of my experience.I was given complimentary internet, which is always a treat, but this was a let down. Even though it was free, the internet was terribly. Terribly internet is way more hassle than no internet. So at no cost to me, I got a lot of hassle and frustration added to my trip.The mattresses were awful. I have not in recent memory slept on a mattress of poorer quality. The temperature controls did not appear to do anything.The food was decidedly sub par, the cost made it a joke. The service was not very good at all. At breakfast, there were maybe 5 tables seated, with only two people at each one. There were two servers. I am not sure what they were doing, but it took forever to get their attention or get any sort of service.The rooms are fine, but basically identical to a much cheaper hotel. They have Keurigs in the room, but free coffee downstairs anyway. This was like a crappy motel in the middle of nowhere with different branding and worse mattresses.Quite frankly, I am shocked that the Hilton brand would associate with such a poor quality hotel. I'm certain that you can do better in Jacksonville.This hotel was actually very nice for the price. I paid $700 for a five night stay in a double room and was blown away at the overall quality of the hotel/rooms. The rooms weren't crazy big, but they were a good size for being a double, the bathroom was nice and very updated. Our room included a mini-fridge/microwave along with a Keurig machine. The AC unit actually worked too, it wan'ts the strongest by any means, but it worked well and kept the room cool during mid day. There were a few things I didn't like, though. For one, the pool closes at 10:00 P.M, which I find pretty odd since it advertises no life guard/swim at your own risk, and which is gated and requires a key card to enter. Either way, it wasn't a big deal.The next was the hotel bar, it also closed at 10:00. Which to a degree is understandable, but still pretty early for a bar. I'd normally expect something like 11-11:30 to be normal. The laundry room for some reason also closed at 11:00, Which made doing laundry semi difficult because if you didn't get your load done at least an hour early you would be locked out until morning. One thing to note, is that there is no free parking. The hotel owns all of it and the parking garage adjacent to the hotel, this means you get to pay $9.99 per day for parking. Which seems like a complete rip-off considering it's almost entirely empty 24/7. The very last thing to note is the Wi-Fi...holy crap it was terrible. First off, they do offer free internet..but they cap you to around 100Kbps which is incredibly slow(imagine ultra slow DSL). They do however, offer a paid internet service for $4.95 per day which increases your speed....to 300Kbps...The internet situation here is a joke and a complete rip-off. I ended up using my AT&amp;T phone to tether to the laptop which was giving me a much better connection. Which is actually kind of funny because the hotel is using AT&amp;T hotspot service as their internet. Overall, this hotel was pretty decent for the price and I would definitely stay here again.So we are staying here as a stop over to an early morning California flight. They offer regular rooms &amp; suites. I used my military I.D. to get a reasonable rate on a two-queen bed room. The room has a fridge, microwave &amp; keurig. There is free wifi using your room # and last name. They have pricey breakfast &amp; dinner. We ate dinner there, burgers are $10 each. The waitress has to deliver to the restaurant patrons AND room service! She was overwhelmed at times. Poor thing! Think the cook was having a hard time which was pushing more pressure on her. Food was decent. Had daily soup &amp; mac/cheese. It was a bit greasy but ok. The sweet ice tea was delish! Great cookies in the lobby. The front desk staff were delightful &amp; helpful. I would stay here again. Restaurant prices are steep but room price decent. Its a 4* hotel.Great hotel. Secure parking. Located within walking distance to local eateries and shops. Our room was nice and the balcony had a nice view of the city, especially at night. And I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the pool table area downstairs! Great service at the front desk as well!Pros:  Clean hotel, good breakfast. Cons:  -HORRIBLE service at the restaurant in the evening. Worst I've ever seen. -Expensive pantry. It's Jacksonville not Manhattan.The location is not bad. It's in San Marco just across the bridge from downtown/Jacksonville Landing. The bar closes really early (at 10:00p sharp). Most hotel bars are open until after midnight, but at least there's one directly across the street called Local's Bar that's open until 2:00a seven days a week. Here's another hint about the bar service at the Hilton Garden Inn - It's in the same building as the Homewood Suites and both are owned &amp; operated by the same people. The Homewood has free happy hour 5:30 - 7:30 Monday thru Thursday. Hilton guests are welcome to partake in free drinks if they walk over to the Homewood bar. The only beer available is Bud Heavy and Mich Ultra, but it's free and it's all you can drink for two hours each weekday.The rooms are nice. They are typical for Hilton Garden Inns. I like the chairs and the beds are comfy. The wireless Internet is of decent speed. Everything is very clean and it still has the feel of a new hotel.The exercise room is shared between the two hotels and is very nice. I love the PreCor equipment. It can get crowded, so go early (or really late).The pool is also shared and is small and usually in the shade, due to being in a corner between two buildings and the front breezeway.Parking is $10/day. It's an open lot with no gate, so you make the call on whether to tell them you have a car or not.There are a few places in walking distance. Of course Local's Bar is right across the street. It's a smokey dive bar, but prices are dirt cheap and it's very convenient. There are two nice restaurants about four blocks to the right (North). One is BB's, which is in the top 10 best lists on anything you look at for Jacksonville restaurants (Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.). They have excellent food and wine. The sushi place across the street from BB's is even better in my opinion. It's called Basil Thai &amp; Sushi. The staff there is awesome. The food is even better. As far as Jacksonville hotels go, this one is pretty good. I stay here or at the Homewood whenever I have to travel to Jacksonville. It's much nicer and better located than the rundown Embassy Suites in Baymeadows.Comfortable hotel rooms but the air conditioning units are noisy. Cookies and infused water make it pleasant to arrive at the lobby.Stayed one night, May 26th and that was enough for me. The good:-Clean room-Modern/relatively new hotelThe bad-Parking $10 per day-The hotel adjoins another so my view was right into another room at the Homewood Suites-Television didn't work, took an hour plus to fix, still not working properly-Tiny pool considering it serves two hotels-Was booked into a double asked to change to a king, was told it was $40 extra per night-Inconvenient location for me-Bed was horrible, not a big fan on Sleep-number bedsOverall a poor value for the $169 I spent. I felt the hotel was nickel and diming me with parking charges and upgrade fees.I will not return and will only use HGI as a last resort. This morning I feel terrible because of these beds.Feeling ripped off.We decided to stay at this hotel for a recent girls weekend that we were having in the Jacksonville area.  Wanting a place that was close to the San Marco and Riverside areas, Hilton Garden Inn was an obvious choice.  I was a bit nervous after reading some of the Yelp reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised!All employees from the moment we checked in until we went home were extremely nice and accommodating.  I have to give a special shout out to Rose and William at the front desk who both went above and beyond for us the entire two days we were there.  Our room was also very large and clean.  We spent some time at the pool and hot tub and much enjoyed both.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay near the San Marco and Riverside area.This hotel's in the middle of nowhere, really, even though it says downtown. There is nothing walkable within the hotel's distance; at least, I wouldn't be caught walking in this deserted area at night alone. There is a Homewood Suites RIGHT next door to this hotel, which I find interesting. You have to pay for parking, and hotel guests are only supposed to park on the first floor. The first time I stayed at the Homewood Suites next door, I didn't know that (ramp wasn't sectioned off), but this time I noticed the ramp was closed to hotel guests.There's nothing that special about this hotel other than it's close to where I have to be for work. The total for one night was $185.84 including taxes, surcharges, and parking. It's your typical hotel, although they did let me have free breakfast and still earn points, which is always nice!Very clean hotel with free internet.. Now the charging for the parking I don't understand why charge the guest for self parking....I wanted to go relax in the pool but it closes at 10pm...like Almost everything in Jacksonville..... Ugggg well I will swim tomorrow.. MI always stay at Hilton Garden Inn Downtown when I'm in Jacksonville for business.  While it's nothing fancy, I keep returning because it's always clean.  Further, the Hilton staff are friendly and always accommodate my needs.Nice hotel. Nice location. Nice cleaning crew. Nice waitstaff at the bar/restaurant. Mostly nice crew at the desk. Some good beers and good food at the restaurant and many more choices for good beer and food within walking distance. Little concerned that my bill ""should"" have been under my door on the last morning but was not and all I got out of the desk clerk was that she ""just came on."" Hello?! Identity theft!All good things.  I'd give it five stars but no free weights in the fitness room.  Close enough to walk to a couple great restaurants, and within a mile of a killer running path that goes up and over a bridge.  Friendly folks.Find another place to stay if you can, don't be persuaded by the ""downtown name"".  This place is in a weird area on the edge of town with nothing around except street walkers and homeless.  Arrival was smooth and it's a nice place, looks new.  I am a diamond member that travels every week so I have kind of high standards but this place came across as just ""ok"".  I did get upgraded to a big room due to my status but only after I asked and the guy acted like it was a favor.Room was nice, bathroom had dirty Kleenex in the trash and hair on the toilet. Beds are terrible, absolutely terrible!  Pillows are to airy and falls flat immediately.  Ordered room service, took almost 2 hours after placing an order over voicemail because they were to busy to answer the phone, can't imagine why, to get my food.  Steak was swimming in water along with the cold Mac and cheese,  was very well done instead of medium well as requested and was mostly comprised of grissle....all in all this hotel was nothing special at all, I am here as a single guy but I can't imagine bringing a family here especially due to the area it's in.  It is a nice place for sure but terrible service","Booked a girls weekend here &amp; had a blast! We stayed in a suite with two queen beds &amp; a pull out couch. The room was comfortable &amp; spacious. The staff was very friendly, and did not mind bringing us extra towels, tp, etc. They even assisted us in calling cabs to go out at night. The hotel is in a somewhat strange part of town. The walkability isn't great but it is a short ($10) cab ride to Riverside/downtown &amp; even less to San Marco attractions. I was surprised to find out that they dont offer continental breakfast, and that is one down fall of this place. Also, the pool was beautiful but shady later than 3:00 p.m. Tip: Dont pay for parking. No one knows if you park in the garage for free!!Very clean, friendly service, and nice amenities. They offer a great military discount as well. Our room included a balcony and a great view of downtown Jacksonville. The only downside about this place is the location. It's not in the best area, but it's close enough to drive to the downtown area. No free complimentary breakfast included, but you can buy breakfast for about $12. Overall, it's a great stay!The hotel itself is relatively new / rooms are big and clean.  Few issues though:1) The beds are horrible.  It has been a long time since I've had a bad hotel bed, but this one is rock hard (even with the adjustment set to softest setting possible).2) Train tracks nearby / quite noisy.3) Not the safest area, especially after dark.",,,,"['hotel', 'staffing', 'put', 'hotel', 'star', 'category', 'everyone', 'eager', 'please', 'make', 'sure', 'husband', 'everything', 'needed', 'rooms', 'spacious',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-central-jacksonville,Hampton Inn Central,3.5,$$,23,"We needed a hotel in a hurry and we were so glad that we found this one. It was not expensive and we received great service. The only minor complaint I have is how rough the pillowcases are. Customer service is excellent, the hotel is very clean and well kept.This hotel is old, tired and has a bad smell. You can try to make a silk purse from a sow's ear, but it is still a sow's ear. No wonder Wyndham left the building. No TV service when it rains. Rained all night. The water did not drain from the bathroom sink and I had to keep turning off the water so it would not overflow. I tried to take a shower, but same thing. I cannot stand taking a shower with water half up my calf. Then I set the alarm for a good night's sleep. Unfortunately, they did not bother to set their room clocks back, so I was up more than an hour before I wanted to be. When I went down to complain and get coffee, the girl behind the desk was very busy - playing on her cell phone. She could have cared less my room clock was not set back.  When I said a swear word and said perhaps she should work instead of play on her phone, she  told me to leave the hotel since I said a swear word. Locked me out, called police. You can bet I will NEVER stay at another Hampton Inn again - EVER. And the coffee in the morning tasted like rain water. Not a good choice. Pick the Holiday Inn Express.A typical Hampton Inn.  The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly.  This location could probably use some updating/refreshing.The breakfast buffets is typical, which means pretty good but nothing to rave about.  I always make a fresh waffle--which I love.The location is great if you need to be downtown on this side of the river.  I come on business and it is convenient.My husband and I got married across the street at Treaty Oak Park and rented out a room to get changed in after we were done decorating (and yes, we spent the night...after a drunken post-reception party with some close friends). Everyone who worked there was SUPER friendly and completely helpful in every aspect (Sigourney, Key, Winston - sorry I really tried to remember the names I hope I'm at least close!) Even after all my worried phone calls during the previous two weeks before we stayed there, they were all professional and courteous.The hotel is very nice, clean, and spacey. Had nice TVs and a fridge in the room. Also had an iron with ironing board, hair dryers, coffee pot, etc. If you forgot a toothbrush, toothpaste, or really any of the basic necessities, you could just call the front desk and get it. Coffee was almost always available in the lobby and breakfast is served everyday between 6am-11am. Great location and by some cool spots in San Marco :)The staff could not be any friendlier. We met a lady named Tina who works there. She provided us great direction to downtown and what restaurants were near us. Even gave us a free drink voucher to River City Brewery. Hotel is clean and a nice view.Friendly staff and good location. The hotel is what you would expect at a Hampton. Property is clean and well kept. You will find the normal cookies at the front desk and optional popcornThis place was nicely located right next to I95. Although they tried to get me far from the highway, the fact is -- I was still next to the highway and heard the traffic through out the night. Service was friendly.The hotel looks like it went through recent renovations. The lobby looks up to date and great. The carpets in the hallway are nice and clean. The rooms and bathroom were all decent. They have these new mass printed notes that say your sheets are clean for your arrival. I don't know how that changes my outlook but I still am aware what goes on at a hotel.Breakfast is available as with all Hampton Inns. Each floor had a great ice machine great for refilling for travelers. The direct TV was a little unreliable but of course a bad storm hit while I stayed there.Very Very pleased with this hotel ! Samantha and Yolanda at the front desk were so polite and accommodating! They provided a free wine opener and gave us tips and hints on where to go and what to do. Was there the weekend of Dec 13-Dec 16th. The breakfast was delish -- love the make your own waffles! So fun! Whatever you do, DO NOT GO TO THE WINE CELLAR restaurant across the street. We got 2 cocktails and a bill for 41.00!  I asked how 2 cocktails (jack and coke and gin and tonic could be $41, and I was told ""this is a 5 star restaurant sir"". Steer clear!).Hotel was very clean and smelled fresh. The bathroom and toiletries were Nuetragena. The bed was so soft and comfy. The pool was cute and the grounds (entrance, plants, etc) were very clean and well kept. The BP gas station across the street was a little shady, but the prices were fair.The river walk and river taxi 2 blocks behind hotel were great! so easy to access! Also - we ate at the SAKE HOUSE 2 blocks behind Hampton and it was absolutely delish! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!  Best hotel for the buck. You will be pleased!To be honest, I have had a most difficult time finding a suitable hotel for me in JAX.  I have stayed at the Omni, it's nice, however they nickel and dime you, and it's a hassle to get in and out because of its size.  Fairfield is clean and nice, but I needed someplace more centrally locatedSo, I try Hampton because the Wyndham Riverwalk seems like a disaster from the reviews.I made the right choice.  This hotel has easy access--fairly easy to get in and out of, if there is no traffic blocking the entrance.  So, JAX people, it's nice to leave an opening at a business entrance in traffic instead of blocking me.  Just be nice.Everyone is super friendly here and helpful.  Someone went out of their way to find deodorant for me as I left mine at home, and someone else got me hot water to make hot chocolate.  They serve cookies and popcorn for snacks in the evening, and I got to choose my snack based on status with Hilton.  Very nice.Rooms are clean and comfortable, breakfast is nice, and they allow me to check out late.I am surprised that so many people like this hotel. The hotel could use a major update. I checked in on a Saturday and stayed two nights. The first day someone was having a baby shower in a private room on the first floor. I was hanging out in the lobby waiting for a family member. They were so LOUD and obnoxious. The room I stayed in was clean, but the carpet was worn in spots. The bed was comfy. I went to bed early the first night. I could hear someone outside my door with a dog barking. Also heard people talking loud and slamming their doors. The second night I could again hear doors slamming. That morning people could be heard early talking loud and again slamming the door. Next time I think I will go to the Hilton. This property is not for me.Ok, I'm somewhat puzzled.  This Hampton Inn seems to get some great, if not almost RAVE reviews.  Is it possible that there is another Hampton Inn nearby?  Or maybe I've finally succumbed to a nasty bout of Hilton Itis?I'm really comparing this to other Hampton Inns, and it still comes up 2 stars in my book.  The rooms have that odd smell of humidity and sweat.  The heating/cooling system featured a fan that turned at the blistering speed of one revolution per minute.  The place was remarkable in its utter unremarkable.  Maybe the location is convenient for downtown visitors, but to me it is worth throwing in the convenience for other offerings near some nightlife and restaurants.  The most convenient option here is the BP across the street (they sell a killer pre packages Italian sub....expiration date is a year from next tuesday).When I return to Jacksonville, I think I'll pass on this property and check out the Hilton Garden Inn just a stop up the road further.Clean rooms , no foam pillows. Hot Breakfast sucks... Cold turkey links and egg chunks. Not up to the standard Hilton family experience. If not for building up my points bank, I would not come back.Just stayed here this weekend (July, 2012) and couldn't have been happier.  Great price, clean rooms, the decor is updated and the place just looks/feels new.THe room was very clean, comfy bed, big flat screen tv and WiFi worked great.  Fridge in room was a nice plus.Late afternoon snack (cookies) were nice touch and typical Continental plus warm foods breakfast provides more than enough choice.I stopped two doors down at the Wyndham and my in-laws and it was a DUMP - made the Hampton shine that much more.Great job!Usually like to stay at Hampton and this one did not disappointed. Its very well located in downtown Jacksonville. The room was real clean and the room was cheap for a Saturday. The staff was all real nice and helpful. Free Wifi is in the hotel and thats a great perk since some hotels still try to charge or it. Definitely stay here if you're in the Jacksonville area, I will again for sure.I had a hard time giving this a 4.  I really was thinking 3.5 stars.  The hotel seems to have been recently renovated with new carpets, sheets, and 40"" LCD TV's..Not to bad.  The service was also very good.  But I just don't love the location.  While it's close to downtown, it's not close enough to walk, and the skyway is not open on the weekends..real bummer.  The wi-fi speed was decent, ad the pool was just OK and outdoors.  Not a bad location for the price.Very nice mid-level hotel that caters to business people.  Great breakfast buffet in the morning.  Awesome customer service.  Good location near hospital.  Very clean.Friendly and helpful staff. Convenient location. Great value. Comfortable accommodations.Another great stay at a Hampton Inn. It was clean and not worn out, the breakfast was great, and service was friendly. Free parking is nice. Not a lot of restaurant options in walking distance, but there is the lovely Treaty Oak park next door. The waterfront is about a 10 to 15 minute walk.If I'm in Jacksonville again I'll definitely stay here.Omg  maybe I was a little to geeked to be in Jacksonville for the first time but this was really the best hotel ever. We were there for three days and even though i didn't the maid to come clean our room she always checked to see if we were ok or needed any new towels. The wifi is fast and I was geeked because I was watching Netflix movies allll Night Long. the breakfast is served from 6am until 10am. Waffles are soo good i wanted to take they waffle maker which makes perfect waffles everytime!! The staff was nice and the price was nice. it was about 366 for 3nights and four days!!!! Right in the center of it all and not far from public transportation.We drove into the parking lot only minutes after the start of a torrential rain shower.  So it was a welcome sight.  I generally love Hamptons...clean facilities, free breakfast, &amp; reasonable prices.  This location was perfect for the weekend activities we had planned...visit the Cummer Museum, the Riverside Arts/Farmers Market, the Landing, San Marco Square, &amp; Cuba Libre dance club.The staff was friendly, helpful, &amp; attentive.  The room was modern, clean, &amp; comfortable.  We had a newer flat screen TV...40"" I think.  There was a small pool.  For breakfast we generally had oatmeal, raisin bran, fresh fruit, coffee with milk, waffles, yogurt, with an occasional pastry.  They also had eggs, sausages, bacon, pastries, &amp; pancakes which we did not try.We had a great time in JAX while staying here, &amp; heartily recommend this Hampton.","Nice place.  Close to shopping and food.This was a great hotel! I made my first visit to Jacksonville and made my original reservations in downtown Jacksonville by the North Riverwalk. I arrived to find my only parking options were Valet (an additional $20 for overnight) or the Parking Garage (additional $10-$15 for overnight). I was unaware the hotel charged this so we cancelled our reservations. After driving to 3 other hotels who charged for parking, we drove less than 2 minutes across the bridge to the Hampton Inn. We were greeted by an exceptionally nice concierge and got a room. He did inform us of the thefts that had been going on around downtown and to ensure all valuables were brought in or removed from view. The hotel also offered a complimentary breakfast, cookies and popcorn. The next morning we received our check out receipt under the door so we didn't have to go to the desk. We did go for breakfast and were greeted by two more exceptionally friendly employees. This hotel was great, especially for the price. I'm currently in the military and with the discount the rate was $80 (and the free parking) which definitely was a steal since less than 2 miles away the rates were at least $100 a night plus the additional $10 per night for parking.I'm not sure why, but this place fills up.  Totally.  During the week, they say it's the business people, and on the weekends, it's the conventions.  All I'm saying is, book it a few weeks in advance, or end up staying by yourself in a smoking room across town while your four colleagues relax in their non-smoking rooms right by where you need to be anyway.Free wi-fi!  Great for those people with their own laptops and a wireless card, but otherwise, there is only one lonely desktop for everyone's use in the lobby.  Make sure you sign out, because for some reason it keeps you in the system whether or not you checked the ""yes this is my computer"" box.  Tsk tsk, lady-whose-ebay-account-I-was-in!  The facilities are ok, nothing amazing or new but decent.  The breakfast is the basic coffee, cereal, biscuits, with a rotating hot tray of sausage, egg pucks (these can NOT be real eggs), egg hash mix (don't do it) and it seems on Thursdays, sausage gravy (not great but not bad).  There is no exercise room, but there is a pool, and all in all, it's pretty quiet.  The staff is very friendly, and here are a few more perks: a popcorn machine in the lobby; fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the lobby in the evenings; fresh lemon water and cucumber water in the lobby in the late afternoons.Watch out for old televisions!  Some of the sets have that I'm-about-to-give-up-the-ghost whine of old electronics that is sure to give you a monster headache.  My last visit didn't have that problem, but the plumbing screamed so loudly, I was afraid the faucet was going to explode and take out one of my legs.  Try and explain that to your co-workers when they have to come find you.",,,,"['needed', 'hotel', 'hurry', 'glad', 'found', 'expensive', 'received', 'great', 'service', 'minor', 'complaint', 'rough',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-jacksonville-hotel-jacksonville,Sheraton Jacksonville Hotel,2.5,$$,32,"I think this hotel is actually pretty decent. Nice layout. Good room design. Loud A/C, but not unusual for the type of unit. Lacking convenient plugs/electrical outlets around desk, but I was able to get creative with other jacks around the room. :-) Nothing to complain about. Friendly / helpful staff. Seems clean, which is my top priority when traveling. It's a Sheraton. It's not a W or Westin or Le Meridian. And, honestly? It's a damn fine Sheridan, at that. In fact, it's renewing my confidence in the Sheridan brand.UPDATE: I'm going to still keep as 4 stars, for this brand only - but not within the context of all hotels. In other words, it's a 4-star Sheraton, but it's not a 4-star hotel.There are two things that were not ideal:1) Thin walls - While I was lucky in not having as noisy of neighbors as my boss, she mentioned that in two rooms she tried (she switched after it was too loud in one), she heard a person's entire TV show, as well as a father reading a bed-time story to his child (sweet - but she heard it word-for-word) over a phone call. I sent this feedback to the GM, though I'm unsure if it's possible to insulate the walls at this point in time.2) Shower Stall - Uneven / not-level floor, and felt structurally unsound. Creaked a lot, and I was worried I might fall through! Since #1 didn't directly affect me (as a data point), and #2 was a fortunately unrealized fear, I see no reason to adjust my review at this time. Not to mention the fact that - across the board, in nearly all facets of society - building standards are just generally decreasing in terms of quality of craftsmanship, as well as raw materials. Again, if you want better quality, target a different brand within the Starwood family. But this is still a decent Sheraton, when compared to others around the country.* I should also mention that I was only here for one night.Back to the positives - what really sold me was the clean and simple bed covering. Everything looked washable, and as a frequent hotel guest and business traveler, this is super important to me. I don't want to see any kind of decorative elements on the bed that are not washed after each &amp; every guest stay.This hotel is an embarrassment to the Sheraton franchise. To be honest, if it didn't say Sheraton on the building, you could easily think you are at a Super 8.... except that they have a lobby.The AC made noise like an old school window unit and the air in the building was stale. I know Jacksonville isn't a world class city, but honestly, I've stayed in better rooms in the middle of nowhere.  This place desperately needs a renovation!This was an ok hotel. nothing fancy. I would give 3.5 just because it's really not bad. Check in was quick and easy. The room was clean as I was looking for all the issues that other reviewers mentioned. It was ok not horrible but ok if ur just needing a place to stay for a night or two.This hotel is below the standard of other Sheraton hotels I've stayed in. The staff was friendly, but the hotel itself seemed cheap and dated.My biggest complaint was the incredibly thin walls. I could hear conversations my neighbors were having as if they were in my room. The guy next to me wasn't being obnoxious, just chatting on the phone and I could hear it all. I heard my neighbors take a wiz, sneeze, cough up a lung, and just chitchat... I did have to ask him to keep it down around 12:30 and he obliged... my neighbor on the other side of me, however, left his television on all night - sounded like it was right in my room. I wouldn't stay here again for the noise factor.Sheratons are usually known for their comfy beds... not this place. It was one of the worst mattresses I've slept (or attempted to sleep) on. Wirey, squeaky, and cheap sheets... The room itself was clean, but this isn't a comfortable hotel at all and I recommend you find an alternative.While my husband and I are gold for life we have stayed in array of hotels within our travels. From seedy Motel 6's off I-95 to category 7 W's. This hotel was a serious let down. While Westin's Heavenly Beds will always be my favorite Sheraton Sweet Sleepers are a great alternative. I can only speak for my room but I am almost certain that this bed was not a a SSS. Upon laying down the foot of the bed came about 6 inches off the base. It was like sleeping in a hospital bed with our feet raised up. I woke up in the middle of the night to pins and needles in both my feet and legs.  If this mattress is a SSS it should have been retired years ago, it has craters of dead spots where the springs are clearly shot. The creaking bed frame was distracting as well.The chair in my room was not an ergonomic desk chair, it was a retired catering chair from the dining room. The desk also did not have any outlets close enough for my laptop charger so I resorted to working from my creaky uncomfortable bed. Because that was the only place I could plug it in. The wall paper is peeling, there are stains on the carpet and the entire floor had an overal stench of B.O. The stains, and what I assume are bleach marks in an attempt to clean, in the hallway was completely off putting.As much as we like earning our points we will not be staying here during our next trip to Jacksonville.I have been traveling for 30 years and stayed in many Sheraton's. I have never walked out because it was so bad. We checked into a suite. The room looked as if it was something out of a motel 6. Walls dented, carpet stains, furniture was dirty. We called and they moved us to another room. It was exactly the same. I left my details and asked to speak with a manager. Next day nobody called. I called again and left 2 more messages. No call backs. While the outside of the hotel looks inviting... Don't judge a book by a cover. In this case... The inside is dreadful.  And if you are looking for customer service, this is the wrong place. Shame on Sheraton for misleading it's loyal customersAccommodating and good service, the hotel simply needs a major overhaul to their A/C systems... First room was unbearable, loud and noisy unit and seemed to be leaking as the floor was damp and room smelled like mildew. Asked to switch rooms, which they allowed with no problem or questions asked... Next room was a tad better but the carpet was still damp all around, and under, the desk where the AC unit is... Mildew/musty smell were consistent. A serious renovation needed - would not stay here, much better options for comparable rate (or less) in Jax.This was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. Here's why: Upon arrival I find out my room is on the Club Level 6th floor. This includes a private breakfast and complimentary appetizers in the afternoon. The man who serviced the afternoon was wonderful. I get up to my room and discover what appears to be stray fecal matter splattered on our wall next to/behind the toilet. No biggie right? I just won't touch the wall... But what else hasn't been cleaned??? I'm standing in my room and hear a song, plain as day. I check my phone and look at the tv. Nothing. Then I hear someone call Wells Fargo on speakerphone and can hear so clearly through the wall that I know their balance is $1099.64. I pray that they are quiet at night. During the night I find out that they are not and this goes on for two nights- listening to Kayne West and two guys having the time of their lives. Finally we call the front desk. It stops for 5 minutes and picks back up. We also visited the restaurant/bar. At 8pm 3 of us put an order in for salads and there is one other group who we know sitting next to us- no one else to serve. An HOUR LATER I ask the bartender to check on our food. It took 2 hours for us to receive a glass of wine, salad, and dessert. She told me she was busy and didn't offer to take care of anything for us. A transient girl was sitting outside the hotel on her duffle bag asking what city she was in... Clearly on drugs. They let her in the lobby for two hours and eventually she goes up to a room... After she has scared everyone in the hotel off. I was with a group and another room told me that their shower/tub wasn't draining at all. A maintenance man came up to look at it and plunge it. Nothing. So he told them to take the drain stopper out every time by unscrewing it, allowing it to drain, and then replace the stopper. Obviously that's disgusting and wouldn't want to do it at my own house, let alone a public shower.The service has been bad and good. We don't want to move rooms but are praying the people next to us leave. We will be buying earplugs today.This hotel is odd. We visited on business, and after reading the yelp reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. When you first walk into the lobby, it was well appointed and welcoming but as soon as we went to check in, I saw what people were talking about. We were told ""We ain't got your reservation."" It was like textbook exactly how to not treat people checking into your hotel, she was negative, made it seem like we had a problem, then said her shift was over and left, while someone else helped us. The hotel is nicely appointed, but it feels like the employees are all motel 6 level. The corners are dirty, there were used robes on the floor in our closet. Things were broken. The maid entered our room without knocking.I had lunch in the restaurant, and did some work while waiting for my boyfriend to return from his meetings in the afternoon, I spent well over $30 on lunch, but when the evening crew came in after 3, I felt very unwelcome, I felt as if they wanted me to leave. It was very unpleasant, and I would not choose this hotel again.Being a Starwood platinum and having my fair share of stays at a wide range of spg properties all over the country, I say stay away from this one.I get it. Jacksonville does not offer many nice hotel options. Co-workers who stayed at the other chain hotels reported disappointing experiences. I defaulted to this Sheraton based on my trust in the spg brand (and the fact there is no better spg than this one closeby), but this hotel was just nothing but a let down.Overall this is BELOW your average Sheraton.Rooms: so I've stayed in standard room and suite. Both are really worn and need serious renovation. Like the other review pointed out, the hotel has a mix of pet-friendly and pet-free rooms, but BE AWARE - even what they claimed to be pet-free rooms smell like pets. Walls not sound-proof.Service: decent, nothing special. Although it's worth pointing out the 1st time I stayed here, I had to re-book my reservation with my company travel agency ON THE SPOT because this hotel had a system glitch and as a result can't find my reservation. Front desk gentleman claimed it's a spg problem. Hmmm, it's my 1st time over 100+ spg nights. Concierge Lounge: the saddest one out of all that I've seen. No fresh coffee, have tea bags out but no hot water...am I suppose to boil my own water?! Breakfast options very lacking.spg, please renovate this hotel or put a Westin in town. I meant, something needs to be done to save the day, right?I had one of the worst experiences staying here recently!!!!  I booked and went there the room was clean however the ""Air Conditioning"" was not working, I checked in mid afternoon and changed the thermostat to cool the room down, I left and came back hours later to find the room had only gotten hotter now ""about 80 degrees"" I called the front desk to see if they could come fix it, they sent someone up and the guy reset it and said it should work now. I was told to wait a while to make sure.IT DID NOT WORK. now at ""82+ DEGREES"" I called back about 1AM to see if they could move me to a different room, THEY JUST SAID NO!!!! I wasn't being unreasonable just asked!!!  They sent the ""CHIEF ENGINEER"" to come fix it!!!  He said is seemed to have cool air BUT, he said THE FAN WAS NOT BLOWING THE COOL AIR...  I called the front desk and the company I booked through and I was told I CAN LEAVE THE HOTEL IF I WANT TO GET A ""COLDER"" ROOM!!!  HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! ALL the meanwhile it was about ""@) DEGREES COLDER IN THE HALLWAY OUT MY DOOR!!!!!!!""  I WOULD HAVE RATHER SLEPT OUT THERE!!  At this point it is 3:30 AM when the ""Chief Engineer"" left the room and neither me or my wife get hardly any sleep because of this, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY ANNIVERSARY GET AWAY!!! At least my wife said ""Its a night we wont forget, they were very unreasonable.""  I just simple could not believe when the MANAGER stated I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and that THEY WERE NOT GOING TO OFFER ME ANY COMPENSATION!!!!!This hotel is below standard. The room smells the walls are filthy. The desk personal was nice and welcoming but if you are accustom to staying in a place where you can lay back and relax and not see a bunch of unexplainable stains and smells everywhere DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!I would recommend this to others, great hotel overall, but some small problems.Great design, very grand and I would consider it a higher end hotel.  The room is very nice, and I feel like I'm definitely upper class when I'm in the room.  This theme follows throughout the entire hotel.  However, it's just a little more dim than I would like.  The dim look definitely goes with the theme of the hotel, it's just kinda' spooky.Ice machines - there are only ice machines on about 4 of the floors.  I'm on the 3rd floor, so every night I have to go to a different floor for the ice machines.Elevator - you have to use your room key to access the floors, which is a little annoying.  I understand it's for safety though.Service - staff is not bad.  When I checked in I had to wait a little while because there was no one at the front desk.  It was a little odd, because like I said, it was spooky, then there was no one around, and there was no phone/bell to ring.  Fridge - There is none.Microwave - There is none.TV - small, I think it's a 32"".  And it's a little annoying, it's on the hotel's system.  So you can't change the channel to a different input (to connect your own computer/movies).  Also, it changes itself to the hotel channel every 30 min or something.  Weird.Weird sounds - I don't even know what that's about.  There's weird knocking sounds from one of my walls.  Doesn't sound like neighbors.  Creepy.For the price I paid ($54 from Hotline)  I would recommend it.  But I wouldn't pay over $110 a night for it.This is your typical, standard Sheraton. There's free parking, bottled water, and if you're a SPG gold member (or higher), wifi. It should be noted unlike other Sheratons where I have stayed, complimentary club access is not available for gold members. However, when I made the comment, ""Oh, this location is different then,"" the front desk immediately offered free club lounge access without hesitation. I like how you needed to use a key in the elevator (like Marriott hotels) to access the lounge, and as SOON as the elevator doors open, you arrive RIGHT in the lounge. I do dock a star though for not allowing gold members free access in the first place (inconsistent with other locations).Starwood Preferred Guest is probably my second favorite hotel chain after Hilton. You can double dip between your SPG and Delta accounts. It's cheap to book a room with points. If you don't have status, you earn one point for each $1 spent. It takes 2,000 points (to give an example) to book a free room at the Four Points by Sheraton Kansas City airport location. So, you don't need THAT many points in the overall scheme of things compared to Marriott. I also like SPG hotel beds and pillows. They're the most comfortable compared to Hilton and Marriott, in my opinion.This hotel is easy to get to off of the freeway. I should forewarn that if your company requires the last four digits of the credit card number to be on the receipt, double check your receipt. The digits weren't on there, so I had to request another receipt via email from the SPG website. I do recommend staying here though, and I would stay here again!Warning - this is a PET Friendly hotel.In fact, of the 6 floors of the hotel, ONLY FLOOR 3 is a no-pet floor.Unfortunately, it was too late for me as when I checked in, I thought the rooms smelled funny and later identified it as excessive deodorizer spray as this was a room for people with pets. I did not want to know what was on the carpet, but I would imagine that it was well broken in, if you know what I mean.I was able to change rooms the next day and Floor 3 was much better.The restaurant on the first floor is a 3 star and decent, but there are better options a mile or two away.Because I have allergies to some pets, I would not stay here again and wish they were more transparent about notifying their guests that only one floor out of 6 is a no pet zone.I am sure if you take your cute little dog or cat or bird or pig or whatever, you would think this place was a 4 or 5 star, but I do not own a pet and would rather stay at a people friendly hotel.Seriously, I remember the days of requesting a non-smoking room and now I have to worry about getting a non-pet room.I travel often and I go out of my way to stay SPG and I am a Platinum member. I have never done a bad review but my stay yesterday warranted that I do. I arrived later than I had hoped, 9pm, needing to get some work done. The employee at the front desk let me know that the WiFi was out but I could bring my laptop down as it was working in the lobby, which was false. I understand technical difficulties so I just went to sleep. The next morning I needed to iron a shirt and the ironing board had no cover and the iron was leaking. I requested a new one for both and they brought me an ironing board with an old cover on it four times too big and an iron. I plugged up the iron and added water and the iron had rust in the holes and ruined my shirt. The front desk asked if they could bring me another iron... How about another shirt?? They weren't sympathetic in any way. Stay clear if this place!!!!!!!!!!Bedding: modern and comfortableBathroom: updatedWi-Fi: Free &amp; Fast/ReliableParking: Free &amp; AmpleNightstand outlets: NoFridge: YesMicrowave: YesCoffee Bar: YesHotel Bar: YesMake a Green Choice: YesOther Comments: housekeeping is overly loud and annoying during the dayWould Return?: YesRoom: The air conditioning situation was ridiculous - I am super thankful I was not there on a hot Florida day. I'm convinced the thermostat is just for looks. The air unit is an older model that is EXTREMELY loud and didn't really cool the room at all. It was so annoying I unplugged it from the wall which was the only way to turn it off. Everything seemed relatively clean. No refrigerator which was a bummer. Good shower pressure with nice amenities. Location: Not very walkable at all. My first night I grabbed dinner at the closest restaurant which was about .5 miles away on the other side of the freeway. Hotel Shuttle: our morning driver was awesome; our evening drivers were always late and didn't speak at all, not even a ""hello"" - it was odd. Fitness Center: Very small but good equipment. I got in great workouts during my time here but went during off-peak hours to try to have the place to myself. Pool: Is super small and I immediately wrote it off but later found out it is a ""swim-spa"" with adjustable jets so you can swim against a current. Again, small and with that in mind is set up more like a single person pool. Bar/Restaurant: I grabbed a simple breakfast one morning and found my carton of milk to be partially frozen and the coffee to be watery. I'm on a booze break right now and the bartender seemed annoyed by my club soda orders each night but never charged me so I guess that made up for the unfriendly service. Overall not awesome but not horrific either. DFTBA ~ chaseI've been staying at this property every week (Monday - Thursday) for work since April 2013 and my experience with the hotel and staff has been nothing short of excellent. Would recommend for any business traveler! Service: EXCELLENT! The staff at the hotel does an excellent job of making your experience as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. The restaurant staff, front desk staff, maintenance group, cleaning staff, hotel management are FANTASTIC!! The quality of service is the main reason I've chosen this hotel for my trips to Jacksonville. Starwood Points Perks: This hotel participates in the ""Green Choice"" option which gives you 500 points for every night you refuse cleaning services during your stay (not valid on the day you check-out). This is NOT standard at every SPG property. Rooms: Comfortable beds and pillows. I've never had a problem with the cleanliness of my room. Rooms come with the basic standard amenities (coffee maker, bottled water, towels, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, glasses, iron / ironing board etc). Food: There's a decent breakfast buffet in the restaurant  that's about $14 (not 100% sure). There's always oatmeal, grits, bacon, fresh fruit medley, yogurt and boiled eggs included in the buffet. In addition to those items, there's always some variance of a carb (potatoes, french toast, etc. ) and scrambled eggs of some sort. And it's actually pretty good! You also have your selection of coffee, orange juice and cranberry juice. There's also a lunch buffet (which I've only eaten from twice due to my schedule) which was also surprisingly good. From what I remember there were TONS of options for whatever your dietary restrictions may be. There's also the restaurant menu that you can order from which is a pretty standard Sheraton menu. I enjoy the beef kabobs (I order them at least once / week) and the fish tacos. I love that the staff lets me substitute the high carb items for vegetable at no extra charge. Amenities: Dry Cleaning / Laundry Service, Free Parking, Free Wifi, Club Lounge for Platinum guests, Shuttle Service (within a 5 mile radius of the hotel), Gym, Indoor poolOkay, this is has gotten long enough, but LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel!I had a confirmed room but they aparently gave it to someone else.  At 10:30 PM they were calling around to near by hotels to have me stay there.  Unacceptable.","I've never stayed here wrote the wrong review it was meant for the Hampton but can't erase it. Please disregard my rating. I'm sure is good though, cause Sheratons always are.Their site shows to be some grand location, but in fact it's not. The restaurant looks great. ( use to be a Shula's steakhouse) buy the food does not match the decor. They are overpriced many items and the food is nothing special.  Also stay far away from the breakfast. Take the time to find a local breakfast place. The gym is ok. The equipment is limited, but has tv and other features on them. The front desk service great. The room was not. There was a big stain on the carpet, the doorknobs to the bathroom came off easily, and the tub was dirty.  Also the tv was glitchy. I purchased in room premium movie and it kept going in and out throughout. Also the tv is small! The beds were comfy and sheets clean. I would have given them 2 stars but after the breakfast , I just couldn't. It's not worth  $132 a night for sure.Not great. Neither of the beds in my room had fresh linens, there was trash in the can from the previous occupants, and no continental breakfast. The breakfast thing would be fine, except that the breakfast served in the hotel restaurant wasn't of a high elder quality than most and cost $16. Additionally, the service crew didn't think I would like more than one day's supply if sugar for my coffee, since they didn't bother to replace what I used (they left the wrappers from the morning, but did take the time to refill the coffee and cup I used). The walls of the room were dirty with some kind of film. The hotel staff seem more focused on how the lobby of the hotel looks than the rooms apparently, because that was the only impressive part of the stay. This seems to be a backward  view on how to run a hotel, but what do I know. I know this much: I won't be giving any more of my company's money to this hotel.I struggled to make reservations on their website because it kept opening different windows.  I was so lost.  Come to find out, my reservations were wrong.  I needed my stay to be 2 nights not 1 night.  When I checked in, I was told I reserved 1 night and that my second night would be $40 more.   Or I could get back in the internet and add another night via the website.  So that's what I did.  Why are the front desk clerks not allowed to override a price for the convenience of the guests?  Crazy.I stayed at this hotel for a conference two weeks ago and left behind an expensive item. I called the hotel numerous times to have the item mailed to me and the housekeeping service failed to return my call or even acknowledge my concern. Other than this issue, the rooms were comfortable and the stay was enjoyable.SPG Platinum, former Starwood corporate employee. Hotel didn't provide proper Platinum benefits when the hotel was very slow. Breakfast in the club lounge very poorly presented-  15 minutes left in the session with multiple guests present but no attempt to replenish the food.  Attendant was aware of this but either decided (or was instructed) to not replenish. Guest room was acceptable but musty.  Spoke with manager at front desk when checking out and he stated that observed policy of not refreshing the breakfast wasn't proper and offered SPG points as compensation.Checked into my room to find the toilet clogged. It's been 25 minutes now..Upper management at this hotel is great.. Whenever I had a problem they immediately addressed and resolved the issue. This is the primary reason I am giving this four stars instead of three.Most of the front desk staff is great. A few forget to do things but are still fun to talk to and remember your name when you walk in. Carolynn at the front desk is one of my favorite. She really enjoys holding a genuine conversation. If you're into humor, talk to her.The restaurant in the hotel is moderate. Depending on your server and who is working that night, your experience will vary. One night I had exceptional service and great food. The next I had horrible service but still great food.Rooms are a decent size, what you would expect in any standard hotel room. I didn't get a chance to stay in a suite but I heard they are about 1.5 the size of a regular room. The club lounge (for those lucky enough to stay at it) is great. Although they charge for drinks (sad face) the food and breakfast is tasty.Very slow services. Waitresses there are unprofessional.  Three breakfast orders with juice and they couldn't get them all right.  We have to remind them three times to get all our food on the table in an hour.The food is terrible too.  I will go to a starbucks next time.Oh yeah, another first for the pig!This place looks very new. Maybe it's because it was fairly new. The girl at the front desk was very nice. She drove us around for dinner in a mini van, and we brought her nice ice cream for dessert. The restaurant on site serves pretty nice sandwiches as well. I think it was Don Shula's grill. We could always count on the bartender to point us at the right direction for some food and fun after work.The rooms are very nicely set up. The bathroom isn't the greatest, but the bed was awesome. I wish I can take one of those beds home.So this is funny. I didn't complete the review. 2 days later, Matty S beat me to the punch:-D He certainly deserves it. Since he knows the area, you can probably get more information from that review. For me, it's all about the people and the mini van;)A quick update to say that that my second stay was just as wonderful as my first.  I love this property and think it's a great place to stay.  Clean, quiet, comfortable, and not bad rates.A few weeks ago, a stay in the Jacksonville area became necessary, and I decided to try the Sheraton due to it's close proximity to the event I was attending, and I have to say was pretty impressed, and left satisfied. The first thing I noticed was the close proximity to the freeway, it was right off the exit, but not close enough where you could still hear the traffic. It is also about 1/2 mile away from the St. Johns Town Center, so you are very close to lots of shopping and good restaurants.There is TONS of parking available, so you won't have a problem finding a place to get in and out. The lobby was very clean, very modern, and the staff at the front desk was very polite and knowledgeable. I was checked in in under 3 minutes and on my way. The elevator to go up to the rooms can only be activated by room key, so you have a nice security element there. I noticed the entire hotel on the way to the room was very clean, and had a nice, professional look to it. There's even a Shula's steakhouse in the hotel itself, a very nice looking restaurant with a nice bar, although I believe they close at 11.The room itself was everything it should've been. Flat-screen TV on the wall, HUGE desk with comfortable chair, nice table with coffee maker and menus. The bed was huge, incredibly comfortable, and very clean sheets. The bathroom was pretty good sized, but very clean, plenty of room to move about. The only weird thing I noticed was that there was no fan to turn on, so since I like HOT showers, it took a while for the steam to leave the room. Other than that, I had absolutely no complaints.Overall, I had a great stay here. Everything was clean and crisp, service was great, and I like the proximity to not only the Town Center, but there are LOTS of great restaurants and bars in the area on Southside Blvd. The only downside was that the hotel itself is kind of all by itself, the only thing within walking distance was a Shell gas station with a convenience store attached. I left feeling refreshed and relaxed, and if I'm in the area again, I would DEFINITELY stay here.",,,,"['think', 'hotel', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'nice', 'layout', 'good', 'room', 'design',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-jacksonville-orange-park-jacksonville,La Quinta Inn Jacksonville Orange Park,2.5,$$,11,"I have finally found a wonderful hotel for my parents when they come to town to visit that isn't too far from where I live.  I've booked them at a couple of other hotels that really sucked and then I finally found this La Quinta.  They have a chihuahua they always travel with and often it's difficult to find a really good hotel that allows dogs at all.  Most of the really nice hotels in Orange Park do not allow dogs... period.  Trust me, I've called nearly every one of them and asked. Not only does this La Quinta allows dogs, but they don't even charge a deposit for them.  They allow dogs to stay for free.  You just have to sign a form saying that if your dog tears anything up then you are liable for it.  No problem.  Especially considering my mom's chihuahua is a tiny, little 4 pound thing. Check in was a breeze.  The lobby was nice and clean.  The employees were so friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. The room was really nice.  Not only did it look clean, but it smelled clean.  That's always a good thing.  The bathroom was larger than I expected.  Plenty of room for two people to move around in at the same time.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the sheets and pillows had a nice, fresh smell to them.  I stayed with them one the nights they were here and I slept very, very well.  Flatscreens are in the room and they are a nice, decent size with a good picture. There are also small refrigerators and microwaves in all of the rooms.  Free Wifi is included.  I used it with my iPad and it runs at a nice, smooth speed.A continental breakfast is provided at no charge.  They have the usual like fruit, pastries, oatmeal, toast, bagels, various juices, and coffee. The price per night is also very affordable.  They paid around $55 per night.This La Quinta is located just off of 295 at the Orange Park/Blanding exit.  It can be a bit difficult to get to if you aren't familiar with the area, but it is located directly behind the Denny's.  So, just look for Denny's as soon as you get off 295 and you'll find it with no problems. There are plenty of fast food restaurants and chain restaurants like Olive Garden, Longhorn, Carrabbas, etc. in the area.  The Orange Park Mall is also located less than a mile from this hotel.  In the future, when my parents visit, this will definitely be the hotel where I make them reservations.Very depressing. Old un-renovated rooms. TV didn't work properly. Terrible breakfast. At least there was hot water.The room was not cleaned properly. There was an unpleasant smell. The bathroom floor and frig were filthy. I doubt anyone even looked in the frig, because the was a sandwich that someone forgot to take with them. We skipped the free breakfast! On a positive note the AC was cold.We stayed in this La Quinta in January 2015 to attend a funeral. I will never stay there  again. We were locked out. When we got back to our room Sunday at 12:25 am we were locked out in the cold temperatures in 40s and was windy couldn't go inside the lobby still locked out rang the bell to let the clerk what happened she was too busy to come to the door and let us in after 7 minutes she finally did was very rude and unprofessional. The room was supposed to be nonsmoking but we could smell smoke the carpet was filthy and smelled bad. As I said I will not stay there again.Really run down motel. The room was not cleaned when we got in it. There was an empty beer can next to the bed and my daughters bed had a yellow substance smeared down the side of the bed frame and mattress. Disgusting! They were understaffed. All through the night there was noise such as banging and stomping. If I tried to call the front desk it was at no succcess since no one answered. At 2:30am I was not about to walk to the front desk. It was just a really bad experience overall. There are other hotels/motels out there much better for the same price. I would not recommend this one.We have trouble traveling because of our very large dog. This la quinta was nice, clean and our dog had plenty of room to move around. The king size bed was so nice and comfy! The reason why im not giving it 5 stars is the location is tricky! Blanding is a very busy street and the traffic was terrible. Plus the hotel is behind businesses and two other motels so at first we drove past it. Perhaps there should be a sign or something...Usually stay here several nights every year since we get a discount rate for a large group. Always have an okay experience but nothing I would rave about. Rooms don't have fridge, microwave, etc. all of that is located in the front office so you have to go up there if you need it. Stayed next to pool last time and several were out there drinking so I refused to allow my kids to go swimming while there. The room I was in had a spacious bathroom but only two small full size beds.DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY!!!Now that I have gotten your attention let me expand on that. We have traveled all over the East coast and we stay at La Quinta because of their dog friendly hotels, cleanliness, free breakfast, and quality for the price.  We've stayed at over a dozen and this one was by far the worst of them all. The place wasn't in the best of neighborhoods and doors were directly outside with no indoor hallways.  We felt a little unsafe here but we were tired and didn't want to cancel out reservation to find another place last minute. We get in and not only does it reek of smoke, but they didn't give us enough toilet paper. After a long drive I needed to go to the bathroom and headed their first and there was poop on the toilet seat!!!!! Not bowel, but seat. Desperate to use the restroom I cleaned it up and uses antibacterial wipes all over that seat. While in there I noticed some mysterious hot pink stain on the towels. It could have been lipstick or gloss but what it was was evidence that the cleaning lady did not do her job well! Went to front desk to ask for clean towels and the poor night guy apologizes profusely as of this happens a lot. We settled in to find a mysterious brown spot/stain on the duvet! I have no idea if it was a bodily fluid or chocolate or some other brown fluid but again aren't these supposed to be hanged between guests along with towels?!!! Not happy about this at all. At about 3am to 4am the trash dump truck scared the living daylight a out of us by dropping the dumpster loudly on the ground. In a shady neighborhood this was quite terrifying. Can't comment much on the food quality as we skipped it. Didn't trust how well prepared and up to health code it would be with all the ""cleanliness"" of the hotel room. Didn't want to risk it. After this stay we got an email from la Quinta asking us to rate our stay and give feedback about it. We found this a little odd as we have never received this email from any of the other 12 or so that we have stayed at. We're guessing that corporate has gotten some complaints lately and/or is evaluating that place for a reason. All in all, avoid this location at all costs.The signs to find this place did suck as the other reviewer mentioned. The room is clean though with new carpet because it smells newly refurbished.  Room is close to the city being only 10 miles out and room is also close to several places to eat right around it. It is kind of silly how they put a Laquinta, Super 8 and Country Inn and Suites in the same parking lot though.Still a decent hotel. They get an extra star because they actually acknowledged my LQ ""Elite"" status. Manager kind of made a deal about it when I checked in, but in retrospect, I do appreciate it because I stay in a ton of LQ inns, many cost a lot more, and rarely do they thank me for my repeated patronage. So extra gold star for you for making me feel just a little special!Dirty. We checked in and there were pubic hairs in the bath tub and on the floor. The top bed spread sheet had some crusty brown stuff on it. We decided to just take it off. We put it with our dirty towels to be collected but the maid just put it back on the bed! So we called the front for a new one, it took them 2 hours to bring another one that had a bunch of little black hairs all over it. Our third day they just didn't come clean our room. Called the front and they said they had no idea why they didn't come. Didn't offer to send anyone just told us we could come get new towels. I just felt so dirty staying in this place. The front desk guy that helped us was apologetic and tried to be helpful but I highly recommend anywhere else.",,,,,"['finally', 'found', 'wonderful', 'hotel', 'parents', 'come', 'town', 'visit',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inns-jacksonville-3,Red Roof Inns,2.5,$,11,"Room was clean. Bed was good. No bugs in sight. Got what I payed for. Reasonably priced.Tried checking into our preferred La Quintas, but they were booked and after 12 hours on the road we just went across the parking lot to Red Roof Inn. I checked the reviews AFTER we were checked in and in our room, and was a bit alarmed, but we had a fine night. Room was clean, comfortable. Smelled a little musty when we first entered but we flipped on the air and it was soon fine. Quiet, comfortable place to spend a night on the road. Deducted a star because no breakfast and wifi was terrible. These are two things I expect at a place like this, even if a seldom partake of the breakfast. We saw NO sign of bugs whatsoever.-stars!  We travel ALOT with our dogs and have stayed at many Red Roofs but this one told us we could only have one of our two dogs with us.   So we cancelled that shit and went to La Quinta.  Very sad Jacksonville Red Roof, that you have different rules than all the others.It's a good bang for the buck.  The bed was comfortable and the shower had great water pressure.  Only had two issues, one the vinyl flooring didn't look clean enough where I felt comfortable enough walking around w/o my shoes on and the other is I saw a roach in the bathroom w/ me.  I was on the toilet when I noticed a roach crawling on the wall next to me.  I attempted to kill it, but it got away and crawled under the base of the wall.  The roach issue makes me wonder whether I would stay here again.  If they fumigated and got rid of those guys, I would definitely stay here again.I'm very disappointed in this stay, due to the fact, I'm writing this review at 1:15am, because we had to switch rooms, where a bug was crawling on me while I was trying to sleep. I turned the light on and there it was in bed with me. I tried to kill it but no success, I started looking for it and more, but to my surprise I find mold growing on the bedspread!!!I hit the roof, now I'm sleeping and breathing in mold by my face, WTH!!! Not cool at all.  I called the front desk and told the lady named Kelly and she switched our room immediately and even assisted us with our luggage, which was nice.  Overall I thought this hotel was up on its game since it's lodged between three top chain hotels but I guess they still have some work to do.  But to be honest, before the incident, I had reservations about staying here and had a second thought, to give this place a chance.Well, to be fair I will think more about staying here again after I calm down and get some sleep, but I don't know.Looks like it's been recently renovated. Great budget option for single night stays. Vinyl plank flooring in the rooms is ingenious for this place as it accepts pets - much easier to keep rooms looking and smelling clean and sanitary.  Superior King room was spacious and clean, fridge, micro, and coffeemaker all worked fine. Nice new Panasonic Flat Panel TVs with HD cable (incl HBO). Would definitely stay here again. No frills, but clean, quiet, safe, and inexpensive!  I paid $57 for a night.I've stayed at this Red Roof Inn several times.  I take my dog, Molly, with me when I travel. It's nice to stay at a place that doesn't charge extra for pets.  (I'm not sure if they charge extra if you have more than one pet.)  It is located close to I 95.  The room was nice.  Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable.  They have free parking and a pool.  Most of the Red Roof Inns I've stayed at have a continental breakfast.  Even though it's not a lot of food, I enjoy it.  This one has coffee in the lobby, but no breakfast.  There are several fast food type restaurants a short drive away.  Every time I stay, they put a charge on my bill for the room safe, which I don't use.  I have to ask them to take the charge off, which they do.  I think they should ask you if you used the safe before charging.  If I didn't check my bill, I would have been paying extra for something I didn't use.  The first time I stayed there I didn't notice the safe charge until I was back on the road.  I had to call the hotel to have the charge  removed from my credit card.  They were nice enough to email me a new receipt.The price is very reasonable, especially if you book through their web site.  They give a senior discount.Terrible place, drug transactions and panhandling while we were at the pool. The doors were left propped open all night so anyone could come and go as they please, and they did all night. Another guest was complaining at the front desk that she was robbed during her stay. Dim lit parking lot that doesn't feel safe after dark. All in all a very bad choice.It was horrible. No fridge, no microwave, and no good channel on cable TV. I was pissedCannot beat this price for nice hotel room with the minimum.It doesn't get any better than than this for $58 (price includes taxes.)

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-jacksonville-east-regency-square-jacksonville,Hampton Inn Jacksonville East Regency Square,2.5,$$,11,"Not the newest or cleanest Hampton Inn, but meets my expectation for this chain. Some Hampton properties are newer and better than others. Some are older and worse. This was right in the middle for me, for a one night stay for less than 12 hours. Solo front desk staff person could have been friendlier at check in by putting his cell phone down, but overall experience served my purpose. Nice location off 295 near mall, movie theater, and nice chain restaurants.I stayed at this hotel while traveling on business because it was close to my meeting location and Orbitz for Business (my company's travel service) recommended it. Staying there was a mistake. This place is a dive. My room on the 4th floor smelled musty. The carpet and furniture were damp. The room smelled so bad that it was difficult to tolerate.  The furniture was beat up.  The iron had white flaky debris that soiled my shirt. No moldings around walls. Just a gross place.My colleague complained of the same issues on the 2nd floor.I called the front desk to inquire about a fan or some other solution to the stink. They had nothing to offer. Service did not meet expectations.2 stars because the gentleman that checked me in was very friendly and polite. I would avoid this hotel.A fine business hotel.  There is not much here, and it is not a place I would bring my family--but great for work if you need to be in JAX.Note, there is a well-stocked gas station in easy walking distance, as well as a few close restaurants.The staff are very friendly, and the rooms were clean.  Some of the furniture was a bit banged up and showing its age.  A cosmetic refresh on this hotel is probably due, but wouldn't stop me from coming back.I was worried when I read the reviews. Really worried. This place was great. Always fresh fruit flavored water and cookies Great breakfast. Clean rooms and really fast service! I was impressed.This may be the worst Hampton Inn they have, I hope the rest are better.  It is not so new, not so nice, and not so clean.  They have no problem charging too much for it though.  Here is what my room was like:  Plaster-cracked walls with amateurish repairs and too many coats of paint, that funny smell...like a basement, and a bathroom that looks like something from 1960.  Forget about this one, it is a loser all around.My 1-star rating is based on the room we just left, after 1 night of a planned 6-night stay.  This hotel has some kind of WATER PROBLEM - at least in our section of it (on the 5th floor).  It was very, very damp - including the carpet - enough to require drying out all our clothes after we moved to another hotel.  When I explained why we were leaving early, no acknowledgement of a problem from the front desk.On the plus side, guest service at the hotel exceeds the service I typically get from Hilton Honors reps when I call.  In this case, no comps, no incentives to move to another local Hilton property, no ""sorry for the inconvenience"" - just the impression that it's only about having me spend more money.  (Side note: don't even think about joining Hilton Grand Vacations club!)If not for the water problem, I'd have probably given this Hampton 3 stars - at first glance it seems OK.  Not a great location, no good restaurants nearby - it's best attribute for me was the very nice woman who was doing the breakfast buffet.AVOID THIS HOTEL!  The dressers smell!  Discovered that they are wiped down with a dirty moldy towel.  The carpet was also extremely filthy in my room.  Before I discovered how dirty the carpet was I ended up destroying a pair of socks.  The floors were sooooo dirty, I had to wash my feet before I went to sleep otherwise I would track debris and dirt into bird.  Also, hot water was non existent in the morning.Even with a Diamond status, I was not able to secure a room with either a mini fridge or microwave.Man, I hate giving bad reviews without really giving it a chance. But, I'll tell everyone this. This place smells so bad omg! Like old undried laundry. It's pretty affordable considering how close we were to Bestbet. For us DG's it's 5star I guess. Pump that ac low and get your nose ready to adjust to the smell. After a while it be awesome. Just to catch some zzzzzz at least. Better then my fourth of July trip here. Slept in the mofo car for 3hrs. Woke up in that heat. No effn Hotel at all. Check at least 30 hotels. FmlAlthough this Hampton Inn is located on Hospitality Lane, do not be fooled. They are NOT hospitable. The staff was rude and it just didn't seem like they had control of the place. The water in Jacksonville is horrible so after the vending machine ate my dollar they gave me what they said was a ""complimentary water"" at the front desk. When I asked for another one the next morning, still not being refunded my money, I was rudely answered with ""What is your name?"" ""Oh.. those are only for our Gold and Platinum members.""Their breakfast was also really poorly maintained and kept running out of juice, there was no ice for the yogurt, AND even their juice tasted like the nasty J-ville water. Sorry, Hampton. You suck.Nice, new clean. Walmart Supercenter and a mall nearby.  Ruby Tuesdays next door. Great place to be for a few days of work.Perfectly ok. Very friendly staff. Near mayport but think I will stay a few miles south next to the st johns town center next trip. Have stayed at well over 50 Hamptons and nothing bad to say about this one.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-jacksonville-south-bartram-park-jacksonville,Hampton Inn & Suites Jacksonville South - Bartram Park,4.0,$$,10,"What a great place to rest your traveling head and recharge your batteries. It was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on while traveling. The breakfast was free and offered fresh made hot waffles, bacon and eggs. This will become my new Jax home while traveling to the area.We are diamond members and have stayed here and at many Hampton inns all over the country. The room was very nice and the maid service excellent. Clean and quiet with many places to shop and eat nearby. However I must rate the breakfast a 1 star.  Totally unsatisfactory.  The food was awful and the selection terrible for diabetics gluten issues and lactose issues.  When my 34 year old daughter asked if she could get a plain omelet because of her lactose issues she was told to scrape off the cheese from the omelette! Seriously the lack of consideration was appalling and the management did nothing so we ate breakfast out at a delicious Panera each morning!  There were no hard boiled eggs and by 8:30 they ran out of fresh fruit refusing to cut up more. I know this was not billed as a full restaurant menu but NO other Hampton suites have this issue.  Sorry to say we will not be back on our next trip to Jacksonville Florida.  You've lost us!This is the first time we stayed at a Hamption inn. The room was clean only found 2 mold spots that were the size of a small dot ( pencil point ) . The breakfast was good for free. The bed was  really comfortable. The staff at the front desk and the ladies that were managing  the breakfast were always friendly. The location was great only a short car ride to St. Augustine.  We will be back and I would recommend this place to anyone who is  looking for a clean place to stay  and Close to St.Augustine .I stayed here with some friends while in Jacksonville last month, and our stay was decent. This Hampton Inn is pretty typical with their freshly laundered sheets, free wi-fi and complimentary hot breakfast. The decor was updated and modern and definitely offers a comfortable stay. My only complaint was the woman who worked the breakfast in the morning was very rude and off-putting. The morning after our first night's stay, my two girlfriends and I walked down to the breakfast, and after uncomfortably staring at us for a minute or two, the woman came over and asked if we were guests at the hotel. Really? I have stayed at dozens of hotels and never had someone come up to me at breakfast and question if I was even a guest. And it doesn't seem as if this hotel is in a location that attracts homeless people wandering in for a free meal. From what I noticed, we were the only ones she did that to....odd. We also overheard her make a snide comment to a child at the waffle maker. So yeah...we jokingly named her Elmira (or maybe that is her name, I don't remember) so beware of her wrath!Overall, decent hotel if you're staying in the Jax area.Stayed here on a recent trip as I was passing through town.  Conveniently located right off I-95 and seems to be very new.  The lobby are was very nice with a TV mounted behind a running wall of water.  I was pleasantly surprised as was not expecting this at a Hampton Inn.  The room was run of the mill with two double beds and the typical bathroom.  The bathroom was quite spacious for a hotel room.  There is a continental breakfast provided every morning, but the offerings can vary from day to day.Very clean and in a business park.  Friendly staff with free breakfast in the morning.  Not too many hot things and I've seen other Hampton's do it better but still nice.  Clean room with plenty of towels etc.  Quiet.  Would stay again.What a terrific hotel!  The price was more than fair, given our AARP discount and included free WiFi.  The entire facility was exceptionally clean, including the pool.  The staff was friendly and effective, especially Jesse, at the front desk.  The bedding was comfortable and the room was spacious.  The complementary breakfast was lovely.This Hampton Inn is conveniently located and, despite its proximity to Interstate 95 and a busy 4-land street, we noticed no road noise whatsoever.I'd left my iPad behind, and with one quick phone call, Jesse arranged to send it to me.  It arrived today.  Thank you, Jesse, and thank you, Hampton Inn.We will definitely return.Hampton Inn, Bartram ParkConveniently located right off 95 and about 20 minute south of the city. The hotel is less than two years old and immaculate.

My only complaint was the air conditioner was very noisy. The A/C unit was so lould it would wake me up in the middle of the night. Saff were nice and exceptionally friendly. When I presented my complaint  to the front desk they stated you have a 50% chance of getting a lould A/C. They are going to be replacing the units soon I was told.We stayed here as a stop over half way home from Miami to SC.  We stopped in Jacksonville to sleep.  We arrived there around midnight.  I had used yelp to find this location and call ahead to reserve a room.  They said they had plenty of rooms, and we didn't need a reservation.  They quoted us a price of $125 for a double queen room.When we arrived about 10 minutes later, there had been a shift change.  The new manager, Steve, was great.  He was friendly, and offered to upgrade the room for the same price.  He put us in a queen suite, which had two queen beds and pull out sofa, so my son wouldn't have to sleep on the floor again.  That was a welcome upgrade!!The room was huge!  Free internet for which they provided the password without having to ask.  We were told there was a free breakfast in the morning.  Beds were comfortable, room clean, and an excellent experience.The Belgian waffles the next morning were a big hit with the teenagers.  The buffet was all you care to eat, and it was nicely stocked.  Staff was keeping the  area clean while were there and restocking as items were depleted.Great experience.  I am keeping the information and will stay at this hotel again when in the area.",,,,,"['great', 'place', 'rest', 'traveling', 'head', 'recharge', 'batteries', 'comfortable', 'beds', 'ever', 'slept',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-jacksonville-downtown-southbank-jacksonville,Homewood Suites by Hilton Jacksonville Downtown-Southbank,4.0,$$,11,"What a change from one night to the next!!!!  After the horrible service last night I told Mercida, the front desk person today, about what we had endured.  She couldn't have been more friendly and said let me see what I can do.  Right before she sent us up to our room with our key she said, ""sorry for the low floor, but this is the best I can do!""When we arrived in our room we were astounded!  She had given us the corner two bedroom suite.  This room is easily 1500 square feet with three tv's, two bathrooms and a fantastic view of the street.Again, with any large hotel chain, some experiences are good and some bad.  As long as the good outweigh the bad we're in good shape.Thanks again, Mercida for the incredible customer service!!!I had to come here for business, so I decided to bring the kids along for small vacation. We stayed here a week and then went to Orlando and then came back here for a week.  The staff was friendly and great to deal with.  They accommodated me with a double queen suite and when I returned I got a double queen with the separate suite for the same price.  Some of the Jacksonville Jaguars were staying here for practice so we even ran into players. The breakfast was great, but the second week I really missed the waffle maker (one of my perks for this place). They are only 30 minutes away from several beaches and at Mickler Brach you can find great sea shells and shark teeth (if you search real hard). They are really close to the free train that takes you further downtown, loved everything about our stay.After staying in a Homewood Suites in Atlanta, when my amazing sister in law told us she was coming down to Jax with the kiddos, I suggested this place to her. I knew it was a fairly new building and had a few former bosses stay at the Hilton next door. Which, with that said, they are right together, just make sure you go in the correct door. :) Full disclaimer, I did not stay here, but we did hang out quite a bit in the room and dining area. Tip: If you are visiting guests, drive on around to the left of the parking garage to the back of the hotel. There aren't a ton of parking spots, but they are free. The room was nice and cozy. I like rooms with the suite set-up, especially if you have been on a long road trip and like to bring your own snacks. The kids loved the pool too.The buffet breakfast was of your average buffet variety, nothing fancy but not bad. And one last tip.... beer drinkers! If you are traveling into Jax, Aaradwolf brewery is within walking distance.If you really enjoy hearing a screaming loud train whistle/horn blow at midnight, 2 am, 4 am, 6 am, etc....then this is the perfect hotel for you!Well it's got pros &amp; cons. Here goes:Cons: TRAINS! Holy crap they are loud and they blow by all day and all night. I live downtown back home, so I'm used to sirens and train whistles, but this is a little different because the train tracks are two blocks away. You cannot avoid them. They are loud as hell. My advice is get some wine.Rude front desk. Check in was awful. I'm a HH Diamond member. I don't expect to be treated any differently than anyone else, but damn. They acted like I was a pain in their ass just for being there.No Lodgenet (pay per view movies and games).The bar closes really early (10:00p).PROS:Great view of downtown Jacksonville, especially from the eighth floor balcony.Comfy clean, new rooms with lots of space.Very friendly bell staff.More than one premium channel (HBO, HBO2, HBO Signature, etc.)It's close to several nice restaurants like BB's.It's 5 minutes to downtown Jacksonville (proper). Straight shot over I-95 North.They have a pool table in the breakfast area.Free beer and appetizers Monday - Thursday 5:30 - 7:30p.There is a local dive bar directly across the street that's open until 2:00a. When the hotel bar closes at 10:00, everyone just walks over there and continues the night.Great stay! They even upgraded our room at no cost. Breakfast and atmosphere were incredible. Very warm staff!Of the Homewood Suites I've stayed in, the rooms here seem to be the smallest. Instead of having a door to separate the bedroom, the bed is in another portion of the room. Furniture seems slightly crowded, as the kitchenette table is RIGHT next to the kitchen. There is still a couch and desk, but it just seems a bit crowded when you first walk into the room.Nonetheless, the bed is comfortable, and the room is clean. There is a shower stall as opposed to a bathtub. Like other Homewood Suites, you have a kitchenette (stocked with cooking utensils, dishes, etc.), including a couple of electric coils for cooking.The free food is pretty decent. In the evening, I had a deli sandwich (choices of various meats, cheeses, and breads), chips (several Mrs Vickie's brand chip bags to choose from), and condiments (including pickles). There was also a salad bar and wine set in ice buckets for self-pouring. I would definitely stay here again!This looks to be a new Homewood Suites built adjacent to a Hilton Garden Inn.  I love this setup because you have the option of staying in the homey feel and large rooms associated with the Suites, as well as the free dinner (and I understand beer as well) and breakfast, while maintaining the option of going to the Garden Inn section for their bar/restaurant. The rooms are modern, large and well appointed complete with a 42"" flat screen LCD TV with HD resolution.  The beds are very comfy with tons of pillows.  The room came with a kitchen, so you have the option of making your own food as well.  The room was spotless.   If you don't want to be stuck in the room, they have a nice gym, pool as well as a pool table.  Pretty cool. Also a large 55"" HDTV is in the main room, where they serve dinner and breakfast and is perfect to watch a NFL game or what have you. Service here is very responsive and polite. The only drawback is the parking fee of $9.  However, at least your car is in a gated garage that is only accessible to hotel guests.  Would definitely stay here again!3/4/13.  Trains Trains and more trains!! It is 12:07am on Mon night and hopefully this is the LAST train for the night!!! The train noise / whistle is loud and you WILL notice it, especially if you are a light sleeper.  The hotel itself is nice, big and comfortable clean room and gets 4 stars. 1 star for the train noise at midnight!!I love Homewood Suites.  When you have a party of more than four, you need the extra space and amenities; Homewood delivers on all fronts!  Not only are there sufficient space, but having breakfast included in the mornings makes this place of great value.  You don't go here for luxury, that's what the standard Hiltons are for; rather, you come here for comfort, convenience, and value!  This particular hotel was clean and very reasonable.  There are numerous special that run, but you have to go to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHilton.com&amp;s=ff48cb5a63451e585a11517cca71d84dbab39510ebce9045d1fc78d465f219b2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hilton.com</a> in order to get them.  Don't rely on what is published on Orbitz or the like.  This hotel also has a nice lounge complete with a pool table and fire place (when it's colder).  Unlike most Homewoods, you have to pay for parking here, but not a deal breaker.  Will stay here again when in Jacksonville!Weird....Homewood Suites by Hilton Jacksonville?  It's called the Hilton Garden Inn I thought???  Anyway it's average to me.  Location is good for walking to the river.  Look out for the bar across the street ""Endo Exo""!!!!   It's swingers night on Saturday. Real shady stuff.  The reel deal.  The place is real Loud so if you have a room facing the bar across the street....sorry for you.  Also there are a lot of swingers staying at the hotel that night so expect a lot of banging on the walls if ya know what i mean.",,,,,"['change', 'night', 'next', 'horrible', 'service', 'last',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-jacksonville-butler-boulevard-jacksonville-3,Residence Inn Jacksonville Butler Boulevard,3.0,$$,16,"I stayed for one night. I do love Residence Inns as a matter of course. This was fine. Not the best. But good. The room was large. The rub was nice but had a small rusty spot and there was a hair in the sink. The rest of the room was clean and perfect. I walked in to find a card and a snack. The card said I was the ""Guest of the Day"" which made my long day better and made me feel so special. I didn't know they did that but it was a really nice touch. The property is nice. Great location. Kind staff. I opted for a Marriott deal and snagged a $25 gas gift card to Daily's, one of the greatest gas station chains and a Jax locals' favorite, which was great. The hotel is pet friendly which I loved. I didn't bring my dog but next time I will. Breakfast was yummy. A waffle maker, eggs, Danish, yogurt, French toast, cereals, coffee, flavored creamer, juice, bagels, muffins, etc. They added a nice touch by adding things to add to your waffle (ex: walnuts, chocolate chips, strawberries, etc). My room was near the back stairs so it was a short walk across the courtyard to get food and then I ate in my room. The main lobby had a fire going, which was beautiful and perfect considering it was in the 50's. My room was good. Quiet location. But the bed was hard! Like a little softer than the floor, but not substantial. I couldn't sleep! The pillows were super lumpy. The bed was right under the AC vent so when the heat was on I felt like it was a little annoying to breathe the hot air and when the AC was on I was freezing. Normally Marriott beds are amazing. I have stayed at many Marriotts, from the Residence to the Curio Collections. The bed is like a part of their signature. This bed was pretty awful. By any hotel standards.  Which was the only real disappointing part of my stay. I would have given 4-5 stars if not for the bed.Dec 2-3 2015 Stay: Brandon the office manager planned a renovation to re-enamel the bath tubs on all floors. Needless to say HE did not display the renovation work on the Marriott website or on the front desk... like all other Marriott hotels are required to do. Keep in mind I  am a Platinum Marriott member so I spend alot of times in Marriott hotels. They are supposed to notify patrons on renovations. Brandon told me point blank, it was he who set up the renovation and planned it. So he chose to let the vendors open the doors to the rooms getting renovated and vent them into the hall. Keep in mind the vendor who applied the enamel BY LAW was required to put a sticker on the door warning people to NOT ENTER. This should tell you that this stuff is harmful if inhaled. It is in fact a carcinogen. (See label Vendor left on each door in the photos section) Why Brandon would choose to do the entire hotel, rather than sectioning off a floor is beyond me. I guess he was trying to save $$$$$ at your and my health's expense.I met another patron in the parking lot and they told me they were having respiratory issues. The Brandon option was they can leave or move to another floor with ""less"" work being done.It is clear that Brandon the office manager has no issue whatsoever putting patrons in harms way to save him money.Okay, let me start by saying, we stayed here for free, for one night, using our Marriott rewards points, so it's safe to say, we've stayed in a few of their properties.Secondly, it was close to the Thanksgiving day events going on at the nearby shopping center.The good..... This property looks great on the outside. The center courtyard has a pool, a grilling area and a court area than can be used for basketball, volleyball or maybe tennis. It really ""feels"" more like an apartment complex. The staff that we had interactions with were very friendly.Our suite was pretty clean, didn't smell. The kitchenette is nice to have.The bad..... We went through 5 room keys before we got one that would let us in to the suite on a consistent basis.There was a spot on the sidewalk that was uneven by almost 2 inches...a real trip hazard.The carpet in the suite, hallway and stairs have stains. Really needs to be cleaned.The ugly.... The bathroom is too dark. The shower curtain rod was about to fall down. The shower fixtures are loose in the wall and worst of all, the side panel is bowed out from the wall (see pic). It really looked like some ""weekend warrior"" installed it.This property started out looking like a 4 or 5 star, but the negatives really brought it down for us and we're glad we stayed for free.Nice hotel in a good area. Felt safe. Friendly front desk - Paige. Only complaint: the tub collected water in the shower because the drain did not clear quick enough. They need to buy some draino.I visited the Residence Inn in Jacksonville, Florida on last night October 23, 2015.Unfortunately, it is one of the worst Marriott properties I have ever visited.I don't know where to start,We were in room 317 and from the time we stepped foot on the elevator, we knew this was going to be a long night.The hall, elevator and room was terrible.They all had a stench that you couldn't get past. It smelt as if something was molding or just unclean. When we entered the room, there were dirty foot prints in the carpet.Okay at this point let's just try to make the night. Next issue the bathrooms were not fresh along with the bed coverings having an odor.We made the night, but I,  really couldn't sleep.After taking a shower my wife and both daughters said that they really didn't feel clean due to the place being so bad.Two other issues:Water noise at the air conditioner all night and the shower curtain falling down.I wanted to ensure that Marriott knew how terrible this place is due to it being the right place for a family to stay but not if it's this nasty!!!!This place is a little outdated, but other than that great AC, great shower, comfy bed, microwave, full size fridge, dishwasher pretty sweet set up. Breakfast is amazing at this place. Nice towels which is a plus! Little workout room? Has 3 treadmills, a bike and elliptical, a few Dumbbells, also a nice big pool with hot tub.My husband and two children stayed here in a suite for three days in mid July/2015.  The kids had so much fun having their own room and bathroom while my husband and I had our own room, bathroom, and desk.  There were three TV's in the suite, a full kitchen, pool, hot tub, and complimentary breakfast plus a gym on premises.  There are also themed evening activities to hang out with other guests.  There is also room service.  Especially with a huge mall nearby, you won't want to leave.  The price is also extremely reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this place.  The only negative is the construction and traffic, but that is not the fault of the hotel.  I do recommend getting an early start.  Another plus is the hotel will give you two hours extra without charge when asked in advance.I definitely think this hotel is worth the price and around the corner from a lot of shopping you can't go wrong.  I had a studio which was a nice size room.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathtub had a little rust on the bottom of it but that didn't stop me from becoming clean. The pool was a nice size along with a hot tub. The free breakfast was a plus!  The room is clean and nice, I would go back.Great stay. Comfy beds. Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Great free food &amp; free drinks 3 days a week! Dog friendly!Room was yucky and in dire need of new carpet and other fixtures. Stains and burn marks in carpet. I should have asked for a different room.  Missing cabinets. So unlike the other Residence Inns I've stayed at. Beds were clean tho!Don't stay here. Horrible management, bugs in room definitely not Marriott standard. So many other better hotel options in the area.I thought this place was closer to the Town Center than it was.  All in all it was an ok hotel.  The rooms were not bad and fairly clean.  The second day I was there I guess they just decided not to clean the room?  Not sure why, it wasn't the end of the world though.  I would stay here again if I was in the area.Stayed here during Easter break on a last minute getaway with a very limited budget. So I wanted a place that served breakfast, could give a room that would accommodate 2 adults and 2 kids using my Marriott Rewards member points. Most locations by the beach were in such high demand that I couldn't use points or rooms were too small so I opted for this location. We checked in late at night and the check in process was so so. I was expecting the worst so was pleasantly surprised rooms were decent. I asked for a roll away bed and it was delivered while we were out to dinner. On Tuesday house keeping came only made the bed and didn't make the roll away bed. On Wednesday house keeping came but did nothing except leave towels and throw a dish and a glass in the dishwasher. On Thursday again only the bed was made no clean towels were left and bathroom was not cleaned so whatever sand the kids brought in from the beach was there when we came back from dinner I was do pissed because I had tipped the cleaning lady knowing the state of the room. On Friday I had enough I complained to the manager who promptly had someone go in clean our room, drop off fresh towels and vacuum all the sand. When I ran into the housekeeping lady she was apologizing profusely in Spanish and from what I could understand basically said she was rushed by management to quickly clean the rooms and didn't have enough time to clean all the rooms. So because of my housekeeping experience this place gets 2 stars but overall it was ok and most of the staff was super friendly so I gave it a 3 star. There's a few guests that are long term guests and they were also very friendly. The property only has two grills and one grill was down so had to share the grill with the regulars. I would suggest they make a schedule for cleaning the gym because as much as our room was barely cleaned the cleaning guy came into the gym  at least 3 times within my hour work out. Its a small room so it was kinda creepy and awkward having him in there while myself and another lady were working out.Good price, nothing to really set it apart from other suite hotels. Friendly maid. No room service other than an expensive 3rd party catering service with limited hours.Not nearly as nice as the sheraton next door. Frankly, it's more expensive most of the time as well.They do provide decent snacks, for free, like all other residence inns.However, the rooms are not nearly as big or clean. I found all kinds of hair on the bed when I first arrived. It's down right disgusting!'nuff saidBe aware that public areas and guest rooms on the first floor are under renovation.  You have to walk through construction areas to get to the dining room and to the parking lot.  It smells like paint and adhesive.  We had problems with plumbing and fireplace not working in the room (333).",,,,,"['night', 'love', 'residence', 'inns', 'matter', 'course', 'fine', 'best', 'good', 'room', 'large', 'rub', 'nice',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/towneplace-suites-jacksonville-butler-boulevard-jacksonville,TownePlace Suites Jacksonville Butler Boulevard,3.5,$$,11,"Excellent hotel. This was the first time I ever stayed at a Townplace Suites but if they are all like this one then I may have found a new home away from home The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable,  and professional. My room very comfortable, clean and a pleasure to be in. From check in to check out this was one of the best stays I have had anywhere. If I need to come back to Jacksonville you can be sure I will stay here!I usually stay across the street at the H......on Inn but their prices were off the charts so TownPlace it was.Since my stay was several days I decided to hit the grocery store and cook dinner each night in my room, it was a perfect plan. The staff was friendly, the fitness center was very nice and the rooms were perfect. The only drawback was that besides waffles there wasn't much in the way of breakfast besides bread and cereal.Hotel was under remodeling. Started pounding on the ceiling of my room very early on a holiday. Management was terrifically rude and LIED about there being no work being done on my side of the hotel. Told me a story about the work on my end of the hotel being complete. Walked up the stairs and the entire hallway was filled with the kitchen units waiting to be put back in. Total joke. Made the dripping shower seem less irritating at least. Even make you pay for the washing machines. TV was a cheap piece of junk that took 30 seconds every time you changed the channel. Mediocre ""high-speed"" internet. Worthless for Netflix.Absolutely the most perfect hotel I have ever visited. I stayed there one night. I left, drove 21 hours to turn around and come back again to spend two nights in paradise. This property takes care of you like family. once you come here you won't stay any place else without comparing it to staying here trust me. I have never visited a hotel where I honestly met so many people on the staff that I like because they were so genuinely friendly. I think this is the perfect hotel for anyone looking to relax and unwind after a stressful incident. I came here after a death in my family and found solace. The housekeeping mgr cindy is absolutely one of the nicest ladies I have ever met. Bella and Regina are both so sweet that when you leave it's almost as though you feel like you need to rush back because you want to see them they are so warm and genuine. The management of this property takes a lot of care of the housekeeping and service aspects for the guests. They always allow enough time for you to pack and then they will help you put your luggage in your vehicle when you are checking out. As a Buddhist I crave peace and solace in accommodations, and room 414 will give you just that. Trust me,  this hotel is like coming home. You are always welcomed here.I came across Towneplace suites while looking for a hotel room for my dad and I. Specifically, I wanted separate sleeping quarters. TownePlace offered a cozy and super clean 2-bedroom apartment (complete with kitchen and living area) for what other hotel chains charged for a standard double room. One bedroom had a king bed and the other a queen -- both super comfortable. The living area offered a sleeper sofa and the fully equipped kitchen featured a stove, microwave, dishwasher, and refrigerator. Inside the cabinets were plates, saucers, mugs, glasses, and silverware -- all the comforts of home. There were even a flat screen TV in every room.From the moment I called the staff was friendly and courteous. They reservations agent even offered a medical discount because I was bringing my dad to visit his sister who is in a rehab facility. On arrival, our paperwork was already processed and keys were waiting. It literally took less than 2 minutes to check in. The continental breakfast had all of the fixings to start the day off right and the check out process was seamless.Can't remember the gentleman's name that checked us in, but Bella (who made our reservation) and Lee (the front office manager) were both very kind. Lee made sure to invite us back again soon.Their apartment-like setting was an AMAZING alternative to the traditional hotel room. I was so impressed that I joined YELP just to write this review -- seriously! LOLIs it possible to ensure these people are recognized and Hotel facility is outstanding and great.Person who checked me in -Maurice or not sure if i mispronounce please forgive me i did not get his name fully -he is awesome               here are detailshe wanted to ask me if he can come and drop the luggage- very nice of him -he offeredhe offered to ensure if i like the room, if not he is prepared to changethis is really awesome room similar to two bedroom suite- that was awesome.he also wanted to ensure i have iron in the room and i should be careful and very nice and thoughtful.he said anything else do not hesitate- very upbeat and nice so i thought whatever extra mile we need to tell - i was touched by this young gentleman last night around 11 :45 pm to 12 midnight appx -please check forgot the exact time..2. The Water -for the shower comes really hot - very quick, nice - normally we have to rotate more in more hotels-this is well maintained shower for hot water bath- i really like it ...it was quick, even though the bath tub is little small for squeezing-very convenient3. Air condition in the night shoots up very quickly well maintained even inf 65 or 66 if i keep it cools so quickly.4. Other two people to recognize areOutstanding front desk Manager lee hazley Ms.Lee Hazley   She is highly positiveShe is prepared to smile -very hospitality industry gestureShe is quick to get things donemanage many things on the phone and help outShe went out of the way to get my Coat , Suite and Tie - done -without her help i am not sure how would i go for this particular interview or so.. very very kind gesture.she also said i can come back and change my dress -on my way home -very accommodative, helpful, nice and courteousAll these people last night, Lee Hazley should never be forgotten for the extra mile they did for meSame goes with Regina who is very nice person in the front deskPlease ensure all these people are recognized at this hotel to send to upper managementwould greatly appreciate, if you can ensure to send and follow-up pleaseThanks so much againsriAlways love staying at this location.  Super nice, spacious rooms that smell lovely!  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  Definitely a must stay in Jacksonville.This is my first visit with the Marriott chain. We wanted to book a fair priced room that wasn't too far from the beach. The prices right on the beach were pretty ridiculous and considering the weather for this weekend, we didn't want to spend most of the time just watching the rain hit the sand. The reviews on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftripadvisor.com&amp;s=b7a45c946ae1ae01b3c7e132feae42871680ada3b76593a3b76393cd0c65a36a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tripadvisor.com</a> were pretty good so we booked it. At $84 a night, it's worth the price. This location seems to be geared towards people on business trips or extended stays. Our studio came with a very nice kitchen equipped with a fridge, dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave, and stove top. I was surprised to find pots and pans and dishes. There was a pantry in the kitchen and the other side of it was closet space that could be accessed through a door in the bathroom. My daughter had fun walking through the pantry and into the bathroom. The desk had a table underneath that could be pulled out ff you had guests or wanted a separate area to eat. We had a nice comfortable sofa bed for our daughter. We had a king size bed for ourselves. Very comfortable. Nice, clean, spacious bathroom. The hotel has a laundry room and fitness center that has three treadmills and some weights. The free breakfast was decent and filling. There was a waffle maker, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, and a few pastries. Fresh fruit would have been awesome. Pool area was nice and equipped with a BBQ grill.Overall, I enjoyed the experience. I'm not very picky and this hotel suited our needs for the weekend.Traditional town place suites but the customer service was phenomenal!  Joshua made my stay. Breakfast leaves a bit to be desired but its quiet, clean, and super polite. Will definitely visit again.I wish I could right a good review for this new establishment, but as a road warrior.....I have an oath to fellow travelers to keep it real. The first week I stayed here was fine- I was upgraded from a one bedroom suite to a two bedroom suite. The rooms are VERY nice. Flat screens in every room, individual temperature control central air for every room, and a full kitchen (full size stainless steel  fridge and freezer, microwave and flat top stove). The bathroom was my favorite becuase it has a permanent ""dim sleep light"" that stays on when you turn the regular light off. I love this becuase I hate having to squint in the morning when I wake up becuase the light is too bright. This light is very dim but you can see the whole bathroom. Week two I was downgraded from a one bedroom suite to a studio becuase they were sold out. I was having a friend over for dinner so this was an inconvienence. The girl at the front desk said she could give me $20 off, but I told her I don't pay the bill, my company does, and after a long day of traveling and living out of a suitecase 3 weeks out the month, something resembling an apartment aka space is what I appreciate. I asked for Marriott points and she said she would have to ask the manager int he morning. Big surprise, I got nothing. I even filled out a comment card about my experience and I did not hear anything back. I hope whoever got my one bedroom was at a higher marriott rewards level than I.Week three they were sold out again but I got my one bedroom suite. Unfortunatly it was on the first floor, right outside of the pool. And some guy decided he wanted to play his guitar by the pool all night.Since this is the nicest amenity hotel closest to where I need to be, I continually stay here but I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.Don't let the cheap remodel or the low room rate fool you. The service at this hotel is absolutely atrocious. By far the worst I've experienced at any Marriott location and I travel 300 days per year",,,,,"['excellent', 'hotel', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'suites', 'like', 'found', 'new', 'home', 'away',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramada-jacksonville-hotel-and-conference-center-jacksonville,Ramada Jacksonville Hotel & Conference Center,3.0,$$,15,"I booked my hotel through Expedia at an average of $50/night (Wednesday night through Friday night). The staff was helpful and remembered me throughout the weekend. Each room has a decent sized mini-fridge (larger than most) and microwave, so I saved money by bringing some groceries rather than eating out. When I forgot utensils, the hotel gave me a set of their silverware to borrow, which was greatly appreciated!It's located very close to I-295 and I-95, and I was able to visit St. Augustine and Ponte Vedra without much hassle during my stay. There is also a shopping plaza with Whole Foods, restaurants, spas, etc. within walking distance. Two pet superstores are also nearby (and the hotel is pet-friendly). Three nice parks are west of San Jose Blvd, on the St. Johns River.Next time I'm in the area, this hotel is my first choice. I do recommend requesting a room on the first floor as there are no elevators.I've been here a few times not for a stay but for the Comedy Zone Club. The lobby is clean and we sat and had a few drinks at the Piano Room which is a bar attached to the lobby and a few feet away from the comedy club. The drinks are stronger at the bar than in the club. The bar maid was nice and the atmosphere nice &amp; friendly.I've come to this location several times over the last few years for the comic conventions that are held here for Pop Retr-O-Rama and the other one who's name escapes me and every time the same thoughts pass through my head.1. The place could use a good upgrade as far as furnishings and decorating are concerned. It's not bad mind you, and it's not dirty but it's just feels a bit outdated.2. There is a pervasive smell that I notice every time when I come here. Especially in the causeway between the outdoor doors and the indoor doors at the front entrance like mold or mildew that kind of knocks you in your nose for a second, but thankfully the rest of the place isn't like that. 3. I can't say much for the staff as thankfully I never really have any issues that require their assistance. I will say that they always look friendly and are around, so no issues there. 4. This place has pretty good convention space though, and I'm always happy coming because at this point it's a known quantity and it's familiar. The verdict is that while this place is a bit on the old side, for my needs (conventions) they are A-OK.The room at Hartley Rd does not look what is on the pictures . This false advertisement ! We check in even we knew that there is no elevator . But we get to the room there is baby spider crawling in the bed and the air that comes from AC smells nasty ! I will not waste my hard earn money for this hotelHad a pretty bad experience there - our trip was for 4 days and we booked this hotel because it looked decent and had a reasonable price. Once we entered the hotel we knew we made a mistake! Everything from the food to service and ambience was very low grade and after about 10 minutes after stepping into our room we called and cancelled our reservation! We checked in at 2 am and we're told that we at least had to spend the night for them to cancel the rest of the reservation - so we had to. But I do give them credit for at least letting us cancel the rest of the reservation....Don't be fooled by their price either - at checkout, they added all sorts of stupid taxes including 'tourism tax' to Jack up the room rent...we found a way way better hote for about 10 bucks more the next day....my sincere advice would be to stay away from their nonsense....A very good budget hotel. Stayed there two nights and was satisfied with the place, location and service.This one is conveniently located right at the intersection of San Jose and 295. The place has a large spread out parking area and can't be missed while driving. Check-in was breeze, the Wi-Fi signal was good enough to stream live FIFA WWC games. The room was standard; queen bed, Samsung TV, Iron w/ board. I really liked their single dispenser coffee maker. The quality of coffee was not bad either. They do have both regular and decaf, and even tea.The bed was not the most comfortable as it felt a little old and somewhat sinking in the middle and there were some few stains on the carpet. Apart from that, it was alright. Doesn't have whole lot of choices in TV channels but you can get by it.The pool area seems to be alright as lot of people seem to enjoy it. This location has Comedy zone and apparently everyone from Jacksonville has been there once. They do have a nice cafe too which is also the place of complimentary breakfast.The breakfast is much better than any other budget hotel I've stayed. They have whole two large buffet table laid out with: scrambled egg, bacon, biscuits n gravy, grits, some bakery goods, OJ, cereals with milk, fruits and some more. The two ladies serving the area were friendly and energetic and even though it is complimentary breakfast expect to tip.There is a decent business area with connectivity if you need to use the internet and bar too although I didn't indulge in them.During my stay there wasn't any kind of troubling scene or loud noises, so it felt safe too. The area has some few restaurants like steak house, Italian and Whole food market all in walking distance.I have stayed in better hotel than this one but a nice gesture from the front-desk lady that have never happened to me will always make it memorable. While I was checking out and about to leave, the lady asked if I would like to have a bottle of water for the road. I was somewhat taken aback by this gesture but really thankful because even the nicest of staffs don't bother that much and the day was already getting hot.I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend this place if you are on budget.In the midst of updating rooms which were not that bad to begin with. Great location. Breakfast is a full buffet in the main dining room, eggs...bacon...sausage gravy and much more. Look for special event deals packaging dinner, room and comedy. Here for four days and really enjoy the place. Low key bar, friendly staff. Ask for room not facing I295, just to make sure it's quite. Walking distance to Steak and Shark, Bib Evans and Whole Foods. Place is clean and staff is super friendly.Great price and great location! Paid 67 for a king room facing the pool.I really liked the quietness of the hotel.It would be a 4 but the young woman who was checking us in was much more interested in flirting with the young man who was in front of us. She didn't give us the wifi information and then proceeded to give me attitude when I asked for it.Id love to come to the comedy zone or the piano bar. Lots of parking and lots of restaurants near by!This is the Ramada Inn that houses the Comedy Zone. I've only stayed here once, for the ""Suitehearts"" package they offered for Valentine's Day. $199 for prime rib and crab leg buffet for two with champagne at the hotel's restaurant, Gigi's, admission to the comedy featuring Henry Cho, a room for the night with late checkout, and breakfast buffet for two at Gigi's. Great deal for what you get. They offer similar packages year-round. The receptionists are friendly, but they don't always give consistent information when calling about Comedy Zone info. Plus, when my boyfriend was trying to book the package, he was told on the phone that the only person who could take care of it had left for the day and he'd get a call back the next day. As that next day was coming to a close and no call had come, my boyfriend called again and was told the same thing. After try again he finally resorted to doing it online. The room was very clean, no complaints there. Just a standard chain hotel, nothing to write home about.Desk person very nice, room not so much. Def not a 3-Star hotel in comparison to other 3-Star properties I've stayed in. Toilet had dried urine on it &amp; long hairs on toilet &amp; sink countertop. Room also smells really musty. Not good. Priceline needs to reevaluate this as a 3-Star property. Disappointed...I've stayed at this hotel mutiple times on business trips and was treated with incredible kindness from the staff each time. The hotel has a private quietness to it that was really relaxing, but there is a bar/restaurant/comedy zone inside as well, so there is much to do while staying there. The first time I stayed here, my coworker and I were flying back from Bahrain and were incredibly jet-lagged. The man working behind the counter, Taye, was incredibly kind, helpful and understanding of our desire to check in early. He gave us water bottles and was one of the kindest hotel staff we have encountered.I was very disappointed..first room 202 smelled horrible,dead bugs and very dusty...we moved to room 159 which was not much better. Dusty, ripped drapes, filthy carpet.We got the package deal for comedy show and GiGi's...the comedy show and food was awesome. Customer service was great. This place needs a complete renovation! I will never stay here again..will attend shows.Hotel reviews trip me out. Or maybe they help set expectations lower. I dunno. But the reviews on this were off the mark. Beds were nice and clean. Room look updated and maybe even recently redone. For the price, I'm really happy with what we got.Wife and I stayed here last night.Got room on Priceline.Renovated room was just fine.I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.Whole Food,next door was nice for breakfast.Cockroaches crawling on the furniture.  Putrid smell in the shower. Carpets that I was afraid to walk barefoot on.  Some of the rooms were renovated...but I guess that wasn't mine.The only redeeming feature is the Whole Foods Market next door.",,,,,"['booked', 'hotel', 'average', 'night', 'night', 'night', 'staff',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-jacksonville-3,Homewood Suites By Hilton,4.5,$$,12,"Spent the weekend at this hotel with the wife and kids during a visit to Jacksonville for a state piano competition.  The room was divided in 2 parts, and was more than generous for our needs.  The room was nicely decorated and clean, no bad odors! The little kitchen was very useful as we stayed in and ate dinner Friday night and watched movies.We were close to a nice little shopping area and 5 minutes away from University of North Florida where the competition was being held so it was a perfect location.  The manager was helpful and friendly at check in, staff was proficient. But the best part of the stay was actually what happened after our stay.  When I checked in, I made a big mistake.  I accidentally wrote in that we would stay for 4 days not 2.  When I found my card was charged double the amount I expected after we left the hotel I was upset.When I called to question the charge the staff was professional and responsive.  They looked into the matter and explained what happened.  It was my fault and they had me in a corner because of the contract I agreed to and signed.However, when I asked to speak to the manager, who I'm sure was very busy.  She spent a few minutes going over the details with me, remembered my kids from check in and gladly refunded the money to my card and made me a happy and loyal customer.Thank you Robin!So this place is not exactly a luxury establishment, but their staff are really delightful. I came here in an emergency and found the staff to be very warm and welcoming.I checked into my room and found it to smell like smoke. I called downstairs and Alexa immediately fixed the situation. As the elevator opened downstairs, she was there to give me my new room keys and apologiZe. Now THAT'S service!My room was extraordinarily clean and very quiet. Easy to walk to all shops and restaurantS at Town Center. I will definitely return to this hotel.This hotel is the standard Homewood Suites you will find almost anywhere on your travels, but the location in the Town Center is hard to beat.  You are walking distrance to more great restaurants/bars/shops than you will have time to visit.  I visit Jacksonville often for work, and this has become a favorite place to stay more for the location than the hotel itself.Words are not enough to express my gratitude to the front desk and kitchen staff for making my stay enjoyable. Having spent four months at this location recently for work I must say they are the friendliest and most caring employees I have come across in my many years of traveling for my job.   Their professionalism never wavered, even when some of the guests were difficult to deal with.  Each and everyone of them should be recognized for their hard work and dedication to customer service.  They treated us like family and took great care of us!I come to Jax regularly for work and always stay here. The location is great and they serve free beer and wine. It's a tad expensive, but free booze, dinner, breakfast and internet are all included and the area is great.This place is great! Professional courteous staff, clean, and you can walk around the St. Johns Town Center.Very cozy stay and perfect for a shopping trip to St. Johns Town Center.  You can walk right to all the shops and restaurants.  I was impressed with how large the room was and the bed was comfortable.  I was there on a cold evening (for Florida) and they had the heat cranked up, but not too much.  They also had put out extra blankets in my room in case I needed one which was nice.  It was so toasty in my room that I fell asleep early haha.  The free breakfast in the morning was decent but not too exciting.  It felt safe also because they said they locked the doors at 10pm.  I would stay here again if I was coming to this area and it was very reasonable for $80 (govt rate).  My only complaint would be that the internet signal was pretty weak.Great room and even better staff!This is my preferred place to stay when I'm in Jacsonville.Always like the Hilton's. Expect for Paris of course. Very clean rooms with kitchenettes. Love the breakfast and a very nice pool.I came all the way to Jacksonville for a business trip and stay at the Hilton. They rooms were very spacious, with a little kitchen, stove, fridge, tiny living room, and comfy beds. There was a full complementary breakfast with everything you could imagine. Staff was courteous and friendly and the hotel is centered all around amazing shops. Thank you!The hotel itself is built as an extended stay hotel as each of it's rooms have a mini kitchenette in them. The rooms all have a separate sitting area with a bedroom and bathroom.  I've stayed in a couple of their rooms and the corner rooms are a lot roomier than the others.  They do offer free meals (good meals) with the rooms during the week and if you have any dietary concerns the in house chefs is always willing to make changes for you.  The staff was extremely nice, always welcoming you in and asking you how your day has been.  I ended up staying there for over 3 months and by the time I was ready to leave, I was reluctant to go as the staff had become my second family.  This hotel is about 5min away from a new shopping center complete with great restaurants.  I highly recommend Maggiano's Italian Restaurant and if you're a fan of Spumoni ice cream, they have the best as its homemade.  Whenever I return to Jacksonville, I make it a point to stay here.  Can't recommend it enough.",,,,,"['spent', 'weekend', 'hotel', 'wife', 'kids', 'visit', 'state', 'piano', 'competition', 'room', 'divided', 'parts', 'generous', 'needs', 'room', 'nicely', 'decorated',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-jacksonville-jacksonville,SpringHill Suites Jacksonville,2.5,$$,19,"Very Friendly StaffWe just checked out of Springhill Suites. We stayed for two nights and had a room on the second floor in room 214. We had three minor issues during our stay - the first night a child who was old enough to know better ran down the hall at 5am yelling (not the hotels fault, it's the parents fault) and the second problem was the plumbing in our bathroom sink was faulty and leaked. We're laid back, so we didn't complain - we just put a trashcan under the sink to collect any dripping water. Our AC sucked and wouldn't really cool down our room during the day.The hotel staff is very friendly - always saying hello and asking if there was anything that they could do for us. Chupa chup lollypops are available at the front desk along with fresh lime water.Breakfast is pretty standard but the meats change daily. Tuesday was bacon, Wednesday was potatoes and sausage.Fitness center has an elliptical, treadmill and stationary bike. There is a pool and a hot tub located out back.Very good location wise - very close to St. John's Town Center and lots of food options.Cable was awful, HBO Family instead of real HBO? Internet was slow, hotel responded that there were a lot of guests in the hotel. NOT an excuse. Worst was moving the bed stand to plug in my computer and there was a nasty white mold all over the plugs. EEK!Had to stay there 4 days for business, and I just cancelled my reservation for next week.  My room on the 5th floor was dirty with mildew smell.  I had plumbing issue, my toilet kept running water all night, notified the front desk the next morning maintenance came to fix but never was fixed.   Shower head leaked drops of water the entire week I was there.  Who has time to deal with that, these should have been corrected before I got there.One evening we reported to the front desk that the floor by the elevators were wet probably from people coming back from the pool.  She ignored and pretended to not hear us. Oh my!  She was not an employee that cares.I'm really surprised that this facility can call itself a Marriott. There are very few things that are nice about this hotel.  They do have the impeccable service that Marriott is widely known for. It was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Now for my negative rant....The sink faucet was broken. To turn it on and leave it on you had to jam a wash cloth underneath the handle. Otherwise the handle would fall down and the water turned off. The shower faucet was impossible to turn on and once it was on, again impossible to turn off. For a quick stay, it's not horrible, but let's be honest - spend the money and stay somewhere better!If you ever come from the airport, they will act very annoyed and put-upon. Flown through here twice, and am now avoiding Jacksonville as an airport/place to stay. These folks are really terrible.Had a slight glitch on our night of arrival, which was handled very professionally by Sarah at the front desk. She was great throughout, and gave us a great lunch recommendation at the Metro Diner, which we thoroughly enjoyed. So a big thank you to Sarah! The room was clean, and spacious, the usual Spring hill suite quality. Breakfast was good, lots of options, was happily surprised to have the option of blueberry waffles, and Nutella for our toast. Both were a big hit with our 11, 15 and 18 year old kids. I would add however, that our bed wasn't very comfortable, and could have used a mattress replacement (room 314). It was very ""springy"". Otherwise great stay, clean, great service (house keeping was also very friendly) and good breakfast. Would definitely return!Although my room was clean (except for some peeling paint in the bathroom), I was right above the hot tub and a party went on until 4 a.m.!!  Very loud!!  When I called the front desk, the gentlemen said he would take care of it.  In hindsight, I'm guessing he was part of the party.  I like Springhill Suites, but definitely avoid this one.The customer service at this hotel is outstanding.  The rooms are very clean, and the breakfast they provide is great.Stay here one night for business on January 19th. The workers Were extremely friendly and went out of there way to be friendly and nice . Their professionalism and charm was remarkable! The rooms were extraordinary and nicely sized. The lobby has a beautiful Contemporary ""Art Deco-ish"" feel. Beautifully landscaped. A ton of good restaurants easily with in walking distance. I will definitely stay here again!!!The good:The front desk staff people we saw were friendly and efficient.   The rest....eh. The rooms are a good size and the almost-kitchenette is handy. I didn't have a ton of cleanliness issues as others have reported but I will address maintenance and upkeep below. Not so good: 1.  I went to lobby around 10:20, hoping I wasn't too late to grab some juice and yogurt.  I figured I was too late but I was relieved to see all the table full and people eating and drinking like it was a celebration.   Great!    Tried to get some juice from the dispenser but nothing happened.   Asked an employee if it was empty.  Her response, ""no, it's turned off."" I asked if she could turn it on.  ""No.  Breakfast ends at 10."" Then she refilled her own coffee and sat down and continued her conversation with her brunch-eating co-workers.   There was still hot scrambled eggs and sausage in the pans but it was made clear to me that I missed my time slot.  If the employees are invited to enjoy breakfast on their breaks, that's great, good for them.  But if the paying guests are turned away at least have enough professionalism to do so out of full view of the customers.   So rude! 2.  One of the two rooms we had last night had a backed up toilet.   We called and reported it twice.   We were told someone would probably come up.  No one ever did.   After an hour, my husband went downstairs, requested a plunger and fixed it himself.   He put the plunger in a plastic bag and left it outside the door.   It is probably still sitting there because it was when we checked out this morning.   Clearly, no one cared to follow through with this.  Room 4143.   Flip lock on inside of one door did not work.   Tried to let front desk know as we checked out this morning at 5.   No one was around.   We just took our receipt from the pile left out on the counter and left.  4144.   Tubs have been resurfaced (poorly) and it feels icky under your feet.   You feel like you are standing on something dirty.   It doesn't look dirty, it just feels that way due to re surfacing product.  Rooms 402, 4145. Daughters wanted to sleep in Saturday and they asked housekeeping to come back after 12.  They never returned.  Room 4146.  Trash in ice bucket upon arrival.  Room 4147.  Lamp with no light bulb.  Room 4148.   My bath towel Saturday was fine.  My bath towel Sunday (new towel) smelled musty.  402. 9.   A.C. Unit in 402 causes the wall to vibrate loudly.My first review for 2015. Yay! I am on a business trip in Jacksonville for a week and was looking for something that had free breakfast so I didn't have to grab something before work. None of the hotels in the area were within my company's policy and I can definitely see why now. The hotel options in Jacksonville leave a lot to be desired. However, I stayed at the Springhill Suites by the Marriott because it was only a few minutes from my office. Also, I am a Marriott Rewards member and held the Marriott brand to a slightly higher standard.The pros are 1) the staff is extremely nice. The front desk clerks were not talkative but did their job efficiently. The ladies who took care of the breakfast were sweet, down to earth and so hospitable and friendly. I did not encounter any bell boys, housekeeping or maintenance folks. 2) The free breakfast is actually pretty good but I only got to try Monday's breakfast (please see con #1). They had the best biscuits and gravy I've ever tasted. Granted, I haven't had too many in my lifetime but their biscuits were soft, flakey and melted in your mouth. The gravy was so flavorful and had a good meat to gravy ratio. I now have this sort of expectation for all the biscuits and gravy that I plan to eat in the future. Other options available were your typical scrambled eggs, toast, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, bagels, blueberry muffins, juices, milk, coffee and teas. 3) They have in-room mini fridge, sink, microwave and an ice machine on every floor 4) they have a pull out couch, albeit, the couch was not in very good condition. 5) you can see the TV from either the bed or the couch because it swivels. 6) It is very quiet or maybe I had no one stay in any of the rooms near me. In any event, while I was there, I did not hear any door slams, children running around, no loud TVs next door, etc. All I heard was ""nothing"" and it was strange. 7) It is within walking distance to restaurants and had nearby shopping.The cons are 1) I wanted to walk right back out as soon as I walked in. The smell that hit me when I walked in was foul but I thought maybe that was just the lobby. So I checked into the hotel and proceeded to the elevator. The elevator had a different smell and was a little dirty. When I got to my floor, the hallway smelled differently as well. When I opened my hotel room it was yet another different smell. None of these smells were pleasant at all. I wanted to check out but it was a Sunday evening and my travel agency was closed. So I stayed the night. I coughed the whole night, got little sleep and am allergic to mildew. So I checked out the next day and went to the Sheraton. It would not have been good for my health had I stayed the whole week as originally planned. 2) the Paul Mitchell toiletries provided were small and I did not like the conditioner. My hair was dry and frizzy. I like to travel light so I always use what is provided by the hotel. 3) the location was not easily accessible.  The hotel is located on Southside Blvd but if you don't pay attention, you could miss the entrance. It is behind a strip of restaurants. So my number one con heavily outweighed all the pros and I will not be back unless they address the mildew and smell issues.Was in town visiting family during holiday weekend. That likely explains the reason for so many kids. Room was very clean and shower was impeccably clean. Continental breakfast was regularly stocked. Sink and mirror was outside of bathroom, first time staying in a hotel like that where you lose privacy (traveling with spouse and in-law).Not the nicest option that exists but for convenience sake and since the staff was friendly, I have to give it two stars.  Thankfully, I only needed the room to sleep in, shower and get on the road for a meeting.   So for what was paid and for the 8 hours total that was spent there, I cannot complain much more. Breakfast in the morning was complimentary and not too bad.  Basic continental buffet type thing.  Now that I know that area a little better, if I have to go back, I may look at a different place.  Just seems outdated and not in the best of shape. Staff was wonderful though.Free continental breakfast...friendly staff but room spelled funny :/Decided to stay with friends in town.Rooms and common areas are OK--typical older style Marriott SHS fashion.  What makes me knock off a star is the super slow internet access here.  I have stayed here several times over the years, and the last few times here the internet has gotten slower and slower.  I wont be back just due to that fact.  gotta be able to work!!Stayed there last week for a night and everything was great. Stayed there again last night with my husband and 5 children in 2 rooms and there was some sort of ""event"" at the hotel next door. Well we were awakened at about 1130pm to the sounds of gun shots in total at least 10 or 12 I has my children on the floor under the desk when I went down to the front desk they did not seem overly concerned and that they thought the group causing the disturbance was just firing in the air I don't think people need to be reminded of the laws of gravity needless to say did not sleep a wink and had to travel home about  9 hours away upon check out they did comp one of our rooms but didnt like feeling unsafeAs hometown heroes Lynyrd Skynyrd would say...""oo-oo that smell, cancha smell that smell."" That was the smell eight years ago when I first stayed here while interviewing for a job in JAX.  And while I must be travelin' on now, I know that things haven't changed.  In fact, the decor is identical to what I experienced eight years ago.  To boot, this Freebird can't get out the door fast enough...because the elevator from the fifth floor penthouse level still takes an hour to reach the ground floor.  Oh, and there's a TGI Friday's across the street!!!Nothing fancy, but a great hotel for a very reasonable rate. Spacious king bed suites. Large flat screen TVs. Sink area outside the toilet/shower area, but still separated from the bedroom. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Very clean, nice smelling rooms. My family stayed here for a graduation, we had 5 rooms in all and everyone agreed with these positive remarks. Again, it's nothing fancy, but it's a clean, spacious, comfortable place to stay at an affordable rate.We are a seasoned visitor to the Jacksonville Marriott Springhill Suites/Deerwood having stayed at the hotel at least six times in the last two years when visiting family.  Our most recent stay was a five night visit December 2011.  The place has seriously gone downhill.  The major things we noticed during this past stay were:  (1) The rooms, hallways, stairwells and fitness center are NOT CLEAN.  This was markedly noticeable especially in any public use areas.  The fitness center equipment was filthy and when I went into the nearby restroom to get a paper towel with which to wipe down the equipment, the bathroom itself was terribly dirty.  (2)  Things just didn't work well - one day, we had no towels after the room was cleaned; another day clean sheets (we think) were left in our room after the housekeeping visit.  Since the bed had been made, did they not change the sheets or did they forget them there.  On three occassions during our six day stay, we had to call to ask for soap or tissues or other basic items that should have been restocked.  One day, the room was askew after housekeeping had been there - the TV was turned, the furniture moved, someone's bluetooth device was left in the room, and our personal items had been rearranged.  Let's just say, we don't believe it was due to thorough cleaning.  (3) Breakfast has gone sunstantially downhill.  It's not cool to serve brown bananas and week old bagels/pastries.  The oatmeal and grits are both in little packages now not ""homemade"" as before.  (4) The printer in the business center would not work and the PCs there were especially slow.All in all we could not wait to leave.  Everything was just ""off"".  Please note this is a very OLD Springhill Suites design and the rooms are just weird in their design.  But that never bothered us before because this facility HAD BEEN a comfortable convenient place to retreat to after a long day with relatives.  We'll look for somewhere different to stay next time.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-jacksonville-jtb-deerwood-park-jacksonville,Hilton Garden Inn Jacksonville JTB/Deerwood Park,3.0,$$,17,"From check-in through check-out every staff member we encountered was polite, professional, and helpful. It felt like they actually cared about their guests and their guest's needs. The room was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with all the usual necessities. There was even a Keurig in the room; so no more of those awkward, spill-prone hotel coffee makers. The bed was very comfortable as they have apparently recently replaced them all.The breakfast buffet (small upcharge) offered made to order eggs, omelets, and pancakes. There were lots of breakfast meats available, too; but as a vegan, I was concentrating on the hot oatmeal and abundance of fresh fruit. The breakfast area is large enough that one did not feel crowded by other guest and finished plates were quickly whisked away from the table by warm, friendly staff.We also paid a very small upcharge for the Romance Package. The staff's execution of this service is what took this review from four stars to five. When we opened our door, there stood a bottle of wine on ice, a beautifully made up fruit plate and a bag with many little extras. Again, it felt like they actually cared (which is becoming a rare occurrence these days).I highly recommend this hotel for families, business travelers, or couples just looking to get away for the weekend.This hotel features the freshest, most pungent mold you'll ever experience anywhere. And of course the beds are just a little less comfortable than a cement floor.  Stay away from this garbage place.I travel for work every week and am a Hilton Honors member. In all honesty this was my most disappointing stay. The lobby looks great, but it is all downhill from there. The rooms are outdated and the carpet had a funny smell. The worst part about the stay was that the iron had rust in the steam holes and I didn't find out until it had stained my lab coat. Very disappointing. I will be looking elsewhere for my next visit to Jacksonville.The most uncomfortable bed I've ever tried to sleep on in two years of traveling every week.  Sleepless for two nights in a row now.The front desk clerk on duty was very nice, hence the 2nd star.I had a great experience. I travel weekly and I'm an honors member. I had a problem with my toilet running I called down and in 5 minutes someone fixed my toilet. Then right after the maintenance man left I had a phone call to my room checking that it was fixed and then someone showed up to my room with a goody bag thanking me for my patience, for reporting the problem and apologized for my inconvenience.  It was clean and staff was friendly! They had a manager from Indiana there retraining so if you had a bad experience before give them another try!Ok, so Tuesday the shower head sprung a leak that shoots across the bathroom and the handle on the toaster came off in my hand. Was going to mention at check out. Then tonight the handle to the hot water in the sink came off and I can't turn it off. The desk said no maintenance on duty so keep the door shut overnight. Ugh!We were hesitant to stay at the Hilton Gardens after reading the not so great reviews.  we were pleasantly surprised. The room was immaculate and the size was perfect.  What really made our trip was the excellent front desk service.  Nicholas and Jeffrey were amazing, super friendly, courteous, and helpful.This conveniently located hotel is extremely well run. Staff and manager are friendly and attentive like none I've seen in a while. The breakfast includes lots of fresh high quality fruit, sometimes whole grain bakery fresh breads. The hot food options are great and they offer to make fresh omelets to your specifications. We needed our room moved because it was next to the elevator shaft and the staff couldn't have been more supportive. The hotel is located near lots of shopping. &amp; restaurants.  The St Johns Center shopping area is just 2 blocks away along Gate Pkwy.I used to try to stay closer to the beaches but I've never had a great experience. I will stay here anytime I'm in Jacksonville. It's now my hotel of choice.Old furniture, stiff beds, and boring decor.  Good location but there are several other hotels in the immediate vicinity which are better.The lady at the check-in was friendly and our room was okay.  Everything was clean, they had a Keurig coffee maker in the room with good coffee...but no non-dairy creamer and only 2 half and half cups.  They need more for two people.  The bed was too firm for my taste but that's just me.  They did have a large flat screen tv and complimentary wifi.  The bathroom was pretty basic and they had Neutrogena toiletries in there that were available for use.  The breakfast the next morning was okay, your typical hotel breakfast.  We would stay here again if the cost was less than 100 bucks per night.I expect a consistent level of experience with HGI, it is well known as a top tier business traveler's hotel.  This hotel did not measure up.While attempting to book my reservation, the Hilton website popped up a special offer for a ""Presidential Suite"" for a very reasonable price (yelp guidelines I think say no numbers here) so I said ""sounds OK"" and booked it.  Three days before my stay, the hotel sends me an email saying that the reservation is marked as a smoking room and that they don't have any smoking ""Presidential Suites"" left (who allows smoking in a hotel anyway - isn't that how fires start?)  I don't see the email until the next morning (why they couldn't have called me - I don't know) and respond, but by then, THEY HAD CHANGED MY RESERVATION WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION and put me into a ""deluxe"" room (read that - all other rooms are ""deluxe"").When I got to the hotel, the checkin and checkout experience was fine, but the room was not what I booked, there was NO HOT WATER either day.  The front desk said they had it checked out and the system was fine, and maybe too many people were showering that morning.  Hey remind me to sign up for my time slot next time.  The showerhead in my shower pointed to the floor and would not stay in place, the thermostat said 76 degrees but it was more like 65, and the common hallway carpets were dirty and needed to be stretched so they were not a trip hazard.Absolutely not what I have experienced at other HGI properties.On the bright side, the breakfast is somewhat adequate, as long as you don't have to pay for it, and the breakfast area waiter will lift your spirits with his enthusiasm and attitude.Hilton Garden Inn is the new Holiday Inn.  Hotel room is average.    Bathroom outdated. I wanted to try HGI for the Hilton brand, expecting more. It's fine as a business traveler choice.   Just manage your expectations. At check in... The attendant offered folks as they checked in if they wanted to arrange the wake up call for the next day.   Everyone including myself took the offer for the morning wake up call.   I'm not usually a good sleeper while away from home and anxious for my early day at the office.... So I slept on and off.   I stared at the clock as the time past for my wake up call.    5 mins later still no call... I dialed the front desk letting them know of the Missed Wake Up Call....not cool!Also, I need to add to my Hilton profile not to give me an adjoining room.  I'm just not comfortable having that door there when traveling alone.  Morning breakfast is busy with businesss travelers.  Most tables are taken at 7:30.  I can see how it may be difficult to find seat at times.  Made to order egg items are available, if you can to flag the server to place your order.   If you don't have time, which most of us business travelers don't, there's a buffet ready with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits, gravy... etc.All in all.... HGI was an ok place to stay.  There are nearby restaurants and  business offices nearby.They like to make the lobby look great but that's about all that looks good here. For what they charge here you should get a nice room with a comfortable bed...  NOT!! Room was mediocre at best. The bed was like sleeping on a concrete slab. Bathroom water pressure was almost non existent.  The shower head had so much calcium on it you couldn't have moved it with a crowbar. I found dirty napkins in the nightstand drawer and trash under the edge of the bed.  The outside of the place is in disrepair and the Maintenance Supervisor should be fired for letting his place looks like this. Overall this place sucked. It's too bad because my wife and I stay in this area monthly for work. Guess we will have to move on to another hotel for next month!Pretty standard issue for this low cost hotel chain. Rooms are simple but well presented. Has all the basics a business person needs: wifi, quiet room, tv, etc. I don't recall that the TV was flat screen. I think the only thing that was missing was a full length mirror, but I find that's usually a coin toss in hotel rooms. There is an outdoor pool, a well stocked front desk pantry with snacks, and plenty of parking. The fitness center was stuffy, a little too warm for my usual morning jog. It is conveniently located by a mall and many of Jacksonville's business campuses. Front desk and housekeeping staff were spot on during my stay, always greeting me with a smile.i dont know what people expect.  i thought it was perfectly suitable, clean, hospitable people, very comfy bed. my baggage was not sent with me on my flight, United then held it hostage in chicago b/c they thought it was a good idea at the time (I was not departing from chicago either, stupid united.)the staff at the HGI was friendly, hospitable, etc. etc. thanks a bunch!get bravo and lose HBO family, and why the heck did my tv volume not go below 11?!Very mediocre. Lobby is nice, usually offers free water and cookies. Room was fine, nice LG tv's. Bathroom was not nice, very outdated and tiny sink area. Biggest complaint of room was bathroom. Great location, near massive shopping area (St. Johns Town Center) filled with restaurants, shops, bars, movie theater, etc. Walking distance to movie theater, few restaurants, and Starbucks.Dirty, unsanitary, they don't listen, they don't care...My room has not been vacuumed so I complained.  They didn't clean my bathroom counter and tub and had hair on them for two days.  They barely make the bed and leave the dirty fork, used napkin, trash on the floor...again I complained.  I came home to a bed that oviously its sheets hasn't been changed (I've been here 5 days now) and now that I examined it, it had hair and dried blood spot.  I surely hope this is my blood and hair...When I spoke to the manager, he just looked at me like I'm crazy for cmplaining...apologyzed half heartedly and obviously he doesn't care...nothing has changed.  I wish I was staying somewhere else...Breakfast buffet:  Bread inside the bread keeper had a dead ant on it AND some fruit flies flying inside.The maid took time to play with my glasses and moved it from the desk to the bed where she made an ""origami"" animal with towels and put my glasses on it.DON'T EVER STAY HERE.",,,,,"['check', 'check', 'every', 'staff', 'member', 'encountered', 'polite',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-jacksonville-13,Hampton Inn,3.5,$$,16,"Beautiful property. Everything and everyone was so pleasant, from greeting to checkout. Breakfast was surprisingly good. I am a big fan of Holiday Inn Express, but this stay may have me thinking about jumping ship.The only con: the free internet is sloooooow.Now this place is fantastic!From the friendly and helpful staff to the spectacular rooms, I have no complaints.The breakfast was above average in comparison to other hotels that include it. Will most definitely be back.Very disappointed.  First off the location is great, I have stayed here over the years and was happy to pay a little extra to stay in a familiar place.   But I also paid extra for the upgraded internet service which not only didn't work, but the front desk apparently was not aware existed.  The real kicker was this evening when I found the Hotel double billed me for five nights so there is more than $850 extra sitting on my credit card (not a pending charge, but a full second charge). Then some stuff that I picked up the snack area that was included in the hotel bill, then double billed on the second bill was then billed yet again as a separate charge as well.   Seems a couple bottles of water now cost $18 and my room for five nights is sitting on my credit card at $1900!  And...I never did get internet service.I give this Hilton Property one (1) Star due to the absence of the front desk staff. As a Hilton Diamond Member I average over 140 nights a year and the 3 times I've stayed here my wait at the gent desk for service is roughly 15 minutes.   Last year I waited at the front desk for almost 25 minutes for the front desk person to return to the property. This review was generated because I'm tired of hearing; ""I'm sorry about the wait""Hard to beat the location.  It was convenient to the Town Center, and a 15 minute commute to downtown Jacksonville.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The outdoor firepit was nice on the chilly night.  The fitness room location doesn't make much sense.  It is a stand alone building beside the pool, so you have to walk outside the hotel to get to it.I needed to stay one night at this place.  I actually used my Hilton points and didn't think I was going to get a good room because I've done this before and usually give me the crappiest room.  Not here! This place was super clean, the staff was nice, breakfast in the morning and the bed was sooo comfortable.  Thank you!!!Great property! Welcoming lobby open feelings. front desk staff friendly and offered great information for local restaurants &amp; very pet friendly! Soft goods very fresh &amp; love room. Also great value.It was clean, nice, and close to everything.  What else is there to say?  They all look the same when you're sleeping.There's nothing better than settling into a clean, spacious and quiet room after a long drive from another state. My husband and I stay exclusively at hampton inns for the reward points. This particular location is one of the nicest hampton inns we've stayed in? I have zero complaints about this location and will definitely be staying here again when we drive through Jacksonville!I stay at this Hampton Inn regularly because it is convenient for business, has an excellent free breakfast and is close to restaurants.  It's always consistent and ALWAYS clean.  The cleanliness and neatness of this hotel is always a WOW for me.New and nice.  Outside firepit is a first for me at Hampton propertiesFirst impression was great.   Special recognition with a special diamond member parking spot.  Very friendly person  at front desk.  Room was upgraded to one that wasn't much of an upgrade but it was clean.  All went down hill from there.  Bed was too soft, bright  light was shining in window all night.  And the chaotic unorganized scene at breakfast was unreal.   The food was limited and what was there looked like it had been sitting for hours.   There was a guy that was handing out plastic forks and spoons with his bare hands from a box. Coffee was bad, oatmeal was cold and hard, fruit was mushy and bread was stale.   Basically it was a cluster and no one seemed to care.Clean rooms, good breakfast, free parking, lots of restaurants, good area, and free wifi. We stayed 2 nights and it was great. We hung out at Trio (right behind the hotel) and caught a movie at Tinseltown which is in walking distance.Very nice suites and great waffles!We are regular Hampton Inn guests and found this to be one of the best ones.  Very pleased with accommodations and staff.I haven't stayed in a Hampton Inn in many years but was very pleased that it wasn't the old Hampton Inn. This was the hotel recommended by the conference I attended.  I was reluctant at first but figured that if it was good enough for 30 CIOs it was worth a try.  My review - I'd stay there again if I was in the area.This place is new and clean.  The front desk was so friendly when I checked in they make you forget the 4 plus hour plane ride to get here. The room was clean large and had everything you'd want. Ok it isn't the Hilton or the Four seasons but for a 'budget' class hotel it didn't feel like a budget hotel.  The comforter was the jumbo style in the better class hotel.  The bathroom was large with granite counter.  The tub/shower was clean and large.  The only small knock was the toilet was tucked in to the wall which had an odd sense but only esthetically. There are tons of restaurants near by and it was close to the conference at Florida Community College, which is another story.",,,,,"['beautiful', 'property', 'everything', 'everyone', 'pleasant',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-jacksonville-orange-park-orange-park,Courtyard Jacksonville Orange Park,3.5,$$,15,"I'm surprised this place has less than okay reviews.  I have stayed in many hotels in this area and I can honestly say this is so far the best one I've stayed in.  Pros:Rooms are clean and pleasing to the eye.Pool is nice.I love that they have a bar and a coffee shop in the lobby.The staff was helpful. Cons:There was one issue in my room where I went to get a cup for water.  The cups were wrapped but when I opened the wrapping, the cup was dirty on the inside.  Wish there was a better way to get inside from the back parking lot.great hotel chain that provides quality, consistent service. This hotel doesn't deviate from the norm. They've replaced the furniture and carpet and we really enjoyed our stay. Will be back again!Had a nice overnight say here.  Booked the room on the app and was able to check in on the app ( very cool by the way).  Once I got to the hotel all I had to do was pick up my keys and that was it.  The room was ready and very nice.  The room was very large with a desk and recliner.  Since I was trying to be romantic, I booked a room with a whirlpool.  It was a nice size and could fit two comfortably.  The room as had a shower separate that could fit two as well.  As always a very comfortable bed with four very fluffy pillows!  So if you are trying to be romantic and live in the Jacksonville area check out the Courtyard By Marriot on Wells road.Very clean, very nice staff, nice inside and out. Probably one of the nicest (if not the nicest) Courtyard's I've stayed. Additionally, they have a nice bar and grille which helps when you've flown all day and don't want to leave.Nice hotel, not too far from downtown. A bit of a ride to the beach but not bad. Will definitely stay again when I visit JacksonvilleThis Courtyard is okay.  My room was clean, and everything worked.  It's been renovated, so the furnishings are stylish.  However, there were a few misses:First off, I reserved a roll-away bed (checked a box during my on-line reservation).  Then, I called at 1:00 pm the day of arrival and asked for a roll-away bed.  When we arrived that evening, there was no roll-away bed, and the front desk knew nothing of my requests.  Why do they have a check-box on the reservation?  (The staff quickly found us a roll-away, which was good, but I don't like to rely on luck at 9:30 pm.)This Courtyard does not have a ""Bistro"" in the lobby (which I really like).  Nor did it have the old-school, sit-down breakfast that all Courtyards used to have.  Instead, it had this $10/head buffet.  It was essentially the same food I'd get at a Hampton or Fairfield for free, with the addition of an omelet cook.  To make matters worse, they were OUT of most of the food!  Out of bacon, out of sausage, out of eggs.  They made more, but the whole place was waiting for it, so 15 minutes later, as soon as it came out, it was instantly gone again.For a hotel that says that they are environmentally-minded and trying to do their part - by not washing towels every day - it would be great if they added some vegan options to the menus. Products without meat or dairy take significantly less resources to produce and are becoming increasingly popular as people learn of the devastating consequences animal ag has on our planet. Eating plant-based foods has a much larger impact than taking shorter showers or not washing towels daily. My friends and I would have appreciated some items other than oatmeal on the menu to enjoy. Other than that, the room was clean and I appreciated that we were offered the option of a down-free room. I also loved having a fridge and microwave in the room, since we ended up having to go buy all of our own food.This hotel was pretty good, stayed one night for business.  Room was clean, had a balcony. There are some train tracks nearby. If your not a light sleeper its fine. There were some stains on the wallpaper which was creepy but it should be replaced. Overall great stay. I will be back. There is a bar and food for your convenience.Very comfortable clean rooms. Would give at least a 4 for room including the good location but the staff just seemed a little slow. room key would not work for me two times and had to go down to reception to fix.  Bar was too lit up and they charged fancy hotel prices for drinks instead of what the rate should have been.  This is a nice place that with a little work really should be a 4.  Will go back there next time as well and if better will upgrade this rate.I stayed here for one night while in town for a wedding. Overall, this is a good (not great) Courtyard.The staff is very friendly, however I stood at the front desk for close to 10 minutes before anybody from the back noticed I was there. The breakfast was good, but it's not free; I'd rather go to the Cracker Barrel down the street than eat there again. The free coffee in the lobby is a nice perk though.Our room had a strange layout, but it worked. The TVs have a huge number of channels -- basically full digital cable, as our TV had a Comcast cable box. There was an armoire (not a closet) in our room, and the doors were very creaky and didn't shut securely. Still, the room was clean and let in lots of light.Overall, this is not the best Courtyard I've stayed in, but the price was decent and the place was clean.Very nice Courtyard by Marriott that is new, clean and fantastic for a visit to this area. The have a nice breakfast area, laundry, workout room, very clean pool and hot tub, and plenty of parking.The rooms are very nicely decorated and absolutely no problems here.We were with a USTA tennis tournament and the group booked here. The staff even let us check out really late and we were grateful for that.Would have appreciated a call from this place to let me know I had not completed my reservation online even though I got a confirmation email!From an Event Coordinator's Perspective: My company was holding an event here, which was an event we have around 15-20 times a month across the nation. I can say this is the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. PROS: The sleeping rooms are comfortable. CONS: * Staff is incredibly unprofessional. Our contract, which was signed by me, stated we had the room from 8am till 5:30 on both days. They had a different version of the contract or incorrect BEOs that weren't signed by me, and it stated we had the room until 5pm. The room wasn't ready until 9am and a woman, who is apparently a ""manager"" named Kim, walked into our room twice to kick us out. In front of all of our attendees, was asking if we were almost done. So unprofessional! Upon talking to Kim to discuss this (I was at our home office), she displayed a very tacky and incredibly horrible attitude and literally said, mid-sentence ""I'm gonna have to cut you off right now..."" and at the end of the call ""You need to communicate better. Now I need to serve these other people so I'm going to go now"" and literally hung up immediately after saying that. Worst customer service ever. * The contract took over a month to obtain (that should have been a major red flag)* All of our A/V needs, which were outlined on the contract were not setup/orderedIt gets even better. At a hotel next door, the staff there knew how terrible the service was at this hotel. They have a reputation in the area, people. Do not come here, it's not worth it. If anything goes wrong, I'd rather be at a place where the staff will be helpful, understanding, courteous, and professional. I would hate for anyone to come here and have something go wrong and have to deal with these people.My brother got married (yay for him!) and this is the hotel the couple had set aside for their wedding guests.  Coming all the way from Ohio we were looking forward to a very nice place to crash for four days.  And for the most part we were quite satisfied.I've learned when staying at hotels that how the exterior looks is a pretty good indicator as to what the rest of the experience is going to be like.  When we arrived I noticed that the parking lot was quite clean and the landscaping well done.  No rundown look here so that was a plus.  Check in was very simple, very quick and the staff was most accommodating and patient.  I use the word ""patient"" because there were two other wedding parties at this hotel along with my brother's and when we walked through the door the lobby was packed with guests in various stages of check-in.  Even with that, it took us less than ten minutes to check in, and most of that time was because I ran into my parents at the front desk and we talked a lot while the staff was trying to check us in.We had a King Suite and the room was beautiful.  Very clean, very comfortable.  Even though it was a chain hotel it still had a nice homey feeling to it.  Plenty of space for me, the wife, the kiddies, and the various family and friends that dropped in to visit.  The lobby was nice and spacious, with two computer terminals for those needing free access to the internet. The only real downside was that the pool area didn't really have a lot of space to lounge.  Plus the water was uber-cold.  In fairness though that made the whirlpool there that much more enjoyable.  The other downside would be the breakfast that's offered in the morning.  It's not complimentary and the price you're paying for what you're getting is so not worth the cost.  Also, there was just one cook working the omelet station which meant a very long wait for our eggs.  I would have thought that the staff would have brought in another cook knowing how busy they were going to be.All-in-all a pretty nice hotel.  What they do right more than makes up for what they do wrong.  Although I don't see myself back in the Jacksonville area any time soon, this would be the place I would stay if I were ever to return.Mahalo, and enjoy.Good, clean, convenient, full buffet breakfast for around $10 (with tip) per person. Bar open at night until around 9ish. Free Wi-Fi and free guest parking. Staff was friendly and helpful. Several good restaurants withing 5 - 10 minutes drive from property.Only issue I had was with the TV. I had to unplug and plug back in to get it to work each time I turned it on, but the hotel now knows about it and this wasn't a big deal once I figured out how to work around it.",,,,,"['surprised',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-points-by-sheraton-jacksonville-baymeadows-jacksonville,Four Points by Sheraton Jacksonville Baymeadows,3.5,$$,15,"This was a clean hotel and the rooms were modern. The bed has a down comforter and nice pillows but it is hard. The rooms was very quiet which is such a nice thing.There is a thermostat and that is always a nice feature and the rooms are very clean. There was a refrigerator but no microwave. A small coffeemaker and paper cups the coffee goes right into. Breakfast of any kind is NOT included. The continental type breakfast that almost all hotels offer was $5.00 and a more generous hot meal was $8.00. You can get fresh made coffee downstairs included in the price although I am not sure if you had to get it to go.Stayed a single night on a holiday weekend here passing through town. Newly built or redesigned not sure, we found a good room for under a $100. Location is handy for breakfast with an iHop and Dunkin Donuts nearby. Plenty of parking is available on site and it's close to I95. The front desk folks were pleasant and had us checked in quickly. Our third floor room was clean and temperature wise pleasantly cool. My bed though had a sneaky old metal spring mattress but was still comfy to sleep in. One of the two complimentary water bottles provided had been opened!? Biggest gripe was the sliding bathroom door than even when closed had a significant gap affording the occupant little privacy.Great hotel for the price.  I rezzie'd through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, and with that I paid less than three digits per night. LESS THAN THREE DIDGES!!! **Church** (That was me speaking like the druggie dudes on Breaking Bad.  I'm a poser.  I'm from the suburbs of Orange County, CA.  I need to sit down before I hurt myself.)Seriously, great price, great value.  The place was clean, the room was quiet.  The staff was friendly.  The wake up calls did their J.O.B.Couple points to make your stay even better:1.) Park around back.  The staff will tell you ""You can park up front or around back, by the pool.  Choose around back.  It's usually empty because all the other knuckleheads park up front, so you'll be golden.2.) Breakfast is not bad...pretty standard ""made by a worker, not a chef"" type of food.  There's a Duncan Donuts in the parking lot, if you want a little bit better coffee.3.) Third floor does NOT have an ice machine/soda machine area.  How do I know this?  1:00 AM, I'm rummaging around the floor like I'm a ghost trying to haunt the place, looking for some ice.  Nope.  You want ice?  2nd or 4th floor, baby.  They got the goods.4.) WIFI It's not really written anywhere how to get to the hotel wifi.  Why?  Because apparently any bonehead (except this bonehead) can figure it out easily enough. Turn on your frickin' laptop and look for the floor you're on under the WIFI list. Click on it and VOILA.  (No...I spend 15 mins trying to figure it out, then call down to the front desk like my grandma would do.)Anyway....this hotel is great.  Enjoy.You can hardly go wrong with staying at this place... It is somewhat reasonable affordable, clean, great lounge area with a bar, breakfast is pretty good &amp; the staff is wonderful.The room was very impressive &amp; clean.  What i like the best is the members have their own floor and a late check out (4pm) which is an excellent perk!!! I will return again at this location!!!I haven't stayed at a Sheraton in about a year.. And in Jacksonville, I had to stay at one for one last night to close out my vacation comfortably. When we arrived and walked in, the aroma was relaxing and I couldn't describe it. It was nice just standing there and checking in. We took our elevator to the second floor and when we stepped out... All we could smell even stronger was cleaning fluids.. 180 degree turn and it didn't make sense. It was about 4pm so I expected them to fix up the rooms and smell by then. Even later in the night, the smell was still there so I just assumed someone puked in the hallway the night before and that's how they were converging up the smell. When we went into the room, it was nice and of course the first thing I do is take a dump. I banged my knee pretty hard on the toilet paper holding thing cuz it was so close (and because I have long legs) and it pissed me off. But the bathroom was also nice and the sliding door was cool. I was concerned the smell might leave the bathroom since it didn't close fully, however, it didn't which was cool (thank god)!I laid down on the sofa in the corner, used their semi slow internet to get caught up on a weeks worth of emails and spent a few minutes on Hulu before a headache kicked in telling me I need to sleep and it was only 5pm. I laid down on the bed and I sunk right in comfortably. I still get annoyed on how well the comforter is tucked in but I was too tired to care and fell asleep. The pillow was a little soft for me, still better than a Holiday Inn, but the bed was too comfortable for me to care. I woke up a few hours later since humans are technically animals and we all know how they sound when devouring food in front of a TV.. And then fell back asleep again. The next morning I woke up since it was bright and they didn't have drapes that covered the windows, only light curtains which was nice at night, but annoying in the morning with the sun rise. As I went down to breakfast, which they gave us for free as we had to pay $10 per person, I was excited. The first thing I took was some delicious milk which apparently went bad and I talked it after 3 thirsting gulps and I've kind felt sick all day and had weird has (-3 stars). The strudel was delicious and I took 2 more and then headed out back home, the end. I expected better from Sheraton when it comes to breakfast to avoid getting sick, especially if I am a weary traveler.Very disappointed !  Not clean and very dated. Will not be staying at an 4 Points again.Duplicitous checkin and charge process has alienated me for life. Charging $80 for incidentals and to a debit card at that!It's like a hotel inception. Four Points within Sheraton within Starwood.Seems like a decent location - not in the heart of the city but not far from the interstate. There's plenty of parking and the front desk was beyond accommodating when I arrived. Free breakfast was included with my room stay and there's also 24/7 free wifi. My room is spacious yet minimalist with a limited color palette of berries, browns and cream. There's a big bathroom, a work desk, a flat-screen HD TV and a couple of comfy queen beds - perfect for a weary business traveler. They have a wine &amp; beer bar in the lobby, a fitness area and an outdoor pool. I'm glad Starwood is making more hip, affordable places to stay, similar to their Aloft chain. :)I have stayed here twice and both visits were quite enjoyable. It is always very clean, and well kept.  The rooms are clean. They have a pool and a quality, clean gym. The staff is warm and friendly and checkin was a breeze.The room was clean and nice for the price. The bathrooms were oddly not very private with the door being on a rack that you can see right from the room into the bathroom. I mean I guess you probably won't have anyone in your room that you need to hide from but still an odd design choice. Overall I was very pleased with my stay.The rooms are nice and very clean, but I'm not a fan of having no drawers for storage. I really like that the gym and pool are open 24-7.   The cleaning staff are quick and efficient.Recently stayed here and I was blown away by this hotel.  My coworker and I got in late and our group had already left for dinner by the time we arrived.  When asking the receptionist for suggestions for a good bite and drink she suggested that she would drop us off and pick us up from Stonewood's which is not in walking distance.  After we hesitated for a bit and saw that the only other option was to go to MC'D's we said what the heck sure.  She used her own car, would not let us tip her and did it all with a smile.The rooms were swanky and the bed was so comfy I almost couldnt get up.  No fear the sweet receptionist called me and reminded me that my group was about to depart for the meeting.  Great hotel, not much to do around here but if you are visiting NAPCO, STAY HERE!!!!!Very attractive and clean hotel. Rooms were nice and comfortable. Lots of storage areas and hooks for hanging jackets, towels etc. Only complaint is that the rooms aren't very sound proof. You can hear people in the hallway and rooms above/around you. The bathroom doors are on tracks that slide instead of swing. This makes privacy a bit of an issue and they are loud when being closed. Overall very nice, well priced room. Easy access from 95 and decent restaurant options close by.We had a great stay here over the weekend of 3/19/2010.  The hotel was clean, very accommodating, allowed us an early check in and late check out.  The room was spacious and came equipped with Seattle's best coffee &amp; Tazo teas as well as complimentary water.  Everyone on the staff was extremely courteous and professional but also very relaxed.  We're fans and for the price considered the stay a bargain.Stayed there this past weekend.  Good overall.  This largely seems to be a business-traveler hotel.  On the weekend, there are few guests and very little help, although if they really work with a skeleton crew on the weekends, they hide it pretty well.  Apart from housekeeping and the morning kitchen staff (usually just one server and one chef), there was usually just the one front desk person running the entire show.  The front desk person also seems to run the beer/wine bar during the weekend evenings as well.  All in all though the service wasn't lacking despite the small staff.  We loved our breakfast server Tatiana; she's very nice and personable.The breakfast menu is really just the buffet ($8.00) or what amounts to just parts of the buffet (pricing less than $8.00).  Food was pretty good although it's the standard fare (cereal (hot and cold), toast, bagels, danishes, potatos, sausage, bacon, yogurt, limited fruit selection (mostly melon), and scrambled eggs (omelets were sometimes available, sometimes not).The room was very nice and comfortable and very modern, as was the decor everywhere (very much like a mini ""W"" hotel).  Only gripe about the room was the bathroom door was a sliding panel that was very noisy...you'll wake up your other half in the middle of the night with it.The hotel can get busy on weekends though if there's a meeting or something.  This weekend it looked like some sort of high school graduation party.  The downside is that it can get rowdy.  At 2am, guests of the party were taking the stairs to the roof (I'm assuming to either drink or smoke a little weed) and we were on the top (4th) floor so we were awakened by them.  However I called the front desk and they took care of that ASAP.  While they have security cameras in many places (you can see the monitor at the front desk), the roof isn't one of them.  I'm also a little surprised that the door to the rooftop was not locked to begin with (or maybe that's a fire code issue?).The bar area in the lobby is nice but it can get noisy.  Sometimes small groups of locals will gather over wine, etc. but the open design means that the noise isn't suppressed well.  For that reason, try not to get a first-floor room.  I would also say that our room's door didn't do that great of a job filtering out hallway noise.Free wireless worked great though (good speed and availability in lobby and in our room).  Pool was also nice but no jacuzzi.  Standard/basic hotel workout room is available too.Not perfect but a good value and good service overall.  I'd stay there again.",,,,,"['clean', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'modern', 'bed', 'comforter', 'nice', 'pillows', 'hard', 'rooms', 'quiet', 'nice', 'thing', 'thermostat', 'always', 'nice', 'feature', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/candlewood-suites-jacksonville-jacksonville,Candlewood Suites Jacksonville,4.5,$$,15,"I stayed at this hotel when I first arrived in Jacksonville, the place really stood out for the hospitality. I loved the laundry facilities they had there. I was able to go and stay there with my medium size dog Harley. It was really a good size room and they had a kitchen. If you're moving to the area I mean it was really good price longer term stay type hotel. In my room there was no smell of smoke at all. That right there is really important to me because I am allergic to it and if I stay in a room with the slightest smell of smoke. I will have head congestion and be feeling sick all the next day. I would definitely recommend this to any family trying to move in the area.Nice hotel, it looked bleah outside and lobby, and i was surprised when i walked into the room.  It was bigger than I thought and pretty.  the kitchen was pretty big - if you want to cook, this is the place.wanted to go to the dog park next to the hotel but didnt get to.friendly staff - they were very helpful with info around the town.I have stayed here several times while on business trips. I like the location, rooms are simple but clean and well supplied with most of what you need. Cost is very reasonable. The staff is really great and the place is generally comfortable and quiet. The free laundry is nice too, if you need it. My single gripe is with the Wifi. It is provided for free but is really pretty slow most of the time. On business trips, this can be a real hassle. Overall a good deal however.First let me say that this hotel is in a great location. It's perfectly situated between southside Jacksonville and downtown. It's right off I95 and US1 and is very easy to get to. This hotel is very nice. The front desk staff are helpful and courteous. The rooms are clean, comfortable and very contemporary looking. The only thing you need to be aware of is that all of the rooms here have only one bed. Since I travel with a group of 8 people, that's our only issue because we have to get double the amount of rooms. Otherwise this hotel is pretty sweet place.This is an extended stay hotel, but we only stayed a night because the rates were still cheaper than most of the surrounding hotels, and you got a full kitchen with it to boot.  The room was gorgeous, the fitness center, laundry and pantry room were all conveniently located and well appointed, and the staff was very friendly.  My only complaint was that the floors seem to be a little thin or maybe we just had loud neighbors, because it sounded like the person above us was walking on their heels the whole time.  Didn't really hear anyone on either side of us, just some yahoos in the hallway at 2am.  Otherwise it was very quiet and I will probably be staying here again when visiting Jacksonville.Great place.  I little odd in that the building doesn't have the obligatory covered drive-up/unloading area  that most hotels do.  But checkin was a breeze, had a great conversation with the clerk about travel in general, and Grand Canyon in particular.  The room was crisp and clean.  I love how this place has a kitchen, though I didn't use it.I checked out early and without warning and the front desk handled it quickly and professionally.I'll be back!The room was very clean . It was a decent price and the beds were not horrible for a hotel it have slept on way worse. There was absolutely no bugs and plenty of full size towels. Would definitely stay there again . The only thing is we were not there for long so we did not really get to see the gym or laundry facility because we only stayed one night. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Although newly remodeled, with nice appliances, bathrooms and decor....I was greeted with a dead roach upon entering my room. Also, I noticed my nightstand to be sticky and with unwanted hair on it. Furthermore, there was this musty odor in the hallways that almost made me sick. The smell reminded me of an elderly nursing home. Apparently, this is an extended stay type of hotel. For some reason, there isn't someone at the front desk 24/7 like in conventional hotels. There's a sign on the desk with a phone instructing to dial ""0"" for assistance for after hours. 6pm is after hours for them. It gave me an eerie feeling. I wouldn't stay there again!!Definitely recommended. Nice folks. Dog friendly with a grassy area for walking pets (although I was afraid an alligator might pop out at any moment). They have a gym and an honor-system mini convenience store. Nice.Hard not to give it anything but a 5. I've never been to or even hear of candlewood suites before so I figured what the heck for the price. So glad I chose to stay here. Me and the fiance loved it. For the price there IS NO BETTER hotel out there. Set up as studios it virtually gives you the option to have a much more affordable vacation in the sense you can stay in and cook with the provided stove, fridge, and microwave. Clean room and arrived in town at about 2 am and they have mini safes that have your key in it so you can just put in the safe code and go. Comes with a laundry room for those on a business trip staying for longer. Just a 5 star expierence and hotel.spotless. comfortable. nice decor. renovated.The rates are awesome! It is a clean hotel, very nice. I was kind of sad when I found out it didn't have a pool, but it does have a gym. The pillows are so comfy!!! I have had two complaints though... The refrigerator makes popping noises every few minutes, it got on our nerves so bad that my boyfriend unplugged it. The front desk said they replaced quite a few, and offered for us to move to another room. We were already settled in and declined, it wasn't that big of a deal. The second issue... there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, let's just say ewwwww if you share your room with someone. (I love my boyfriend, but I don't want to smell him) I would definitely stay in another Candlewood Suite despite the minor issues we had!Staff nice, but room was very dated and worn.   80's era decor.  ""Old"" smell in lobby and room.The front desk was very helpful, a very quite peaceful place...I stayed here in January and was very pleasantly surprised with how nice this hotel is appointed.  They are in the midst of refurbishing this property.  You have a bedroom, separate sitting area, full kitchen, full size refrigerator and quartz or granite counters in the kitchen and bath.  The recliner looked ""tired"", but the front desk said they will be replaced as soon as they are shipped.  Quiet location.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-jacksonville-butler-blvd-jacksonville,La Quinta Inn & Suites Jacksonville Butler Blvd,3.5,$$,19,"This is our third night on the road. This La Quita is well run, spotless, and very pet friendly. There is a small lake area with benches and poop bags.We were surprised at the value, quality and view out our 5th floor window. Our room is basically a suite with wifi, desk space and, most of all, a comfortable king bed. We had a list of restaurants to explore but since our suite is so relaxing, we are ordering in. It feels like home.Not impressed.  Maybe I'm a little pickier than others as far as this brand is concerned (used to work for them).This inn, like several others in the chain, is dated, poorly maintained, over-priced.Being picky, here's just a few things that need attention:  elevators dirty, ""creekly"", noisy, undependable.  Painted surfaces on doors and other areas, chipped, dirty.  Walls and other ""nooks &amp; crannys"" covered by outside vendor's menus and flyers.  Dumpster area, dirty, littered, noisy from machinery and a generator?  Road noise, construction noise...not the inn's fault, but it would have been nice to be given a choice of room location.   Morning breakfast was ok.  I have a problem with juice pitchers that are left uncapped for public use (picture guests picking up the pitcher, sneezes, loose hair, assorted hands touching everywhere...ewww!  Fresh fruit and fruit salad were a nice touch, along with cereal, bagels, muffins, make-ur-own waffles.Our room, clean &amp; dirty...mostly clean, but the fridge and tv area were not.  Rug needs shampoo'd.  The bedside alarm clock digital readout did not work.  The lighting for the room was plentiful but not easily managed (hard to explain, but the way switches and lamps are setup, made it odd).The heating/cooling was hit and miss...mostly had to manage it manually to be comfortable.The furniture, while sort of adequate, really needs the addition of a chair and table.  As is, the desk serves as a table and desk with only an uncomfortable desk chair.  There is an old, bulky, hard to use leather recliner...yuk.  Asked front desk agent for an extra, regular chair.  She was not very friendly about getting one and sounded like it was going to be a hassle to get it.Housekeepers were terrific.  Since we were DND our entire stay, we just swapped dirty towels for clean every day.  They were great about doing this and supplying refills of paper products, taking our trash, etc.At this price, I expect better.  On to Marriot next time.I don't understand why this hotel doesn't have a better rating on Yelp. Everything about my experience was first rate. Jeremy, at the front desk, was genuine, efficient and sincerely working to please not only me but each and every guest I observed him with.We stayed last evening and it was great. The room was very clean. The rate was superb.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  We drove thru NC, SC and GA before settling into Jacksonville.  My husband loved the waffle breakfast!  We will stay again!Made our little family's stay in Jacksonville SO much better! Excellent service, polite, and pet friendly!Spending time with family visiting from out of town. Suggested they stay at the La Quinta - Butler Blvd &amp; Lenoir Ave,  because it is easy to get to and very centrally located, with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby.  Also pet-friendly and has free breakfasts, which would make anyone very happy. The hotel is clean, the clerk, Jeremy was polite, friendly and very helpful. Best experience at a hotel in a long time.The room was clean, the WIFI worked and the TV in the room had a menu to navigate channels (comes in handy when you are in an unfamiliar city).  The morning breakfast was very basic, but the food seemed fresh.  The only drawback I found was in the fitness center.  The two treadmills were in need of maintenance and the TV in the fitness center would loose the picture after a few minutes.My family and I have stayed at this la quinta for 2 weeks. We just moved to Jacksonville and our rental home is not ready yet. We originally checked into the orange park location, but we're not happy with that location.  So we checked out there and checked in to this location on Butler Blvd.  Staff is extremely frienfly. Hotel is clean. Breakfast is a plus. I have 2 large dogs with me and la quinta has the best pet policy. No breed restrictions and no pet fee. Because of this we always stay at la Quinta hotels.  We've really enjoyed our 2 week stay here.Had a bad experience with a staff member, who was very rude to my dear friend who is 7 months pregnant! She needed to use the restroom, but the employee on staff did not allow her to because she was not a guest. Employees need to be better screened on having common sense, respect, and courtesy.I have been to La Quinta Inn &amp; Suites before and I have had pleasant experiences, and terrible ones. Unfortunately, I have endured a terrible experience at this La Quinta location. The staff here is very friendly in person, and over the phone, but they are not helpful at all. The member at the front desk was happy to inform us that we were getting a room that was newly renovated, which was nice to hear. Once we got into the room, we had nice carpets, a nice bed, and tv. The bathrooms were not renovated, and the tiling was very old, our bathroom was missing doorknobs Painting in this room was also incomplete. During our stay we had to leave our room so they could install new curtains. (They couldn't do this when we left?) Also, our room was cleaned once, and we had stayed here for over a week. We had put in requests to have our room cleaned 3 times, and it had never happened. During a room cleaning, your supplies are replenished. Since our rooms were never cleaned, we had to request new towels, toiletries, and sheets from the front desk nearly everyday. One positive thing about this location is that it is pet friendly, and they are always happy to have pets in their locations. We stayed here because we were moving and needed a hotel where we could have our dog until we found a home. Hopefully by the time anyone else chooses to stay here, the renovations will be complete, and they will have at least one person here to service rooms full-time.Very disappointing.First problem - the phone didn't work. When the repairman came, we also asked about the air (room was very warm).  He checked a few things, and said it was now fixed. We travelled with a baby.  her knees were black from crawling on the carpet.  When I came back from the hospital, I went for a cup of coffee.  The site ""Hotels near St. Vincent"" said it was always available. No coffee- only in the am.  When I went to the room it was still warm. When I complained, the front hostess simply turned the thermostat down to 62.  I expect to freeze tonight. Her comment was ""well, what did you want me to do?""  I expected to get a clean, comfortable room.  Silly me!This hotel has always left us with a great experience. I don't care to stay anywhere else in Jacksonville. Clean, tasteful, and friendly.Excellent location and beautifully kept facility at a fantastic price!   Before we arrived, we had three different contacts here with the front desk.  Haley could not have been more helpful, and when we arrived she continued to make our stay as delightful as possible.    The staff welcomes guests as family into their own home!   Staying an en extra night this trip, and will definitely return I the future.Worn and tired hotel. My room is spacious but it smells like wet dog and the chair smells like urine. I am too tired to request a new room. I will try Motel 6 next time. UPDATE: The guests next door came back and showed the paper-thin nature of the connecting door. They are loud and I can't fall asleep. This place sucks for sure. I called the front desk to get a new room.UPDATE #2: The new room smells of new paint. I called the front desk to ask if it has been painted (now I see the painter's tape on the back of the room door) and the desk has no records of what has been painted recently. After 10 minutes and the start of a headache, I ask for yet another room.UPDATE #3: I check the next room and it all looks good. Finally! I unpack and yet when I go to the bathroom, there is fecal matter in the loo. Wow, they don't even bother to flush!? That's it. Three strikes you are out.In the end, I called <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> to demand a refund. I left and headed for the nearby Best Western. It ended up being cheaper and the room was much, much better. This was my first visit to a La Quinta hotel and most certainly my last.I wish you could give zero stars.In town on business, we stayed at LaQuinta because the company uses this hotel to host overnight visitors. We were greeted by a friendly staffer and quickly settled into our spacious room. It was everything we needed and was as clean as we expected it should be. From our fourth floor window we could see peeps enjoying the hot tub and pool, and although we did not partake, they seemed to be having fun. The bed was comfortable - firmer than at other hotels we've been to recently - and we awoke well-rested. After I take my shower we will head downstairs for a quick breakfast then we'll be off. :-)Clean room for a good price. Nice Staff and fairly quiet. Moved here after a disastrous stay at another hotel in the area. Very relieved to have a better experience here.We needed a cheap place to crash in Jacksonville while down there meeting up with some family.  My only condition was that the place was clean and had a nice pool.  This place really exceeded our expectations, and we paid under $150 for 2 nights.  The rooms were great - pretty much your standard hotel room, but had a mini fridge and microwave in addition to the coffee maker.  No balcony, but had windows which opened which was nice.  Huge sigh of relief when I saw the spotlessly clean bathroom.  Comfy bed with nice crisp clean sheets.  Decor was nothing special, pretty much what you'd expect in this price range.   Smallish TV, came with HBO. The pool was great!  Very clean, not too chemical-ly, and we had it to ourselves most of the stay.  Also had a hot tub, but it was about 90 degrees outside for our entire stay, so stuck to the pool.  Spent a few hours each morning swimming with our daughter down there and loved it.  The location is pretty central, but not in downtown.  About 10 minutes from downtown, 10 minutes form the beaches, 30 minutes from St. Augustine.  Safe looking neighborhood, lots of nearby restaurants/gas stations/stores, right off 95.  One great surprise was the included breakfast.  It wasn't just some danishes, but had a make-your-own-waffle station, fresh juices, bagels, yogurts, fresh fruit, cereal, tons of tea and coffee, toast, and of course danishes.  Pleasantly surprised, and would definitely return.We enjoyed our stay here. The front lobby staff was friendly and professional and checked us in without fuss or drama. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. It was in line with a moderately priced hotel. We realized the next morning that the windows opened wide and we could have had fresh air all night in our third floor room. Other hotels block their windows closed. Although we did not swim, our window looked out over the clean pool, and other people did enjoy a quick evening swim. The hotel is situated near full service restaurants and in a clean neighborhood where we did not fear that our car would be broken into. We would stay here again.Excellent stay for the price!  A very comfortable and quiet night's sleep!",,,,,"['third', 'night', 'road', 'well', 'run', 'spotless', 'pet', 'friendly', 'small', 'lake', 'area', 'benches', 'poop', 'bags', 'surprised', 'value',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-jacksonville-tapestry-park-jacksonville,Aloft Jacksonville Tapestry Park,4.0,$$,43,"Although, I work from home, our main office is located in Jacksonville, I love staying at Aloft. Their hotels are always so trendy and provide excellent customer service. They have a hip bar area down stairs called the ""WXYZ Lounge"" where you can mix your favorite drinks and relax with some conversation or watch TV from their many flat screens. They also have a pool area to shoot some pool and play several board games or plug your PC in to browse the internet. They also have a small cafe with plenty of fresh fruit and refrigerated drinks and food that you can take to their outdoor pool area or gym. Their rooms are like I mentioned before very trendy and have that loft NY feel to them. It's the perfect hotel for business or for a short stay for 2 or less. This is not a family hotel so be careful.Reasonably-priced rooms, cool decor, friendly staff and a happy hour with a pool table help make staying at this (or any) Aloft a treat. Two additional benefits of note: - Live music many nights in the XYZ lounge- A fantastic pet policy with no pet fees and a welcome amenity of a dog bed, bowls, treats and (sometimes) a ball. We've stayed in four separate Aloft properties up and down the East Coast as we make our way from MA to FL each year. If you haven't stayed at an Aloft, you're missing something whether you're traveling with or without canine companions.We had a great time. Very modern design and decor. Lovely staff. Tyler and Jorge were the best!!!!Nice location - convenient to all places we needed to go. Plenty of parking. Nice soap, shampoo, hair dryer, charging station and TV selection. Only ding....water pressure was a bit on the low side. Free Wi-Fi - love it.Stayed here a few nights last month. The staff was fabulous and always welcomed me when I walked in the door. I appreciate those small touches. Large, inviting lobby that had a great feel. This is the 4th Aloft I have had the pleasure of staying in and I would say this was my best experience. The room was large, open and the bed is so dang comfy. Many outlets which I appreciate. I really like the minimalistic vibe of the whole place as well with the addition of pops of color. Starbucks was right next door in the same complex so I walked over there for my coffee each morning. Overall a very pleasant experience and I would definitely stay again.Aloft was definitely built to be the ""poor man's W"" and I like it. The basics are there - I was surprised that the rooms don't have the traditional hotel brochures, etc. - that's good, save the planet! Reception was friendly and always willing to help. The pool was convenient as the beach's 15 miles away. Location is good, with conveniently located theater across the street, Starbucks in the parking lot, Publix a short walk away, and plenty of restaurants nearby. Courtesy of SPG, I had an omelette every morning, but on my last morning (different chef) the omelette was half the size! Disappointing :(This was my first time at an Aloft hotel, but am very familiar with the Starwood family and normally stay at Westin &amp; Sheraton. We stopped here for 1 night on our way up the east coast with my wife and 11month old and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel! The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and the room more than exceed our needs. I love the modern feel of the hotel. Instead of a ""sophisticated"" modern like the Westin is, this is more of a ""hip"" modern. I love it! Breakfast at the wxyz refuel lounge was great. Also, I really liked the surrounding area. There are plenty of dining options and it is very clean. I'm not too familiar with Jacksonville and a lot of people I know don't have very nice things to say about it, but I thought it was very nice around Tapestry Park. I will definitely be staying with Aloft again in the future!Had a great experience here for a two night stay. The staff was very friendly and knew me by name, and always made me feel welcome. I ran out of lotion in my room and they happily gave me a few more bottles without question. The XYZ bar was pretty poppin on Thursday night, a little quieter on Wednesday night. And the best part was I got 2 free beers after each night I stayed-- they offered a $5 voucher for each night you don't request housekeeping.My wife and I stayed here on a business trip on April 15th and 16th 2015. The staff at the front desk and throughout the hotel were very nice and took good care of us. The bartender was awesome. She made my drinks exactly the way liked them and we had good conversation even though the bar was pretty busy. The room was kind of small but clean and nice. The air conditioning worked good and the Internet was pretty fast. We are SPG members (Aloft is part of the Starwood Hotel Line) and as a member you get complimentary Internet, free bottled water and a few other amenities. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. We didn't eat at the take out breakfast place in the lobby  because I didn't feel like  paying $8 for a breakfast sandwich.  They do not have a restaurant on site but the hotel is very conviently located with plenty of spots to eat nearby.  See my review on Your Pie which is basically across the parking lot from the hotel. They have excellent pizza and sandwiches.  Overall our stay was nice and uneventful. I would recommend it business travelers.I've stayed at many Aloft hotels, and although I like the modern appeal they are generally a little worn down. This was not the case for this property considering it was built around 2011. It's modern, new, and situated in a simple shopping center with simple food choices. Within a few blocks is the outlet malls and a plethora of eateries. Add in the fact the the number of start points is minimal, and this hotel is a no brainer.Really enjoyed my stay here and surprisingly affordable! Pros: cool decor, spacious room, very clean, good service, nice snack bar, great parking, great nearby eateries, great Bliss brand toiletries and unlimited shampoo/conditioner and body wash!! Cons: no iron in room, no baggie to put in the ice bucketWould recommend!Stayed here in a quick Saturday rendezvous out of town with friends. First, the hotel is very cute. I mean like super cute. The lobby and all of the decor was very modern.  Check in was almost seamless, but the check in agent was a little distracted during the process. It was raining at the time of our check in, so the lobby smelled of wet dog (as the hotel does allow pets). The smell was not present upon subsequent visits, however. We received a room on the 2nd floor, with a king bed. Here we encountered a number of issues (minor and resolvable). First, we discovered hair in the bed (under the pillows, under the sheets, etc.). Second, we found that the remote did not work for the TV. I assume this is because the batteries were out or low, and this is not an issue, however I find that it's worth mentioning. Because the room was not booked in my name, my traveling partner went to the service desk to address the issue with the the cleanliness of the room. I was gathering our belongings, so I am not sure of the details of the transaction, but the staff seemed more than happy to transfer our reservation to a new room (3rd floor-King size bed). Shortly after arriving in the new room, the bartender came up to deliver us 2 $10 coupon vouchers for breakfast in efforts to acquiesce the situation. We happily took these vouchers. During our stay I only heard people in the corridor and in other rooms a couple times, being from a college town, I did not find much issue with this, but this may be a less than ideal situation for those that prefer quiet on a Saturday night. The breakfast/snack bar area had an okay variety, but most of the items were very overpriced. (I usually pay $2.88 for a red bull, here they are $4.00). Breakfast and lunch combos are available for $7-8 a pop, including a sandwich/salad, drink, and a side. The location of the hotel is pretty decent, it's a distance for everything we did food and entertainment wise. There are many food options in the area, and a couple fun spots nearby. It's a decent way away from the beach (about 15 minutes from the pier) but definitely manageable.TL;DR: Would certainly stay again if traveling in the area. Staff was very helpful.The hotel was very nice and there is a Starbucks next door. The front desk was always friendly and accommodating. I was with one other person and they only gave us one small water. We asked the housekeeping for another one though , and they gave us some more. The pillows were also very fluffy but kind of hard for us.  The room was very nice and the bathroom was modern and nicely done.  Oh and the Bliss products in the bathroom was also a very nice touch.  We enjoyed our short stay but would definitely come back again .  Oh Rachel from the concierge or reservations line was also very nice and accommodating .Very clean with friendly staff.  The bar was lively and the pool table was nice.  You can get snacks and drinks in their cafe area.  They also have a shuttle van to take you around.$99  a night is a steal for this beautiful and new hotel experience. The decor is quite modern with chic furniture. The hotel itself is pet friendly and get this...no pet fee!!! The outdoor pool is gorgeous and heated. We went swimming in the cool evening and steam was rolling off the pool. The staff was very friendly and greeted us and our dog with open arms.  :)Located in Southside of jacksonville florida, there are plenty of restaurants to visit. Unfortunately we only had 1 night here. I would definitely come back here for a few extra days. We did try two restaurants that were walking distance and both were a hit!!! (Seven bridges brewery with homemade food and your pie with homemade build your own pizzas and paninis)We had a few issues with booking, but Amelia made up for it! Thank you for making my birthday special! We had a wonderful stay at Aloft! We will definitely be back!My husband &amp; I stayed here for the weekend. It was close to restaurants, shopping plaza and the beach was 20 minutes away. The rooms were a bit smaller than other hotels but it was clean with modern furniture. They also have a lounge in the lobby where we sat and had dinner and a drink. They also offers game boards and pool table for extra entertainment. We went in the pool late Saturday night and it was not crowded. The water could use some cleaning but other than that the pool was very spacious. Checking out was easy breezy &amp; I even registered (while Mr. was packing) for the rewards program because we plan on coming back and staying there again. I highly recommend this hotel.Loved my stay here! Only two dings in the room: 1. after a long flight/day a hot shower is all you want, but the showerhead was clogged from Florida's hard water and the water streams coming out of the showerhead felt like getting hit with needles.  Needed a little CLR soak to clean up the holes.  I fixed this by running my fingernail over the holes to free them of debris and this made things so much better.  I know it's a daunting task for every room, but if someone could soak them in CLR once a month, that would help greatly.  2. the a/c unit in the room rattled a lot while running.  Pressing on the outside did nothing to deter this, so it must be on the inside.Good things/people! 1. Michael, the manager was very accommodating on my weird request of vinegar.  I had a stinky wetsuit that I had to rinse off and he gave me a bottle of vinegar, which I used and returned.  2 the front desk ladies greeted us upon returning from our daily activities every time.  3. the wxyz bar has 5-7 happy hour with $3 domestics/$4 well drinks and their well liquor is Smirnoff, bonus points!  4. beds were comfy  5. if you decline room service, which we did a few days, you get a $5 voucher for use in the bar/breakfast/break area of the hotel, extra bonus points!  6. Michael also granted my request for extra towels on my scuba diving days as well. 7. free parking  8. Starbucks is literally in their parking lot!Although I appreciate some what of a response from management, I am in process of taking legal action in order to retrieve the fee I was improperly charged. I'll let my attorney handle this matter in hopes this never happens to another customer that stay at the Aloft Hotel. I have yet to see these photos I have requested on several occasions, I don't believe they exist. To all customers reading this review, please Do Not waste your time or money with this company. They are crooks who take advantage of travelers like myself. I will never do business with this company ever again!!!We've stayed at Alofts in Charlotte and Tallahassee and always had great experiences so when we were booked here by Sheraton , due to no availability at their place, I had no qualms. Unfortunately this was a different deal. First of all, the room smelled like someone forgot to flush the toilet. I was told during check-in that they were at full capacity so I knew there were no other rooms available. So we cranked the AC down to try to stifle the smell. It was worse early in the mornings. The first morning it was so bad that we both woke up with headaches. We decided to get up and get out for some fresh air so we left our room early. We returned around 2:30 in the afternoon in order to get ready for a wedding and to our surprise our room had not been cleaned. I called and inquired and was told that they were really busy. I told them we would be leaving at 5:00 for a wedding and requested that our room be serviced and I was told that housekeeping leaves at 5:00. So no clean room. And still stinky (we propped the door open to get some fresher air in).  To add insult to injury when we checked out we were charged more for our first night ($27 more) than the rate I was quoted when Sheraton booked the room. The front desk wouldn't correct it, saying I would have to take it up with Amanda, the Director of Rooms. Of course Amanda, Director of Rooms was not there and wouldn't be back for 2 days. I wouldn't stay in this place again if they paid me. The only reason for 1 star is the awesome service we received at the Wxyz bar.Enjoyed a great stay at the Aloft hotel....always wanted to stay at one of these hotel chains, but thought they'd be outta my price range. Turns out the rooms were 130.00 a night but they give a great Gov't rate discount for 83.00 a night!!! You will not stay at a better hotel for that price. Rooms are excellent featuring curtain California closets, walk in glass door shower, bed is the most comfortable you will find...I literally sink into the mattress! Curtains close all the way down so no sunlight when you want to sleep late!! They have a bar, heated pool, great gym with treadmills, bikes and dumbells. The lobby has a lounge that is used as an extension of your room, free USA today paper...snacks and drinks available 24 hours a day, mini fridge and iron in all the rooms, no traffic noise, pet friendly-without the noise of barking dogs! Excellent relaxing stay! Book early though as they fill up fast during the week with all the traveling business representatives frequently staying here. They are located right next to several restaurants, bars, and a movie theater! 5 STAR HOTEL in my opinion!","I stayed at Aloft based on a recommendation from a coworker. However, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. While quite trendy I think that you would want to stay at an establishment that would call you back when you feel that you might have left something behind. I lost two beautiful necklaces during my stay at Aloft and when I called I was put on hold for a long time and all the front desk did was leave a note for the housekeeper. The housekeeper never called me back. This made me feel unimportant and that is poor customer service.i stayed at this hotel for two nights recently for a business trip and really enjoyed my stay. the staff is great and really helpful. they already knew me by name on the second day. there's complimentary shuttle service that takes you anywhere within a 5 mile radius. my office was close enough so i was shuttled to and from work - you just need to reserve with them ahead of time. they didn't have my shuttle reservation the second morning (not sure what happened) so i would just double confirm anything you reserve here.my room was fine. modern and clean. comfortable bed and pillows. i love the shampoo/conditioner and body wash dispensers in the shower - so much better than those little bottles. also love the fact that they're from bliss!mitch (who worked the night i arrived) was a lifesaver. i had a nightmare situation taking the taxi from the airport to the hotel - the taxi's ancient credit card machine wasn't work and when we finally got it to start working it wouldn't take my credit card. i tried four cards before i gave up and asked the front desk for help. this was after 30 mins of ME resetting the machine with the grandpa taxi driver. mitch paid him cash and charged the amount to my room so i have record of this horrid and expensive taxi ride. i'll be taking an uber next time.p.s. there's a starbucks right next door. perfect for grabbing your morning coffee and breakfast.Nice hotel but low levels of service with regards to mechanical, heating, AC, etc. Un Uncomfortable enviornment!!!ECJReally enjoyed this location. Room was nice, clean, and pleasant. Great mattress - best sleep I've had in a long time! Staff was friendly and accommodating, even when being queried by one of my party about his room number multiple times after we came in quite late. The price was quite reasonable for the location and amenities.This was the first time I had visited this Aloft and I understand because of it's location weekend nights are quite inexspensive. By far the best $70 room I've had in years. Bed was super comfortable and room was laid out well. The hip Aloft feel prevailed and did not disappoint. If I was in the area again it would be the first place I would look to stay, having restaurants and a brew pub accross the street didn't hurt the experience eitherI visited Aloft last night (29AUG2013) for a social event at their bar.  It took me 25 minutes to get a drink.  I had ordered and then I could tell 5 minutes later that the bartender forgot my order.  The decor is awesome and is very modern.  Checked out the outdoor pool and workout room and these looked excellent.  Empanadas and Chips and Salsa were set out for appetizers.The hotel had closed down for 6 months and just re-opened.  I heard a rumor that they had black mold and had to replace the drywall.  I don't know if this rumor is true.I'll go back for a happy hour sometime at the bar but might wait 2-3 months and go on a slow night.We have stayed here during two separate trips to Jacksonville and really enjoyed it each time! We have always found the rooms to be very clean, quiet, and relaxing. Very cool and modern design. The price is perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again next time. I have also stayed in an Aloft in Colorado and found that hotel to be extremely similar in style and cleanliness as well. Overall, I would prefer to stay in an Aloft when I travel. Very good value for the money.Good location, not so great staff. Our entire stay, the lobby was crowded with private parties or children running around everywhere. On Saturday, they closed the bar early because they felt like it. The pool is small, but it's a good layout. The woman who checked us in seemed overly eager to inform us there are NO cots, NO double beds, and we would probably not be able to have any extra pillows/sheets/blankets. The hotel itself is well-designed and the room was small but functional.Can't say anything about the rooms, as I didn't stay here, but I did come to the hotel for a few days for a conference held in the hotel. Although, the person I was with had stayed in the hotel before and sent me pictures of it, so I know the rooms were nice. Everything here looks classy and modern.Staff wasn't overly helpful or friendly. I think over the multiple days I spent there, I never talked to or was greeted by anyone. The people behind the desk were usually talking to each other.Their system for ordering food, etc. was weird. I didn't realize why the kitchen was so bare or why there were stomach soothers in a modern looking display case until people started ordering them at the desk.Pool looked nice, but I never saw anyone in it.The bar and lounge area looked nice, but in the evening, the music in the bar area was very loud. Walking past it made me want to get out of there, as it wasn't conducive to relaxation or conversation.Overall good location, as you are close to shopping and a lot of restaurants.Place needs a good scrub. Floors are dingy and peeling.  The bartender was rude and on her phone both nights.  They have fantastic cocktails,  but when I pay $12 for a drink I expect at least a Hello. I love the aloft concept,  but would probably not stay at this specific property again. The hotel rate was really reasonableOkay so after one additional night, my review has changed a bit. First, the AC kicks on and off within few minute increments which is weird and especially because the AC is a little noisy so the noise, silence, noise, silence every few minutes is annoying. I had some guests check in next door to me and this is when I realized that the walls are paper thin. I have my two year old in the room with me and the people next door, went to their room, and ""got busy"" instantly! Not a hater...for I like ""getting busy"" myself. But why did I have to know they were getting busy? I could literally hear every moan, howl and ""gurgle"" they made. I had to speak over their ""gurgling"" noises because my two year old could hear them too...NOT COOL! Also, maybe it's because it's the weekend, but people don't seem to sleep in this hotel and they have late night, hallway cellphone conversations. I don't know if this was the same guest but It happened several times in the two days that I was here and it sounded like the person was talking in front of my door but I'm sure they weren't. So here it is 4am, and my neighbors are at it again. Therefore, I'm awake. Sure wish they would have put some sound proofing in these walls! I know the hall noises are not the fault of the hotel and neither is this late night rendezvous going on next door but man I wish they could find a way to make it quieter in this place.Aloft is one of my favorite travel hotels.  The lobby, bar area and rooms have a hip feel to them.  The Aloft in Tapestry Park is pretty new having opened in January 2011.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I hung out in the lobby bar after dinner making light conversation with some fellow business travelers.  Viola, the bartender, was super nice and funny. A few interesting things I noted about the bedrooms that were different from some of the other Alofts I have visited.  Room key cards had RFID chips instead of the magstripe.  And, there was a cool charging station for your mobile device.Tapestry Park was a 5 minute walk offering a variety of restaurants from steakhouses to Thai food.  Nice location.  Will be back.Beautiful, green hotel.  Room well decorated, comfortable.  Unusual but nice bathroom. In room safe.  Nicest shampoo I have ever used, wish I could have bought some.  Left my hair squeaky clean, full, and smelling great.Very comfortable bed.  Only negative is location, next to a busy road with traffic noise all night.  Must be near a hospital or fire station, because there were also sirens all night.  Very friendly, helpful staff.  Breakfast for purchase from refrigerators.  Microwave it yourself.  Did not partake of this, went to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Plenty of free parking.  Is located in a shopping center that has several excellent restaurants.  Beautiful lobby.  Pet friendly.We stopped at the Aloft for the night driving from the Florida Keys back to North Carolina. Started off as a great hotel &amp; would've given 5 stars until we were awoken at 1:00 am to a fire alarm! Turns out some idiot got mad about something &amp; pulled the fire alarm.  It took staff a good hour to figure out how to reset the system, so that meant not getting to sleep until 2:00. Fortunately the beds were super comfy &amp; check out wasn't until Noon. Breakfast was ok - nothing to write home about. Amenities were nice. Good price for this class of hotel.Cute property and concept but no insulation in the walls. I could hear EVERYONE and EVERYTHING that was going on up and down the halls of the hotel. Likely won't stay at one again for that sole purpose - it woke me up at night.Modern, chic and trendy! Not too mention their very friendly staff, and how affordable the room rates were :]Their location is right next to a shopping mall, surrounding bars, fast food chains and local restaurants!  *two thumbs up*I know the Aloft is supposed to be the essence of the W, but I was still surprised at the quality of this hotel!The rooms were set up very economically, and I really enjoyed all the green aspects of the hotel.  Among others, they had soap and shampoo dispensers in the shower, rather than passing out little bottles.  There was a ""green roof"" on part of the hotel, which looked really cool from the fifth floor looking down. The lobby was set up in a very modern manner, with plenty of places to sit and a very friendly staff.Uber friendly staff. Modern amenities and decor really Comfy bedContinental breakfast had a lot of food options for the vegetarian and meat eaters. even yogurt! Yum. temperature is controlled near the entry door, not over by the actual heater/ac unit. the shower was nice, and they supply you with the shampoo conditioner and body wash in the big push dispensers on the wall.I stayed at Aloft in Jacksonville 9-11 Sept (Sun-Tue) and glad that I did.  It was closest to my BCBSFL meeting in Tapestry Park and appeared to have a better fitness center than nearby Hotel Indigo.The hotel is ""chic modern"" -a very industrial feel with poured concrete floors and exposed ceilings (w duct work) throughout the public areas, multiple stainless framed windows, bold colors, modern furniture, lighting and music.The Lobby is one large room that also contains the ""w xyz"" bar, reception, a spacious seating area, multiple televisions, their 24hr kitchen area (known as ""re:fuel"") and a pool table.  This is the first hotel that I have stayed at which had a pool table in their lobby.I arrived early - 2pm on a Sunday - and there was no wait (no one in the lobby at all) and I was given a room on the 2nd floor (#217) facing the green-roofed (aka ""living"") meeting annex.First off, the RFID chip key-cards are FAR BETTER than the mag-striped: just wave in front of the sensor and the door unlocks.On entering, the room is small but very well appointed.  With a bowl sink, sliding mirrored door to the toilet/glass shower (w wall mounted pump shampoo, body wash dispensers: nice touch!), and dorm-like curtain covered closet space, it was very modern and comfortable - a space for everything. They even managed to fit in a settee.The fitness center was VERY user friendly: 2 each elliptical, bike and treadmill machines - all of the latest Life-Fitness brand (so built-in television, iPod docs, etc).  There was also exercise and medicine balls, yoga mats and importantly (to me anyway), a full set of dumbbells and cable machine.  What worked well for me is I used the space 4 times during my stay and only once was I interrupted when someone else came to exercise (and then only for 20 minutes).The fitness room faces the infinity style pool. During my stay, the ambient temperature ranged from mid 70s-80s so while not heated, it was not shockingly cold when I swam and after doing some ""laps"" (it is only 30ft long), it was very comfortable.  Again, the times that I swam, there was no one else in the pool area.  The bar - known as ""w xyz"" - was as expected, dead on Sunday night (4 patrons) but a bit more lively on Monday (20 patrons).  The bartender (I think her name was Nicki) was very nice on both nights and attentive and the drinks reasonably priced.  I did not eat from the bar menu as it was limited (hummus, chips, etc).I did however have some grub from the ""re:fuel"" kitchen area in the lobby.  While better than nothing, it primarily consisted of better-quality but still microwaveable boxed pizza, burritos and the like as well as some premade salads.  On the night I ate (Sunday), the stocks were bare - very few choices - and I was told that they did not make food on those days as it is not busy - so not fresh to say the least - but filling.As alternative, there is a Starbucks and Sushi Restaurant in the parking lot and several restaurant's serving a variety of fare across the street. The big problem areas for me were:- The flat-screen television ""froze"" in my room and while the manager came in within minutes to repair it (simply unplug it and let it reboot), he said that this is a normal occurrence as they are on a dish antenna system.- The towels are literally threadbare: I replace mine long before they reach this stage.  I thought it might be a fluke but on the 2nd day, both towels were again shredded.  When I mentioned this to the manager, he said that they replacements had been ordered.  But realistically, they should have been replaced a long time ago.- On the second day, I found what looked like blood spots on the cover to my bed.  There was no sense in mentioning it as thankfully, the maid volunteered and replaced all of the linens in the room.  Still though, it was a bit creepy.- There is something growing in the bathroom shower - or at least it looks that way.  The floors are black and this is white and gooey.  I'm pretty sure (I hope anyway) it was some type of grout or sealant but they need to clean it up and use clear because it looks bad.Overall, the stay was good and I would return.  However, I am fearful that if they are not keeping it up now (it's only been open a year), it will not be habitable in a few years.Although I'm not a fan of the party hotel concept, I knew what it was when I reserved a room and am not taking away stars for this. Before you stay here, know you're walking into a bar that happens to have a hotel connected to it. All Alofts are like this. If you want a quieter room, ask at check-in. If checking in at night, expect to have to speak at yell volume to communicate with the ""front desk"" because the music is LOUD. I get that. If you're above 30 you might feel out of place here. Besides that, there were some things I didn't like about this particular hotel. For instance, if you put out the do not disturb or do not clean sign at any time during your stay, they will not clean your room unless you ask. Even if you take the sign down on night 2. This needs to be disclosed up front. I've never been in a hotel that did that. The dual-mode toilet (full/half flush) I loved but it still didn't seem to have the pressure of a normal toilet. The shower water pressure wasn't great. In-room safe and mini-fridge was a plus, though. The TV was modern and nice, with a connection module on the desk for hooking up a laptop, etc. The open design was mostly good except if you wanted to sneak away to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Any light you turn on, including the commode/shower room, lights up the whole room. I really want to be fair in my reviews. This place wasn't awful and I might stay here again. The price was right this time, it was clean and it felt safe. The location is great - near a HUGE outdoor shopping mall with easy access to I95/I295. JTB is a mile away so it's easy to head to the beach from there. A Starbucks is in the same parking lot and a movie theater is in walking distance across the street. Restaurants are also in walking distance. And even though I could barely hear myself think in the lobby, my room was quiet as can be. But it's not my favorite hotel in the area.","Great hotel, great location, great staff.Love this place. Its green. New. Clean and Industrial style hotel. Very minimal and simple. Would definitely stay here again and again....Only downside is that there is no restaurant on site. Perfect location to the town centre that has the BEST shopping!  Staff is friendly. Cool place.I felt embarrassed while I was in a military uniform and in front of my wife and newborn.  I called the Starwood corporate office and immediately opened a claim against him and this hotel.  I also recorded some of the conversation on my phone and I'm sure that the hotel has a video that I would like to get of this incident.  Although these words may have not have hit you directly or painted the picture of PURE RACISM, RACIAL PROFILING or extremely poor customer service, it's one of those things that you had to be there in order to understand the true feeling and experience which took place.  Also like I stated before the hotel has this on camera so that the ones who are in charge can get a better picture of what happened.  I have never in my life experienced something like this and it will must be stopped.  I explained to him that how I felt and what he should have did as the GM.  Show some empathy for the customer since is he the General Manager of this place.  How he is the leader of this place and shows no empathy for customers.  The hotel attendant and the Chef were amazing.  I didn't want anything from this place but for the situation to be resolved and so that I can finish and enjoy my 4 day weekend.  It was his actions that made me understand that what I was a victim of.  It's like something you hear about on TV and to know it actually can happen to you.  I really don't care if this guy has a million people tell him that he is amazing he needs an immediate correction.  I don't know if any other African Americans or other ethnicities feel this way but I definitely was treated as if I was just a person lying and looking for free handouts.  It's a lot more to this story again this is just the small portion of what happened and I want the hotel video tape so that everyone can see what the GM of ALOFT Hotel in Jacksonville

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-jacksonville,Radisson Hotel,2.5,$$,17,"Stayed here for three days. The service was great. Everyone I had an encounter with was super nice. The staff is very friend. The hotel is super clean . It does need a little work but management does communicate with you . We tried the food for breakfast and it was hot and tasty . You can tell that this hotel is run beautifully . I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family .The hotel is ok, but the breakfast was deplorable.  $13 for a buffet of 6 items.  Can't even make your own waffle.  Not even butter for toast.  The hotel should be ashamed.I had a reservation at Radisson Jacksonville (Florida) which was supposed to be booked for July 30 - August 1, 2015. I was in town for the USATF Junior Olympic National Championships with my 2 children. The coach for my daughters track team reserved a block of rooms for the team, in March. The parents were given the reservation numbers to change the name, method of payment and date of stay for their rooms. I called on July 15, 2015 to the reservations number and did just that. However, when I arrived on July 30th I was told I did not have a room because my reservation was booked from July 27, 2015 through July 31, 2015 and since I did not arrive on the 27th, my reservation was cancelled. Because of the event that week, I was then told that the hotel was completely sold out and they would not be able to accommodate me.I travel fairly often, both with and without my children, but this was the first time this has ever happened to me. I traveled from Georgia to Florida for this trip and you have no idea how disheartening it is to feel stranded with two children. The front desk clerk, who ""helped me"" happened to also be the Manager on Duty was unapologetic and suggested I check with the Marriott next door to see if they had any rooms available. Now if this is how The Radisson hotel and its affiliate hotels deals with their customers, you can rest assured knowing this will be the last time I ever attempt to stay at one of your properties. I will be sure to share this experience with everyone possible because this is completely unacceptable. In the end, the Marriott next door was able to accommodate me and my family and turned a horrible experience into a pleasurable one. They gave me a discounted rate for being left stranded by the Radisson.The place I clean and aesthetic to the eye.  However, the bed is like a brick. The sink drain slow. The pillows hard and flat. This is the last time I will stay at one. Second Radisson,  second city, both suck for the money.Disgusting.  Deplorable service.Filthy rooms, understaffed (and poorly staffed) front desk, management that is wholly unavailable for major issues.I travel alone for work.  This trip was 10 days long and my days are long.  I always leave lights on in the room so I don't stumble in to a strange room alone in the dark.  Night one, all my light shad been turned off despite a no housekeeping sign on my door.  Who came in? I'll never know because management never called me back.I had 2 packages delivered and the first one was left at front desk and I just picked it up.  Second package they once again came in my room without permission.  No management to return phone call.RUDE front desk, so so so rude.  Unhelpful, disinterested, rude.Hotel is in disgusting need of repairs and updates.  I immediately booked another hotel and went there after a couple of nights in this hell hole.Utterly disgusted. After a very long day of travel I shouldn't have to inspect all bedding before letting my kids sleep. Broken phone. Bodily crusty fluid on comforter. I want to leave but I'm too tired.If your last name happens to be Rubble or Flintstone you are probably accustomed to sleeping on stone slabs, if not your not in for a good night's sleep.   This hotel chain has the worst beds &amp; bedding on any 3 1/2 star hotel I have ever been in.  Absolutely the worst night sleep.  I was able to book the room 1/2 off ($48 + tax) via priceline, but even that seems too much.  *disclaimer our room was not supposed to have a sleep number bed, but we suspect they didn't replace the sleep number mattresses just locked the setting in place* On the good side the hot water was hot, decent shower and free wifi.I attempted to stay here last week while I was in town on an IT project that involved taking a site survey.   I used a corporate lodging card to book my stay, and they proceeded to put a $50 hold on my personal credit card for ""incidentals."" Well, considering the fact that I didn't plan on ordering breakfast, room service, or anything else, that bothered me.  When I got to the room, the one amenity that I was truly counting on, high speed Internet, was a joke.  Whoever installed the wireless access points in the hotel obviously thought that a heat map is something that you do with a globe and a thermometer because between the lobby and where my room was on the sixth floor, the signal on my laptop never went above two bars, and I was able to connect faster using my smartphone as a wireless hotspot. In short, if you have money and want to waste it, stay at this hotel.  If you want to get anything resembling work done, go stay at the Econolodge down the road.The hotel was near Mayo Clinic where we needed to be. Restaurant was open late and we were hungry~ there was only one other table with people and a few folks at the bar. It was about 8:30 pm. Food was so-so. Waitress was very sweet. The bread on my sandwich was so hard at one end that I couldn't eat it. My husband only ate half of his~ badly put together club sandwich. Room was OK. Furniture very dated and chair was beat. Sleep number beds did not work at all. Pillows were entirely worn out. Did not sleep well.  We did get a Mayo discount which is the only reason I didn't voice more of a complaint. I took the survey after our stay and got the standard response from the manager. We are heading back to Jax next month but I won't be staying there. Will pay a little extra for better accommodations. We did get a free glass of wine voucher upon check in which I had with my meal. The breakfast buffet was $12.99 per person so we skipped that.I really like the decor of this hotel, the lobby and the rooms. Staff is professional. The bar is small but has 2 big screen tvs, so you can sip on your drink and be entertained if you're by yourself (as I frequently am, travelling alone). The lady bartender who works there M-W is sweet as can be, and even made everyone a shooter at the end of the night.The room has adequate seating with a lounger and chaise, as well as a really nice desk. Internet is free and there was a fridge in my room, hidden by wooden paneling. I have to say again, that I loved the decor. Dark wood, paneling at the bed's headboard, earthy and rich brown tones. The bed was very comfortable as well.Would definitely stay here again! Class, convenience, without all the nickel-and-diming you see at hotels that are 4 stars and above. One of the nicest experiences at a hotel I've ever had.The service here is really amazing! I was just here on business and it made me want to stay an extra day. The pictures and the written amenities don't really do it justice. There is a huge human factor in this hotel. The people make the place. However, if you don't like to talk to anyone and you just like to hole away it might not be as great. It's a very comfortable but simple hotel. Sleepnumber bed, mini-fridge, coffee maker and microwave are all bonuses though. Upon checking in I asked for a quiet room and Geraldo at the front desk really took a moment to give me what he thought would be a good room. It just so happened that the AC had a weird rattle noise and the WiFi wasn't working. He sent someone up immediately to fix it and then helped trouble shoot the WiFi. It still wasn't working so he put me in a new room. (I'm seriously such a pest but he was so gracious about it all). The bar tender/waitress/everything in the restaurant was so awesome. Her name is Carolyn and she is obviously a staple. There were several people that came in just to say hello to her and give her a hug. I met at least 5 regular patrons who come here several times a year. It was actually really weird- I thought, this is a simple but nice hotel, what makes people come back over and over again? The service, the food and the affordability. The room service breakfast was also insanely good. Tanner moved my order up and accommodated my requests and was super friendly. Everything was perfectly seasoned and tasted like it was made with some heart. The evening chef also loves to watch Jeopardy at 7:30, you should go have a drink and order something after the show so you can hear how knowledgeable she is (if you order during than you won't get to experience that). After my first day another front desk attendant (Chelsea) called to see how my stay was. That's just great service. I don't know if I'll ever have a need to come back to Jacksonville but if I do I'd want to stay here.I recently stayed here on business and the staff was very nice and friendly, and the overall hotel was nice. However, my MAJOR complaint was the fact that every morning, without fail, the housekeepers (4th floor) would be literally SCREAMING spanish back and forth down the hallway as they were cleaning rooms. I'm not talking one or two yells, but a constant conversation that lasted over an hour plus. This happened EVERY morning and woke me up each day.Not bad.  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> got me a very good rate for three nights and the room was clean, spacious, and had all the normal amenities.  Loved the wired internet; much more reliable than wireless.  The desk was kinda weird but hey, it works.  TV, flat screen, fine; but the channels are lame (again not their fault).   Very quiet until Friday night when crowds checked in.  Not much they can do about that so I'm not dinging them.I did not try the restaurant but I'm guessing you can do better elsewhere.  The bar has alcohol.  Enough said. Now the bed.  My room (327) had a sleep number bed, which is basically an inflatable mattress with a control to set the degree of inflation on each side of a queen sized bed.  I am not a fan.  Others may disagree.  If I stay here next time I'll try to find a room with a normal mattress. Looking out the window I see a nice pool and jacuzzi.  No bathing suit so I didn't imbibe.Pretty convenient to Butler Blvd, and I-95 just south of Jax.  If I return I'll stay here again.I normally wouldn't review a chain hotel, but this one was very clean, staff were friendly and everything seemed to be newer.  What i'm saying is, if you need a hotel off 95 in Jacksonville this one will do just fine.  And show your AAA card (if you have one) for a discount.Nice clean room at a very good rate.My husband and I have stayed at this hotel about 4 times over the last few years. It was our go to spot in Jacksonville for quick weekend getaways. It is such a shame that the management has allowed the property to deteriorate so quickly since the last renovation. The lobby is still impressively beautiful but beyond that we were totally disgusted with the filth of the hotel. We booked our stay about 4pm before arriving in Jacksonville around 6:30pm. Check-In was wonderful, the clerk was very friendly and we went straight up to our room. We were initially disgusted by the horrible carpet stains as soon as we got off the elevator. I mean if it is that visible to guest, why can't management see it and get it fixed? We entered the room and were in shock of how many visible things were wrong with the room. I mean don't the cleaning staff see these things? Toilet stains, mold in the shower, stains on the chairs. We were in a rush to get to a dinner reservation for 8pm so we went back down to the front desk and asked if we could check out due to the cleanliness issues. We were only there for 30 minutes before we decided to leave and just book another hotel in the area but the clerk was adamant that we still would be charged and there was nothing she could do because we checked in before the cutoff time. Whatever. We didn't want to be late for our reservation so we left and she agreed to switch our room when we got back. We didn't want to waste our money and we had enjoyed previous stays so we figured a new room would suffice, it was just one night. Wrong. The second room was just as bad.  Once again we asked to just have the hold removed from our card so we can check out and we were told, NO. It was after 11pm and we were tired so we just dealt with room number 3 which was slightly better than the first two.I didn't say anything at checkout because I hate being viewed as a customer that is just seeking a discount or something so I decided to just never return to this property and post my review and pictures. I just want others to beware.It is such disappointment to see such a quality property that we once loved with so much potential decline over little things that can be fixed if management cared enough.I cant complain about this hotel everything was GREAT the outside and inside swimming pool was nice and hot tub the only reason I gave them a 4 star they need more stuff around the hotel to do there is one thing within walking distance and that DAVID BUSTER I mean literally walking distance from the front door of lobby to D&amp;B front door lol the front desk clerk are nice. The hotel is close by the interstate 10 min from beach they have a mall like 5-10 min away. The rooms are spacious with sleep # beds you have a microwave, refridge, FREE WIFI, TV, Phone and etc worth the money.",,,,,"['three', 'days', 'service', 'great', 'everyone', 'encounter', 'super',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-indigo-jacksonville-deerwood-park-jacksonville-3,Hotel Indigo Jacksonville Deerwood Park,4.0,$$,48,"I spent a lot of time trying to find a place in Jacksonville and finally decided on Hotel Indigo.  It is not the most expensive, nor is it the cheapest.  This place has overall great reviews and I can see why!We arrived on a Friday evening and were promptly greeted in their beautiful lobby next to the bar.  We made it up to our room, and it is probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I have been in, in awhile.  Have to love the hardwood floors!  The bed was a little rougher than I would have liked, would have been the icing on the cake if it was softer.  The shower was amazing.  It did not have a tub, but I would rather have the HUGE shower instead of the tight bathtub/shower combo you have in most places.  They give you the typical shower items - shampoo, soap, etc.  But ladies, they also give makeup wipes each day! Score! :)The location of the hotel was great for us.  I'm not sure on it's proximity to things in Jacksonville, but we were just staying there for two nights for travel to and from Gainesville.  It is in walking distance to a lot of things.  We walked to dinner Friday night and to breakfast Saturday morning.  There is also walking around a pond that we explored Friday night.I highly recommend this beautiful hotel!  Great place to stop and get some good nights sleep!We stayed here December 26-27.After a long journey, arriving at Hotel Indigo was like finding an oasis. The staff was friendly, cheerful, humorous, and helpful. This hotel has a youthful vibe, as opposed to some hotels where the feeling is old and stuffy. The wi-fi was strong, and very easy to access. The bed was clean and comfortable. The shower was huge! It could easily fit five adults. The water pressure was surprisingly low, but enough to get clean. It would be better if the room had full, solid curtains for those who would like privacy and to sleep in later. Don't be surprised if it takes a little bit of time for the lighting to warm up to its full brightness level. There are better LED and CFL bulbs on the market that don't take as much time. The positioning of the hand towel rod is strange, as it is attached to the bathroom counter down low. The TV had issues in that it would lock up the image, and then wouldn't turn off. Then it wouldn't turn on. This happened multiple times. The hotel does have dining options on site.  We didn't eat here, but I browsed the in-room menu. Their modest attempt to use local ingredients seems more of a marketing ploy than an actual desire to support local farms, but the food options seem better than what you might find in other hotels in this price range. A Keurig, with both regular and decaf organic coffees is provided in the room with real mugs instead of paper cups.Despite the few negatives I've mentioned, this large, cool, clean, and contemporary hotel is a great value. For the price of $89/night it felt quite plush.First timer at Hotel Indigo and would recommend to anyone staying in the Jax area. The room was undeniably spotless. Hardwood floors, comfortable beds and a giant walk in shower are just the tip of the iceberg. Upon entering, a fully stocked Keurig machine rests comfortably on a wooden shelf. The window views overlooking the lake were relaxing and peaceful. Amenities included a 24 hour fitness center, which I took advantage of instantaneously. For a hotel gym, it did the trick. Next to the gym, there's a small pool. If weather permitted, I would've went for quick swim. Lastly, the lobby houses a bar and ample seating for breakfast and conversation. The service was inviting and accommodating. I did have a slight issue of my credit card being charged, instead of my boss's card. The front desk attendants were patient with me and a few days later my credit was returned. Overall, a great experience here.Stayed here after a company Christmas party and was very impressed.  The rooms are smart, stylish, and the service is fantastic.  Even their wifi (which is usually problematic at hotels) was reliable and free.Everything about this hotel is designed with comfort and class in mind and they definitely are doing it right!On my last business trip to Jacksonville, I was rather comfortable about where I was. It's almost like comparing apples and oranges. Very similar to OC in terms of the weather and the laid back atmosphere. The land is more flat in JAX and the humidity makes it warmer, but they have this thing called Southern Hospitality that just permeates from the neighboring states. On a recent drive thru Anaheim, I noticed the city also has a Hotel Indigo. The one in JAX is almost identical in it's modern design and look, making it a stylish boutique hotel that reflects the culture and vibe of the surrounding area. It's located in Tapestry Park, overlooking a beautiful lake. Across, from the Merrill Lynch campus, you can take a bridge and just stroll over to the other side.There are several restaurants within walking distance of the lodging, making it very convenient to go back and forth. The St. John's Town Center is a couple miles down, with Downtown JAX being just a few minutes away. The staff is ultra friendly, with a clear focus on comfort, and a firm belief in taking care of the guest. Compared, to the other hotels I've experienced outside of LA, it was a pleasant surprise.Along with the contemporary design, there's a lot of color inside and out. My room had a hardwood floor, a couple rugs, and a spa inspired bathroom with an open shower (no door). I'm talking about FREE Wi-Fi, toiletries provided by Aveda, and a great air conditioner that blasts to infinity and beyond. I don't care how cold it gets in the room. You wanna keep me happy, get the A/C working right. The bed is oversized, plush as well. 32 inch HD TV, lounge char, and a separated section that acts as a draped closet. As for the services and amenities - Fitness Center, Outdoor Pool &amp; Hot Tub, Business Center, Same Day Dry Cleaning, Laundry Service, and FREE parking. The 98 Forty Bar &amp; Bistro, located on the lobby floor, prepared my expensed breakfast every morning without fail. Not to mention a few signature cocktails during Happy Hour. Did I mention that the place is pet friendly? Would definitely consider this hotel during my next stay in JAX.I've only been to Jacksonville Florida a few times, and this was the first time I stayed at the Hotel Indigo. It was very clean, and the staff was exceptionally friendly. If I had one criticism it would be that the hotel needs to invest in better mattresses. The mattress in my room was very uneven and lumpy.I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Indigo and I would recommend it. The drawbacks are that the pool is tiny and there isn't much sunlight. The gym is of 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical and a work out bench. The gym window is where the pool is.I love the layout of the room and the hardwood floors add a touch of class. The bed is very comfortable and the room had a nice view.We've done Indigo before and have always liked it.Keyword here, dog friendly! Bad point, they add a $50 fee /per stay for the four leg one. Roomie said, that ain't bad. And I said, that's 2 case of beer! Good points, staff are friendly, bar is great, parking is free, wifi is fast enough, room is clean. Shower was hot, facility to walk our dog is beyond good. Great shopping walk about too.This hotel is beautiful but the staff is what sets it apart from all the others. The staff goes above and beyond. If your staying in Jacksonville, you want to stay here.Enjoyed the stay, nice property although some of the furnishings in the room we stayed in could use a renovation. But overall it was clean and comfortable. Would stay again if in town.Amazing hotel! First time in this hotel and first time in this city. The hotel is beautiful, super clean ,modern and comfortable. Super friendly staff. The room is a beauty, super clean, comfortable, modern. Super comfortable bed, great, amazing bathroom. The truth that we Super recommend this hotel is beautiful of all we have visited over the years, is one of the most beautiful it is definitely one of the most beautiful and comfortable. I post some pictures so you can see it better. Great Hotel!Update 02/26/15 ...Stayed at this hotel again.  Good news/bad news:Good news:  The wi-fi works with iOS devices now.  The staff is still friendly and seemingly competent.Bad news:  If you are a business traveler (or other) and require the use of a VPN with wi-fi (some businesses require it for remote access and smart travelers often use it to avoid having their wi-fi communications eavesdropped on) you are OUT of luck.  VPN is blocked by the Hotel and/or its ISP.More bad news:  While the hotel says it is ""pet friendly,"" what that means to many of us is that our allergies will go crazy.  They did.  Pet friendly = guest unfriendly, in our experience.  Sleeping was difficult.So, it's a nice hotel, but depending on one's circumstances this one might not be for you.Beautiful hotel. Comfortable, clean, quiet with beautiful grounds. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Dog friendly!  One of our go to places when we are passing through.This hotel was very nice and I loved every minute of it, EXCEPT one small thing. The picture on their official website of the pool uses EXTREME measures to make the pool look much bigger than it really is. I was looking forward to swimming some laps and having a good time. When we got out to the pool it was the smallest little pool I've ever seen for a hotel rated with this star. While it was clean it was still like urghhh so small. The biggest perk was the hot tub it was really nice.The location of this hotel made everything perfect. It appears to be in a newer area that is kept up very well. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and a movie theater in walking distance. The hotel is right down the street from the St. Johns Town center if you enjoy shopping. 5 min drive. The hotel is situated right by a small lake and also in a business park. Everything felt safe.Customer service was great no issues. Housekeeping mistakenly threw our entire pizza away. We went to the front desk to tell them about the situation and they reimbursed us right on the spot which was exceptional customer service. Also, since we did have left over foods from some of our restaurant's they kindly went to heat up our food in the kitchen which was nice, since no microwaves are in the rooms.Not to mention this hotel has hardwood floors which makes the room appear to be much cleaner than nasty carpet eww. They also have big showers which was a plus! The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  I'd DEF go back if I visited Jckville again.What a great place at an awesome price. The rooms and  hotel  are modern looking and tidy, with  great eye appeal around the grounds. Had breakfast before we left and it was top notch. Get  breakfast coupons included  in the room fee because it is a little  pricey. ...but good eats.I'm torn with this hotel because I absolutely love it. It's better than any hotel I've ever stayed at. It is in a prime location, is quiet, clean, and comfortable. The first night I was there they accidentally charged me $385 extra and the second night they charged me $114 extra on top of the normal cost for 2 nights. I literally begged the front desk for a call back from a manager as reassurance that it wouldn't happen again, because I really wanted to come back but never received the call they promised. If you do stay here, I recommend you double check your account after your stay. I wish I could say I was coming back because I loved the hotel but I can't because I don't trust them.Hotel was lovely. Very clean and comfortable. Stayed a night for a concert that was in Jacksonville. Shower was amazing. Very much enjoyed our stay.Great location near a lot of eating &amp; shopping spots and located next to a lake that's so serene especially at night! There are a few bars located within walking distance of this hotel which is plus if u wanna get your drink on then walk back. Check in was soooo easy and we were able to check in early. We requested a room away from elevator and on highest floor in which they accommodated, the staff were really friendly but my favorite part is the hotel bar! Andy was an outstanding bartender who engaged with every drinker in conversation and superb drink making skills.A lovely hotel on the outskirts of Jacksonville proper. It is situated in a quaint little restaurants and shops strip called Tapestry Park. The hotel itself is on the end of the block overlooking a lake and other hotels nearby. The grounds are well kept, the lobby is colorful, and service at check-in was very friendly and efficient. The room is tastefully decorated and modern touches are in every detail. Lastly, room service and free wifi (my two favorite amenities) are also offered at the Hotel Indigo. Very solid place!I have had several stays with Hotel Indigo while in Jacksonville and the experiences have been subpar to say the least. The beds are extremely small, the showers are huge but have trace amounts of mold that is visible, and the staff seem unbothered and at some points were down right rude. Obviously they don't honor late check outs like most hotels, I was NOT feeling well and was hoping to get an extra hour or two in bed before departing and was denied. When I called the front desk I was told ""she had to ask the maid service and get approval."" I have stayed at many hotels, five star included, and NEVER EVER heard of anyone having to check with the maid for a late check out. The front desk then returned and offered NOON as a late check out as if NOON wasn't their regular check out time. I'm in and out of Jacksonville often for business and pleasure and Hotel Indigo will NOT be an option for me moving forward...","I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Indigo.  There was a combo of things that made the overall stay explained by category below.   Like previous Yelpers - they were pretty much spot on with their assessment and now here is my $0.02Venue: Located in a community, village type neighborhood.  If you from or live in Atlanta, it is similar to the West Village as far as setup or Lindbergh Station.  It is surrounded by shops, restaurants within the community.  There's a small lake right behind the hotel which is gorgeous to walk along on a nice spring/ summer day.  FREE Parking and plenty of it in the back.  The neighborhood is in a quiet corporate park and seems very safe at night in SE Jacksonville.Decor:   When you first walk into the lobby, you  notice the different color furniture, the walls, the paintings.  I actually liked it.  I found it unique.  I found it kind of different and trendy.  Had no issues with it.  The actual hotel room was hardwood floors, quite comfortable bed to sleep on, flat screen tv, huge shower.  The room was comfortable.Service:   The bartenders, room service &amp; cook was pretty much awesome.  Environment:   Quiet, peaceful, just the way I lke it.Food:   They have cheap happy hour drinks.  They will try to be stingy on the liquor but ask for more and tip when appropriate.  The breakfast served, go for the breakfast quesadillas.  If you are a cheese feen like me, add feta cheese to the quesadillas, quite delicious.Prices:   Hotel Price seemed to be spot on for what you were getting.  The room service prices was actually great itself, no complaints.  Breakfast and lunch items at or under $10Huge Pros:  Gang of restaurants right near by.  The Jacksonville Beaches are a straight shot down the road.  There's a movie theatre within 1 minute drive up the road on the service street without getting on the main road.  Downtown is about 10 minutes away without getting on major interstate.  Very easy to get to and most importantly--safe neighborhood.  In addition, management was very attentive when having issue with A/C unit.  Came up right away to explain the problem to make me comfortable of the issue &amp; solution.Debbie Downers:  This is reaching but the fitness center is just a couple of treadmills.  The pool was cold.  That is because the shade from the building blocked off any sun light that hits the back area where the pool and patio is located.Conclusion:   If I was to visit Jacksonville at a good price, don't want to pay a huge amount of money on a room and don't want to be located to downtown, this is my new go to hotel when staying in the 904.Overall: B+We travel travel to Jacksonville at least twice a month to visit a sick family member. We usually stay at her house, but it's old, small and not very comfortable, so I put out for a hotel this time. Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh! What a breath of fresh air! Although we were staying for one night, it was worth the money to be in a clean, modern and very comfortable room. This was the first time I was able to completely relax during my stay in Jacksonville.The staff were great; very friendly and check-in was a breeze. Didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food.There really isn't much to see in this part of town, but it is really cute and has plenty of restaurants and a movie theatre within waking distance. Also, if you're a fan of shopping, and eating, you'll be happy to know that St. Johns Town Center is only a few minutes away!Hotel Indigo is pet friendly. I'm assuming that's why the rooms have hardwood floors, which I like much more than carpet.Two points of disappointment - very small gym, and the pool area is shaded by the building which means no sun bathing.You will love this hotel. It's hip, vibrant, and clean. Free parking, cute lake and my doggie loved it! We'll be back.This place rocks! It is very modern and clean - it is always full so book early! It's the best business park hotel I've ever stayed at and they were ranked in the top hotels for the whole chain! You won't regret it!Check in at 3pm or later, insane. I never heard of this in a hotel in my life.  For sure I will not be coming back here any time soon.Service is GREAT. Rooms are clean and modern. Bedding is soft and comfortable. No issues whatsoever. Watch the room price which varies day to day even if you are staying for several days in a row.Breakfast package - a true breakfast is not given. You will receive a $10 voucher for breakfast. Juice &amp; typical breakfast will cost you $12-15 plus tax and tip so be prepared for pay a few $ for breakfast.We stayed on the 5th floor (water side) and it was incredible! Beautiful rooms, awesome open shower. Really enjoyed our room and I really liked how the floors were hardwood (nice and clean!). The staff are super nice and friendly. Would def recommend staying here!!!Upon entering this place I smelled some rank sewer fumes.  Not joking.  The next day it was gone so I can only assume they were having some issues that one day.  That being said, the hotel is just fine.  It's owned by Holiday Inn but it's a different style hotel and much likened to a newer contemporary style like Alot and the like.I was put in a handicapped room and to be honest I didn't think it was a big deal until I got in there.  A shower was not easily achieved if you can imagine and the bed was nearly on the floor.  Not really sure why I was given this room b/c the place looked 40% empty.Front desk was quick and polite so that was a plus.  This hotel is near some very nice places to eat as well (walking distance).The Indigo is amazing &amp; instantly became my favorite new hotel!  The price was right ($79/night on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>), service was excellent, and some other great things I'll list below:AREA.  Okay, the Indigo is in the Southside (a JAX neighborhood filled with business parks), but it is in a town center like area within the business park with restaurants and little shops.  Take note that most of the restaurants are closed on Sundays as we found out.  The Seven Bridges Brewery &amp; Grill is within walking distance and was open on Sunday, and had excellent beer (try the sampler!).  The St. Johns shopping area is only a couple of miles away.  It is an outdoor/open air mall, with fun restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, etc.) and good shopping.  The hotel is maybe 15-20 minutes from both the beaches, and downtown Jacksonville.HOTEL.  It is beautiful!  It is only 3 years old and feels brand new.  The lobby is cool and the bar/seating area when you walk in has a good vibe.  The rooms are the best!  They have hardwood (laminate) floors throughout, and the rooms are modern but cozy.  There is a frosted glass partition when you walk in which separates the entryway from the sleeping area, which is nice - the layout of the room is a nice variation from the typical standard hotel room.  I love when hotels have washable sheets as the duvet because you know they're washed after every guest.  The beds and pillows were super comfortable.  Love the Aveda bath products, Keurig coffee, and spa like bathroom.  Here is the best part.  When I booked online thru <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, I opted in for the $5 breakfast buffet (for 2 guests was only $5 total, bringing the room charge to $84).  When we checked in they gave us two breakfast vouchers for $10 each!  There is no breakfast buffet, but you can use these vouchers at the cafe for breakfast OR for ROOM SERVICE.  So, we had $20 to put towards room service breakfast.  The food was AMAZING and arrived within 20 minutes!With the free parking, free wi-fi, and breakfast vouchers this is hands down the best deal in town AND an awesome hotel.  I wish there was an Indigo in every town I traveled to.My first stay here at Hotel Indigo and I am impressed! Great location, cute mini ""town center"" and the staff is every friendly and efficient. I am in town because a family member is in the hospital and the bright colors and beautiful decor of the hotel have lifted my spirits!Friendly staff, attractive hotel and room, and a good location for walking/dining (especially during heavy rain, as when I was in town.)  My one 'nit' has to do with the closet in my room (418) which was designed into a corner, making it difficult to access.  However, that detail is easy to overlook when everything else is good, and that it was at the Hotel Indigo.Unloading my car while five people smoked under the awning in front of the hotel was less than welcoming. Check in made almost impossible by the 50 people standing around the front desk talking. I guarantee you I am not exaggerating the number. Having some sort of event in the lobby with no regard for guests or fire code. Upstairs in my room - barking dog next-door. Bathroom smells like the sewer is backed up. Went downstairs to inform the front desk about the bathroom and the dog. It was so loud the front desk person could not hear me. All she heard was dog and proceeded to tell me they are a pet friendly hotel. I think that's great, I just don't want the dog next-door barking. Tried again to explain about the bathroom. She just looked at me like I was a crazy person.  Went back to my room and closed the bathroom door. The next morning when I told the person at the front desk about the bathroom she didn't apologize or say I'm so sorry what can I do to help she simply stated 'oh you're the lady who complained last night'.  Really?  Does customer service even come up in your training?  It just leads me to believe they view the business traveler as one and done. No need to impress because you'll never see them again. Very bad business.If all I had to do was look at the Hotel Indigo and it's rooms I'd give it 5 stars. Once I got over it being pretty and actually started using it as a hotel room I think I was disappointed. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. The wood floors, good size desk with easy to reach outlets, comfy chair and ottoman, large bathroom with a big walk in shower, single cup coffee machine, very nice decor, and a few other appointments were impressive. But wood floors are cold in the morning, and you can hear the people above you easier. The walk in shower was pretty, but had no door and therefore was a tad drafty, the floor of the shower was also quite slick when wet. The towel hook outside the shower was installed upside down, so your towel just kinda slides right off it. Yes it may look nice to put a wooden bench in the middle of the shower with the floor mat folded on it and the tiny bottles of shampoo and conditioner sitting on it. But now I have to walk into the shower, move the bench, put the floor mat down, move the tiny bottles. I know this doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but I'd rather not have to ""get ready"" to take a shower. The towels are housed under the bathroom sink, so make sure you think about that before getting into the shower too. And seriously, who the hell is going to sit on the wooden bench in a hotel shower?? Free wi-fi sounds like a fantastic deal too. Especially if you're considering working in your room after a day of meetings. But, you'll have to call the help line and wait for them to call you back if you want to connect. I talked to two other guests who had the same experience. Once you do connect, it's painfully slow. For my company's rate of $99 a night, it was an ok place to stay. If I were paying the hotel's rack rate of $135 for the same nights I would be annoyed.Wow!! We paid a little over $100 for our one bed room and that was the least we paid for a room our entire nine state road trip. When we first got to our room we called the front desk to make sure there wasn't a mistake. The room looked and felt like a $400 a night room to us, everything was brand new looking and feeling. It was very modern and stylish with a great view of a lake. We couldn't believe it was only $100 after we had paid $130 for a dump in St. Augustine just a half hour away. This was the nicest hotel my girlfriend and I had every stayed at, hands down.I'm picky and high-maintenance when I stay at hotels; I travel to Jacksonville at least every three months when I have appts at Mayo Clinic. Hotel Indigo was THE best in its class, especially the customer service, the location, not to mention the ambiance of staying in a modern-style hotel. One shouldn't avoid this hotel if modern design isn't their cup of tea. Trust me, you will leave your stay with a smile on your face. I have a few illnesses (explains the Mayo comment,) and require a room located in a  VERY quiet location and Late Check Out. I'm a Priority Club member, but that doesn't guarantee my requests, especially if the place is booked. This hotel is a bit out of my price range at the time, but through the PC, found a unbelievable deal. Assuming the deal was open to all PC members, I didn't think I'd get what I requested as the hotel was completely booked, or so it seemed.Upon my arrival, the lobby wasn't crazy or loud. I felt calm and stress melt away. At check-in, the clerk greeted me right away. I didn't mention my requests, feeling that it would make me look like a cheapskate as the price I paid was next to nothing. Immediately, upon seeing where my room was located, I was shocked. The most quiet room is usually the upper levels, all the way at the end, on a side not facing a busy highway. That's exactly what I received and more. Oh, I booked the room two days before my arrival, so I was grateful. The very top floor all the way at the end, with a view of the lake. Stunning.Reasons to stay at Hotel Indigo: Friendliest hotel staff I've personally encountered. Especially housekeeping!Hardwood floors. Cleanliness. Location: in the middle of a quiet, quaint area by nice businesses, minutes from St. John's Town Center outdoor mallFood: Room Service and meals at the lounge are comparable to restaurants, delicious food and giant portions. From the towels to the awesome shower head, the peace and quiet, blissful bed and pillows, Hotel Indigo is worth every penny. I stayed in that location because I wanted to go to the mall nearby, but instead, never left the room.Great place for company eventsThis is a very nice, new hotel with friendly staff.  Easy check in with ample parking.  Nice variety of places to eat within walking distance.  Love the hardwood floors, comfortable bed, bath and products.  Allows pets with only a $25 dollar fee.  Rates are very reasonable for quality of room and location.  We will definitely stay here again when passing through Jacksonville.A nice lively hotel that served our needs in terms of affordability, cleanliness, and something with a contemporary vibe.  The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. They were able to meet our request for a late checkout (albeit only half an hour later than standard checkout @12pm). The room was modern with nice wood floors and a great modern floral mural that I believe is standardized across all rooms. Only gripe was the wood floors seemed clammy and damp. Otherwise a great hotel that I may also consider for business trips!Loud loud loud last night.  Bring ear plugs.  The floors are wood laminate and sound traces right through them.  Good atmosphere in the lobby but not a good nights sleep.I do not give high fives ever!!!! So believe me when i say "" this is a nice place"". Decor, neighborhood, staff, value... You get it all!!! Everything right in a little village. Sweet!!! Peace out.I loved this hotel and I am picky. Great service, beautiful LARGE rooms, great little pool with jacuzzi. I would definitely stay here again. Super comfortable and clean bed with soft pillows. Quiet too.","Clean hardwood floors. Very affordable. Colorful decor. Comfortable beds. Plenty of restaurants and shops around, some of them within walking distance. Would definitely stay again.Great experience during my stay. New construction and friendly staff.Great location for restaurants and shopping.Awesome hotel. Great decor and everything is spotless!  Close to shopping and nice restaurants.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-jacksonville-baymeadows-jacksonville,Embassy Suites Jacksonville - Baymeadows,2.0,$$,49,"I stayed here this week while on a business trip. I understand that it has been going through a remodeling. Upon my arrival it looks like it is almost done.I found the property to be in good shape. The hotel is of an atrium design however I was put in a room in the south wing. My suites was nice and everything in order. The fitness room and pool looked nice. Front desk check was courteous and friendly. Breakfast was typical Embassy Suites which means good.I enjoyed my stay here and can say this property delivers what you should expect from Embassy Suites. I would be happy to stay here again.We arrived for check-in at 6 P.M. on a Sunday evening.  After waiting 20 minutes for a front desk attendant, we weren't met with a friendly greeting.  It appeared that the front desk clerk hadn't slept in weeks.  We gave him our relevant information and were told that there were no clean rooms available.  I had to scratch my head as it was 6 P.M. and the hotel's stated check in was 3 P.M.  We were then told that there was a mixup with the room types and our requested 2 queen beds in the room was not available.  I stated to the clerk that this was unacceptable based upon the number of guests sleeping in the room.  He told us to give him 15 minutes and he would try to find another room.  We went to the complimentary evening manager's reception for some drinks and appetizers.  What a mistake.  We have no clue how they consider this a reception.  The drink selection was extremely limited and the food consisted of a bowl of pretzels which was crawling with bugs.  The reception should be a complete embarrassment to the hotel.  After waiting 15 minutes and battling the bugs for the pretzels, we went back to the front desk to check on our room.  We were told the room was ready.  We then proceeded into a filthy elevator up to the second floor.  The elevator doors opened to a hallway filled with dirty dishes and garbage all over the place.  We dodged the plates and garbage to get to the room.  After opening the room door, we discovered a room with the wrong bedding.  We then proceeded back down to the front desk and requested to speak to a manager.  The manager informed us that the majority of the housekeeping staff called in sick and that was the reason for the late check in.  She apologized and said that she could not find us a room.  We stated that the hotel should provide two complimentary rooms to solve the bedding issue and compensate us for the hassle.  She apologized again and agreed.  We then went back into the filthy elevators and proceeded to two new rooms.  When we opened the door to one of the rooms, the pillows were thrown all over the place with no pillow cases.  We called down to the front desk and they stated that it would be taken care of.Despite the hotel's attempt at making up for it's deficiencies by not charging us for the rooms, I would steer clear of this business.  This is an Embassy Suites and there is an expectation for better service and a much better product.As I understand it, the hotel is nearly finished with a $12 million renovation. To be fair, I will start with this disclaimer: I would have rated it with 4 stars except for the following. 1. Outdated and slow elevators. 2. Horrible bartender working at the restaurant. (Worst old fashion I'd ever tasted)3. In-room coffee maker didn't work4. New glass shower door leaked water all over the floor soaking the bath-mat. Now for the good stuff:The room was really nice. I stayed in a 2 room suite with a balcony. The room included a lounging area and business nook, as well as a kitchenette and mini-fridge.  The bedroom was equally as nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. The rooms look nothing like the pictures from years ago. I will add updated pictures from my next stay here. That's right, I'll stay here again...just won't enjoy any adult beverages here.The rooms are comfortable and clean. But I would give them 5 stars for Excellent customer service! Housekeeping was very nice, the free breakfast was great...Rebecca, the breakfast chef was very friendly and makes a mean omelet and Stephen, the General Manager was very attentive, and friendly to every one. He even jumped our car after we ran the battery down overnight.  Great job!I would give this hotel a much higher rating if the AC in our room had worked.  We were here for a convention and other people said their AC worked fine and others said their room was hot.  Ours was not cool.  I've stayed at other Embassy Suites properties that were far superior to this property.  Nightly bar and snacks were nice.  Breakfast was not overly tasty.All the other bad reviews are sadly true.  It's loud, outdated, overcrowded and dirty.  Worse than that, management doesn't seem to care.  They had a wedding reception going on there but not enough space to host events.  Halls were crowded with rowdy annoying guests.  The pool was filthy and small.  When we complained, management asked us what we wanted them to do about it!  We were told to deal with it.  We told them to keep their room.  We stayed at another nearby chain and much happier.  I'm stunned Hilton allows this place to call itself an Embassy Suites.  Sad, sad, sad.I pose these questions:1) Should a hotel's website indicate that extensive renovation is underway?2) Should the hotel close while said renovations occur?3) Should the hotel offer financial incentive, i.e. discounted rates, to those who stay?Answers: yes, yes and yes.  (Though -- to embellish question 2 -- a shut-down isn't realistic and would cause employees financial hardship.)If you read this review before booking reservations, I suggest you call to determine if the renovation is complete.  When we were there, the path on the main floor, from reception to dining room/bar was in essence a construction site, and dreadfully cold.  Drilling, pounding and other such noises start before 9 a.m. and continue till dinnertime.  They hadn't  worked out plumbing kinks and  throughout the night, we'd hear high pitched squeals.  (No!  Not the neighbors!!  The plumbing!!!)On a positive note, when renovation is complete, the hotel is bound to be beautiful. And from our experience, Embassy Suites generally deliver.  But in November?  Caveat emptor.I'm giving them one star since zero stars isn't an option. This is the worst Hilton property I have ever stayed at. It stared at check in with an unfriendly front desk person. I'm diamond with Hilton so I should have received bottled water and snacks - got nothing. Gave her the benefit of the doubt thinking it was already in the room. nope it wasn't and when I called down it was like I was lying. Got in the room and it was very warm and the shower was dripping. Cranked the air down and it was still warm. Called down - she said there was a problem but they have fixed it so it should be better soon. Took til about 3am to finally get cooler - never cold. And the air conditioner sounds like a 747.And the dripping water? All night long. It's like some kind of Chinese water torture. The Saturday morning breakfast doesn't start til 7:30am and the line is huge because of course people are hungry. The place isn't even clean. I'm telling you I would rather be camping than stay at this hotel again.I came here before my physical prior to enlisting in the Navy and I had a pretty great stay. They are undergoing renovation, CLEARLY, because one of the elevators was blocked and there's a whole lot of wood walls everywhere. There's a restaurant, small gym (with lots of equipment surprisingly), and I believe a bar on the first floor. Not to mention a neat atrium with a huge area filled with tables, chairs, and benches for people to sit. The people there were very friendly and nice, the rooms were spacious and clean (I stayed with a roommated in a room with 2 beds, a kitchen, and living area). So really, can't complain.Staying open during major renovations may not hurt the bottom line of this location financially.  Nevertheless, I'm sure the reputation of this location will take quite a hit for some time to come.Visited this location as part of a professional training.  I was very afraid of what I might find, having not read the reviews until the day before my arrival.  (As a result, I'd even looked up rooms at surrounding hotels in case I'd have to leave.)When I arrived, while it was less bad than I anticipated, it was still pretty bad.  Just imagine street construction in an enclosed hotel.  Yes, that bad.  As I checked in (as well as throughout the day during my stay, which included a great deal during the on-site training), an unseen drill sounded like someone was trying to get to the middle of the earth.  It was kinda silly, really, considering that people pay to stay in hotels for the purposes of being comfortable during their stay.   Not utterly annoyed.  Granted, construction occurs only between the hours of 9am-6pm, but the dust, disarray and alarms are 24/7.It's Mid-March and, apparently, the organizers of the training had been assured by management that these long-lasting renovations would have been completed by now.  They were not.  They will not be for a while either.  The entire atrium is less than half-complete and from what I could see (&amp; thanks to my HGTV-given expertise), a lot of drywall remains to be put up.It's a shame to leave this hotel with such an impression, given that the rooms look gorgeous on the inside.  But it's hard to appreciate that when fire alarms are going off all throughout the day, you're bumping into construction workers constantly, paint dust (it's a thing) &amp; concrete dust is flying everywhere.  By the way, dust and the overall smell of construction lives in the nice new carpets in the rooms after being tracked all through the hotel.  Pros: Huge suites w/ microwave &amp; fridge as well as separated living area and bedrooms.  Many things appear to be upgraded, including tv's, interior furniture &amp; carpeting.  Pleasant staff at check-in, decent on-site restaurant, great hot and cold food complimentary breakfast w/ omelette station, evening complimentary reception with drinks and snacks.(Huge) Cons: Indoor construction with dusty facilities and ridiculous amounts of noise.Cons:  Stiff beds with small, bumpy pillows.Great staff and customer service.  Everyone had a smile and went out of their way to make this trip special.  The evening manager and reception bartender stood out!  I will definitely stay here again.My wife and I stayed at this Embassy Suites 12-15 June 2015 while visiting the Jacksonville, Florida area.  I am a Hilton Honors member and we always try to stay at Embassy Suites due to the exceptional accommodations and service we normally receive.  We did not have a good experience at this hotel.  As soon as we checked in we were told there was a large softball group at the hotel and that it would be a busy weekend.  The softball group seemed to be the hotel's justification for most of the issues we encountered.Some of this was not the hotel's fault, as renovations were taking place and over half of the parking lot was off limits.  We parked at an adjacent parking lot, which was not a major deal, but there were no signs indicating that it was allowed to park at the other business and this was never expressed at check in.  We drove around the limited spaces in Embassy Suites' parking lot for quite some time waiting for someone to leave before I went and asked the front desk who then said we  are allowed to park in the adjacent business' parking lot without being towed.  The front desk said that because of the number of guests with the softball group, that the parking lot was at overfull capacity.Housekeeping was horrible at this location.  We were gone from our room for an entire day, and upon returning at approximately 6pm, nothing had been touched in our room.  My wife called the front desk to inquire about housekeeping missing our room.  She was told that it was probably missed because of the large softball group that was staying at the hotel. They then indicated that they would send someone right up.  After a short while a housekeeper showed up and asked me what the problem was.  I indicated that our room had been missed.  She then asked what I needed?  I again said that the room had not been cleaned.  She asked if I needed towels.  I said that we did, but rather than address my comment about the room not being cleaned she handed me a stack of towels.  I asked if the trash could be taken from the room.  She handed me a garbage bag for me to exchange with the trash that was in the receptacle.  Not that I am above removing trash from my room, but the attitude presented was as if I was putting her out to have her to come to our room regarding a job that was never done in the first place.I didn't address anything to the front desk.  I just dismissed this as everyone has a bad day and maybe today was the housekeepers bad day.My wife and I then went to the manager's reception and this is where the line was drawn.  While visiting at a table, someone from the upper balconies threw an M&amp;M at our table and nearly hit my wife in the face.  I told my wife that we were going to talk to the manager and cancel the rest of our stay and go somewhere else.We spoke with the manager, who was very apologetic but understood our reasons for wanting to leave.  She credited our room and said that she hoped we would give them another chance in the future, and that things weren't normally like this.  It was suggested that possibly some kids from the large softball group may have been responsible for throwing the M&amp;M.We then went to get our bags from our room and call some other hotels to book a stay.  Every hotel that we called was full due to a large Country Music Festival that was being held at Everbank Field.  We decided to finish our stay at Embassy Suites due to this reason.  The hotel manager was kind enough to mail us a voucher for a free night's stay so that we would give this hotel another chance.  We decided to give it another chance, as we have never had bad experiences at any other Embassy Suites that we have stayed at other than this one, so maybe this was just an off weekend for this location. The voucher we received indicates that it is for a free weekend night's stay.  We plan to be in the Jacksonville area again in the near future and will need lodging for four nights.  I called the reservations desk for the Jacksonville Embassy Suites to find out if they would honor the voucher on a weeknight rather than a weekend night.  They said they could not do this.  I said, ""So you are telling me that if your hotel is not fully booked, you would not honor a one night voucher on a weeknight, even though you will have a paying customer for three other nights?""  They said this was correct.  I said ""I will book my stay elsewhere then.""  At this point they went to verify this through a supervisor.  I was placed on hold shortly and upon their return, they confirmed that even if the hotel is not fully booked, they were willing to lose a paying customer for three nights because they would not honor the voucher that was sent to us to cover the fourth night.  In my opinion, this is a very strange and backwards business practice.  With this being said, it doesn't look like this hotel will be getting the second chance that the manager asked of us.We are DIAMOND MEMBERS of the Hilton honors group, with that being said, we stay at many hilton properties all over the world and have never seen a embassy suite ran or managed as poorly as this one. Renovations look like they are still taking place almost a year after what I have read already in the comments, which is absolutely ridiculous during tourist season.Cleaning was worst I have ever seen, I placed our extra blankets in the closet so we did not have to go get them again..(our phone did not work to call the desk) and the cleaning staff actually had the nerve to take them!!! It took them 3 days to get back to us on why our phine was put of service, due to renovations, go figure!! Elevators were slowest I have ever seen, so we took the stairs only to find a sign, ON THE FIRE ESCAPE STAIRS I MIND YOU, to read do not enter construction!! Very u safe!!I will never stay at this embassy suites again!! If there were minus stars they would get a minus 5!!! Very unsatisfiedI arrived to learn that I would be shuttled between rooms during my stay due to renovations.  OK, I can live with that, especially since the conference I was attending was being held at the hotel.The room was damp and dank, with the signature crappy Embassy Suites ventilation.  A veritable Petri dish for Legionnaires' Diesase.  Oh, well, I've stayed in enough Embassy Suites properties that I'm used to their strange and inherently unhealthy HVAC systems.  Room decor of rust and yellow stripes was straight out of an early '70s porno.  The bed was lumpy and dingy with 3 tiny lumpy and dingy pillows that would only be suitable for a dog to sleep on, as long as the dog was small and not prized.  Exhausted, I nodded off, swaddled in stagnant dingyness.The fire alarm first sounded around 0445.  It shut down momentarily, but then continued again for another 15 minutes, rousting the entire hotel into the parking lot.  According to some conversations I overheard, it happens e-v-e-r-y night.  Shouldn't the Jacksonville Fire Marshall have something to say about this?Breakfast was decent and cheerily served.  In fact, the entire staff, from breakfast to front desk was top notch.I attended the conference, but it was a bust.  Poor sound reinforcment equipment coupled with the sounds of renovation made it difficult to participate.I know when to fold a losing hand.  I checked out at noon, never to return.Embassy Suites Jacksonville - Baymeadows is a pox on the Embassy Suites brand.STAY AWAY!Haven't been to Jacksonville on business in a while.  As a loyal Hilton customer, Embassy Suites are usually pretty decent and this one is close to my office.  But this place should really be closed during renovations!  The room isn't all that bad, seems to have been renovated with some new things intermixed with some older things.  But there's a terrible smell throughout the place which I'm guessing is coming from the bright and shiny floor throughout the lobby and atrium.  Looks like some kind of sealer/polish they've put down on the tile.  You can see the difference between the tile floor and the tile on the steps.  It absolutely stinks!  To the point I thought about changing hotels tonight but it's late and I'm tired.  I'll definitely stay somewhere else tomorrow night.  Here's to hoping I don't wake up with a terrible headache.Update the next morning...Looks like housekeeping is questionable as well.  Someone else's hair in the shower, someone had a drink and roasted peanuts which was left in a very prominent garbage can, and one of the hand towels in the bathroom had clearly been used for something.  I'm out of here, never to return.I will not be returning. Tom Getman the director of operations is a nasty racist individual who uses his authority to treat people bad. He made comments to my guest as if he had a problem with black people. If you have stayed there recently you know the site is under construction He stated to my guest ""we have new things here and we want to keep it that way"" as if my guest were going to tear up the place. there were soft ball teams wedding partys just alot going on and i really believe we were singled out. TOM GETMAN DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS NEEDS TO BE DEMOTED!TOM GETMAN @ EMBASSY SUITES BAYMEADOWS RD JAX FL NEEDS TO DEALT WITH....The hotel should be closed during renovations. This place is old, musty &amp; dusty.During a Girl's Weekend, 4 of us traveled 4 hours to find this hotel was very disappointing &amp; does not fit our prior Embassy experience. We switched rooms 3 times. The 1st room smelled old &amp; musty. The white comforters had obviously not been changed in months as there was red lipstick, food and daily handling stains on both beds when we folded back to check the sheets. There was what looked like dried splattered blood on the wall &amp; door of the bedroom. The bathroom ceiling had attempted to be patched. When I asked the front desk how often they changed the linen, the response was ""im not sure about this location, but it should be after every guest"".We were upgraded to the ""Executive Suite"". After what seemed like a 10 minute walk through hard hat construction area to the otherside of the building, the room key did not work. Back we go to the front desk. It was suggested we use the house phone....the old yellowed, what was ivory gadget on the wall? The 2nd room was much smaller than requested, smelled of cigarettes and appeared clean until we looked up at the bathroom ceiling....mold!! I asked an unhappy looking staff in the hall how old was this hotel. His response ""it should be brand new by January.""After apologies and offered 1/2 off the stay, we were met by a staff member to open &amp; inspect room 3. Although dark &amp; still musty, it passed our 1night stay inspection. After we sprayed and used disinfecting wipes, lit a candle, we were ready to get our weekend started.  After a long evening of food &amp; fun, we were awoken at 7am to a fire alarm. Startled, searching for our bras, we made our way to the door, towards the exit next to our room, down a flight of stairs, which led us nowhere. Back up the stairs we go towards another exit....but wait the elevators are working? WTH. So we load the 1 working elevator towards the door...the alarm stops. A hour later the alarm goes off and again 30 minutes later and once more 30 minutes later for the road. If it wasn't for the other ladies that wanted to stay in the area, didnt want the hassle of locating another hotel suite for 4 with Pittsburgh Steelers fans in town, I definitely would have found another hotel. Not even the free cocktails, free breakfast or $50 stay made this worth it. The dry water feature in the atrium has the potential to be nice though.Unfortunately, we stayed at this hotel the week of November 10 at the suggestion of our clients as the proximity to their office was desirable. I was originally put in a room back in the ""executive building"" far away from the rest of my team, but decided to check it out before requesting to move. This back building is a hike from the rest of the hotel and you must go through a construction zone past all of the working and not working/smoking workers to get there. This building obviously hasn't been updated in a very long time and felt more like a retirement home/rehab facility than a hotel. The beds are very low to the ground, the cabinetry and furniture was very worn and dusty - not at all what I would expect from this class of hotel. After requesting to be moved to a room in the main building, I was very happy to find that my new room had recently been refurbished and while it still smelled of paint/chemicals, it was much better than the alternative. As for the rest of the main building, the lobby is very dusty and there are makeshift ramps and boarded up sections. After all of this, I really could have dealt with it, understanding that all that is part of the process of renovation...then I got sick. I came back to the hotel around noon on Wednesday feeling like death, fever, vomiting, etc... and just wanted to sleep. However, the construction was going on directly above or below (not sure which) my room. The noise was such that I was unable to sleep even with earplugs and my coworker who was attempting to speak to a coworker on the phone had to actually leave the building and go outside. I called the front desk and after being asked to hold three times, I asked if there was any possible way the workers could work on another room that wasn't right next to me and while they did offer to see if they could move me, I was in no condition to pack up all my stuff and move rooms. The jackhammering that literally felt like it was going to come through my ceiling was not a pleasant thing to deal with at the time, but I understand that most people are not at the hotel during the day. If you plan to be, stay somewhere else. A few other things to mention...My coworker came back to her room around 5:30pm only to find there was a maid who was just beginning to clean her room. We had been gone since 8:00am that day.Depending on who checks you in, you'll get wildly different service. I left the hotel around 3am to catch an early flight and there was no attendant at the front desk, so I called the next week to ask for a receipt. When I mentioned why I needed it emailed, I was very promptly cut off and corrected and told that there was always someone at the front desk and I should have rung the bell if I needed something. All in all, the hotel is in no condition to provide a restful or productive stay and the staff really don't care much. You get what you get and you don't throw a fit....that's what I tell my 3 year old (but then again, they aren't paying $150/night to live in my house).Heavy renovation going on. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. It smells and it's not easy getting around the hotel.Right off the highway. Ok on weekdays absolutely never stay friday or Saturday night. This hotel becomes a kids party zone with each room having dozens of kids. This has happened to me three of the last four weekends. Forget the complimentary breakfast when the line is a dozen deep. on the weekdays despite the construction this place is ok and well located.","I stayed here for a work trip and survived.  As a loyal Hilton member, I chose this hotel as Embassy Suites tend to have more room and a decent free breakfast.  Hotel is pretty dated and run down. When I checked in, right when I opened the door of my room, a whaff of cigarette smoke/mustiness blew in my face.  I called the front desk to change rooms, and my second one was better.  Apparently they don't have smoking rooms, yet they don't  implement the no smoking rule or check to see if the room smells like smoke for other guests.  Gym was your typical hotel gym- small with only 2 treadmills and free weights.  Because I shared a rental, the location is near some places to eat.  There's a barbeque place called 4 Rivers Smokehouse which was decent.  Breakfast was alright.  I've had better at other Embassy Suites. The coffee was pretty horrible; very weak.  If I came back to Jacksonville, I probably wouldn't come back to this hotel.This hotel is the worst one I've ever been to, the renovations are still going on, the elevators are terrible, the quilt that was on my bed when I checked in was nasty with orange looking spots on it and long black hairs all over and I know they were not mine, so I call the front desk and they said they would bring me another one.. hours later and nothing so I call again, hours later and still nothing, finally I call again and at 10 at night they finally decide to bring the quilt but the new quilt they brought was disgusting as well so I didn't even bother calling again, I was over it! And don't even get me started on housekeeping, I had left the next morning to explore Jacksonville I left at 10am, I got back at 4-5pm and they still hadn't got to my room yet, I was fit to be tied, housekeeping was terrible, and the the pool area was a hot mess, the hot tub wasn't working and it was flooding the whole area! Chances are this hotel is independently owned because I highly doubt that the Embassy Suites chain would not have allowed this kind of nonsense, never again will I stay here and I'm making sure to let everyone I know NOT to stay here....horrible!I was in Jax for a week working, my boss picked this place. It is old and dated, had the option to play N64 through my TV. If your on the north side you will hear I-95 and Baymeadows most of the night. Beds were comfy, so it cannot be too bad. Managers happy hour was actually serving Shiner Bock so you don't lave to drink Bud/Miller light. Within walking distance is an Orlando favorite 4Rivers Smokehouse, but let's be honest, it's Jacksonville and you could throw a rock and find great BBQ. I was excited for a taste of home and no crazy line. When traffic is not aweful, easy access to I-95. And you are downtown rather quickly, again if traffic is cooperating.A bit disappointing.The atrium is nice although the water features were dry. The first attempts entering our room where frustrating until we discovered the door handle is broken and only works in one direction now. Hotel repair staff said a lot of the doors now do that and did not fix it.The first micro-fridge was leaking but was promptly replaced. The ceiling above the tub had obvious water damage and an active leak plugged by napkins. The pull out bed mattress is not recommended for use, even for children. Breakfast area had a wide variety and standard quality for free hotel breakfast. A positive. In case you missed it from their adds:  You have to pay extra for wifi. Staff was friendly and courteous. The staff indicated this hotel which is much in need of remodeling and repair will soon occur based on vacancies.Not the best of Embassy Suite can offer. Yes the hotel is dated. Furniture is dated.. Bath room is small and cramped... But the bed is comfy... Too bad for the pillow.. Not sure why thd pillow is so small. Breakfast is acceptable... But i do wish thd beacon is thicker.. Its so thin.. You dont feel it at all.We really enjoyed this place. The entrance was pretty bad ass. They had an open floor plan where all the rooms are around a big open area with tables to eat at and a gazebo. It was designed to look like you were ""outside"" when you inside. I like stuff like that. We booked on expedia and got one of the last rooms since we were there for the Jacksonville Bank Marathon. Our room was HUGE. It even had a 10 person conference table with chair which we didn't need, but was cool since we could lay our all our race stuff. There was also FREE breakfast (nothing fancy) and FREE Drinks during Happy Hour (house liquor). You can't beat the room and amenities for the price.That all being said, the rooms definitely need to be renovated. Nothing wrong with them, they are just due for a new look.This is a large hotel conveniently located off I95 for both business and family. Overall, a tired property in need of refresh, investment and improved maintenance.Pluses: Breakfast made to order; complimentary Happy Hour, 5:30 - 7:30; and Wi-Fi at the hotel that works well.Minuses: Dingy, no outdoor pool, very few balconies you can use, no luggage carts in the back of the hotel, and overall a tired property. As a frequent Hilton guest, this property needs renovation and better upkeep.Proof:  Double door lock failed to lock twice, and emergency escape instructions on back of door were for a different floor and different room. Really!The Hilton standards inspector must have seen nothing. He/she could referee wrestling.Tip:  Stay in the back of the hotel for more quiet.If you think this review with photos is useful, funny or cool, I'd appreciate ur feedback by clicking below.Yuck! I smelled mold in our room. My husband smelled saw dust. It's the kind of room you don't want to take off your socks in fear of what is hidden from the naked eye on the floor. The kind of place you question the top cover on your bed. Did I say yuck?Really? An Embassy Suites Hilton that offers no free wifi unless you are gold or diamond Hilton Honors?  In a mediocre part of Jax? Curt front desk staff?I travel about 80 nights a year, will not come back and recommend no one stay here. Oh yeah...it's a business hotel but breakfast doesn't start until 7:30am. Hilton is sliding fast on my charts.Outdated. Great prices. Paid 89 dollars on a Friday night on Easter weekend. Rooms were clean but old. Still can't beat the price with included breakfast buffet.Good place for business travelers and corporate events.  The staff is nice and helpful.Nice stay.  Clean room.What you expect from these chain hotels.I enjoyed the 5:30 - 7:00 Happy Hour.The Sangria was nice and helped put me to bed :-)The morning breakfast was perfect.I had my omelet made to order.Plenty of juices to choose from.A great way to start my mornings.One star off for not calling me for the requested ""Wake Up Call"".Good thing I'm not a good sleeper when traveling and had woken myself up anyways.I did take the tip to request a room at the new part of the hotel.The rooms were clean, but still dark.... cant' imagine what the older rooms look like.All in all a good stay at this conveniently located Embassy Suites.I was very unhappy and disappointed in this hotel.  My boyfriend and I was looking for a nice getaway place not far from Atlanta but near a beach to call our mini vacation spot and this was our first stop.  Based on this experience it will definitely be crossed off of our possible locations.  Upon checking in we're told that we qualified for an upgrade because I travel a lot and always stay at a Hilton brand hotel, when as soon as I open the door to our room I Thought I was at a Howard Johnson or Days Inn and not an Embassy Suites Hotel, it was that bad.  The furniture is outdated and poor in quality and the room smelled.  The carpet was dirty and the restroom didn't have enough towels for 2 people to shower.  We checked in early so we though we still had time for breakfast because at other Embassy's breakfast is served until 10:30, well this hotel stopped serving at 9:30am. So that was out!Later on that night we decided to try the manager's reception for cocktails and the drinks were awful and watered down, which was so unnecessary because they were already serving very cheap liqour to begin with and it made both of us sick. I have never had such poor service at an Embassy hotel and this hotel should just sell to a Ramada or Motel 6 because it is definitely not up to Embassy standards!!!!!!!!So we decided to just make the best of it because it was father's day weekend and we wanted to enjoy it.  Well that didn't happen either, we were up until 2am because some kids kept running down the halls and shaking handles then running away All night, we had to call the front desk 3 times.When we did finally check out and voice our concerns after all that they gave a $40 credit on a 3 day stay,  I guess they feel like that was doing us a favor, we Will Not Be Returning!!!!!!Stopped here on my way back home.  Seems like all Embassy Suites need some major updating.  This one clearly has seen it's hey day.  Rooms just felt dated and old.  Somewhat cheap.  Main lobby area and open area was very humid as if the A/C wasn't working.  Breakfast was nothing to write home about.  Best part was the free drinks.This hotel gets the job done. Happy hour from 530-730 is a nice perk. We stayed here for a week long business trip. There is a distinct difference in cleanliness and room quality between the old and new sections. Some of my colleagues were in the new section (7 floors) and I stayed in the old. Cleanliness was less than to be desired for a 90/ night hotel. Breakfast was pretty good with lots of variety. You have to pay 10/day for internet if you are not a Hilton rewards member. Bottom line is that If I was traveling to this area again, I'd look somewhere else.Checked in and had to change rooms 3 times at 1am. Rooms keep getting worse. From wet floor, leaking faucets, extremely noisy a/c ,bad smell, baby size pillow, etc etc you get the picture. Should have been given a full refund instead was offered 10,000 points, which help me how ?? I've stayed manyyyy times at Embassy around the world and this is the very worst. Excuse was construction, why don't they even mention that anywhere in the website so we can be informed? Either way what does construction have to do with offering a decent, odor free, adult size , leak proof  room? Disappointed beyond belief. Will be filing complaint with cooperate office .  Please don't stay there. You've been warned.This hotel is not up to the Hilton standards.  It looks grandiose when you walk in; they have good reception from 5:30 to 7:30 and a good breakfast as well in the morning.  The rooms however once you enter in are very dirty and look old.  It is right to say that they are similar to the ones you will find in Motel 8.  The hotel just seems very dull and depressing.  I will not be staying here again after my first visit.  The Wi Fi is free but only for HHonors Member or AT&amp;T members, it is slow as well.  I would not recommend this hotel.Rooms are large - Staff at front desk is great except Blonde older women with accent- She is unfriendly, not very willing to help and I think has been there too long to understand that she is the 1st impression. On the other hand the rest of the desk staff cannot do enough to help and the manager was very friendly and helpful. Someone needs to have a talk with this women.Great lobby, food, happy hour etc...  Thanks for the serviceAffordable. Clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff. Lots of amenities. Easily accessible. Abundant parking. All you can eat breakfast, which I made liberal use of. We had a major water leak in our room when we checked in. They were not as prompt to move us as I would have cared for, but did so upon request. My cousins wedding was here. Everything went quite well. I would stay here again, given the option.This place is dated to say the least, dirty broken old also describes it   Bad customer service even for diamond members.  Desk clerk just a kid.   Could be the night I got here but it was packed full of kids and noisy.  We didn't leave the room after we got in.  Deck was dirty. Bathroom put together with tape and rusty.  Think it is time to burn this place and rebuild.    Very disappointed in Hilton for this one.","Dirty and worn out, but at least the bed was comfortable and breakfast pretty good.  Not many choices in this part of Jax so this is the ""best of the worst"" in my opinion.Awful.  This once proud hotel doesn't look like it has been touched by a renovation in a decade.  The rates were cheap which seemed inviting for a family traveling through the area and, yes, it was generally pretty clean.  However, I'll start with the pull out bed which had no blanket and no extra pillows.  Required two separate calls to the front desk.  Each visit by someone took 20+ minutes (for what should have been stocked already).  The room shows signs of wear everywhere you look but the biggest debacle was the breakfast.  You couldn't be any cheaper with their breakfast.  At 8:30, they were out of bacon, sausage and fruit loops.  The orange juice was so watered down that I thought my son was messing around with me when he asked me to taste it (never trust a 10 year who says ""eat this"" or ""smell this"").  They also had no forks.  Every table in the breakfast area was covered with garbage from previous diners.  It was truly terrible.The good... Lovely &amp; well maintained atrium and all suite hotel. Food and service at the Omaha Steakhouse was good. The bad. Rooms are a bit dated as is the building, staff is mostly young and seemingly inexperienced. We were there for a birthday party and the catering staff was not ready with the food that was ordered. The ceiling was leaking on the dance floor. The food and service at the breakfast buffet was awful. There was a slew of rowdy kids staying at the hotel and making a royal ruckus and mess of the place. Playing hide and seek across all levels and screaming and throwing food at each other. There were no parents or hotel staff attempting to reign in the little brats.  We would not stay here again and would not recommend this facility for events.I'll go back because the wine is better than the Residence Inn. Overall, it is hard to find a reliably clean, well-serviced hotel in this part of Jacksonville. They're all iffy. Why?Overall - very comfortable. Service in the free happy hour is really good.Sometimes the rooms and hallways are clean, sometimes not. Sometimes there are plenty of towels and washcloths; this time I had one washcloth (for 3 days) and no bathmat. Sometimes there is a packet to make coffee, sometimes only decaf.Rooms in the #15-#10 area are noisy-airconditioning and other hotel machinery is outside that area. E.g. Room 310, room 711 - too noisy to sleep well.Rooms on the street-side get noisy early, Baymeadows is a major thoroughfare,Rooms in the ""executive"" area at the back are different, but it was nice and QUIET back there. That's what I'll ask for again.This hotel is a stopping point for young men and women on their way to military service. They are not allowed to frequent the free happy hour, and have a separate dining area. They generally are reserved and keep to themselves. But sometimes the quality of the rooms reflects this audience.Great sushi delivered from Sushi House!!!Stayed at this hotel for a work event - big mistake! Customer service is poor, they never answer the phone at the front desk. They also charge $10 for wi-fi per day despite Hilton's advertising free wi-fi throughout their hotel chains. I should have read the reviews before selecting this hotel. First and last time I stay at this hotel.The worst embassy suites I have stayed in...no competition.We stayed in 3 ES properties to and from our vacation in Florida...and I'm pretty sure I won't be staying in one again unless it's the only option.  I counted in one pass through the atrium...3 family reunions...and a wedding.  The hallway outside the pool (same that you have to use to get to the elevator) was slick with water from the children running (and yelling) in and out of the pool area.   Worse, nobody from the hotel seemed to care that the rest of their guests wouldn't find this entertaining, there was no attempt to curb the behavior.  Maybe this is the new 'target client' for embassy suites.  If so, then message heard...we won't be back.The AC in the room would not cool the room down...even as I sit here writing this after a night in the room, it's still hot in here.  The bathroom has yellow growths on the ceiling, and something is wrong with the water.  It tastes and looks wrong.For families, the rooms only offer 2 doubles.  I assume that's because the bedroom area is too small to hold 2 queens, but even so that's substandard.  I haven't seen 2 doubles in a hotel room since I don't know when.  The minimum is 2 queens.Worst of all...i wasted 35,000 Hilton points on this dump.Nice and clean but for an embassy suites the walls are thin. You can hear the toilet flush in the room above you among other things.This is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed. I feel like I in a stadium.. Cant sleep.. closed the drapes and doors.. still If you are coming for business find another hotelCleanliness is bad and mgmt really doesn't care!!!  First time I stayed I found a hunk of mold that was about 2 inches in diameter floating in the water tank of coffee maker.  When I complained, they said they just got these coffee makers and they are still training their people to clean the water tank.  I understand mistakes happen so i stayed there again.  Guess what... stale water in the water tank of the coffee maker again.  I decided to run the coffee maker with no coffee grounds - bright yellow water.  When, I complained, it took 2 days to respond and when they did, they called to apologize that my room wasn't clean and for me to call them explain what wasn't clean about it.  I gave one star since I could have gotten sick and you don't mess up when it comes to what people eat or drink.",,,"['week', 'business', 'trip', 'understand', 'going', 'remodeling', 'upon', 'arrival',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-jacksonville-hotel-jacksonville-2,Omni Jacksonville Hotel,3.5,$$$,77,"Stayed at the Omni for one night while in town for a concert on a Friday. I was drawn to this upscale establishment because of all that it offered. Location to the Veterans Stadium where the concert was. It is also close to the Landing area. Both are situated off the river. Next was the amenities that are provided. Restaurant, in room service, not a normal but awesome late check out option (5 p.m. checkout at a cost that was worth it). All the extras that you could want are selectable while making reservations online.I had non-smoking king suite. it was spacious and functional.  You get the typical creature comfort like a closet (with a safe, iron, iron boards, starch which was a plus, wood hangers and a laundry bag), a dresser that has a 32"" TV atop of it, refrigerator that has a variety of assorted liquor shot size bottles and candy snacks (but you have to get a key for and pay for what you take), there's a desk with chair and lastly there was a chair wit a ottoman. The bathroom was clean and spacious with the basic tub with stall with a shower head. there was plenty space on the counter to spread your beautification items (in my case my lady arts and craft tools). The water was perfect and didn't take long to heat up. On this stay I purchased the option to have breakfast in bed. And it was amazing and fulfilling.  I think my only complaints were that room service disturbed me while I was utilizing staying later as I paid for late checkout. They also were extremely loud while cleaning the room next to mines as I tried to sleep in. Lol! Nothing major and it was over quick but still annoying. I will definitely stay again if ever in town because the whole experience was great from valet parking to check in to checking out.This review is specifically for The Dinner Detective Interactive Murder Mystery Dinner Show that takes place on the 2nd floor inside of the Omni Hotel. First of all, was it a horrible time? No. Was it worth the money? No! Would I go again? Not unless it was free. Needless to say I went in with a lot higher expectations than I should have. I just assumed for $64.95 + 14.55% in taxes &amp; service fees per person we would have had a better show. Lets get right to business! ...Check-in for the show begins at 6pm..once you get there make sure at least one person from your party has their id because they do verify the tickets. After you check in you have to make up a ""name"" of a person you want to be for a night &amp; wear it as a name badge. This was particular difficult for me I don't know why. I ended up being Vanna White &amp; my bf Harrison Ford. They take your picture &amp; later on during the dinner and show try to sell it to you for $35.. (yea..no thanks!)Once you enter the private room they have several tables set up with 10 people at each. Again not really what I had imagined. I was thinking the room would be decorated and we would all be sitting at a long rectangular table when someone got murdered! lol It felt more like a banquet dinner. They had a chips and salsa bar as you waited for the show to start. Drinks are not included not even soda. A liquor drink was $8 a piece, a bud light/corona was $6 and a can soda was $4. They also ONLY take cash just FYI!!The service &amp; the food were both good. I had the chicken dinner which included a whole grilled chicken leg, red bliss potatoes and a squash medley. Before the meal you were also served a salad as well as bread. Dessert included cheesecake which was also pretty good. My main reason for giving 2 stars was the show. To be completely blunt it just sucked. It felt like a couple college kids got together and tried to make a murder mystery show and it was just lacking in a lot of areas and extremely cheesy. If you picked the murderer &amp; a good description of why you thought they were the murderer you won $100 at the end which was pretty cool. Another reason for my two stars was one of the ladies at my table was extremely rude &amp; annoying. The butler picked up my salad plate that I had eaten off but there were a few tomatoes left and when he started walking off with it she said ""excuse me,"" took the plate from him and finished eating off my plate. Ew!I do hear there are Groupon deals of this event around for around $85 for 2 people and also comes with a mug so I would look into that first before paying regular price for a ticket!!It's ok if you don't consider it an upscale hotel and just think of it like a Days Inn. That's about the level of customer service you'll get. Room was dated and a bit run down (and very dark). Customer service was very hit or miss. Room wasn't ready when I arrived. When I was checking in (late afternoon) their phones were ringing with dissatisfied guests asking when their rooms would be serviced. I just skipped service since I was only there two nights, but I can confirm it came very late in the day when people were trying to get ready for dinner.  Icing on the cake was the bogus ""mini bar charge"" on my credit card that showed up days later, even though I never touched the mini bar. They reversed it when I called to ask about it...but that kind of crap just makes the whole operation seem slimey.  Silver lining was the room was pretty steeply discounted ($130). I certainly wouldn't pay more than that for it.Don't believe the views in the photos! They were clearly done with trick photography. My view of the parking lot was excellent, however!The property is very nice, clean and centrally located. It is next to a convention center and the Jacksonville Landing, which if you reference my review of it you will find out it sucks! You are next to the St Johns River which is pretty cool. You see minutes to the Five Points area that has lots to do.I did really like the quiet, comfortable hotel that is clean and pretty luxurious-feeling. I travel quite a bit but I haven't stayed at many Omni properties. It has a bar and restaurant inside, and they provide a list of nearby restaurants and entertainment.Jacksonville is a really decent city and this is a place is stay again!Super top notch Hotel in the Jacksonville area. We were put up in this hotel for one night and I'm totally glad we didn't stay anywhere else! The Omni is exactly what many hotels should model themselves after. Exquisite service, a cool decor &amp; beautiful spacious rooms. I loved the clean lobby which had a cool modern vibe decor that made the place look very chic and upscale.The room we stayed in had two queen beds, was very spacious and had a nice writing table that looked very study and clean. The interior room also had dark furniture which if I were buying new furniture for my home I would probably think about purchasing myself.I would highly recommend this place to any future guests as the staff were very accommodating to our needs - Thank you! The lobby also had a cool water dispenser with fresh oranges for flavor which was a nice touch. The hotel bar was also very modern looking and had a nice drink selection at the bar.For hotels in the Jacksonville area the OMNI truly is one of the best!We got invited to perform for a wedding and got to stay at this lovely hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 12 luckily the rest if the group arrived at the same time. The event organizer a book six rooms for the entire group and luckily we got the rooms early and was able to get some rest before the performance. Ome of the best feature of the hotel is the security of the guest that no one can access the hotel rooms without a key to get on the elevator. Felt secure. the room was amazing. With a bar and all the alter in the room. I Had a comfortable sleep after our peformance.And it close to the landing where you can just walk around for food and shops!For an Omni hotel, I was definitely disappointed with the place. It is in desperate need of remodel. To begin with, we checked in and were informed that the pool was not open, but could walk the 3 blocks down to the Hyatt and use theirs.. We booked the hotel for the fact it HAD a rooftop pool. The website did not mention that the pool was closed, as apparently it sprung a leak and suddenly had to be fixed. After explaining that this is unacceptable, we received a lower nightly rate, and headed to our room... WHICH WAS LOCATED NEXT TO THE POOL. Literally, our sliding glass doors were on the pool deck. Super awkward room, I had the curtains drawn the whole time, as if anyone were outside smoking, or if the pool would have been open, you would have had no privacy.The walls are super thin, and we were awoken several times by our noisy neighbors. The only reason this place gets 2 stars is the staff. The manager was very apologetic about the pool situation, and two different front desk staffers warmly welcomes us each time we entered the hotel. Kudos to you for the customer service! FYI - The location is... not ideal. If you are here for the night for a football game, by all means book the hotel. If you are staying here because you are vacationing in Jacksonville, I recommend looking elsewhere.Had some major issues this my stay but after talking with their corporate offices and the location management, they comp'd a full night and parking. They seems to realize the issues we had and seemed to actually care about fixing them. I will probably give them another chance and stay again when in town.Nice hotel, and the location is phenomenal. It is close to the Landing, which can make getting to the hotel a pain if there is an event going on. For the money, however, I expected a few amenities (free WiFi should be standard these days) that weren't included. Also, I've stayed several times at the Hyatt Regency a few blocks away, and it is much nicer and less expensive.3.5 stars...counter agent has a certain arrogance, not real endearing after travelling for 16 hours...great parking staff, great room service, bistro was out of certain items offered on their menuStopped for drinks after a show last night. Wasn't too busy. Waiters let us sit there forever before begrudgingly waiting on us. Took a while to get 5 drinks. 2 people ordered Irish Coffee which they brought and it tasted like 2 day old coffee grinds. Totally not drinkable. When they brought them back to the older, female bartender with the blond hair she rudely said ""well what do you expect it's coffee!"" Rolled her eyes and went to wait on others. No ""I'm sorry."" No ""would You like another one or something different."" Everyone at the table tasted it and it was disgusting. Waiter was slightly nicer and came over after the bartender complained to him that we complained about the drinks. Felt like a Red Roof Inn rather than the OMNI. Yikes. Time for a new bartender less full of herself and more Focused on customer service. Would never go back.On the positive side, the service here was amazing and very attentive. However, I know that they are so good because I had so many problems when first arriving. My room had a mysterious wet spot on the carpet and a backed up shower. Disgusting! I can't believe these things escaped the notice of the cleaning staff, and it made it a little hard to get comfortable. For such a nice hotel, I was surprised at these lapses. However, the staff was very helpful in resolving the issues, and the downstairs JBar was pretty good!I guess this is as good as it gets in Jacksonville.corporate clients must keep it going.dated rooms.tub shower combo is so ten years ago.well trained staff.bed was soft.PROS-staff very friendlyCONS-rooms very small and cramped-hotel was dirty-ice vending was broken-charged for basic wifi-room lighting was very badWould not stay here again.Worst hotel experience I've ever had. Service was terrible. The ladies at the front desk were annoying and condescending. Way way overpriced.Beautiful hotel and attentive reception staff. The hotel is close to the Jacksonville Landing so you're close to food and shopping. The hotel and rooms are outstanding. The parking is relatively good prices you have a few choices. I wish they would have explained how to use the elevators a little better cause a lot of my group got confused or stuck on the elevator because you have to slide your card to activate the buttons but it isn't very conspicuous and while I was in the elevator with a bell hop he neglected to explain how it work and simply smiled when I couldn't get the buttons working. Great location very close to the heart of the city and only 30 minutes from JAX beaches.I've never stay in a room at the Omni but I went to a room someone had reserved to sell sheet sets and the room was beautiful I know they take good care of you while you are there in the lobby they have fruit, coffee and puuch for the customers the desk clerks are very friendly even if you are just walking through the hotel and it is so clean.I am here for business only 2days.... hotel staff...from the front desk to the cleaning are so sweet and helpful...all is great, it is a older hotel..but been kept up....and the shower is a real shower, if u know what I mean.Simple yet cute rooftop pool. There's a telephone for bar/food service, but we decided to avoid the extra service fees and order downstairs.This is a beautiful Hotel in the heart of downtown Jacksonville, Florida. It is one block away from the Jacksonville Landing, they Skyway, and the beautiful Saint John's River. The Omni is connected with the Enterprise Bldg.. Juliette's Restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat for a quick lunch, but even better for dinner. They have a daily Monday-Friday Lunch buffet for about $10.00. Not bad for the different variety of foods you have to choose from, with a chef their to cook special dishes for you with your choice of foods. I go here for days I feel the need to ""treat myself"" days. You also have a menu to order from, if buffets are not you cup of tea. They also have a full bar. I highly recommend this place to any who wants to dine with style. We also have our Christmas dinners here for the company I work for. They have always done a perfect job. If you have a bad meal, they want to know and will make it right for you. A dish I had one time was too salty and the gave me something in place of that dish.","We got a great rate day of.  Came for the Harry Connick, Jr. concert at the Union-Times Moran Theater.  Literally right across the street from the hotel.  We joked that it took us 1 minute and 31 seconds to get there.  The young man at the front desk was courteous, efficient and had us in a nice room within minutes.  The room was nicely appointed, perfect temperature and very clean.  My one little gripe is that the maid woke us up at 8:28.  In her defense we did not have our privacy sign out, but still that was early.Check out was a breeze with 2 coffees in hand, our valet brought the car, offered to load and sent us off with a wish for a pleasant day.We will be back.Nicely appointed rooms with a view of the River, and an airy atrium with friendly bartender and highly decent breakfast buffet. I'd definitely return.The recent review from Jon is nothing like what I experienced. The valet was super friendly and the front desk was just as sweet. The man who handles the luggage is the same man and even remembered me from my last visit (2nd time here for this year). The room is a little dark but has large space, clean bathroom and comfortable bed. The pool area was a little plain and small but I still really enjoyed my stay. The soaps and shampoos smell nice enough to use at home. The gym was very clean, has modern equipment, towels, disposable headphones and a water jug. The gym connects to the pool, which can be kind of annoying since people walk in and out every once in awhile.The restaurant on site has pretty good food and full bar. There is room service and the breakfast (10-$15) was a nice splurge since the rooms do not have kitchenettes. There is a store but hours aren't posted so if it is slow, they may not be opened or on break. The parking is valet or a private lot without re-entry. I went with valet, which was 20 bucks a night. Chance of return: 90%The Omni was nice. Best water pressure I've ever had in a hotel. The staff was very nice.  The room was clean, Kureg coffee machine and Wolfgang Puck coffee is nice.  I know I keep saying 'nice' but that's all it was, nice.  The parking situation is not the best. You either pay $20 a night for valet parking or $10 a day in the lot BUT if you leave the lot you pay the $10 and if you leave and come back the same day you pay again so valet is probably your best bet. The area is not nice. We went to River Walk which is like a block away and had 2 different people ask us for money, one asked for a cigarette.  I would not feel comfortable walking around at night for sure and we actually left a day early because my husband did not want to leave his truck parked in the lot overnight. I had driven up a day early in a rented car and didn't care about that but after spending the day in the area he did not want to take a chance parking in the lot.  I was attending an event at the hotel so I was kinda stuck there. But I would not go back and stay in that hotel again just because the area is yucky.Well, I initially started to give this place a better review, but when you mess with someone's finances, you have a problem. I am not happy at all. They leave a lot to be desired when it comes to their billing. FIRST, let me, a customer, tell you how this works --- when you call and go thru the timefull process of giving all of your information to make your reservation waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay in the beginning including giving your account and debit/ credit card information, don't expect to be charged like you would think. Don't expect someone to tell you with courtesy that you will be charged upon arrival. Don't expect any information on the billing, check-in, process, or anything... Don't expect crap. YOU WON'T GET IT. What you will get is someone pretending to charge your card and act like everything is normal when it's not. Then, when you get to the hotel, they charge you. Then they hold another charge on the room and then they add money to the card!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a mess! Then, you go to clear it up and management tells you, ""Yeah, it's a problem we have..."" no kidding! NO KIDDING! Try charging people when they call. Perhaps that is the reason why they are calling when they call is to reserve and PAY for their room. UGH. #PostingDivaLike this hotel. The lady at the front desk was very friendly when we checked in. Close to greyhound bus station.Nice hotel but the pool facilities suck!  Get more lounge chairs!  The rooms are nice and good amenities in the bathroom but it was not enough to overcome the sucky pool situation.The location for the hotel is a great especially if you're going across the street to the times for him for a show. Unfortunately there is really nothing within walking distance as far as restaurants or entertainment. As far as the room, it is a step above basic and very comfortable. I did experience a problem in which there was a piece of used chewing gum attached to the soap that they had placed in our room. It appears that they had put new carpetin recently which is great but unfortunately it was pilled up and really needed to be vacuumed quite badly. The stuff and valet were very nice and the chicken was very efficient and easy.Great, thoughtful and welcoming employees throughout the entire hotel. Restaurant is OK, but service is A+.We came for a birthday weekend (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) as a change of pace from what we usually do to celebrate at the Omni at Championsgate. While I am glad to have tried something new I found myself comparing everything about this hotel to the one at Championsgate.We checked in at 1 AM and were greeted by valet who was absolutely a delight considering it was so late. Check in went well and within 5 minutes or thereabouts we got the keys and the bell boy assisted us to our room for the weekend.Upon settling in for the night I realized as a Select Guest I only got one instead of two morning complimentary beverage tickets. Select Guest Gold Members get one for each night of their stay. I was okay with that because we were planning to go out for breakfast anyway. We had booked with our reservation their ""Home Away From Home"" package for out four legged family member. Unfortunately, we never received anything and upon check out we were billed for it anyway. I will get to more on that later.The hotel itself was beautiful give or take a few quirks. The bathroom and closet doors stuck and made annoying sounds when opened or shut. The windows didn't seem to have proper sealing because they made funny sounds. The room was immaculate, we had plenty of towels, but the two double beds I had booked my reservation for was changed at some point for one king. The river walk view wad replaced by tall buildings and a parking lot. Not only did we get robbed of two beds but my dog was forced to sleep between us because he was without the dog bed he was promised. Valet parking was $20/night instead of the $20 for the duration of your stay as stated on the website. We were also billed $60 plus $10 extra every night for our furry family member instead of the standard $50 one time fee.The pool was nice but small and quaint but to my surprise no hot tub. The fitness center was well equipped for the small space it was located in. A perk was that it was indeed 24 hours for us insomniacs. Would we return? Maybe. We love traveling and staying at Omni because of their attention to detail and the way they make you feel welcome. We just aren't sure about Omni Jacksonville just yet.The hotel itself was nice, the staff was very friendly and the room was clean. The bathroom was dated but everything worked. I chose the hotel because they allowed pets and I was forced to spend the night in Jacksonville due to horrible traffic during a long travel day. They charge you $50 extra for a dog for the first night and $10 extra for each additional night. It doesn't come with a treat, a toy, water bowl or anything it is strictly for cleaning....fine. When it comes for the dog to relieve themselves there is no place for them to do so. The hotel is all concrete outside. There is a small flat parking lot with grassy parking medians that we had to make due however there were no waste bags or trash cans to be found....obviously this is an issue in a pet friendly hotel.In addition they offer a best rate promise if booked through their website. BEWARE of the fine print as they do all they can to get out of honoring it. I would have saved $10 per night through trip advisor, hotels, orbitz, expedia, ect but chose to use their website thinking they would match the price and not have to pay the third parties any fees. I figured I was helping them out and saving them money, I was wrong. Their customer service department was quick to point out I needed to book three days in advance to get the price match promise. They call it policy, I call it used car salesman tactics. For the guy above that said it had a ""Las Vegas Vibe""....no, no it doesn't it's Jacksonville there are a few subpar bars across the street, there are plenty of druggies and homeless around the corner. The people frequenting those bars are less than desirable. It is nothing like Vegas...Business travelers - AVOID. If you need to use Internet for your job and it is important for your stay at a hotel, avoid this hotel like the plague. Internet speeds are 8% of what is advertised, and  there's nothing they can or will do to fix this. Sure, you can demand a refund downstairs. But wouldn't you rather stay at an honest hotel that has working services so that you can actually use your room?The business center is even worse. $6.95 every fifteen minutes for a download rate of 147 kbps. Super nice employees here but its ridiculous. I can't believe that Omni isnt upgrading this hotel.Not a fun stay for how expensive it is.- Dark, old feel room in a bad way.  It didn't smell fresh.- Pillows were linty which made them seem dirty- Wake up call at 6am I didn't ask for.-Ahi tuna came drizzled with wasabi sauce, not described on menu, which made it inedible.  I thought it was avocado based, there was so much of it.  -Tiniest most awkward fitness center. I don't expect a lot from hotels in this area but this was ridiculous.  There is no way to work out if more than 3 people trying to use machines / weights at same time.  - Wrong items brought for breakfastAt first, the hotel looks really nice and exquisite. Even the lobby looks expensive, but , that's not the case. We got double beds, and there was a lot of little hairs on the sheets. The pillow cases were also too big for the pillows, which made them look really messy and not neat at all. Ps the pillows inside were yellow(stained). When I entered the bathroom , I saw that one of the towels had a lipstick stain on it (no one had used the bathroom yet). I thought ""Eh I guess it's okay if it's a stain and it's not dirty"" , but I took at piece of toilet paper and rubbed it onto the lipstick and it EASILY came off. I was pretty grossed out to say the least...Then, I looked into the shower, and the inside curtain was stained yellow and brown in many places. THEN, when we were walking out of the hotel at night to go look around the shopping area nearby, we saw the employees fighting and smoking out in the front, it was very unprofessional. (Some of them still had their uniforms on)Amazing place to stay when in Jax. It's right next to the Landing, has great views of the river, yummy room service. Only downer was having to pay for WiFi. Would go back here anyway!By far one of my favorite hotels to stay in. The only downfall is parking, otherwise it's always an enjoyable stay.My credit card information was lifted by one of the employees. I stayed here for business and everything was paid for by my employer except breakfast and valet. Somebody at the front desk or in the restaurant stole my information and used it again at this hotel months later.Overall great hotel. The Location is Fantastic, right next to landings and right off the interstate. The reason I am giving this hotel III, is because the gentleman that checked me in was completely rude. He asked us where we first time guess we said yes and asked if there was anything we needed to know. He did not give us any information on the hotel not even that we needed to use our room key to use the elevator. Nor the location of the elevator so we had to ask the guest assistance at the front door. When we came back after checking in our room with questions he had a very ignorant attitude. So we decided to walk away from him and ask him next person next to him. To whom gave us amazing feedback and information. On top of that he did not speak to us like we were a burden to him.We got a great rate through Hotwire on our room. I thought it was clean, nice, classy, and great customer service.  Everyone was really  nice and we enjoyed our stay.  The room is cozy and the beds are comfy.  We would stay here again.  The room service was especially yummy.  We were very surprised by how good the food was.  Highly recommend!Ok, so perhaps if I were here on pleasure this hotel would be fantastic. However, I travel for business mainly, and to me this place was a logistical nightmare. I need to get in and out quick. You cannot do that here. You must park in a garage for$12 a night. So if I leave something in my car I have to get on the elevator, go to the huge lobby, cross the little street to the garage, get on another elevator, get my stuff, and then come back. This is the evil of huge hotels. Now, if you are attending a conference at the hotel, it's a dream. You never have to leave the premises. You have in house restaurant, gym, pool, concierge, everything. Get ready to be nickel and dimed here. You pay for the garage, pay for in room refreshments, pay for Internet access, and yes, if you use the business center computer, you must pay for that as well. If you want to print something, you can from your room, however, you will also pay .49 cents per page. The hotel itself is lovely. The rooms are well appointed, room service was actually quite nice, and they have wonderful toiletries and an ipod dock. It's just for my purposes this hotel does not work.","Overall very nice hotel. Clean room. Nice stocked mini bar. Great water pressure. Bed was slightly hard. Restaurant in hotel was great for breakfast but I a little pricey. Starbucks Coffee!!!Well priced and nicely located for the business traveler. Its adjacent to the skytran central station. Its located a couple blocks from Jacksonville Landing (though struggling mall) and Laura Street. The lobby is really nice and welcoming. Very nice staff. The rooms are comfortable and pretty current.  There is a nice roof top pool.  The restaurant bar is nicely decorated but the service and food is not on par with the rest of the hotel. Its a good option for downtown Jacksonville.I had a really great experience here, staying earlier this week. The staff is super friendly and the hotel, while getting older, still has a very nice ambiance and is nicely luxurious. Having seen some other hotels my colleagues were at, I have to say the Omni beat them all by quite a bit. The only compliant I had was dang did it take a long time to get served and attended to at lunch in the J Bar. Might want to tell the waiters to check on tables three times as often as they do. But even that complaint was mitigated by the food being terrific.My stay at the Jacksonville Omni was tolerable, but not the most relaxing of experiences. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were okay, but check-in was quite the hassle. I had booked through kayak and confirmed my reservation with the hotel staff the Wed. before my arrival. The staff confirmed a Premier River View room, but when i arrived the hotel stated the reservation did not specify the type of room because it was not booked through the hotel website and they had no river view rooms available. I was both confused and frustrated by this information, especially when i had confirmed it just 2 days prior.Long story short, after looking at 3 different rooms, i gave up and chose one which offered a slight view of the river. Upon check out i asked for a receipt which showed that i did not stay in a ""premier river view room"" so that i could obtain a refund from Kayak (Omni stated they would not reimburse me), the front desk stated that i was staying in a ""river view room"". At this point i was done trying to communicate, understand or deal with the Omni. Breakdown:1. Friendly staff, but not good with communication and had the feeling they were lying to cover their mistakes.2. Rooms are dated, but clean. I expected more for the price, but perhaps my expectations are too high.3. Be prepared for the 7am wakeup call day of checkout (not optional)4. Valet was friendly, polite, and quick.5. charge for water6. charge for wifiGood luck!Stayed at the Omni Jacksonville for business Feb 26 - 27, 2012.  The property is about 15 min away from the airport. Cab driver was very nice and personable. (Gator Cab Company) The property is flawless in a rather rough part of town. Perhaps it was the dark clouds and rain but it seemed to be a jewel nestled in town.  Check in was not bad though they had me down for checking in the next day - easy enough to fix. The gal who checked me in was very polished and polite. The room rocked. Lots of space. Clean. Fabulous TV and bathroom. The shower pressure was perfect. It didn't have a in-room safe which is always a HUGE bonus for me so I deducted for that....the fitness center is on the 2nd floor and very small. The pool looked decent but it is outside and it was Feb. :)  The business center was more of a business closet and while I couldn't get online to print my boarding passes for free for Feb 27, I asked the front desk about it and they immediately offered to do it for me on the spot - huge points for this and the front desk was very accomodating in helping me out.  Room service was very prompt and very nice. Served it right in the accurate estimated time and was extremely polished in savvy in ""presenting"" your meal which I've come to love so much.  I'm convinced if you choose to stay at a nice property and order room service, presentation, taste and timely delivery is everything. It's an experience. Food was awesome and their menu had a LOT to choose from....Breakfast in the restaurant on site ROCKED. Huge bonus points for this one. Ordered off their healthy side - spinnach friatta with provolone, multigrain toast and fruit. It was HEAVENLY. Awesome meal for the cost of maybe $12 with an ice tea - sweet or unsweet? I asked for half and half and it was spot on. Overall, go for it. The staff truly makes it a nice experience even down to those whom you run into in the elevator who are very welcoming and definitely show their professionalism.  Didn't venture out as I was there on business for all of less than 24 hours so I didn't see too many local hang outs but don't let that stop you.  The price is right. The staff is amazing and the food rocks.  Had low expectations in the cab on the way in and happy experiences to report and share with you on the way out back to Columbus.Nice hotel for the price.  Great location close to Jacksonville Landing.  Parking on the 8th floor was a little bit of a pain but overall a nice stayMy wife and I stayed at the Omni over Thanksgiving.  We had a deluxe room in a corner of the building.  The views from the room were quite pretty with views of the river and bridges.  The appointments and comfort of the room was really great.  We loved it.  The staff at the desk couldn't have been more pleasant and accommodating.  Several shifts of people that we dealt with had a really positive attitude.  Credit to the hiring and training of the staff.  Very consistent.  We also liked the valet service very much.  They knew us by name and didn't need our number for the car...ever.  We enjoyed our time and would come back the next time we are in town.After a long week of business travel, I ended up at this hotel for the most recent 4th of July.  I am so happy I chose to stay here instead of by Jax Beach.  This hotel has a good view of the St. John's River and is just a block away from the Jacksonville Landing.From the time I arrived at the hotel, the valet staff was very friendly.  The front desk made me feel very welcome.  The hotel lobby was clean and well laid out.  My room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable.  (I really appreciate when a hotel gets the mattress right.)  One thing I noticed when I first got in the room is that it didnt have a flat screen TV.  It still has a 25""-27"" tube TV.  I couldnt believe that this hotel hasnt updated all the TVs in their rooms.  Also, the bathrooms need some updating.  Yes, it had the granite countertop, but the tub and tiling was old and it showed.  My other complaint was that the elevators were stuffy and all had a funky odor to them.  I thought it would have gone away but when I heard another couple complain about it, I knew I wasn't the only one it was affecting.I still give this hotel 3 stars because the pool area, which is on the 4th floor and overlooks the city somewhat, was nice with plenty of seating.  The fitness room was also spacious.  The Wi-Fi is free if you are a member of there members program (easy to sign up on the spot, if needed).  I will definitely go back when i'm back in town.Omni hotel brought it's A game for a mere $150/night.  Top 3 things I love about this hotel.1. The water pressure.  No flat hair from water saving shower heads and pawltry water flow here.  At times the intensity of the spray almost hurt...hurt so good.  I actually don't even need any other reasons than this to make this my favorite hotel, but in case others aren't as critical of their water pressure...2. The fitness center and rooftop pool.  New machines with individual TVs.  Everything works, more than two people can work out at once, and none of the machines squeek.  The pool is nice and relaxing with comfy lounge chairs, bags/corn hole boards, and a fooseball table.3. The rewards program.  Sign up free to get: free paper of your choice, free room upgrades if available, free juice and coffee brought to your room every morning, free presssing, and a free stay or airline miles for every 10 visits (each night counts as a stay).  I'm halfway there already!  The hotel is also in walking distance of the river and plenty of restaurant options.The omni has lost ""it"". My last fee experiences here, and in Austin, have shown me an omni without the typical high quality I expected. From missing reward benefits, to be shuffled through multiple rooms due to broken fixtures, to very poor internet, rooms not being cleaned upon check in, and the fact that they lost my pressed clothiers the night before a big meeting. All of these faults with a poor front desk and customer svc attitude. It makes me sad because I used to stay at the omni in Brookfield and was so impressed with my visits there. The company overall must be changing as they made rewards and free nights harder. Overall I think I will take my annual stays back to hilton.Stayed here for our weekend trip to see the New York Jets take on the Jacksonville Jaguars.I give it three positive ""C's"" : Convenient, clean and comfortable.It's a mile and a half walk to Everbank Field, home of the Jaguars and it's just a block away from Jacksonville Landing, a spot to grab corporate chain food and drink.The room was clean and comfortable.My only negative ""C"", for complaint, is that the only stationary recumbent cycle in the fitness center was broken.Other than that, it was all good.I was not feeling well when I checked in. I was so grateful for the Valet. So nice and offered me self park. The checkin was fast and friendly. The room was really nice.  Warm colors.  Higher end. The bed was Fab!!!! Seriously wonderful. Bath was above normal nice. I am not a hotel lover. I usually stay in BnB because I want a superior experience. This hotel gives that.Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Omni Jax you have a fan!The hotel is nice! But the restaurant is not. Had a shrimp pasta, no taste the portion was a joke compared to the price. I returned the plate.Where do I start. I stayed at this hotel for Florida/Georgia weekend so naturally the rates were much higher. Unfortunately the quality of hotel no where near matches the rates. I give it two stars because the employees were all very nice. The room itself was awful!! I have stayed at nicer holiday inns. The beds were full size if that, extremely small and uncomfortable. To top it off they didn't have a fitted sheet on the bed just another top sheet tucked in. The bathroom was dirty and old. The tub was disgusting and I felt dirtier after I took a shower. Needless to say $700 for 2 nights was ridiculous. I know it was a busy weekend but I would have rather slept in a tent. My advice...find something else if your forced to travel to Jacksonville.As far as Omni's go, this was right in line with other Omni's I've stayed in.  Beautifully appointed and professional lobby...the rooms were nice with dark wood furniture, good linens, feather pillows...nice soaps and toiletries.  I'm a sucker for a waffle robe and they came through for me.  The Valet had my car for me in record time, and there was also a free shuttle around town which I found to be a really nice touch.  I only stayed one night, but my boyfriend stayed the night after me, too.  We had issues with our TV the first night and he had the same issues the following night and called the front desk for it to be fixed.  It was late and he was ready for bed so declined the technician after a second thought, but the front desk clerk very graciously slipped a hand-written note under his door that evening. She apologized for the inconvenience and included a gift certificate for a breakfast for two in bed the following morning.  It was a very kind and hospitable gesture for such a large hotel to make and quite honestly, not one I'm used to receiving anymore.  I would definitely stay here again!I've stayed at a few other Omni properties and only had positive experiences, but last night at the Jacksonville Omni was an embarrassment to the brand. They cancelled my reservation since I arrived late at night and claimed it was impossible to re-book at the same rate (which was through Hotwire). Even better, my previous payment would not be refunded.On top of cancelling my reservation and still taking my money, they didn't offer help with luggage and spent an inordinate amount of time training an employee on their computer system instead of just letting my party go upstairs and sleep. A pregnant woman behind the front desk also served as the valet which was just bizarre. It may have been because of the billing issue, but the room we got after booking at a much higher rate smelled like smoke, had a loud / barely functioning AC unit and the Internet was unusable. I won't be staying at an Omni property again for a while and definitely not while back in Jacksonville. Hotwire made it right and gave back all my money plus more for the trouble, but Omni was happy to take my money and not give me a room.This Omni is doing it right and I give all of the credit to the staff.   From the front desk to the maids and bellman the service was great.  My stay included use of the hotel conference facilities and catering that had to be arranged on short notice.  It all went very smoothly.The loyalty program gives you some immediate tangible benefits at this Omni: free Wifi,  free coffee room-service, one free shirt pressing daily and the NY times.    (Note:  They have a nice pool/lounge area but its totally shaded by about 5pm.)This is a review for the bar only, and not the rooms. Met some out of town guests here for drinks before heading out to Taverna for dinner. Service was great and the atmosphere is comfy.The lobby is decorated beautifully and the staff is very friendly for our short visit. The have a really cool book of information about where to eat near the front desk, complete with menus and pictures. I wouldn't recommend everything in the book (Sticky Fingers, really?) but if you are without wifi and yelp, it's a nice second choice.The only bad thing is that if you are just meeting someone and you don't want to rush out the door, you have to pay to park.I didn't stay in the rooms or use any other services, but our guests were very pleased with their stay.wonderful property.  the staff is is fantastic-adam the valet is incredibly amiable, joe the front desk is wonderfully accommodating (I had an issue with a very loud neighbor when i checked in-Joe went above and beyond), and Lindsay recommended a fabulous restaurant (Bistro Aix) after a very unpleasant experience in their restaurant.  Kirstin, the bartender was great, but the food was TERRIBLE.  That's my only complaint-the restaurant food was not good.  But there are lots of good places within walking or short driving distance-and the staff is really wonderful and service oriented.   Also liked that they offered free wi-fi (all you have to do is sign up for their loyalty program).I have stayed in way better Omni hotels. This is cool but the seems a little dated. The staff is amazing and the hotel is right near the Landing which is the only thing to do around there.","Love this hotel, love the location. This was a perfect choice for my birthday. The Landing is in walking distance so you can walk or stumble back and forth. Close to several other entertainment/clubs/bars/restaurants. But of course there is a restaurant downstairs which is GREAT. And the bartender was great! He spent several minutes mixing me drinks - I have no problem being the human tester.  And the pool area is great for an early morning swim. The only downfall was parking. Parking is expensive and a hassle because the place is that huge.This place is pretty good.  We stayed there for 2 nights to see Pats vs. JAX in December. It is very convenient to the stadium -- an easy walk.  The bartenders at the lounge are great. I definitely recommend the berry mojito. Downtown Jacksonville is pretty dead on the weekend, but there are enough places to eat around.A very nice hotel, but you do get nickel and dimed for everything, you have to pay for wifi, good thing I can tether from my phone.very close to the landing, be prepared to pay for parking.   clean hotel friendly  staff.  one downside is that the atm in the lobby was out  cash for my entire stay.Not at all what I expected..This was very disappointing for an Omni.  While the lobby, decor and ambience are very nice..I felt like customer service was extremely lacking.  It all started at check in..I was just handed my keys..no welcome sir, no elevator is to the left or right, just here you go sir, room XYZ..not expected at all.   Parking was pretty steep, considering you could park next store for half the price.  I just didn't get a warm fuzzy...not a bad hotel for the price, but I hope it was just an off weekend.Oh Omni hotel, how I love you and the things you can do in in the 15th floor window and not be seen!You would have had a given 5 stars, even if I was almost in tears trying to find you (side note, anyone that knows JVille, you know their road systems and driving 'directions' make absolutely no sense..just sayin'), but seriously..the parking situation? Come ON!!It's $12...in the garage...that's attached to the hotel...no re-entry baby. And bad enough that I didn't realize that Twisted Martini happened to be at the landing, the only thing open on CMas eve, and it was sprinting distance from the Omni, but we drove. Yeah, another $12 the next day to park and checkout. But the online check in was amazing, considering we didn't show up until after 7pm. Room was very nice, comfy bed, couldn't have asked for a better area. We had about 7 people come by (and we were only there CMas eve night and checked out the next day mind you) for different things like inventory and restocking of mini bar, towel service, room service, and other things that just didn't even make sense and I seriously thought it was a joke of how many people were trying to come in to my room...and then I realized i didn't have the privacy tag up...so it just looked like an empty room if they were walking by, so that was at least my fault. Oh, and really...they charged about $1 for a local phone call that I only made because I didn't want to grab my cell phone charging in the bathroom, another fail! The concierge was wonderful and I didn't feel the slightest bit judged when stumbling in laughing with my lovie, super twisted off of wonderful martinis and shots, nor did I feel that way when checking out in my new present: a shirt that said ""Polar Bears will F*@K you up."" Points for you Omni!Kickers: The room is designed for having fun;) Chaise, bed, sturdy massive window that you can't see in from outside that overlooks downtown, desk...it was like breaking in a new home! Nice rooms, huge bed, walking distance to landing, room service available, wolfgang puck coffee for when you wake up...best.cmas.ever!Fails: Charge for local calls, ridiculous parking garage fees (and it's your only option)Diamondism: Would have been my go-to spot if it weren't for the parking...next time I'm valeting!The rooms (and plumbing!) REALLY need a makeover here.  You walk into the lobby, which is nice, expecting a decent hotel.  Then you go up to the rooms and are sadly disappointed - these rooms haven't been touched in probably 30 years - very dark and dreary.  What is the worst though is the water pressure / drainage.  I've stayed here a number of times and the sinks and bathtubs in all of the rooms empty really slow.Unfortunately there are not a lot of choices in downtown JAX for hotels :(.The OMNI hotel was Jacksonville's premier downtown hotel for many many years until the Hyatt opened up just down the way. Now it may have a little healthy competition, but this is still a very nice hotel.Located close to the water across from the beautiful Times Union Center for the Performing Arts and the Landing, it has great location for visitors coming in town to see a show and looking for a place to eat and catch a drink later in the night. I am not a huge fan of the Landing, but they are feverishly working to make the Landing a cooler place, with better options. [Honestly, when the locals are avoiding the big tourist draw/center, you know something isn't gellin'.] It is also very close to Chew, Moca, and the Main Library and a short walk from a lot of other nightlife [Burrito Gallery, Dos Gatos, LIT, Dive Bar, The Ivy, Marks, TSI...]The hotel itself is nice, with spacious rooms. It attempts to be a little more ornate than it is, but still achieves the overall effect. You will undoubtedly be comfortable and happy with your stay here.The hotel is nice enough but the area is not safe. After my niece's wedding some in the bridal group walked accross the street to enjoy the Jacksonville Landing. On the way back to the hotel our group including the bride, was jumped by a group of people in the front entry way to the hotel and beat to the ground. The hotel staff did nothing to aid them and in fact failed to acknowledge any surveilence video even though there are plenty of cameras out front. Would think twice about choosing this hotel to stay at if I were you......When I pulled up to the Omni Hotel last weekend, I have to say that I was immediately impressed. The shape of the hotel is unique, which leads to breathtaking views of the St. John's River. Hard to describe, but the hotel is mostly circular with a few partitions in between for areas such as the pool or the second floor ballrooms. This is also a full-service hotel, essentially meaning that you can ask for almost anything and they will probably be accommodating (which is something that shocked me because I'm not used to good customer service I guess). The rooms themselves are gorgeous, all completely modernized with huge 40""+ flat screen TVs, comfy beds, nice bathrooms, a comfy chair for relaxing in, etc. Going back to the pool again, there is only a pool, but the fact that there are these comfy cabana chairs in addition to beach chairs makes up for it, in my opinion. The gym is located just off of the pool and features all brand new equipment, with flat screen TVs attached. And if you forgot your headphones at home, they have a basket of complimentary headphones available for use. The location of the hotel is also great--walking distance from Jacksonville Landing, The Jacksonville Museum of Contemporary Art, and my new fave place Chamblin's Uptown.Having said all of those positive things, I will say that as soon as I arrived, being told that I had to pay either $20 for valet or $10 a day for city parking was a bit of a shock to my wallet. Although you can pay up to $140/night to stay at the Omni, DO NOT expect to get anything extra for free. In fact, in-room wifi is $9.95 per night. And the TV movie rentals--don't even bother looking at the prices, you'll faint. $5 for the in-room bottle of water. I don't even want to know what would have happened if I took anything out of the mini fridge. Oh and room service= overpriced food + $2 delivery fee + automatic 22% gratuity....uh excuse me? I just ended up ordering Pizza Hut, and I probably saved myself $20. Also, breakfast isn't included. They have lemonade in the lobby, no free coffee. Basically, I did enjoy my stay at the Omni. But I do not enjoy being charged for something every time I turn around. Hence why I can only give 4 stars, not 5.This is a nice hotel with a good staff.  I was there only to check out the meeting rooms but it was a good experience.Best hotel in JAX.  Nice location in downtown and right on the river walk area.While in Jax for a concert we stayed here.  Great location and ok after that.  The rooms were ok, the food in the bar ok, and the atmosphere is ok.  We like more than ok.  The entrance is a little weird and for what we paid, we expected more.High marks in professionalism and a great level of service.  The rooms (like most Omni rooms I've stayed in) have an ""old time-y"" feel to them, which isn't really my cup of tea.  However, the loyalty program is great, giving you free morning drinks, WiFi, and other benefits.  One thing I didn't like (which is at all Omni's I've stayed in) is that they use incandescent bulbs instead of CFLs (like most hotels nowadays).  I was told that this is to preserve the ""old time-y"" feel.  Also, I ""had"" to use valet parking because it was basically the same price as compared to doing self-parking at the deck across the street.Bless you Omni Hotel, for being my sanctuary against the opressive humidity of Jacksonville in August!  i forgive you for the small t.v. in my room, I even forgive you for your loud air conditionng system that made it hard for me to sleep because it kept me from melting.  I don't know how I would have survived without you.P.S. The Salmon that I ordered for dinner from your room service was most excellent!  I have been to a lot of great restaurants in San Francisco that serve salmon, and i must say yours is definitely top notch.P.P.S.  Next time I visit, I want to try the pool.Sincerely,NancyVery good Omni Hotel in sleepy downtown Jacksonville.  I stayed here twice while catching flights to and from Jacksonville.  It is about a 20 minute taxi to the airport.  Check-in is always flawless.  Never a problem getting a room even before the standard check-in time.  I got mine as early as 1030.  If you are not a Select Guest member, I highly recommend you sign up online.  It is free and the perks are very good.The room was spacious and clean.  There is only one restaurant with a bar.  The bar is good and the drinks are not too expensive.  There is not much to do in the surrounding area.  There is the Jacksonville landing but it closes early during the week.  It is okay on the weekends but nothing special.  If you are looking for night-life, you are going to have to travel about 20 minutes to JAX Beach where are the action is at.I highly recommend this place and will stay here again.The beds are very comfy and the staff are very helpful. The hallway smelled bad, like a stinkbomb went off.  I dont know what that was about.",,"['omni', 'night', 'town', 'concert', 'drawn', 'upscale', 'establishment', 'offered', 'location', 'veterans', 'stadium', 'concert', 'also', 'close', 'landing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-jacksonville-riverfront-jacksonville,Hyatt Regency Jacksonville Riverfront,3.5,$$$,108,"Great hotel! We didn't know but we went for a Supernatural convention (big fan) and this was the hotel wre the event was taking place, so we stayed in for 3 nights. Everything was amazing since we arrived, the hotel was super packed but every one of the staff were amazing, very friendly. The hotel is very very nice, super big,clean the rooms was huge super clean and we had an amazing view, the bed was super comfortable. Everything was amazing, the only bad thing the restaurant food is very very bad, but beyond that the hotel is great. We will be there in 2017 for the second Supernatural convention . :)Stayed January 2016Stayed here last week.The front desk associate was very nice, room was clean with a mini fridge. The bathroom was completely redone and clean.The view wasn't anything to write home about but the room was quiet--which is what I needed. Used the in room dining and got a sandwich that was really good (pricey though). Parking cost $15, but it was worth it.Definitely would stay again.Stayed here for a professional conference. The conference rates were great.The room was extremely relaxing. The updated decor was very trendy but still calming. The office chair was the most comfortable. Plenty of plugs for all of our electronics all over the room.We had a great view of the bridge and enjoyed hearing the sounds of the city at night with the door open. We had a few special requests of housekeeping for making up the room each day and they were followed to a tee. (Something that has never happened at a hotel before!). The staff throughout the hotel were courteous and helpful. The lunch served to a small group of ours was very food and service was amazing! Loved the fruit infused water in the lobby.Close to The Landing to walk over for lunch and dinner.If I were to visit Jacksonville again, I would not hesitate to stay here again!For a higher end hotel, the Hyatt Regency here in Jacksonville is no good. My stay was terrible. When I first arrived in my room, I tried to connect to the Internet to get some work done. The signal was terrible and the Internet was sooo slow. I called the front desk and asked to be moved closer to a hot spot. My new room was better, but not by much. The Internet is so slow, I had to use my phone's 4G Hotspot, costing me time and money on my data plan. I am a business traveler and a lot of my work is cloud based, so it is really infuriating when I experience a hotel with crap internet. I wouldn't say here again for just this reason. The vending machine on my floor doesn't work. Huge inconvenience when I'm thirsty at midnight. I ate dinner in the bar area downstairs. I had a Caesar salad with grilled shrimp, French onion soup and an Old Fashioned. The drink and the soup were ok, but the salad was terrible... odd tasting anchovies, wilted lettuce, no flavor on the accompanying bread stick and a dull dressing. The shrimp had a stark fishy taste and were maybe a little undercooked. Just terrible. Also, the TV in the room doesn't swivel, you know, like they do in single star hotels... so if you're sitting at the desk, you can't see the TV. On a positive note... there is a sliding glass door in the room that opens up to a wonderful view of the water here in downtown Jax. BOTTOM LINE: Too many things wrong with this hotel for me to stay here again. They have some serious work to do.We had a great stay here at the Hyatt. When we entered the parking lot, we were greeted, our luggage was taken and we were escorted to the registration desk. The hotel had fresh water with fruit in the lobby. Also there were fresh oranges sitting on the counter. Checking in was a breeze. Our luggage was immediately brought up to our room. The room was great. Nice and roomy. Comfy bed. Free WIFI. Great view of the river. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There is a restaurant and bar in the lobby. We didn't try out the restaurant. We pre-ordered room service for breakfast at 9:00 however it arrived 2 hours early (and woke us up). We sent it back. They called an hour later to see if we still wanted breakfast. (That woke us up again). We did get out breakfast at 8:45. (Still early). I was going to give this place 5 stars, but I was tired and didn't like getting woken up 2 times. I'd definitely stay there again but not pre-order my breakfast again.(Just the bar)Nice small bar located in the hotel with it's own non pretentious enterance. People might think you are already drunk if you just stand in front of it. The doors say guest enterance only. Just pull of the left door and walk right and vear left. Dark warm colors lead you into picking a nice seat at the bar or taking up a table. Servers and bartenders are normally in local team jerseys waiting to serve.Food is goodSeat is goodService is goodBartenders are awesome - order a martini then tell them to surprise you.And somehow the crowd is always a mix of downtown locals and friendly traveling strangers. Minimalistic space - not a bad thing. Small bars are cool. Especially before an ArtWalk.Hyatt is actually located at riverside downtown very close to the Landing - A riverbank attraction. This hotel is just next to the river bank. It has great view to walkway at the riverbank. The hotel has a garage across the building and is compliment for the hotel guess to park free with hotel stay. The hotel has a nice lobby and the people are friendly. I got a room upgrade for the first time stay to riverfront room. The view is gorgeous. I can imagine this is a great room when the city has the firework going on with a room with river front. The room is spacious and quiet at nine floor. When you reserve the room, you may want to consider adding additional $10 for the breakfast. If you buy the breakfast separately, it will cost you $25. It is a great value to add it because they are delicious buffet. Furthermore, the additional $10 you have paid is for two people if you have the mate with you. The buffet breakfast is including the southern biscuit with gravy, thick bacon, sausage, oak meal and more. They also have the fruit section, Danish, corn bread and soup. Overall I am satisfied with the stay. I get a quite room which is the ultimate goal.If you don't mind spending $50 a plate this the best place to go home for Christmas dinner! In fact my family and I do it every year. That way no one has to cook and there is no dishes to do. Of course on the other hand I can't eat everything because I'm on the Paleo diet but they did have a fair share of meat and veggies! So my Paleo side was happy my human side said eat the macaroni cheese and shut upThe company that I work for had a national meeting at this hotel and it was a very good experience. Our food was provided banquet style and it was excellent. Usually places have a hard time making good food for large groups. They pulled this off well. My room was very clean and everything worked. Finally, every staff member that I interacted with was very helpful and courteous.I was here for a work conference all last week.  I can't speak to the room rates since they gave us a special discount for the conference itself so I'll talk about my overall experience here.PROS:1) 19th floor gym has almost everything you need for a good workout.  Treadmills, bicycle machines, yoga mats, weights, towels, etc.  The gym is open 24 hours 2) 19th floor poor (pretty nice and big), lots of areas to sit and lounge3) Valet parking $20, self-parking $154) My room was at the end and it was HUGE! 5) Cleaning service was a plus 6) Healthy vending machine snacks7) Hotel restaurant, bar and coffee place was located on the first floor and overall good food options8) Concierge staff were friendly, personable9) Fridge in the room (but not microwave)10) Free Wi-Fi 11) Front of the river and close to local restaurants and river walk CONS:1) Ice machine on my floor was not working property2) There was a lot of construction going on during my stay which made some of my co-workers' stay here less than convenient.  They had to relocate rooms throughout the week. I believe they overbooked. Also with the construction, there was noise throughout the day, which made it difficult to concentrate and feel ""comfortable"" in the hotel room.3) While I am a working mom and I travel, I was breastpumping in my room and placed the ""PRIVACY PLEASE"" sign up on my door so I would not be disturbed as I was pumping breastmilk.  Regardless, I received a knock on my door from hotel security who said that they had to change my locks.  This was a violation of my privacy.  They could have come back another time when my sign was not up. Why does changing locks become a priority over someone's personal matters?This riverfront hotel is just steps away from The Landing and a short walk from EverBank Field, making it an ideal place to drop anchor if you're in town for a football game. My family and I spent one night here on the way down to Port Canaveral, and enjoyed a quiet, comfortable stay in a clean and spacious cityview room. Parking was conveniently located in a connected deck, and there's a coffee bar with pastries and fruit just off the lobby. With its central location and reasonable rates, the Hyatt Regency is where we'll be staying whenever we're in town.Nothing, like what was advertised!!! Please, I mean please do not, do not go by the pictures on the website... They are not accurate at all!!! The is not Hyatt quality!!!! The room design is dated back to 1985... The comforter is is as thin as a sheet, and the bed is hard as bricks!!! I called the day before, because we would be arriving early, and was told we would be accommodated early it would not be a problem. When we arrived things changed, and that was the start of all the problems. Customer service attendant attempted to accommodate us, however with a bit distain... Then after coming down the hall and smelling an odd smell, lackluster room, and extremely hard bed, I called an asked the front desk person to have the General Manager to call me in the morning...Well, after my shower and watching a comedy show on HBO!!! Get a knock on the door from security... Related to my laughing from the comedy show (too loud) and a smell in the hallway (I smell the same foul smell coming down the hall). He stated that was the 1st warning... If I wasn't so far away from home, I tell you!!! Most horrible stay ever...Stayed 3 nights for a work meeting. I stayed in a double queen room facing the river, which was clean and huge, nice view and I like that the window opened. Plenty of counter space- this is a common gripe I have about hotels, not enough room to put your stuff, but the Hyatt Regency counter spanned the length of the bathroom, so I never had to fumble around. There were outlets all over, they clearly put thought into practicality. Sufficient drawer and closet space, Starbucks coffee with the in-room coffee machine though I never used it. The toiletries were nicely scented (meaning barely scented- too often hotel toiletries are either too perfumey or they don't provide conditioner). The food served at our meetings was much better than typical hotel conference food. This was the consensus of pretty much all the coworkers I talked to. Thanks, Hyatt, for a great stay!Stayed on the 15th floor; spectacular views of the river front; professional and friendly staff. Hotel room was clean and staff was attentive. Ordered room service twice and and impressed with the food. Maybe the buffet may have been better.I stayed her for the recent Garth Brooks concert in Jacksonville.  I chose this hotel because of its proximity to Veteran's Memorial Arena.  It is less than 1 mile away and is walkable.  Thankfully, I didn't even have to walk.  The hotel had shuttles in front of the hotel that would take you to and from the show for $2 each way.  The room was nice enough.  The best was comfy.  The room was clean.  However, for the price I paid I would've liked better service.  I sat in front of the hotel for 10 minutes attempting to valet and no one came to assist me.  I eventually gave up and self parked.  The parking fees were pretty high and although the view from the front of the hotel was lovely the view from my room was off a rooftop and not at all lovely.  Breakfast was included in my rate.  It was nothing special, but it made me feel a little better about the price.I'm not sure why other people hated on this place. I enjoyed it because ..- it's clean and large- nice valet guys out front that will take care of you- has a good selection of dining options in the hotel- you can walk to Jacksonville landing for more food and entertainment options- get a room that faces the river for a great view- is well priced - rooms are clean and were more spacious than I expectedI've stayed here on a few ocasions several years ago and as I returned for a weekend in JAX and a Giants Game I was very disappointed this place has not improved not one iota in fact it is for a Hyatt property a big disapointment. Lobby is very old / modern type look with lost of marbel ... Check in was a breeze and the front desk lady was a real doll getting me a room with partial river rivew on night of the boat parade. unfortunately that is where the superalitves end. Room itself is completely and utterly OUTDATED.  Old furniture / old fixtures / bathroom from the 1960;s and a flat screen TV with limited chanels all ANALOG non of them High Def..   Charge for in Room Internet in Short the room is a Major disappointment. Even have some crazy ants running around on top of dresser next to TV.. no food here no idea why there would be ants. Gift shop took 15 minutes to buy a $4.00 Gatorade because the girl behind the counter was on the phone... not quite sure if she was on phone with something to do with the gift shop or just playing candy Crush....Starbucks in lobby ran out of regular coffee... 1 person behind the counter with line half way into the lobby. Left the Room Sunday A.M. about 8AM and didn't return till 445PM.. My Room was not made up yet until close to 5Pm with me in it and she was in and out of there in less than 10minutes Hard to say what if anything she cleaned but it was not much. Two Computers with printers to print your boarding passes only.  Unfortunately neither of them are updated with FLASH which is required on all applications now to print and the printer on the right side is out of ink printing blank pages. $20.00 add on for Valet parking yet when I arrived in middle of the boat parade VALET WAS CLOSED full cause they took too many cars that were non hotel guests. Last but not least had electronic bill sent after I checked out and there was a $76.00 charge for a restaurant in the hotel I did not Visit...  After 3 phone calls they took it off. BOTTOM LINE my last visit to this Hyatt until it gets a major overhaul.. Simply disappointing on all accounts... START OVER WITH THIS PLACE!Rooms clean spacious and nice viewService good at feo desk and restaurantBathtub very shallow Good place to stayStay away from this hotel! WIFI does not work (called the front desk and was transferred to an outsourced help line, which I was billed for a long distance call for $20), ridiculous prices for breakfast ($22 for one breakfast buffet), even worse pricing for snacks in gift shop, water REEKS of sulfur and taste worse ($4 up charge for the small bottle of Aquafina sitting above fridge), awful view of a desolate parking lot and roof, was charged an $8 ""handling fee"" for a package I had shipped to me at the hotel. THE WORST HOTEL EVER. AVOID AVOID AVOID!This place is okay. I stayed here recently for a conference. The room rate for the conference was over $200 a night...which is a lot. This is Jacksonville not some busy touristy city (the downtown is dead). The price also did not include any breakfast or anything. I stayed in a double room with 3 other people (so four total). For whatever reason we kept getting 3 towels a day and had to keep requesting extras. The shower and sink barely drained. There is a really scary cement block ""balcony"" with a large gap between the block and the railing...total safety hazard. They gave us a river view room then tried charging us for it, even though we didn't request it. Needless to say we got that charge taken off, because I will not be charged for something I didn't request!OH and the bar/restaurant staff SUCKS. It will take about 20 minutes to get a drink from them and then they will angrily slam it on your table. The food is good but just be prepared to wait and receive lots of eye rolls from the wait staff.","I just stayed here for 2 nights at a conference.  The hotel is very lovely, the river views are great.  But it is insanely noisy.   The rooms have a newish heating/AC system that clunks really loudly every time it kicks on -- scared the daylights out of me. So, I turned it off for the night and still darn near froze to death -- despite being off a FAN still blew all night long.  The expressway below the hotel precludes opening the balcony door at night -- jake brakes on big trucks was constant.   The conference meeting rooms were, without a doubt, the coldest I have ever been in. People who don't even drink coffee were holding cups to keep their hands warm. One woman had a blanket! It's also expensive -- over $400 for 2 nights at a conference rate without any restaurant/bar charges.I stayed at the Hyatt hotel for a conference. I was disappointed in the hotel. The hotel was very outdated for being a Hyatt. The lobby, was nice. The rooms were completely outdated, old and need of an make over. With the hotel brand you expect much more, especially for the price! The hotel pool was decent, the jacuzzi was COLD! So disappointed. The workout center was normal I guess. Full of aerobic machines and a few Dumbbells. There wasn't much room to use the free weight equipment. The steam room had to be the best part!The customer service was good. I don't have any complaints with them at all. There was self parking for $15, and $20 for valet. All in all, for the price and the brand name of a Hyatt this does not meet their stands and is far from it. I would not recommend this place unless you had to stay here.This place gets props for just having a party for the Giants!  Awesome stuff.  Nice lobby, spacious.  Friendly staff.  Great location as far as along the river and close to the landing.  Grade: CJust got back from my stay in Jax at this hotel on the water. The entrance is right on the Riverfront walk so there is a perfect background for a morning or evening walk with a lovely view of the bridge. It's really a great neighborhood. This is a larger hotel that is not brand new but pretty well kept. The lobby is quite large and with a large restaurant and bar area as well. I stayed in a room on the 10th floor that had a view of city edge and water! It was nice. The bathroom was huge and the water pressure was great, two things I love in a hotel. There was also a sink in hall of room and in bathroom; this is a great touch if you are staying with multiple people so that everyone has access to a sink, even if someone is using the bathroom. Something that threw me was that there was a sign in the room stating that if you wanted to access free WiFi to do it in the lobby. That was weird. For parking, the valet was $20 and there was self parking in the garage across the street for $15. Overall I would stay here again for the location and views!Very modern hotel..clean...5 minute walk to the jacksonville landing...if you're up to it could probably wall to the stadium too...pretty good sports  bar in the lobby (Jaxx)..I'd highly recommend this hotelWe have had a wonderful time her at the Hyatt. They have been very pleasant the strawberries and champagne was wonderful. The only problem was the hot water was Luke warm. I give the Hyatt 4 starsThe best thing about this hotel is the view if you get a riverfront room. Next, it's clean. Honestly, we were disappointed with the architecture of this new building when it was built by Adam's Mark but were happy that downtown Jax was getting some attention. I wouldn't pay full price but was pleased to get a sweet sweet deal on a room via Priceline. The staff was pleasant so I have nothing to complain about. I do think it's nifty to have a pool on the top floor overlooking the river but steer clear of the hot tub.I'll start with the good. The view was great, as well as the size of the room. The not so great. I got room service. I ordered the grouper salad. I took one bite of the fish and almost got sick. I ended up removing the fish and ate the rest of my salad. The bad. There was no hot water! I had to take a cold shower. I told the lady as I checked out and all she said was; really? As I got in my car from valet, no one helped me with my bags and it took me a minute to juggle everything and place my suitcase in the trunk. The young lady who retrieved my car just stood there holding my keys. I was on a work trip and not looking for anything for free.  I travel and stay in hotels weekly. I did not get good service at this hotel.This is a nice conveniently located hotel, and it is better than some reviews make it out to be. Our room was small, but cozy and the beds were very comfortable.Horrible stay. Would not recommend to anyone. Stayed the weekend for the georgia florida game and upon arrival was notified our 5th roommate would not be given a wristband that was needed to enter the hotel. Manager was rude to deal with. The wifi doesn't exist and we didn't have hot water in the room. Stay at the hilton doubletree across the street. Much better.Getting to this hotel after an event at Everbank field's quite a task! Many downtown streets are closed, &amp; you'll have to turn onto strange streets, reroute, etc. in order to reach the hotel. Good luck!Valet parking earlier that day had closed at 1PM, which seems ungodly early to me (check-in's at 3-4PM). I guess the hotel was packed. The bell hop did at least unload my luggage and assured it would be at the concierge desk. I went to the self-parking garage, as directed. If I remember correctly, it only cost about $15-$20 to park, which isn't bad for being right on the St. John's River.I had the hardest time getting to the floor where check-in is located. When I came out of the first floor of the garage, I went up a flight of stairs, and I think you end up on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the hotel. I was on the same floor as wedding parties no matter where I went so I finally had to call the hotel directly for directions to the first floor. The helpful guy navigated me to the right spot.I came here to Jacksonville for game 3 of the send-off series for the USA, prior to leaving for the World Cup (soccer). I did not have time during the day to check into the hotel, and this was a mistake. Like many others, I had to check into the hotel post-game.The hotel was in utter chaos. Many parties in front of me did not have rooms because the hotel severely oversold their rooms. There were 4 staff members checking in parties of 4 or 6, so these people needed multiple rooms. There were two people ahead of me, and after waiting about 45 minutes, finally it was my turn. I could only hope for the best.I gave a pleasant hello to the lady, and she confirmed my reservation. She explained, ""I have to talk in a low voice because you are the only one here who is guaranteed a room due to your platinum status."" That's how dire the situation was! I also received a room upgrade with a riverfront view, and after I asked if there was bottled water in the room, the lady told me to wait, &amp; she brought me two bottles of water from a back office. I was grateful to have a room (cost 8,000 points) and thankful for the free water. My room key was marked with ""VIP,"" which was nice and something you will never receive at a Hilton chain hotel.I went to the concierge to collect my luggage. I saw it immediately behind the desk, about 8ft from where I was standing. I gave the lady my ticket, and she said I had to wait for assistance. After 10 minutes of waiting, I told the lady I could handle the luggage myself. She replied, ""Since the luggage is behind the desk, you will need to be assisted."" I found this very strange. I suppose someone's sued the hotel in the past for some odd reason. After another 10 minutes of waiting and me assuring I can handle my own luggage, she gave up on waiting for a bell hop and gave me my luggage.I got to my room, and boy, I was tired. There was no fridge for the water, so I got some ice and put the water inside the ice bucket. There's no microwave. There was at least a small counter area for the coffee pot, etc. The room had the basics, and I also had free wifi due to my status.I LOVED the view. It was absolutely gorgeous, right on the river. You could open the sliding door (small iron fence protects you from fallen), and the air conditioning turns off automatically when you open the door. I thought this was a neat trick. Listening to the fountain below and the river's waves slap again the riverfront's walkway was calming. I was very hungry around 10PM at night, but I didn't really feel like walking around because I was so tired. I decided to suck it up and pay the exorbitant hotel restaurant prices. Instead, RIGHT outside the restaurant, there was a small, set-menu, kind of cafeteria line. For $7 cash, you could get fried or baked chicken and potato salad. Sold! The lady put a LOT of food in the to-go box, filling to the max. I was pleased, &amp; the food was decent especially since I hadn't really eaten since breakfast.The next morning, I took it easy. Platinum members do not receive free breakfast at the hotel, so I did not eat at the restaurant. The hotel did allow me to have a late checkout, so I chose 2PM. I did not know how to get back to the garage (since I came in through another floor), so I asked about this while checking out. Being on an upper level floor, I didn't know you had to go down to the first floor to get to the garage. I thought there would've been a way to reach the 2nd floor of the parking garage by going to the 2nd floor, but apparently not. ""All you have to do is walk outside &amp; go across the street,"" the lady said. I thought this was a bit rude.I give two stars because of the check-in process (including luggage retrieval) &amp; the rude checkout lady on the phone. I don't care what status you are - no hotel should oversell their rooms and have to take people to another hotel when they've already paid for a certain location. For this hotel, ensure you check in as early as possible!Nice water views from rooms...... really and all you do is ask for them.    This is a good ol' business style hotel on the riverfront and probably the most well patronized.  I'm staying 3 days on a work trip and it has steady stream of customers both leisure and business.   It is also one of the best hotels, servicewise in the area.  This is typical of the Hyatt Regency service and customer focus, its super nice to be catered to.  If you need something?  30 minutes tops for the wait they say.  They show up in 5, super efficient .  And they have everything you may have forgotten such as toothpaste, slippers, nail clippers.... complimentary.   I'm not a fan of  hotel filtered air so I like that you can open sliding doors to let the outside air in.  No smog, open hotel sliding doors to a water view.... priceless!  One less star for the paid WIFI.  Really?  This is why I bring my on TriFi everywhere.  You give me slippers, shaving cream, comb, vanity kit, hair spray, shampoo and 30 other vanities from the bathroom.  Every traveler would rather pay for the things they forgot and get free WIFI.   Be hip Hyatt!!  Its 2013, over 20 years since the birth of consumer Internet LOL.Tip:  Gym and spa/pool are on the top floor, super nice views!   Self parking is 15 per diem, next to hotel.  Cheaper parking for $5 per day is 3 blocks away but no in and out privileges.  Visits: 5Fair to middling. Wouldn't stay here if I weren't getting a special rate from a place I'm interviewing at. Some of the rooms have nice river views, but there really isn't much around the hotel at all. The rooms are nice enough like you'd expect, but they charge to use the business computers. It's only 40cents a minute but the machines are so Detroit that just to check email is going to be a five or six dollar proposal. The vending machines on my floor were broken too which was annoying to say the least and they don't offer come zero anywhere. I'd look for cheaper places further from downtown; this hotel and this area would not be my first choice.Very nice property, recently updated.  Do yourself a favor and pay extra for a river view, very nice!!We stayed here for tow nights and it wasn't good at all and we had to woke up @7:30 am because of they'r doing constructions n the Hotel ... i'm really disappointed with thatAs an airline pilot.... I know hotels..... and this hotel has to be one of the quietest rooms I've ever stayed in.  When we checked in there was some crazy conference going on (dudes in funny hats, couldn't tell what kind of club or whatever, but my first though was it's gonna be a loud night)... so I get to my room... which was like walking a mile down winding hallways... and in my hallway were kids from some high school group... crap... it's really gonna be a long night....... nope, not a peep, didn't hear a cricket chirp.As for the location... excellent, right on the river walk , great place to go for a jog, and plenty of places to eat within walking distance.Stayed here for two nights. Checking in and out was a breeze. Only glitch being that I thought a room with a river view was included, but they told us to pay $15/day. So, we got the room overlooking the city of Jacksonville instead.Overall, the room was very spacious and clean. Even with the ongoing conferences that week, it was really quiet. Besides the freezing weather in January, the hotel is located right along the river walk. You can also venture into downtown by foot. Recommend this hotel.The hotel is not so easy to find because it is blocked by Wells Fargo building. Mazy at the front desk granted us early check-in which was much appreciated. The room is clean; bottle water Aquafina in the room costs $4 each, no fridge, no microwave.I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights when I was in town for a Conference, and I am definitely a fan, both of the hotel itself and the Conference facilities.My room was clean and comfortable, and the bed was soft...but not too soft. I do sort of wonder what was up with my housekeeper, though, as she seemed to do some random cleaning of some items and ignoring of others - and I didn't like the fact that she kept taking my towels, even though there were hung behind the door, which I thought was the universal sign of ""no need to replace"". But whatever.I also didn't like the lack of recycling that seemed to be taking place. There wasn't the card in the room regarding keeping towels/please don't change the sheets, etc., and I only ever saw one recycling bin in the hotel area, so I honestly don't know if they recycle or have the green initiative in place or not. But those were the only things that bugged me about this hotel, which is why I knocked off a star.The staff here are all amazingly friendly and polite, and will go above and beyond to not only speak to guests when they see them, but also provide any assistance that is needed. I had a minor snafu at the front desk with my room charges, and this was not only corrected quickly, but I also received a small discount for my troubles. Each morning, even when I had very early starts, I was greeted in a warm and friendly manner by each staff person I saw, and any request I had, such as turning down the air in our break room, was met quickly and professionally. Honestly, the staff really made this experience a 4 star one, as otherwise this hotel is much like any other. I was given Regency Club access while I was on site, which was also great - they had plenty of really good food options all day long, and although alcoholic beverages were not free, they were extremely reasonably priced. The staff in that area were also fantastic, and really should have a tip jar out for the service that they provide.The Hyatt is also dog friendly, and is within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants (though the area isn't the safest at night, if you're alone). There's a great view of the river, several dining options in-house, and free Wi-Fi in the lobby.All in all, if I'm ever back in Jacksonville, I'd definitely stay here again.Pros: nice view of the st johns river; nice view of downtown; walking distance to the landing; laundry facility; choice of valet ($20) or self park ($15); comfy beds. Cons: outdated room decor; hotel late night menu lacking; valet didn't answer phone when time to get car; 10 elevators but there was still a long wait. When I visit Jacksonville, I normally stay at the omni, but this time I stayed here. I actually like the omni better as far as hotels go, but you couldn't beat the views at the Hyatt. I was on the 18th floor and was shocked that the room has a balcony with a sliding door that fully opens.  The omni definitely doesn't have that.","Well where do I begin on telling you how much of a wonderful experience I had this past weekend at the Hyatt Regency Jacksonville Riverfront! I checked in late Friday night around 11PM and was fretted by the very courteous valet staff! Walked in this gorgeous lobby and headed to the registration desk! Now normally I check in at the Platinum members desk but there was no line so I proceeded with the regular line where I was warmly greeted by an employee by the name of Priscilla! I have to take the time to give this young lady MAJOR kudos and handclaps because she delivered some of the best customer service I've experienced at a Hyatt property! Originally I booked a two queen bed but we had a last minute friend who tagged along and we were upgraded to a suite however with this being a riverfront property I would need to have that wonderful view on a high floor, long story short Priscilla went above and beyond  recognizing my Platinum member status and she made it happen!! not only was I granted a high floor (18th) but I was able to get a two bed with an extra bed WITH a view! If I'm ever in Jacksonville again I wouldn't stay anywhere else but here!!Everyone at the hotel was very helpful and extremely friendly. We had a hamburger in the bar and the servers were very friendly and the food was tasty the next night we had dinner in the Sports Bar where we had our awesome server from the day before again great experience. The house keeping was great the turndown service was a nice treat. In room dining was also good. The only problems I found with the hotel were the rooms and some of the areas in the lobby were very dated. The rooms were very prolly decorated and the furniture was really ugly. I've never been a fan of the Floridian decor that you always find in Florida hotels. The bathroom did look like it had recently been updated as it didn't have the same look.My expectation for the price is based wholly on the many other places I've stayed, and this hotel certainly misses the mark. This hotel is priced solely for the location, and certainly not for the hotel itself as it is very basic and dated. I've stayed at much nicer Hampton Inns for half the price. For $220 a night, the toiletries shouldn't be generic and smell like medicine, and maid service shouldn't leave our door unlatched for an entire day.Stayed here for one night. The room was on the 19th floor and the view of the river was amazing! The room was clean and the staff at check-in was very polite. I did not get to enjoy any of the amenities at the hotel such as the gym, pool, spa, or restaurant. The hotel is pet friendly. I will stay at this hotel again when in Jacksonville.Today's special at Hyatt is BBQ pulled pork sandwiche serves on a hoagie roll with crispy onions and fries, coleslaw or fries.I've always loved the Hyatt! I've been a gold passport holder for the past few years and I don't have many complaints! All of my stays have been pleasant. The staff is always exceptional and go beyond what's needed. My room was always clean, every morning my newspaper was at the door, and the entire facility was clean. Enjoyed the Einstein bagel shop being located within the Hyatt and I love the fact that the balcony room doors open and there was a beautiful view of downtown Jacksonville and the bay bridge area. Just gorgeous view! Will be back to this location!View was great (especially at night). Surprised my girlfriend with a mini vacation here and it was worth every penny! Located in downtown Jacksonville right along the river it wasn't far from anything. We didn't get a chance to visit the shopping center located only a few blocks up the street but we did walk along the riverfront. The room included 1 queen size bed (w/ comfortable bed set/pillows) your normal sofa, office desk and chair, a nice size tv, a small bar/drink area, nice sized bathroom and excellent lighting. It also had a pool on the top floor with, what we heard, was a great view of the Jacksonville skyline.Would definitely go back any day of the week/month/year!Awesome location and the hotel is beautiful.Great location, and the room and bathroom size is not bad.  The roof top gym is excellent.  But I do think the rooms need to be renovated.  The furniture seems dated and for the price they charge, they need to do so. The wifi is not free and and kind of expensive.  No fridge is a bummer too.Hotel is certainly not bad for the price. The 18th story pool and gym are nice, although the pool and spa could use some work. The conference facilities are decent. Catered food is delish but the restaurants here need work. WHY are they serving frozen fish here?? Aren't we in Florida?Overall we had a good stay and I would definitely recommend this place for a conference or similar. It is centrally located and there are a lot of decent restaurants around. I recommend trying 'Blue Fish' if you are in the area. It is the best food I had while in Jacksonville.I stayed there two nights for the National EHDI conference. My room was riverfront. View was amazing. Room was clean and spacious. Elevators are fast. Location is really quiet. There is ""The Landing"" nearby that has local restaurants and water taxi that will take you across the river for $6 round trip (or $4 one way). I took water taxi one-way and walked back over the bridge which didn't take long ~ 20 minutes. The weather was nice during my stay. Hotel staff is friendly and efficient. I ate at the hotel restaurant which was great. Good quality food.Good clean rooms but be careful ordering breakfast room service. They add gratuities onto your bill and don't tell you so you end up paying double if you don't pay attention.Hotel bar service is questionable. On a slow Sunday night it took forever to get drinks and all tables were dirty, we finally left when the waitress decided to clean the long table by spraying it down heavily with a strong chemical that was awful to inhale. Left coughing.I confess I'm somewhat amazed that this is such a popular conference hotel.  I attended a roughly 500-person conference at this hotel in February, 2014.  There were at least two other conferences taking place simultaneously at the hotel while I was there.  The room was fine: clean and comfortable, although I was surprised at the limited television channels.  The fitness center was well-equipped, although also quite busy every time I used it.But for a hotel this size, and which makes its bank hosting conferences, the Hyatt Regency Jacksonville was a major disappointment:First, the food selection was awful.  A massive conference hotel with multiple restaurants inside, but all of two vegetarian options for dinner (one of which was a Caesar Salad).  Even their soups are made with chicken broth.  Why?  A large and growing number of Americans are vegetarians, and we want to be able to eat responsibly (and healthily) while we travel.  This should not be too much to ask.Second, the hotel was incapable of catering to so many conferences at one time.  During peak conference hours, the elevators were literally overflowing. People would ride them down and then up again (or up and then down again) just because it was impossible to get one.  The doors would open on the first or second floor, and the elevator would be completely full - and no one would get off.  If the hotel does not have the capacity to host so many conference-goers at once, then they shouldn't have so many conferences at once!Finally, and this was really inexcusable, when I attempted to use the business center at around 9pm, I found that the door was locked and my room key would not unlock it.  A trip down to the desk, and I was told that someone would be shortly up to help me.  When that person arrived, his key did not work either.  I was asked to wait again while they fetched another key... Long story short, after about 20 minutes, it turned out that NO ONE had a key that could open the business center.  Printing my presentation notes became a major ordeal.  How can this be a conference hotel??Conference-goers don't generally have the option as to where their conferences will be hosted.  Conference-planners do, though, and I hope that conference planners will read this review.  I would likely find an alternative hotel to stay at, should I be attending another conference that was held at this Hyatt Regency.Nice hotel right on the river...that part is great. There is nothing in the way of retail around though, and a large vagrant population otherwise. Case in point, closest Starbucks is 3 miles away. Didn't know that was possible. You have to have a car if you stay here, and I don't!Got a nice room overlooking the west side of the river, can see beautiful sunset. When they lit up the bridge at night, the view is gorgeous too. The hotel is located at a place where there is nothing much going on, nothing much to do or go. It is close to Jacksonville Landing where there are a few restaurants. There are a few restaurants scattered a few blocks away. Unless you have a car, anywhere else you want to go, you will need a taxi. The hotel itself is clean, with friendly staff.They had some issues with my room key but management made up for it. After four new sets of keys they still didn't open the door to my room. The curbside help person was very cheerful and the front desk was very polite too.The staff bent over backwards to accommodate us on an extremely busy day.  Our room was beautifully appointed with a lot of space to move around in.  There was live music in the lobby and lemonade to greet us, making a very nice first impression.Great hotel for business or pleasure. Great waterfront over looking the river and a short walk to the Landing. The only issue is there are a ton of homeless people or suppose to be homeless people waking around. One guy two nights in a row was stating he only needed $6 to get to where he needed to not realizing the night before we already have him $10.Overall good experience. Good customer service. Room is spacious, beds are clean and comfortable. Only bad thing, we arrived to our room with 4 people and there was only two towels. I have been staying here when I come to jax for the past 7 years and this never happened. Also, I think the complimentary tea ""kit"" should be more than three tea bags thrown in a bag. Other than this, we had a good time.Never had an issue with any Hyatt. They've always been good to me, so I became a gold member. And vice versa, since I am a gold member, they've always been good to me. (1 perk is, free room upgrade when available)Yes this one is not as trendy as some other ones, but the location is unbeatable. Outstanding view! &amp; I could care less about what kinda tv is in the room when I'm traveling w good company ;)","Great service, very clean, everything you expect from a 4 star hotel. Nice location by the river and short walk to Jacksonville Landing.I came here for a work conference. The hotel is in a great location-right on the river and a few minute walk to the landing. My room was very clean and we had an room upgrade to have a river view. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was much like other Hyatts. The only issue was the hot/cold water. Only hot water would come out of the faucet. Very hard to brush your clean with hot water. I didn't mention it to the staff because it was only an overnight stay. All in all, great place.I will never come back to this Hyatt or any other Hyatt ever again. We booked rooms at this hotel 4 months in advance for a USA - Nigeria soccer game in Jacksonville. We called a couple days prior to see if we could check in early and the concierge informed is that we could try when we got there. We arrived around 11am and were told we couldn't check in until after 3pm, which was perfectly okay, only when we returned after the game at 9pm we were informed that we no longer had rooms at this facility and would be moved to a Fairfield inn miles away, without a refund, which we all know is a much lessor grade of hotel. Apparently all of the managers aren't onsite (of course on an extremely busy weekend in which every room is booked, there are no managers around) and we couldn't even get a business card for a anyone above concierge level. We watched them hand cards over to some new arrivals and withhold rooms from other, clearly profiling who would be denied as they approached the desk. As a young professional engineer, I do not appreciate being so insulted. The ladies behind the counter were nice and accommodating, I understand and respect that their orders come from a higher power, but this is unacceptable. After much debate back and forth we were given one room, cab fare to the Fairfield for the other room, and reimbursed parking. This is beyond aggravating as 1. They obviously do have rooms to give and 2. These accommodations and a full refund should have been offered as soon as we arrived at 11am this morning. The way the Hyatt has handled this whole situation is absolutely ghastly. I've watched person after person be told this news with no explanation or total reimbursement and the 12 professionals I am with will never patron a Hyatt again. This is ridiculous - we are absolutely disgusted.This hotel is very sizable, worthy of a Hyatt. But there's only one restaurant inside and all the places to eat around the hotel within walking distance close pretty early. There is a gift shop that sells things like water bottles for $6. But those are luxuries. The rooms look nice. But they are made with cheap materials. The walls are thin and you can hear people talking outside... from the other end of the hall!Gorgeous view, nice place.  Digna is terrific, she was really helpful.I love that they have a sliding door so you can get some fresh air in the room!! Too often, hotel rooms are very stale and cold. The view was awesome!!The beds were soft, the sheets were clean. They left a travel tube of Aqua Fresh Extreme Clean every day. The front desk was incredibly friendly.Jaxx is a bar on the first floor. They have really cool bartenders there. Terrific snack mix, and good drinks! The other place I went to was the restaurant for breakfast. They have an awesome breakfast buffet. The omelette station is an added bonus! The breakfast comes with coffee and juice, both are terrific!My view of this hotel may be slightly biased. My friend made the room reservation, and he's a premier member of their rewards club. Having a room on the 15th floor with a great view is a good way to get a matching review! lol :)I would certainly stay here again, and hopefully get a room  on one of the higher floors for that view!I really wanted to hope otherwise but indeed this is three stars.  Doesn't stand up to national standards of other Hyatt's I've stayed in accommodation or food options and forget it, doesn't even compare to international options.  I'm guessing the local business traveler simply doesn't demand more otherwise Hyatt would step up as they have nearly everywhere else I've stayed with them!Beautiful location and nice hotel room.  The room had a nice view of the river.  The room was super clean.  I was there for a conference and I have no idea if the cost was the right amount.  The conference rooms were nice.  The food in association with the conference was tasty.The only negative thing I would say about the hotel was the bed was not terribly comfortable.  I had to take major medication to junction the first day after sleeping on the bed.  I am not sure what was wrong with it!After reading some fellow Yelpers I had to wonder if they stayed at the same hotel. I stayed several days for a conference that was held in the lower floors of same building. From the moment I arrived I was given VIP service. I don't know. Maybe, because I smiled and acted respectful? Not like a crank or doush-bag? Just sayin'Before I left the desk, I was given the free parking card (because I asked) and free WiFi number (because I asked). For those not in the know, one needs to agree to sign up for the Hyatt Gold Passport (no cost) and all of the above is provided.The room was on the tenth floor, impeccably clean with a gorgeous view of the bridge and river. Extra special touch is the iHome to keep the phone charged and close to the bed. (yay!)I had several random interaction with the attendants on my floor. Their assistance was rapid, thoughtful and genuinely kind. At no point, did I ever feel like I was ""interrupting or bothering"" them. They were not only professional but a credit to the Hyatt customer service.As for the food, I had one breakfast in the lobby the first morning. It was the morning after the Super Bowl so a little Oatmeal recovery was in order. Because the free food was up stairs, I had a nice, quiet (and again) delightfully personal customer service. I was checked in on, several times. :)The conference provided light breakfast (muffin, bagels and fruit), coffee and tea service and lunch with an afternoon (awesome) cookie platter. The grand event for food was lunch. After several of these conference, I am impressed at how smoothly and quickly they are able to feed so many hungry ""firemen and police"". Ok the spectrum of people is a lot larger then that but there were quite a few big boys with big appetites and all I saw was content smiles and happy chatter. Well done, Hyatt. While the entrees where appropriately sized and nothing to controversial, the stars where the salad and dessert. I am picky about salads and will judge heavily against a restaurant who cannot or will not get the salad right (It's just not that hard). The desserts were just perfect each time. While I did not hang out at the hotel bar, I did walk West and enjoyed a fantastic dinner and several beers at the Irish bar. (see that review) There are several great spot to wet the whistle, all within comfortable walking distance.Lesson - Be nice, ask, and say Thank you. You get what you give.No bird droppings on the truck.I will first say that the staff at the Hyatt were SUPER nice. Always asking what they could do to make my stay better.  But, the Einstien's Bagels that is attached to the hotel is horrible.  The rooms were nice, but I think the bathroom fixtures need to be updated. I'd still stay there again.Great customer service. We were here for a wedding and booked several rooms for family and friends. I dealt with the event services group as well as various other hotel staff. Everything went smoothly. The rooms were very nice and well equipped. From registration to housekeeping, bellman, valets, concierge, all were happy to help and did so quickly and efficiently. They accommodated all my special requests with a smile.Parking is a hassle -valet-$20Self parking $15And wifi needs to be included at those prices.It's free at Motel 6But other than that,it was/is as nice a hotel as you'd want to stay in.Newly renovated .Responsive staff.Excellent location.I went to Jacksonville for a conference that was hosted at the Hyatt Regency Jacksonville Riverfront.  Reservation Process:  I did not have to interact with the hotel directly to make a reservation, the reservation was made through my company's travel system.Checking In:  This hotel is great at keeping you informed via emails.  I received an email from the hotel indicating that I could do a web check-in.  I thought this was pretty cool, until I arrived at the hotel and saw the room I was given.  Upon arriving at the hotel there was no clear guidance as to where you should go if you checked in via the web.  There was also no clear line system in order for you to check in.  I just stood behind someone waiting for a representative to give me direction.  I was then abruptly told by a lady that works for the Hyatt that there was indeed a line.  No problem, I joined the line.  I then told the representative that I checked in via the web and she took care of the rest and provide me with my key.  I happen to be at this conference with three of my co-workers who did not do web check-in.  I was given a room on the 4th floor, my view was of the AC ventilation system on the room.  My co-workers who checked in at the hotel, ocean view.  The young lady that checked me in did not explain the wireless system to me or did not offer me the free breakfast that was offered to my peers - my peers booked using the same system I did, the big difference, I did web check-in and they did not.My Stay:  the room was spacious.  The bed was comfortable, the cooling system was great, the bathroom was great (watch out for the loud suction noise the toilet makes when flushing, it will catch you by surprise at first).  The desk chair was comfortable, but the chair was stained and dirty.  Checking Out:  a breeze, no issues.  I asked and received late check out without a problem.  Dining:  I did not dine at the restaurants at the hotel, I went to other local dining places.  This was just a preference of the group - nothing against the hotel.My wife and I recently stayed here for a half business/leisure trip. What was supposed to be a pleasant visit ended up becoming a catastrophe. We would never recommend this hotel after our horrible experience of being mistreated. We left extremely disappointed with hotel management and will never return. Do not go.Pre-trip:My wife and I are over 60 years old and frequently travel, and this is by far the worst experience ever! We usually don't leave online reviews, but this is the first time that I have to ask my son to post this review using his account.Hyatt offers online check in 24 hours prior to arrival. We took advantage of this online tool and confirmed our room.On-arrival:We arrived at 11 pm and tried to pick up our keys, but the front desk informed us that there has been a change in our room, and our online check-in has been voided. Our new room was basically a closet with no bed, no windows, and it turns out that the kitchen/toilet was malfunctioning.Assistant manager to the front desk Mr. Palmer came out to inform us that this was our only option. We were told that this was due to our late arrival (so...online check-in and specifying our arrival time was not enough?) We were told that this will only be for our first night, but the room rate of $175 remains unchanged. As compensation for this ridiculous closet, we were given breakfast for only the next morning and a one-class upgraded room for the remaining two nights (a lofty $35 value - wow, lucky us...). This is completely unacceptable!We tried to argue and demanded alternatives, but unfortunately, English is not our first language. He took advantage of the situation and brushed us off. We were left feeling helpless, mistreated with his service, attitude, and inability to deal with the situation. It wasn't until after repeatedly asking ""why"" did he finally tell us that the hotel was overbooked. Apparently, online check in is useless. We just want our original room and will pay the rate that we booked, but this is too much to ask here.We had to call our son and ask him for help. After numerous calls to get in touch with him and what I'm sure was a very frustrating conversation, the best that he could do was to take $75 off the first night only - that's $100 for a room with no windows and no bed. It is clear that He is incompetent, unable to manage his staff and customers, does not understand basic customer service and hotel management, and cannot deal with situations outside normal/standard business operations. He took advantage of our old age and inability to speak English fluently. This hotel has the potential to be better without this employee.No bed, no window, closet room: We had slept (or didn't/couldn't really) on a sofa bed. The sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable, and at our age, we woke up suffering from back pains. That terrible evening weakened our immune system, and we got so sick that we could not walk downstairs for the only free morning of breakfast that was offered to us.We feel relieved to have returned from hell and to have escaped from the unjust treatment and customer disservice. Unfortunately, we are still physically ill and recovering from the emotional trauma. We recommend that you avoid this property at all costs. There are plenty of other wonderful places in the area to stay.I usually stay at hyatts but this one is awful. They first sent me to a room with broken lighting then kept me on the phone for about 15 minutes when I told them the situation. The manager was nice enough to give us a better room on the top. Which the other front desk lady said there wasn't any other room with river view with one king and tried to give me a room with two queens. The second night the hotel had no water running! I can't believe a hotel would turn off the water at 2am! Nice view but other then that I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.As a Hyatt passport diamond member, I am not thrilled with this hotel.  With the hype that people put into this hotel, Hyatt Regency in Jacksonville just doesn't meet my expectations. First off I am pleased with the staff at this hotel. They were all very professional, and are there to help. Now to the problem.. For the price that they charge, I believe it's not worth it! Sometimes prices can range $200+ per night just for a standard room, and it amazes me how dingy and old it looks! I walk in and immediately I feel like I am being time warped into the 1980's. I also feel like I am staying at a Motel 6, just in a larger building with better service, and a nice waterfront view..  Uncomfortable beds, dark bathroom, and dusty lamp shades.. It's really sad that it's the largest hotel in Jacksonville but it doesn't have that ""WOW"" factor.I have been traveling to Jacksonville for work for about 9 years, and this hotel has been a favorite for a while, due to its location and staff.  I feel that it now needs some work though; I've found myself staying nearby in one of its competitor hotels and like it better than the Hyatt.The good:  this hotel's staff is outstanding.  Each time I visit, they are very attentive and professional, and the few times I've had an issue, they've been very quick to fix it, whether this occured during my stay or afterward.  The hotel's sports bar Jaxx is a good spot to have a bite to eat, and they have a decent (more than Bud/Bud Light/Coors) selection of beers on tap.  It's also a good spot to watch a game, since they have DirecTV and several monitors.  The hotel's rooftop pool and fitness center are a hidden gem, since the views are really good (riverfront!) and the pool's patio showcases them nicely. The bad:  the Hyatt's decor and furnishings are really showing their age and wear, and need updating.  A facility of this caliber needs flat panel HD TVs in each guest room, rather than the upgraded ones.  The bedspreads are worn, as are carpets in the rooms; the furniture is not good, either.  It appears management is trying to do the best with what they have, but it is time to invest in some infrastructure repairs.  This is too nice of a spot to let go to seed. The location is very favorable, as it sits on the river, just next to the Jacksonville Landing; the Landing is pretty tourist-oriented, but has some decent options for eating and drinking.The building is nice and the roof top pool is nice.  There is a nice radiant and a small sports bar.  I was there for a conference however and out ed the staff who won a 5 star rating from me.   They were professional, helpful,  and just nice.This is a nice place right on the river.  The accommodations are good, the rooms nice, and the lobby was bustling when we were there recently. It's right by the river walking area which makes for an enjoyable stroll, and the Landing and some of the older streets with restaurants, etc. are nearby as well as an Einstein's Bagels.You can find this on Hotwire occasionally (although you wouldn't necessarily know you're booking it), so we got a great deal on the room.  I'm sure the standard rates are probably a bit pricier than they should be, but that's typical these days with any nice hotel chain.I'd definitely stay here again, especially if I could get a good price on the room.I stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights during a conference. The hotel is beautiful and immaculate. The room was clean, updated, and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable, I slept so well. There was good water pressure (6th floor) and housekeeping refilled amenities daily. I was here for business so I wasn't expecting a room with a view. My view was of the top of a building with a little bit of the river in the background- good enough for me. The staff was so helpful. The front desk allowed us to check in early, sympathizing with our long travel and getting us room quickly to rest. My coworkers luggage was lost by the airline so the hotel gave her a complimentary guest package with everything you'd need to freshen up (minus clothes, but they provided a robe). The concierge was very helpful. The doormen were friendly and gave us great tips on where to go. The  lobby offered free wifi and there was lots of comfortable seating. Disappointed that free  wifi was not offered especially since this was a business trip. There's not much to do within walking distance of the hotel- only Jacksonville landing and a water taxi that will take you to the other side of the river. The hotel offered a free shuttle within 3 miles of the hotel but I didn't use this service as it didn't seem there was much within that radius. Great conference area, large rooms, and easy to go back up to your room to rest between sessions. There were a lot of elevators so the wait was never more than a few seconds. I was concerned that there was no security for the elevators so anyone could access it to get up to guest room floors. This hotel made my first trip to Jacksonville a comfortable one.","Great location, nice facilities. The sports bar has atrocious service - we waited for 30 minutes for our order of 4 glasses of wine and finally gave up and left. Also, there's not even a single complimentary bottle of water in the room, which is strange nowadays. Also, they ought to keep it real - Aquafina doesn't cost $4!! I stayed here as a part of a wedding... I wouldn't otherwise.I stayed at the Hyatt over 3 nights for a work conference. The location seemed ok, not too far from the airport and the river view was pretty. The shopping center nearby (The Landing?) was kind of dingy and a little spooky, even in broad daylight. As a single female, I definitely felt I needed to keep my wits about me as I walked alone from the hotel to the shops. Once inside the hotel though, things were better. Every employee I encountered was very polite and helpful. My overall opinion is that the employees are the glue that's barely holding this place together. I was greeted with a glass of champagne, wait... let me rephrase that. I was greeted with a plastic cup of champagne. It was good, but it could have been the best champagne in the world and only just ok because it was served in a plastic cup. The reception area is inviting, though a little bland in coloring. Employees quickly checked me into my room, explained the WIFI (WIFI was free for us because of the conference, but otherwise is not - and should be. I mean, really, Starbucks gives free WIFI and I only spend $6 a pop there, a hotel room is over $100 here!) and the location of other hotel amenities (pool, fitness, etc). A nice bellhop took my luggage to my room &amp; there I started to explore. I like the setup, a sink outside the bathroom, in addition to the one in the bathroom, makes the room very convenient for more than 1 guest. The sliding glass door opened to show me a lovely view of the river and allowed for some fresh(er) air. I also like the energy saving feature that shuts off the AC unit when that door is open. I would have preferred a balcony, instead of just a metal rail, but you can't have everything.  The rest of the room was a bit dated. The problems with the facility started with dinner on my first night. I never expect much from conference fancy dinners, but the food was so very boring. Our appetizers of crab cake and lobster ravioli tasted of light freezer burn. The salad course had wet leaves (makes it soggy &amp; the toppings slide off your fork) and the feta cheese was a low quality cheese lacking any feta flavor. I selected beef for my main course, and while the filet was very very tender it too had no flavor at all, like it had been boiled or something and the water had leached out the flavors. Some of my colleagues selected fish and chicken entrees and were equally unimpressed. Dessert was ok, It was a trio of mini items, one a blueberry lime cheesecake, one a dark chocolate tart, and the last an apple pie type thing. The apple pie thing (which I had the highest hopes for) was completely inedible. The gummy crust and overcooked apples were difficult to swallow. The dark chocolate tart was very dark, and while I enjoy dark chocolate many of my colleagues were turned off by it's bitterness. Had the raspberry sauce that was drizzled on the plate under that tart been drizzled on top, I think it would have cut the bitterness and made it a more palatable treat for the majority of people. Lastly was the blueberry lime cheesecake, or at least I think that's what it was... It definitely had fresh blueberries in it, which was a welcome change from the frost bitten appetizer, but the cheesecake was sadly quite bland. My last comment about dinner is that there were WAY too many people at each table and WAY too many utensils/dishes at each setting. Water glasses, wine glasses, coffee cups w/saucers, 3 forks, 2 spoons, 2 knives, bread plates, napkins and the printed menus. I'm very surprised that I didn't end up elbowing an empty coffee cup into my neighbors lap or tipping over a water glass into the bread basket. Just about every meal we were served at the hotel over the course of the convention was similarly disappointing.  The morning &amp; afternoon snacks were better, with a selection of fruit, granola bars, pastries in the mornings and brownies, cookies, ice cream bars, soft pretzels, fruit in the afternoons. Breakfast were probably the worst meals served.Eggs were under or over cooked, the meat choice was very greasy each day, and the hashbrowns tastes as if they'd been shredded days ago, fried the prior day, and left to bake for 24 hours on a steam table. The saving grace for the meals were the employees, who tried to be helpful in fat least ensuring the food was plentiful, refiling drinks promptly and usually wearing a smile. On the first morning of my state another problem arose. Neither my roommate nor I were able to turn on the water in the tub. It had been tightened down so hard we had to call maintenance for assistance. Even the strong, nice, man they sent to help us (he didn't laugh at us silly women who were unable to turn on the water) had difficulty! We discovered why after use, the tubs faucet dripped for the remainder of our stay because we couldn't tighten it down enough!Overall, the hotel needs a face lift in order to stay competitive, but because of the staff, it was still a nice stay.I would've rated my stay as 5-star but the fact others paid $79 and $89 rates when I paid a $119 conference rate with another $20/night in taxes is concerning.The place was beautiful, gorgeous, stately, clean, marbly.  The employees were quick, courteous, helpful.  (I would've liked a check-in person with better English.)  I had used the online check-in and brought my barcode for the kiosk only to be helped by a human--I wish I had saved the time and printer costs.  Concierge was available and knowledgeable.  Eight elevators meant little waiting.  (Sometimes the elevator at one end opened and shut before I could get there from the other end.)I was there for a conference, held on the second and third floors.  Everything went like clockwork. Sessions were well-marked. Microphones worked well.  Catered breakfast and lunches were great.  I wished for more convenient restrooms.  It was actually shorter to take the elevator to my room as needed than trudge the long hallway.  The halls were devoid of chairs and it would've been nice to have some places to sit down between sessions.I did not use the amenities like pool, wi-fi and parking garage.  The room's clock alarm did not work properly.  TV limited to 20 channels.  I was disappointed the business center charged 40c a minute for computer use.The downstairs restaurant and bar served food quickly that was delicious.  There is an Einstein Bagels hooked to the back, only open til 2:30 pm.  The Gift Shop was extremely expensive and prices were not marked on 80% of the items.  $3 for a soda, $5 for a bag of rye chips.The rooms begin on the fourth floor.  I asked for a low floor and they gave me the sixth floor.  The bedroom was spacious and well-appointed.  The bathroom was large, tiled and marble-topped.  The shower was great.  Plush towels. The plug for a bath did not work properly.  Great small coffee machine.  They charge $4 for bottle of water.  The view of the blue bridge was beautiful, day and night.  The a/c was chilly but my room stayed temperate with no a/c for 3 days.  The kingsize bed was comfortable but lopsided (high in the middle where less used).  Comfy room chair.I'd stay here again easily.Just an okay Hyatt.  Food in the outlets wasn't particularly pleasing and the service in the lobby bar was questionable.  The place looked like it was open but when I sat down, some staff member told me it was closed.  Put a sign up please folks.Rooms were okay.  Yes they seem dated a little.  I had a view of a tarred roof.  Not very pleasing.A few days prior to my check-in, I did a hiking tour of the panhandle.  When I arrived, I wasn't dressed like a business person but I was presentable.  The valet guy opened my car door and immediately suggested self-park.  Did I look like a vagrant?  I was prepared to use valet service but this guy pissed me off so much that I chose self-park.When I retrieved my car from the garage, it was covered in bird shit.  I looked around and saw several other cars covered in similar guano.  When I went back inside and asked a bellman where I could find a car wash I got some dumb dumb surfer response, ""uhhh, I don't know.""  No offer to help me find one.  Thank goodness for the smartphone.No wifi?  I spend much less at roadside chain flops and get free wifi.  WTF Hyatt?I worked at a Hyatt property when I was in college and for many years gravitated towards Hyatt Hotels.  Not so much anymore.Stayed here twice in the span of a week. It's a big chain hotel and you get dinged for a few things like parking ($15) and Wi-Fi ($15).But i gotta say, the service was excellent from every angle. From the doormen, to the coffee girl, to the front desk - every employee was attentive and helpful. That's huge. Kudos to the someone near the top for instilling that vibe.Rooms are good, not great. Our upgraded ""riverview"" room had a small ghetto TV. However, our ""city view"" room had a nice 40"". Go figure.The pool on the roof is fabulous. The breakfast buffet was solid, but it should be at $18 per person.A great place to stay if you can score a discounted rate, otherwise it aint' the cheapest place you'll find.Room accomedations is good, but honestly for the price couldn't they give you breakfast and free parking?  The 3 mile shuttle bus is a joke! No airport trips, really? I guess Go shuttle service must be owned by the mayor.People are very friendly rooms are great! Always been a Hilton fan but now will only stay in Hyatt's! Went their to watch Houston Texans play the Jaguars. It is a 7 block walk or a $4 water taxi ride from stadium. Great location close to Jacksonville Landing, bars, and River Coty Brewing Company!OK Hyatt - You are a Hyatt. I expect the best and you should respect that. I go to check-in at the hotel with two friends, but the room was under my friends name. I ask if I can receive the Hyatt points and she said that I can't because the room is in her name. I asked if she could change the name and she said no because she already pressed the ""check-in"" button. Ma'am, you did that 30 seconds ago. I asked to speak to the manager and he resolved the situation in about 1 minute. The room was average - Not what I would expect from a Hyatt. Small, few channels on the TV, and terrible views (partial blame on Jacksonville). The only thing in walking distance is the Landing, which is fun only one day out of the year (Florida vs Georgia). No fast food restaurants in town and few sit-down restaurants. The place is a ghost town after the work hours. I felt like I was going to see a barrel of hay whistling down the street. The downstairs was nice, and drink prices were reasonable for a hotel bar ($6 for well). Food was average at best.Lets just say, if you are spending $150/night, you should find yourself a better deal.spent Christmas here and felt like I was at home. At at one of the restaurants for their Christmas special offered to flight crews and was appreciative there was no charge. My server was very attentive and the nice touch was having the manager walk to different tables and ask how everything was.The lobby looks great and the beds were comfortable. The crew room is by far the best I've been to with a pool table and huge screen TV. When I called down to see about surround sound since there were speakers, they sent someone up. Be  careful what you ask for because not only was he not able to fix the problem saying the speakers were only for ipods, he continues to engage in negative convo about the teams I was watching and my job.Lucky for him, I still had such a good day, and meal I didn't give him the business but I hope I never run into him again because he was the worst part of the hotel. Other than that, the hotel is beautiful, in a great location and everything in the hotel closes late.This place was beautiful, I just wish I stayed more than just one night.  Nice rooms, great pool, and friendly staff.For a large conference location, this one is still living its glory days in the 1980s.  The hotel rooms were gloomy and outdated. I wouldn't stay here again, even if it was paid by the conference.Super attentive service, great views of the Jacksonville bridge from many rooms in the hotel, and just walking distance to pretty much everything worth visiting in downtown Jacksonville. Hyatt Regency in Jacksonville, FL, you get 4 stars ;).This is just what you'd expect from Hyatt.  Clean, nicely decorated room, good service, plenty of restaurant and lounge options in the lobby.Our room was on the river and an excellent view.  From the 15th floor the view looked like being on a cruise ship leaving port...The place might be a little dated in decor, but everything was in great shape and clean.Adjectives to describe this particular Hyatt:-Dirty-Dated-DisgustingAdjectives describing the staff:-RUDE-Condescending-Unprofessional-IgnorantHaving owned a wholesale travel biz in a previous life, years ago, I know my hotels. I can say with utmost certainty that this is the WORST Hyatt I have ever stepped foot in!It starts off like this:I'm early, and walk into the lobby at approx. 12:45. Obviously, since it's a few hours before ""normal"" check-in time of 3P, there is NOBODY in line to actually check-in. However, there is one man in line, who appears to be a friend of the Front Desk Agent, ""Fallon."" The man was in line to break what appeared to be a larger bill, and gets some change.Since there was absolutely NO sign that read ""check-in"", I stood a few feet behind this man, as he was being waited on by the only Front Desk Agent. Seems appropriate, right? I guess that I was out of line---literally.Fallon proceeded to scold me, and loudly announce in front of her friend, ""SIR, the CHECK-IN line is OVER there between the ropes!"" {Hmmm, I didn't see the rush of potential guests waiting to check-in}I move about 2-3 feet over to the partition, in which it does NOT read check-in. Approximately...maybe 30 seconds later, she summons me over to the exact same spot that I was in line, and proceeds to continue with her condescending attitude while she checks me in. Usually, I would've asked to speak with a Manager, but I was exhausted and didn't have my normal level of energy and quick wit. Upon entering my room, I noticed that it was dated and had stains on the floor. Not a big deal because I did manage to get a decent rate on priceline. When I proceeded into the bathroom, I noticed an extreme level of filth. I'm not sure if Peter North was previously there and sprayed his infamous stuff on the walls, or if a guest just threw lotion ALL over the bathroom walls. Don't fret, because it gets better:The shower tiles were moldy, and the curtain was kind of falling off the rod. NICE!* Not to forget---NO WIFI! Hey Hyatt, this is 2010---get with it!1 Star is solely based on the workout / pool area on the rooftop. Now, this was nice, clean, and provided great views.Terrible staff,  and dirty / dated rooms would discourage me from staying at this particular Hyatt again.Looks can be deceiving. The only good thing about this hotel is the view of Jacksonville (though not really a great view due to it being Jacksonville), the lobby of the hotel, and the fitness room. Staff was really nice and thats about it. The furniture in the room were really outdated and no wireless in the hotel (a big minus) at all but if you are lucky you can catch a signal from the Crown Plaza across the river like I did.I figured it was time for me to write a review since I have stayed at the hotel once a mnth for the last  6mnths.  Let me start by saying I have become a bit hotel snobby-  I have been very pleased with the service at the front desk and with the staff - They have been consistently courteous and attentive.  They actually have been extremely helpful on multiple occasions when there were  problems.  You are always greeted with a smile and energy when you drive up. ( one exception was a valet  attendent that  was very rude and tried to charge me for valet while I checked in - b/c it took longer than 15 mins- of course I told him he was out of his mind and I wasnt about to pay when first of all he did not mention I only had 15 mins  and primarily b/c the delay was at the front desk- although it was unavoidable and not the hotels fault and they were apologetic that it took so long. )  at any rate- the rooms are always clean and the views are always great.  The prices are often unbelievable b/c I sometimes use priceline to book) But people - really_ you cant be upset with the hotel b/c someone else searched for a better deal than you and paid less -seriously). I booked 3 rooms for a group last mnth and the children enoyed the  heated pool and jacuzzi which were both working without a problem.  The food in the trelisses restaurant was very good and  the wings are truly the ""bomb diggity"".  My only complaint - which for me is a big one (there is no reason that there should be a charge to use the business office- none)Somehow in the last year, I've apparently become a bit of a hotel snob.  Heh.  Interesting.Anyway, I was looking forward to staying at a ""Hyatt Regency,"" as they're kind of hotels of lore.  Something you'd imagine Carey Grant staying at.  However......this one didn't live up to the expectations.  Maybe it's the town (let's just say we won't be returning to Jacksonville... a little bit parochial), but the hotel just wasn't up to snuff.  Actually, from a lobby / overall downstairs perspective it's actually ok.  My issue is actually with the rooms themselves.  They're dated in terms of furniture and setup, and they're really not maintained too well.  The staff was very nice, but when I goto a hotel, I'm hoping not to have furniture in there that I'd expect to see at a garage sale.All that being said, overall it wasn't bad... it just wasn't good.  I'd go back, but not before I checked to see if other hotels were available in the area...There aren't a whole lot of hotels in the Downtown area, so among the various few choices, this is definitely the best. It is kind of generic, in my opinion, but the rooms are spacious, have beautiful views of the St. Johns River, and the pool is pretty great. Also, what they lack in charm, they make up for in size. This place is big! The location of this place is pretty right on. It is literally on the water and has front door access to the riverwalk, which leads to the Landing, it's immediate neighbor. There are a ton of restaurants and bars in the Landing, but from a locals standpoint its kind of lame. However, the Hyatt is also within very short walking distance to a ton of Downtown nightlife, like the Bay St. Strip [Marks, Dive Bar, TSI, The Ivy], and Dos Gatos and LIT are also equally as close. Burrito Gallery, a delicious mexican joint with a fun bar and outdoor patio attached in the back, is also very close. The MOCA and Main Library, as well as the chic boutique restaurant Chew, are also not a far walk, either.At this point, Jacksonville is expanding its Downtown pretty rapidly, and  the Hyatt is at the center of it all.This is a review for the banquet facility and services:I was an attendee at the Teacher of the Year 2010 EDDY Awards for Duval County this past Thursday. The event was held at the Hyatt and included a cocktail hour and dinner. The hotel lobby was nice, although the tile was really slippery.  The banquet room was huge. They had really good lighting, though, lots of big chandeliers to fill the space. The bartender during cocktail hour was slloooowwwww but the service during the dinner was much better. The food was great and the dessert was unbelievably good!All in all, I think this is a fine place to use for a function. They have a nice outdoor patio that overlooks downtown Jax (which we locals happen to think is just fine, Mr. Reviewer from Ohio. What's so great about OHIO?) It's especially pretty at night when the bridges are lit.Also confused on the poor review, but it's all good.  I came here with my husband this past weekend to visit my MIL and had a fabu time.  Hotel is beautiful, room was attractive (though I still think the Hyatt Place in Dallas tops it), and the fitness room was very impressive.  The view from our room on the 5th floor was an unhappy vista of a rootop littered with industrial paint buckets, but hey, what are you gonna do?  Everyone else already booked the riverviews.  Location in downtown isn't really central to anything except the aboslutely pathetic Landings, but there's a Ruth's Chris right on the other side of the bridge.  The staff didn't seem overwhelmed in the least by the myriad of convention goers, and with the exception of the moron concierge who interrupted my photo ops by asking if I wanted to ""see his phone"" (keep it in your pants, pal) all of the hotel staff was friendly and polite.Now, that excuse for a restaurant in the lobby ... that's a different review and a completely different rating.I'd return.","['great', 'hotel', 'know', 'went', 'supernatural', 'convention', 'big', 'fan', 'hotel', 'event', 'taking', 'place', 'nights', 'everything', 'amazing', 'since', 'arrived', 'hotel', 'super',
