http://www.yelp.com/biz/b-historic-savannah-savannah,B Historic Savannah,3.0,$$,20,"Let me get one thing straight, people... The staff at B Historic Savannah is hands-down the sole reason I am coming back. Savannah is a beautiful town; the history, the food, the people... But it was because of Quincy Jones and Tim Rackley at the front desk of B Historic Savannah that this trip took a step up from awesome to EPIC.It's not always about getting the most expensive hotel in order to get the best service.  I booked my stay through Kayak, which utilized the price found on some unknown ""getaroom.com"" website. This unknown company screwed up both my and another person's reservations, but both Tim and Quincy called the company and made sure that they made us a priority. I work in customer service managing apartment communities, and I know the difference of ""above and beyond"". Tim and Quincy certainly went the extra mile to make sure that everything was in order for my stay.So I challenge you to find a staff that could make your stay EPIC in a hotel that is under construction (can't wait to see the renovations), busy, and who is not sent reservation info by the booking site...  Tim and Quincy not only met this challenge, but turned it into an opportunity to stand out from others, and procure a customer for life. Thanks for everything you've done, guys!!  You are EPIC!We stayed at B from the 24th-26th. There was nothing about the room that i liked. We arrived as a late check in and were told there was additional $12 per night we had to pay for parking. i thought that should be an expense of the hotel especially because they had no other parking. on the walk to the room everything was ratchet looking from the elevators to the plastic on the walls . The hotel said it was being renovated. I wish they would have started with our room first. We just wanted to shower and go to sleep. When i got into the shower it wasnt clean. There  was dirt in the shower and someone else hair on the wall.  Under the pillow in one of our beds was a brown stain no clue what that was and there were a lot of stands on that sticky carpet. Its 2015 and i didnt know there was still hotels that were connected by the door in the middle. The walls were paper thin and there was a really loud guy that was on the phone all night we heard everything and when we left the room to go get waters from the corner store this guy came out of the room and peeked. After remedying the issues ourselves we went to sleep. The next day housekeeping knocked on the door multiple times and i told the lady at that point we were still sleep and in the bed and we didn't want anything we were tired. An hour later when i was butt naked getting out of the shower the same lady walked into our room. I had to tell her again we didnt want room service while standing dripping wet coming out of the bathroom door. . 30 mins later another house keeper came to the door with a box with trail mix, water and something else in it. Im not sure why they didnt understand we were upset and just wanted to be left alone. We were so upset about everything we ended up checking out at like 3 in the morning and going to a family member house for the rest of the trip and we were still charged for 2 days,.Nice hotel.  Ever so slightly off the beaten path, but only by a few blocks. Close to the Savannah welcome center and the location where most of the trolly tours leave from.  Room was very clean. Updated furnishings. Nice bedding and linens. Bathroom was also very clean and updated. They offer Aveda products which was a treat. The common areas were lovely.  Bring a deck of cards to play at one of the tables! Overall a very good value and pleasant experience.HORRIBLE!!! A disgrace to this hotel group! This hotel used to be some other mediocre hotel but recently changed ownership. The lobby is really appealing, but that's it. The lady who checked me in was so rude! She was annoyed that she had to check me in instead of texting on her phone which she kept out at the desk and checked twice while checking me in. After check in, I went to go park my car downstairs in this tiny little garage under the hotel. There's probably 10 parking spots total and they are so tight that I couldn't even get my little Audi A4 into the spot. The garage smelled so bad of cigarettes that the smell invaded my car.  I went back up to the desk and asked what I was supposed to do about parking and they gave me a tap card for a garage across the street. I went to go move my car from that impossible spot downstairs and I was trapped between a pole on my side and a huge wall behind me. I had to make a 16 point turn with guidance to get out of that spot without destroying my car. I then went up to my room. 3rd floor, elevator opens and the hallway smells a little stale, the floor has outdated carpets, but other than that it's fine. Open the room and the carpets are disgusting. Black and brown stains all over the floor. Chipped and dirty furniture, stains on the yellow plaid curtains and a lumpy bed. Whatever though we aren't here for the hotel, we are here for the town. So we go out and Savannah is nice, we come back at night and get into our lumpy bed. The air conditioning is on, and so loud that it sounds like an airplane is landing in our room. I turn it off for peace and quiet. My fiance falls asleep fast, as usual, but I can't get to sleep. At around 1 am I try to turn the TV on, but there is no signal, just static, I tried messing with the TV a little, but nothing worked. So I just sat in the lumpy bed staring at the yellow plaid curtains for about an hour until it got so hot without the air conditioning that I was sweating. But of course the air conditioning on was so loud that I couldn't fall asleep. All in all I would have thrown a fit downstairs the morning of checkout if I wasn't so tired from not sleeping. I would never stay here. And I would never recommend it, I'm just trying to forget all about it.I can't rate a full 5 because the noise at 8:00 AM on a holiday from construction when you've been out partying all night doesn't help. They should have put guest away from the construction not the room in front of the construction area. Lovely hotel lovely staff and that's my only concern. I'll stay again only after the construction is over because I hate morning disturbance more than anythingThis place was pretty awesome for the price and location. It is walking distance from everything. We never drive our car during our stay due to how close it was to everything. The room was great size and bed was really comfy. Only thing I didn't like was the random stain on the carpet by the window, which they attempted to cover with the chair. Almost looked like a huge blood stain. There were also a few of my towels with what look like pubic hair. Not cool at all. The hotel is currently under construction they are refurbishing a lot of stuff. But I didn't hear any noiseCame to Savannah for a weekend getaway.  Spent a couple of nights at B Historic. First off, the staff is super friendly and very accommodating, but for good reason. The hotel itself has many problems. The original room we got stunk. Bad. We checked in late and were so tired we decided to ask for a new room in the morning. They accommodated us without an issue. The new room we got in the morning didn't smell, but the carpets were pretty disgusting. As well as the carpets on the lobby stairway. The tv in the room didn't work either.  When we called the front desk, the maintenance man came up immediately and fixed it.   Like I said, the workers there are fantastic. But management needs to pick up their game. There's plenty of hotels in Savannah. This one isn't too comfy.I stayed here two nights at the beginning of April and it was a great stay in the city of Savannah. I had been to Sav-town before but stayed elsewhere and far away from the city center. This hotel is situated only a few blocks away from everything (15 min walk tops!) When we got there on Friday afternoon, the woman that checked us in was so friendly and was very quick to assist us with the parking situation. You have to meter park at check in (kinda) and then they'll give you a card to get in and out of the parking garage across the street. It was really nice to offer it for a cheap fee because we had a half marathon to run that next am and needed to be efficient with being in and out. The rooms were average and I thought they could be updated a little but the bathroom was fine/clean as well. The only problem was the TV. I know, who watches TV on vacation? I do. I fall asleep to TV because it's my thing. There's didn't work at all and was in black and white. Very bizarre but an easy fix! I also got news that they're majorly renovating this summer so with that said, I will definitely recommend this place. Everyone was very inviting and hospitable! :)Nice location and reasonably priced. However, the walls here are pretty thin and I could hear some noise from the ongoing construction at the hotel. The wifi here was terrible: I couldn't even load my gmail from time to time. So if you're trying to work while you're in Savannah, this hotel might not be a good choicePrior reviews in regards to hotel in a negative way should be disregarded. Update bathrooms, clean rooms, and will def stay againBeautiful hotel that is in walking distance to the downtown area of Savannah.  It is situated right off the highway that exits onto the main road passing by the hotel. It is also a block away from the convention center. The hotel has a parking lot the you have to pay an additional $12 for. Now onto the accommodation.  The lobby/main entrance has a fireplace front desk, seating area and concierge service. Passed the fireplace is the eating area for the complimentary breakfast. All are a nice touch and very inviting feel. My room was clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was functional and had all the amenities most decent hotels have.  I had two issues with the room and it was the loudness of the A/C unit. It gets extremely loud when it turns on, which was a problem to me when trying to sleep. The second issue was the sound from the road outside. I could hear the vehicles burrowing off the highway or down Montgomery Ave. I wanted to ask about getting both fix but I knew i was with a big group and the hotel was pack. Wasn't going to be able to move rooms and a couple other people complained about having problems with their A/C units. I stayed six nights. Split between location and the accommodation and the quality of the room, it's hard to say if I would recommend or stay at this hotel again.Cool place very historic looking area.  Just know that you don't need to pay for parking just look for a spot on the corner and your good.  Easy walk to the downtown area and waterfront. I'd come back here !!This is a beautiful hotel within walking distance to the conversion center and downtown Savannah.   We had two rooms; one for us and the other for my son and his family.   The rooms were clean, but the bed sheets were wrinkled and the bath towels were dirty.   We told the front desk and we got clean towels, but the sheets were never pressed.  We loved Savannah, but not the ""B"" Hotel.I really liked this hotel.  I know some reviews said it was dirty, etc.  I didn't find that to be the case at all.  Some of the carpets are stained, but it was a clean hotel.  My understanding is B Historic bought this a few years and is really turning it around.  Our room was fantastic.  5th floor, huge ceilings, we had a corner room with tons is light, nice bathroom, very quiet.  Savannah is so walkable, it was very easy to walk everywhere from the hotel.  We would absolutely stay here the next time we come to Savannah, especially for the price and would recommend this to anyone.  Really good experience!Great customer service, well located. I stayed in this hotel two nights (Dec 20 &amp; 21) and I enjoyed it. Stylish &amp; charming. Recommended.Stayed here for four nights. The lobby is very attractive and the front desk staff is super friendly. The beds/pillows were awesome, I slept very well. I'm also not sure what people are complaining about with the garage. We pulled up out front and were instructed to unload, then given a key card for the really nice garage across the street. Parking is $12 a night, which is to be expected in city hotel. The only downside was the house keeping. Our room was never cleaned after our first night and wasn't overly clean when we arrived.Stayed here only one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Great location and great room. Walking distance to a lot of the sights and nightlife. Parking is additional in a garage across the street. Would stay here again!Stayed one night and the room was reasonably priced, mostly clean (stain on carpet) and with handy parking for $12. Location was good for us since we were picking up a student.I've never stayed here BUT while reading reviews on other sites I noticed the hotel had changed owners and a few people mentioned construction.  So I found the actual website, got the phone number and called to verify.  (At the time I noted the nightly rate for our check in date was $99) I was greeted by a very rude reservation specialist who informed me that ""whutnt no construction going in around here"" and I was grossly misinformed. Soooo I ask well we were planning a visit... Gave him/her (I honestly don't know) the dates and inquired the price. I was told quite rudely (an after a very loud exasperated sigh) it would be $169.  When I said ""wow why is it so much higher when your website says the same room is only $99"" I was asked "" then why didn't you just reserve online"" to which I replied ""looks like I won't be staying here thank you"" prior to hanging up.   Great customer service.I stayed 2 nights with a tour group. The lobby is attractive and staff helpful. The halls smelled musty and the carpet was water stained. The faucet for the shower fell apart and I was unable to take a shower in the morning. They could not fix the shower, and we had to be moved. The breakfast was included for our tour.  The breakfast was adequate and there was always hot coffee. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone",,,,,"['let', 'thing', 'straight', 'people', 'staff', 'historic', 'hands', 'sole', 'reason', 'coming', 'back', 'beautiful', 'town', 'history', 'food',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-savannah-hotel-savannah,Homewood Suites Savannah Hotel,2.5,$$,20,"Hotel is comfortable,  but the staff is not on their toes.   Had to ask for toilet paper twice.   We always tip the housekeeper, but this did not motivate him/her to empty all the trash cans, etc.Horrible hotel. Nasty, made me cringe.This is an old raggedy hotel that has the plate Hilton in it.Has mold in the restrooms, rooms are dirty, smells bad everywhere and the staff wasn't the best.I am a Diamond member so at the check in I asked for the courtesy snack, water.They denied saying my profile wasn't high enough. Lame excuse just to not go an extra step to oases the customer. And mind you, I spent 150-250 nights/year in this hotel chain.If you are around, don't come in here.It's not often I feel the need to rate hotels.  I try to just write positive reviews, and mainly I do because I generally frequent established and well-reputed businesses.  Such as Hilton properties.  Right?I booked this hotel for a three week business trip, but checked out after five days.  Honestly, if I hadn't been working such long hours, I probably would have checked out sooner.  I kept trying to convince myself the place was just old, not dirty...  But everyday I'd get the heeby jeebies just looking around the place.  Walk around in socks, or barefoot?  I think not.I had to leave and find a different hotel.Terrible experience. Never post on Yelp but I highly recommend not to stay there until Hilton fixes the issues there.It's summer in Savannah, GA so I took the best of the worst that was left for reservations. It's not the Ritz for certain. My ONE ISSUE which is unforgivable they let people return to the evening buffet style mixer with the same plate. No signs anywhere telling people to get a clean plate when they return. Major Health Code Fail. I actually spoke to the front desk and the guy heard me but did nothing about it.  I'm definitely reporting them to the Health Dept. Yuck!!Pass on this hotel. Booked a NON SMOKING room and I was given a non smoking room that when you open the door you are knocked down by the smoke smell. I went to front desk to change room and none were available. On the door and the one next door it has non smoking. To add insult we were looking for a plate and found a ash tray in the dishwasher. We bought odor eater and frebreze to try and help but not very effective. Sofa is so uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time. I am a Hilton diamond member and this is the worst hotel stay I have had in a long time.This hotel gets 5 stars for their staff. Very friendly, helpful and just pleasant to be around.The hotel is very nice and clean. There is a main building with 3 floors in typical hotel style. Then a couple other buildings that have ""pods"" of rooms. If you don't like having an outside door ask to stay in building one. The rooms have a microwave, full refrigerator, and two stove top burners. There are also a couple grills outside you can cook on. There is a basketball/tennis court, a pool and a hot tub. The location is great - walking distance to grocery store (fresh market and publix!), Gigi's cupcakes, five guys and bonefish grill.It's also about a 10 min drive into the historic downtown savannah. And of course you have to love the free breakfast. Make your own waffles, eggs, breakfast meat, cereal, yogurt, etc. Weeknights they serve dinner.This location does not hold up to the normal level I am accustomed to for Homewood Suites.  The cleanliness is less then favorable.  The sink was slow to drain and I dared not research the reason.  Someone emptied the trash containers for the floor and decided to leave them in the hall for over 24 hours.  Six large bags of trash greeted me each time I returned to the room from the elevator.  The evening light meal was exactly that and only drinks were offered one evening.  Normal travel is work related and I'll likely pass on a retuned stay for this location.  The furniture was nice and the refrigerator was clean.  Didn't really trust the coffee maker though!WOW!!!! What a horrifying and unfortunate experience. I typically go out of my way to stay at Homewood Suites properties. I went out of my way this time &amp; what a mistake!!! The hotel is fragmented into small buildings. All outdoor entrances &amp; no elevators. The room was okay. Nothing major to complain about. It was the service or lack of that was downright awful. We were booked for 2 nights. After our first night, we left early to explore savannah. Upon our return later in the evening, we found the maid had been there but only made the bed. No clean towels. No replacement of coffee. The coffee pot wasn't cleaned. The garbage was taken out but no new bags in place. Old dirty glasses were still there. Basically the maid did nothing. We went to the front desk to complain &amp; request the items were didn't have. A woman was also at the front desk. She had been there for 3 days &amp; her room was never cleaned. Hey folks, this is hotel 101. Our first morning there was Christmas morning. We went to have the free breakfast. On Christmas morning they served tater tots &amp; egg mc muffins. It was Christmas morning.  Maybe the food could have been stepped up for the holiday?? Overall it was a bad experience &amp; somewhere we would never stay again. There are 4-5 other chain hotels right nearby. If you need to stay in that location, do yourself a favor &amp; try one of those.My boyfriend and I loved staying here! We stayed on a Thursday night, then the following Friday night. On Thursday night, they served complimentary dinner and the food was pretty good. Much better than I would expect from a free driver from a hotel. And they serve dinner Monday through Thursday. I had never known a hotel to do that, so it was a pleasant surprise. Our room was another wonderful surprise. It was clean and very spacious. There were actually two separate rooms. The first room was a living room space with a mini kitchen. The kitchen included a fridge (with a freezer and ice maker), a stove, dishwasher, microwave, and utensils. On top of all that, there was a totally separate bedroom! The bed was comfortable, there was a tv in the bedroom and living room, and the bathroom was broken up into two sections. Long story short, there was a ton of space! The staff was very friendly and helpful. I had added the second night after I booked the first night, so I ended up with two separate reservations. I talked to the staff and asked if we could stay in the same room both nights, and they took care of it. They really helped make staying here a pleasant experience. I would love to come back again!Let's keep it to the point!The room was clean. The location was convenient, as I had no trouble getting to any of the places in Savannah that I wanted to see. The only big downside was that my room faced the road and, unfortunately, I could hear all the traffic passing by (even though I wasn't on the ground floor). Definitely not my ideal, since I'm a light sleeper.If I'd had a room that didn't face the road, I think it would've been almost perfect.The amenities here are really nice, and the beds are comfortable. I will however say, that part of the reason we booked here was because of the hot tub, and it broke just before we got here, and won't be repaired until after we leave. It's kind of an odd set up getting to your room, where the rooms aren't really connected to the lobby of the hotel, rather like separate buildings, with access doors on the ends. But I digress.... Did I say the hot tub was broke &amp; it's going to take like a week to fix? I know this is the south, but man, is the part coming on a ship from china?Nice place to stay. Good location.Very clean nice set up. Flat screen in front room as well as bedroom!! Perfect for hub and I cause we watch different stuff on tv. Full kitchen if you wanna cook in. Plenty of parking...a close drive to gas stations and fast food grub! Very cozy...im loving my getaway.Well the walls are super thin. I can hear every word the couple next door is saying to one another. And now it's 2am and it's keeping me up.Nice property.  Great breakfast and dinner.  The beds are very uncomfortable.  We ended up leaving early to get a better hotel.Ok. Long hall way walks.  Smells of slight mildew and quite a few smokers.Not many other options in this area that are better.We decided to go to Savannah the Tuesday before 4th of July so needless to say, hotels were filled up. Homewood Suites had a vacancy and since it's Hilton figured it would be ok. Plus, since we have a toddler who goes to bed before us, the idea of having a suite was nice.The place was mostly updated. I say mostly because the cabinets in the kitchenette should have been replaced as should the dishwasher and microwave. They looked really dated. There was also a big space where something used to be (maybe an oven) and you could see where the sink had caused water damage at some point. Overall, the room was fine. It was clean and comfortable. The pool was perfect. Clean and maintained. What more could you ask for?The breakfast was disappointing. I tried to eat eggs both mornings we were there (first as an omlette and then as scrambled) but they were kind of cold and gross. The hash browns were gross. How do you mess that up? I opted for a waffle because you could make them yourself. Overall, it was fine. Nothing to write home about but not bad especially for a last minute trip on a major holiday.One of the worst hotel stays I've ever had. It was such a disappointment that this Homewood Suites ruined my rosey view of previous Homewood stays. There were so many things wrong with our room that the staff provided a free room upgrade, but the 2nd room had most of the same problems --- clue phone that this is a junk hotel.  Here's the shortlist of issues:  water stains all over the ceiling of all rooms, black mold / mildew on windows and ac vents, sticky bathroom and kitchen floors, dirty room -- breakfast cereal on floor upon check-in, dirty glasses, dirty bathtub, chipped paint and dirty doorframes, very loose safety latch on main door, dirty light switches....etc. And yet, they want to bill at $125 a night! Real shocker that this location gets the Hilton seal or AAA rating. Not the best neighborhood either.I stayed here under unusual circumstances; a friend's brother lives here for work, and has an extended stay suite at this hotel, which he lives in during the week. Weekends he heads back to his place in Buckhead, and is generous enough to allow his sister &amp; friends free use of the suite. The housekeeping service was great, it might have been just that we were and weren't there at the right times, but I never saw them once, and never had to ask for anything. there were clean towels every time I went to shower, and every time I came back to the room it had been tidied. the king bed was soooo comfortable, and the free breakfast in the morning was pretty good. The room was very clean and comfortable, had a little kitchenette, and a very large bathroom. 2 flat screen tv's...I have no idea how much it would cost to stay here, but if I plan another trip to savannah, I'll definitely check it out, having had a good experience. It seemed to be within close driving distance to everything we wanted to do, as well.",,,,,"['hotel', 'comfortable', 'staff', 'toes', 'ask', 'toilet', 'paper', 'twice', 'always', 'tip', 'housekeeper',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-savannah-midtown-savannah,SpringHill Suites Savannah Midtown,3.0,$$,20,"This hotel is located in Savannah Midtown.  Coming here was interesting as it was difficult to find the road to come into this area, which has a few other hotels as well.  The best way to know you are at the right turn is that it's right at the Logan's Roadhouse.Once you come in, it looks nice out in the front.  Some areas are still closed off as this hotel is undergoing major renovations.  They have completed the first and third floors and are now working on it for the second floor.I was in room 327.  Overall, the room as nice, but there are some improvements to be made.  First the good though.  The beds were clean and very comfortable.  You can tell that they are new foam mattresses.  The windows from the room need replacing.  The windows were pretty bad, and it was bad enough that I wasn't able to take pictures of the room view.  Anyways, some other things that need to be fixed in the room were the USB and power outlets at the desk when you first come into the room.  Finally, one thing that needs to be done correctly is making sure the room is fully clean when selling a room.  When we went into the shower area, there were some long hairs on one side of the shower stall.Fast forward to breakfast.  The breakfast was okay for some things, but it left a lot to be desired.  The meat that they had that morning was bacon, which I eat all the time.  However, this bacon tasted like bark instead.  Also, they were out of pepper, which is normally the only thing I put on them as I don't use salt very often.  I ended up having a few bagels with cream cheese and apple juice instead.Had I not spoken with the front desk manager about the issues that were found in the room, I would have given it two stars instead of three.  She handled the situation very well and professionally.  She was glad that we said something as some issues they would not know about outlets and USB ports not working unless someone tells them.  She also addressed the housekeeping issue and assured me that would be taken care of.   Given the care and concern given, I would return here in the future after all the renovations are completed.Stayed here at the Springhill Suites for a business trip.  Great location, close to Hunter Army Airfield.  Usual SHS amenities and room layout- mini refrigerator, microwave, LCD TV, fitness center, complimentary hot breakfast, WiFi, and parking.  The hot eggs and daily protein were underwhelming, it looked and tasted as if it was made a long time earlier and left on the heater for a while.  A good number of shops and restaurants within close driving and even walking distance.  Downtown Savannah was less than a 30 minute drive.  Honored the tax exempt form, saved on the state tax- didn't realize there were so many other taxes and fees that applied.  I would stay here again, but I would try to look for another Marriott property first.  Will repeat and recommend with reservations.Great hotel. Clean rooms.The good: comfy bed, decent tv, non-tiny bathroom, reasonable priceThe bad: useless cleaning person (apparently spilled water in our room and didn't seem to actually clean anything), slow front desk service, cold hallways (must be unheated), inconvenient location.Verdict: I'll probably stay somewhere else next time.Our 2-night stay was very pleasant, the breakfast was delicious and the room was spacious with two double beds and a pull out couch. The staff was very knowledgeable with nearby restaurants and bars. The location is close to the highway making it easily accessible to anywhere you'd need to go. I'd recommend it to anyone needing a nice, relaxing stay.They are currently renovating this hotel. As it stands I am not sure it would even get 2 stars, but since they are renovating to fix the issues I will be lenient. Everything seems (and smells) clean but is just very old and shabby right now. Happy to see that they are doing some reno. Otherwise, location is nice, room rates are reasonable, and seems very quiet. Staff is friendly as well.I don't understand all of the bad ratings. The hotel is on a row of two other hotels. Room is nice, bed is quite comfortable and like any other hotel now a flat screen that swivels. Breakfast this morning was eh..cereal, pastries, fresh waffles, oatmeal, scrambled eggs and potatoes. Yes, you need to make a u-turn to get to the hotel, but it's not a big deal since the traffic is minimal. Overall, it's a nice hotel, if I'm in the area again,I would stay here again.My room was very comfortable, with all the amenities one could reasonably ask for. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about Savannah, and the location was a convenient drive to downtown. Overall, very happy with my stay.Second time staying here in the last year, and another great stay! It was kind of late when we got in, and we were a little lazy and just ordered pizza to the room, watched TV and stored a few beers in the nice mini-fridge. These rooms are spacious and comfortable, and I had a great night's sleep. Looking forward to the next visit!Average hotel which is good enough for me for the price.It is around 35-40 mins from Tybee island and to downtown Savannah is close to 20 mins depending on traffic. Great Sushi place in walking distance and plenty of grocery stores and gas stations around.This Marriott is the motel 6 version . The folks were nice the rooms were clean except the previous occupants left food in the refrigerator the bathroom was dimly lit the towels were threadbare the beds were comfortable the sheets were clean.As a very frequent Marriott rewards member and business traveler, I have to say that I have experienced a lot of Marriott properties all over the country.  This one definitely falls short of my expectations.The Good--price at @ $79.00 for AAA rate on a weekday.The Bad-- Super slow Internet, bad location, funky smell in my room when I first came in, dirty carpets in elevator and hallway, condition of carpet in my room, static on half the cable TV channels, very dated look, worn and scratched furniture...I will look for another place to stay next time in town.Is zero stars not an option?? When we arrived no one offered to help us with our bags or anything! Our front desk lady was less than friendly and when we got to our room the smell of mildew knocked you down as you entered the room! We tried to switch rooms but conveniently no other rooms were available! Some sketchy maintenance guy came and drenched the room in frebreeze! Can we say gross!!?? We were from out of town for a bachelorette party so we had to make the best of it! The hot tub was broken, the breakfast was gross, and it was like pulling teeth to get any clean towels or wash clothes! There was a very large water spot on the ceiling that had tripled in size by the next morning! We are now all sick! (Go figure) Very disappointed! I suggest that no one stays here! We would definitely not have if we had known how sketchy and gross this place was!! Yuck! Stay at your own risk!!!Stopped in on the way to Fort Myers Beach for a one night stay. The rooms, and pool were clean, well maintained, and the staff was very friendly. I had no issues at all. There was a lady from NYC that complained about everything including the coffee at the free continental breakfast. She claimed it was cold but i was right in line behind her and it was plenty hot. I guess some people are never satisfied. I guess she thought it was the Ritz! If you want a 5 star hotel for vacationing this is not the place for you. If you need to stay at a clean hotel at a reasonable price for a few days this is the place to stop.BTW stayed there on the way home and had service as good as before.Property needs updated.  Beds very uncomfortable. Staff was friendly.Okay the hotel is located in the worst location available. The sign sits low behind trees and if you dont know exactly where it is located you will likely drive past it. This will of course result in driving a block and a half, making a U turn, driving 3 blocks making another U turn and finally arriving at the hotel. If you intend to see anything to the left of the hotel, you will be making guess what...another U turn. The staff was very friendly,  however the rooms were not. They had advertised free wifi but during the week of my stay the wifi did not work. When housekeeping came in generally they are supposed to change the linens. Not the case I accidentally spilled a little red wine on the sheets and after notifying the front desk they said not to worry that they would be changed the following morning. Before I checked out the morning I left I returned to the room to find that the red wine stained sheets were still on the bed and had been remade. Um, okay so the next customer comes in and sleeps on my sheets so whose sheets was I sleeping on. That is unaccetable by all standards. Not to mention unhygienic. The continental breakfast in the morning was nice, it offered a wide array of food from muffins and bagels, to cereal and oatmeal. Including a hot plate of either bacon and eggs, or potatoes and meat. The pool was clean largely due to the 50/50 ratio of water to chlorine I think, the hot tub was down for maintenance, but in the 4 nights that I stayed at the hotel, no one worked on it at all. The weightroom offered very few options for working out. I will not stay at this location again. For the price I paid and being a frequent Marriott guest this was largely pathetic to say the least. Not the worst hotel I have stayed in, but not even close to the Marriott standards that I am accustomed to.Good staff.  Ice machine had bugs and leaves in the ice!  On different days!They just need to shut this down and start all over.  Probably the worst SHS I've ever stayed. Poor execution on upgrades. Really felt and looked low class. Toaster didn't work. Towels were thin and cheap. They didn't put my bill under my door so had to do that before I checked out. The friendly lady that checked me in gave this place the one star. Will not stay here again.My husband made a reservation at Springhill Suites in Savannah, Ga for my kids. They were visiting me as a surprise from Atlanta post my surgery.  Everything was fine until my kids went to check into the hotel. My husband made the reservation and he put the reservation in my son's name so that he could show identification to the hotel if needed. When my kids arrived at the hotel to check in, Springhill Suites management who was not working at the time, but was talking to the clerk over the phone refused to let them check in until my husband physically come to pay with a credit card. The kids were tired from driving from Atlanta to SC and then to Savannah and having a long day. They just wanted to check in and get some rest, but they were not allowed to. They did not want to get their dad out of the bed to come to the hotel, but their cash was refused and they were not allowed to check in.WHY WAS SERVICE REFUSED TO MY KIDS! by this hotel. My kids sat in the lobby and waited until my husband physically came to the hotel to swipe his credit card for a room that was already paid for just like the pervious stay. The clerk told my husband that his credit card would have been charged  anyway if we cancelled the stay and even if he had not come into the hotel. My kids felt humiliated by this hotel and my post surgery surprises was marred by the attitude of the management of this hotel and staff. Early the next day I personally called to complain to the manager who already knew about the incident because the clerk was getting supervision from her and was told what to do.The manager also made the statement to me that my kids cash probably was refused service because they probably did not have enough money to pay for the room. She also argued that everyone should have a credit card. WOW! I could not believe what I was hearing. No apology from this big company; just assumptionsI complain all the way to Marriott's Corporate Office several times and as of today 8/24/13 we have no heard back from the Corporate at all. Why were my kids refused service by this hotel chain. This incident occurred 7/31/13, and we are still waiting on the reason. I called another Springhill Suites in Savannah, GA concerning their cash policy and the clerk told me that the hotel just add $50 deposit to the total and the deposit is given back at checkout. A simple solution has turned into horrible situation by a manager who has lack of training or who just don't care about the people paying her salary.My kids stayed at this same hotel during the Thanksgiving holiday last year, 2012. My husband made the reservation, the reservation was out in my son's name, no deposit was made, his credit card was harged and we had no problems. What happened on 7/31/13 Springhill Suites Marriott? Marriott, we are still waiting on an answer to why you refused to give my kids a room at your hotel.Stayed here while planning our wedding...the rooms were spotless and the beds were comfortable with a high thread linen count.  The hot breakfast was clean and appetizing.  We loved it so much that we picked it out as out hotel location for our lovely day.",,,,,"['hotel', 'located', 'midtown', 'coming', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'find', 'road', 'come', 'area',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-by-marriott-savannah-4,Residence Inn By Marriott,3.0,$$,17,"Average 3 star hotel. Cool hangout areas outside by the fire pit or inside by fire place if you were staying for a while. Quick easy drive to downtown. We only stayed one night but opted for the two bedroom suite since we had two adult couples. The setup was nice, with enough privacy and ample common area space. I would definitely stay here again. I read some reviews about dirty or worn areas, but we didn't experience this.The hotel itself is nice. The suite we stayed in had a full kitchen and actual fireplace (wood not gas) which was surprising. The road noise is outrageous! This is a major downfall. Bring ear plugs. Drive to the heart of things along the rivers isn't too bad. No where to walk to from this location.Nice hotel very nice staff!  I had a top floor room on the White Bluff Road side of the building and it was very loud (traffic noise) throughout the night.  I was disappointed in the location.  Although it was in a very busy area with restaurants and strip malls it was quite a distance from the Riverfront or Historical District.  I was only there one night so it was fine but if you are looking to experience either of those it is not conveniently located.I visited Savannah and decided to stay at the Residence Inn since had a kitchen in the room.  When I arrived, I thought it was going to be a typical room, but it was a lot more pleasant that I thought that it would be.  It felt very homey, like an apartment feel.  The front desk clerks all were very nice to us during our stay...very friendly.  Our room did not come with a oven, (which we didn't know ahead of time) and they allowed us to use the oven in the kitchen.  We had a continental breakfast in the mornings.  I had no complaints at all for this location.  Very nice, and I would definitely consider staying here again if I went to Savannah.  This location is definitely not in walking distance to the river, but has stores nearby if you wanted to shop or need any last minute items.Mediocre. Pretty standard for a residence inn off the main strip. Friendly and knowledgable staff-the pool is indoors and the management company could spend a few bucks on renovations. The wifi was average for hotel speeds.Before booking, I checked the travel ratings on trip advisor...it seemed okay so I gave it a chance.IMHO the Yelper have gotten this one wrong...we got the two bedroom suite for a family of five...it was a good value for the size of room....four stars on value.You will not walk anywhere from this place.  It just isn't that type of location.  Two stars for location for savannah tourists.Room was clean and updated...room gets four stars.Staff was very pleasant...four stars there.Facility needs a little update and common space cleaning...three stars on that.Great hot breakfast and happy hour...not like an Embassy Suites, but four and a half stars for that.We were very happy with our room, the service, friendliness of the staff and  the breakfast buffet. Great coffee!! The wifi was iffy so I would not pay the $4.95 to upgrade to hi speed. Perfect overnight stay on our way to Florida!Definitely needs improvement. Check-in: A few snafus here. First room was already occupied. I opened the door and was surprised to see a family in ""our"" room. The front desk was apologetic and sent us off to our next room. This room was facing a very noisy highway and would not work for us as Platinum Marriott Rewards members. Finally, the last room. No real view, but it was quiet and on the third floor. The Room: Verrrry small. Like a shoebox. This is e smallest Residence Inn room I've ever seen. The room was very humid and hot. It was fairly clean until we noticed a huge roach in our room. The bathroom is super tiny. The TVs had basic cable and HBO, but nothing was HD.the cable quality was very poor. The TV was fuzzy the whole time. Parking Lot: Wthi all the families driving in with their huge SUVs, the parking spaces should be doubled. The parking was pretty limited and spots were very tight. I was lucky to not have gotten a door ding.Location: Okay. It was about 15 minutes from downtown Savannah. You have to drive through some very rough neighborhoods to get there if you don't take the interstate all the way around.This hotel definitely needs some attention from Marriott Corporate to bring it up to standards.This place is really nice and clean! This was my second time staying here on my visit and both times were pleasant.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating, I will def recommend this place.Awesome experience. free breakfast/happy hour and my mom loved it.Sure it could be closer to downtown, but it is centrally located and the rooms are quite spacious (especially for the money).The breakfast is not exactly world class, but for free.99, I'll take it. The egg beaters are always present (at least in my 3 mornings they were there) and there is a rotating cast of potatoes. Thanks.The dinner is definitely lacking, but again, it is free. There is some cheap wine and Budweiser on tap, so no big complaints. It would be nice to see more veggie options, but this is the South so I wasn't expecting much.The desk in the room is great, the kitchen is well designed, the table seats two and the bathroom is fine. I was definitely surprised at the quality of the furniture, etc. If this ends up being my home for 2 months, then I'll have a lot more to say. For a 4 night stay, it was certainly worth it! I looked at smaller studios in Santa Monica than this...The free Wi-Fi is pretty slow, but that is to be expected. The building is quiet and I haven't been disturbed by neighbors. The staff was very attentive and friendly.Will never stay at a Residence Inn again let alone this one. It is built right on a major highway and my room abuts it. No sleep tonight I suspect. Plus their ""pet friendly"" policy includes a compulsory $100 cleaning fee. A deposit seems fair but a large, flat out charge? Wish I could tell my dog he can be as messy as he likes here. Marriott's in the dog house for certain.First off, when you are making reservations online, they make it seem like you can walk to downtown Savannah from here. No. You cannot. It's an 8 mile walk. My husband, dog, and I made reservations here for MLK weekend. We were in transit to Kings Bay and since my hubby did not have to report to his base until Tuesday, we figured it would be nice to take a break from the drive from New England to the south and stop in Savannah. Well, we got to the hotel and it is directly across from the projects in Savannah. Great. We went to check in and our room was not ready. This was not a big deal. We were just going to drop our stuff off and take off anyway! The woman behind the counter, (very friendly by the way) offered us a map and asked if we would like to take a WALK downtown while they finished our room. The dog needed to stretch and whatnot so this was perfect!!However.... no.... you CANNOT walk downtown from this hotel. It is a 15 minute drive. There are no sidewalks and on either side if the hotel is a very very busy street... NO SIDEWALKS!!! My husband at this point was pretty fed up. He was tired from the driving, he was not impressed with the location, and he wanted to find another hotel. We ended up staying because once we saw our room, he was impressed. It was a nice room! I felt right at home and became very relaxed!!The staff at night was kind of rude. I stood at the desk for 15 minutes while the woman stood in the adjoining room talking to her friend while watching TV. She saw me. But, i waited.Clean room. Friendly staff. So so breakfast. Dumpy neighborhood, though with a bunch of similar priced hotels.  Road noise in the room. Over priced on the weekend we stayed.Needs lots of help with customer service. Not pet friendly!!!!!!!! Sorry. Triple A you a wrongNice hotel.  Staff very friendly.  Rooms clean.  Near many restaurants.  Close to historic downtown Savannah.gross.  We walked in and after traveling for a while I needed to use the ladies room and clean up the kids while my husband checked us in.  Bathroom in the hall was dirty with a broken toilet.  Front door had a broken handle.That was as far as I got before we moved on to another hotel.Gross.",,,,,"['average', 'star', 'hotel', 'cool', 'hangout', 'areas', 'outside', 'fire', 'pit', 'inside',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gastonian-savannah,The Gastonian,5.0,$$$,28,"Awesome!!! Awesome!! Awesome!!We absolute loved this place for our three night stay in savannah.. Everyone that works here is such a pleasure. Breakfast was wonderfully made each morning and even custom made our last. He heard we wanted biscuits and gravy and made it just for us. Everett was a true pleasure to see each day and talk with as was Marcus.. Thank you all and we can't wait to stay in this gem againLOVED this place!!! My partner and I were on a road trip and stopped in Savannah. We walked in to take pictures of this gorgeous historic building. The innkeeper  was gracious enough to give us a tour. We ended up falling in love and getting a room for the night. BEST decision we made. Friendly service, amazing breakfast, and breathtaking rooms.The Gastonian staff are some of the most customer service oriented individuals that I have ever met. My husband and I stayed at the Gastonian for 4 nights and we could not have been happier. Our room was phenomenal and ready upon arrival. We had a set of champagne flutes ordered and they were set up at turn-down. The food at the Gastonian is amazing. We didn't have a single morning where we were disappointed with breakfast. The tray service was a nice touch and my husband and I really enjoyed the midday snacks and the desserts in the evening. We stayed in the connecting mansion so it was very quiet. They were making renovations but they didn't inconvenience us at all. One thing to keep in mind however, this building is over 100 years old. If you are wanting modern amenities and elevators, then this is not the place for you.The location was lovely. It is right across from Forsyth Park and an easy walk or Pedicab ride into downtown. We never felt awkward about the times when we would come in late and there was always someone at the front desk if we needed them. Overall, this is a fantastic place to spend a vacation or special occasion. We had a lovely time and cannot wait to go back.I'm a local hairstylist here in Savannah. I do A LOT of hair for weddings, so I've been to many b&amp;b's for bridal hair appointments...Most b&amp;b's I've been to don't really concern themselves with me, as I'm not a paying guest, which is understandable, I'm more like ""staff"".  But as soon as I walked in to the Gastonian I was treated as a guest. EVERYONE greeted me and offered me water.  They even had someone carry my bags to the brides room.  On our way up I even got a little history/ tour of the house, which is absolutely lovely, by the way. I've never stayed at the Gastonian, but they treated me (neither staff, nor guest) with nothing less than the utmost cordiality.  The brides room was huge and beautiful. It had antique furniture, historic charm, but simultaneously wasn't cluttered or outdated.  We also walked through a lovely back porch area with an arbor.I've always wanted to take a ""stay-cation"" here in Savannah. Now I know where I'd like to stay when I do. I also know where I'll be referring people to stay when they visit.NiceStaff andThe place looksFantastic. HasFree meals, wifi, and a few parking spots.Unbelievable place, we deliver bikes there, and the place is really first class all the way.  My wife and I are planning our mini vacation and this will be where we stay. As residents of Savannah this says alot. Thank you so much savannah on wheels!Excellent place, staff; easy walk to river and other Downtown sights.Spent one night at this well-appointed B&amp;B.  Our room was just perfect with nice furnishings and a modern bath.The staff, particularly Walter, are great.  The common rooms in the main house are nice, and they have beverages and treats in the afternoon and evening.  Breakfast is very good.Look forward to returning.Where do I begin........Well.....there are no words to describe how I felt here at the Gastonian.....let's just say, today is my first day back home, and I miss this B &amp; B sooo much. This house, is absolutely beautiful, so charming and historic. The decor is beautiful and the staff is beyond amazing.Kitchen Chef's are superb!!!!! Mario, James, Ron and Walter.....I love them all, and in just a few short days, I felt like they were my family....I really do miss them....so polite, considerate and caring...not to mention.... They can cook!!!! They made our stay, that much better. The innkeepers, Fallon and Carol, were so charming, hospitable, friendly and kind.....I couldn't ask for better customer service.....I would definitely go back to this B&amp;B, if only just to see all these guys!!!! They truly were amazing, never experienced customer service to this degree..... I wish I could give it more stars.....this deserves the whole universe!!!! Gastonisn staff, if you read this review....I'm sending all of you big hugs and kisses from your friend Michele...here in L.A..... Miss you guys!!!!Be forewarned: For the rest of your life *every* hotel you stay at will *always* be held in comparison with The Gastonian. It is TRULY an unforgettable Bed and Breakfast with pampering well worth the cost. For our Honeymoon I researched to find the most romantic location to spend our FIRST night as husband and wife---I wanted a place with enchanting decor from a more noble past but not so ""Anne of Green Gables"" that it would be a libido turnoff. The Gastonian was the perfect combination with plenty of privacy for the blushing newlyweds! We stayed in The Carriage House which is essentially your own *private* two story brick apartment with a porcelain claw-foot tub (big enough for TWO) and a balcony on the second story with wrought iron furniture. The walls were exposed brick and the hand carved wooden bed was so high you had to use the stepping stool. It was absolutely lovely and I couldn't imagine a better place for our Honeymoon!I don't think The Gastonian can be described as merely a ""Bed and Breakfast"" since it also provides gourmet afternoon hors d'oeuvres and wine as well as various desserts and Cordials at the nightly reception. You feel spoiled by all the extras and attention! The staff is incredible with genuine concern about your weekend escape! In the morning you have your choice of pre-ordered breakfast delivered to your door (on a silver tray with coffee service!) or dine in the main hall. For the first morning of our Honeymoon I  ordered this delicious Spinach Florentine Eggs Benedict and my husband ordered the French toast. It was luxurious to just get out of the bath, wrap up in my robe, and then have breakfast waiting for us in the sunshine. It was a beautiful spring morning on the balcony overlooking Savannah and I was there with my husband smoking his pipe! The staff really goes over and above the customer service you receive at most lodgings. While my husband slept in the next morning, I went inside the main house to get myself some coffee. One of the attentive employees greeted me, brought me a plate of scones, and invited me to sit on the couch and read a newspaper while I ate and drank. I honestly cannot say enough about this amazing institution If you're looking for a weekend satiated in romantic ambiance and pampering!.17 rooms, parking around back, we stayed on a ground floor room with a beautiful and large bathroom including a cool ceiling mirror. Susan was amazing, helpful and entertaining. Make sure you ask for cake right at 8PM when they serve it COMPLIMENTARY. The Gastonian lays on a lovely block and makes you see a lot of the historic district because of its location.Beautiful beautiful room and bathroom. I was really surprised how spacious the room and bathroom was. The decor was accented around the beautiful historian home. The staff was great and friendly. They would turn down your beds leaving you a nice late night treat and a card letting you know what the forecast would be the next day. The staff accommodated you with anything you needed. The location was nice too, wasn't too far from Broughton and main attraction area. Everything was within walking distance.  I would definitely come stay here again!My husband and I came here on our Babymoon during President's Day weekend. It was absolutely wonderful! Our king size bed provided the best night's sleep (which says a lot since I was 8 months pregnant at the time). The spa-like tube was also so deep that my entire belly could be covered with water. They provided your choice of breakfast each morning, afternoon tea and desserts at night. They would even save you the desserts if you weren't going to be there in time. All of the staff were courteous and generous the entire time. They gave us food and tourist site advice, which helped and ordered us cabs whenever needed. It is in the historic district, not downtown so it is very quiet and relaxing. We thought parking would be worse. We had to park on the street and move the car once because of street cleaning, but we walked everywhere else. This is not the party type of place, but is perfect for a romantic getaway. I would love to go back!Assuming what should have been a five-star review, minus two stars for the room condition, plus one for the staff. We stayed in the Caracalla Honeymoon Suite. It is a grand and unique room, but it wasn't in the tip-top condition I expect from the flagship room at a 4-diamond hotel. The door to the bathroom didn't close, the moulding over the the bathtub was falling off, the gas fireplaces need updating (was like lighting a gas grill with a match - make sure you stand back), the tub wasn't pristine, and a minor annoyance: despite having a dimmer on the light switch, the lights didn't dim. The staff and front desk was exceedingly helpful and polite, and the breakfast was great.Adore this hotel and the concierge, Lance:) Southern hospitality at its finest, with gorgeous rooms, great food and excellent service. I'm having a ball:)Great rooms, service, grounds, location!We had been here 11 years ago and our comments would have mirrored the 5 star reviews currently posted.  This time the 4 of us independently felt that the place had gone downhill from the cleanliness of the rooms to the breakfasts to the service.  What's the old saying ""you can't go home again.""I doubt that we will be back or  recommend this place to our friends.We LOVED this place. The staff really took care of us and made us feel at home. A+ customer service. The house was stunning. Our room was immaculate and so beautiful. We will visit again, for sure!Stayed here for our Honeymoon back in March of 2014. The place was incredible, service was top knotch, and the food and drinks was amazing. Can't wait to go back again, hopefully soon.First trip to Savannah, first stay at a bed &amp; breakfast. The Gastonian exceeded my expectations-beautiful, friendly staff, delicious breakfast (first experience with grits....mmmm) amazing decor, great location, huge room, fabulous bed, evening cocktail/dessert hour. Just delightful! :)We could not have been more pleased with our stay at The Gastonian.Room: We were lucky to have the honeymoon suite for a great deal. This room is not located in the main building which I though was great. It is an amazing room. Extremely large, clean and comfortable with fireplaces in both the bedroom and bathroom. The tub was amazing - although it took way to long to fill up it was great to soak in a bubble bath after a long day of walking. The bed was very comfortable but the nightstands are to far away from the bed. The TV is small in this room and oddly placed - very hard to watch it from bed. The toilet room is small and the door does not close all the way but this did not bother me at all. The turn down service was a treat and the room was kept clean by the staff.Food: We were pleased with the food. Each night you receive a menu to select your items for the next day. You may have a tray service delivered to your room or have your breakfast in the main house with the other guests. We chose to eat in the kitchen/dinning room and enjoyed having conversations with the other guests and the kitchen staff. Food was always cooked to order, fresh and tasty.  I recommend if you can to return to the B&amp;B and enjoy the lovely wine and snacks they provide in the afternoon as well as the cordials ans desserts in the evening. Staff: The staff was very helpful and friendly they made us feel welcomed and at home through out the stay.Location: Right in the historic district 2 blocks away from Forsyth park. Nice charming neighborhood. Good restaurants within walking distance and a very nice 15 walk to the river.  Overall a most romantic stay in a charming house with lovely rooms, beautiful gardens, friendly staff and good food. A five star for sure.","I stayed at the Gastonian in March 2011 (wasn't on Yelp! at the time, so getting caught up with my reviews...this was originally posted on another site, but I'm posting here, too) and had a great time. The rooms were nice &amp; well kept. The house was very charming. The staff was cordial and fun to talk too. Especially Calvin - he cooked the (included) breakfast. Not only did he do an outstanding job with the food, he was fun to talk too as we enjoyed breakfast. He is a true example of why Savannah is the ""Hostess City of the South""!Included with the price was a very nice room (and decently sized), breakfast (with the option to eat in the kitchen or have tray service in-room), wine/h'or devours in the afternoons, and cordials in the evenings. The house is old, so expect to hear some floor-board creaking noise, but that adds to the charm.Definitely somewhere I'll stay again!A wonderful establishment!!I would return here again and again and again. Hell, I'd live there if they let me!!!However, they won't and I can't see myself moving to Savannah anytime in the future.But the stay there, even as brief as it was (one night) was fantastic. -The night before we had stayed at the Riverside Inn (also comfortable and enjoyable). The reason for the change of hotel was experience and wanting to see the fireworks on the river from the room, not a crowd -So back to the Gastonian. I'm embarrased to say that it was my first time in a B&amp;B but now it won't be my last. Why on earth anyone would stay in a Marriot or Hyatt in a place like Savannah is beyond me. You keep those places for the late night drive down 95.The Gastonian and it's employees are so pleasant, and cordial with all the southern politeness and hospitality you could ask for.The place is decorated beautifully! No hotel furniture here!!Each room's pieces have been selected and arranged in such a way that it's not over the top &amp; gaudy and you feel like you belong in a true home of 1865. Oh...you can't beat the fireplaces in every room either! Breakfast was served to me and my sweetie in our room beneath silver trays. We had opted for that over breakfast in the kitchen just cause we were lazy following our previous day out and about. And breakfast was delish! When was the last time I had breakfast in bed??? So long ago and I can't remember when.The evening before there was wine and  hors d'oeuvres in the dinning room. Of course we pretty much cleaned them out of a bottle of red! We also met a pretty cool couple from Switzerland on a big road trip down the East Coast. Seems as though they have seen more of my coast than I have!We didn't partake though in dessert and cordials later that evening. The Gastonian was just a very pleasing experience all around. Perfect for romantic couples, close to  a lot of things without being right in the middle of it. Off the beaten track so to speak.If you stay here or on that side of town, it really is a great place to bring your bike! There's also pedicabs that'll pick you up. So by no means think it's location is far away from the 'action' so to speak. You couldn't be in a better spot!As good as it gets, in a great city.The Gastonian is a well-rated bed and breakfast for good reason.  Terrific rooms with fire places, old world charm throughout, friendly and professional staff, complimentary Southern breakfast, complimentary tea, wine, and hors d'oeuvres, complimentary cordials and desserts, nice reading material and furnishings in the parlors, friendly other guests to chat with over wine or cordials.  It's all perfect.You can have your customized breakfast in your room, but it's more fun to eat in the kitchen.  Their chef is a charming lady whose been cooking for many years.  She has a wonderful banter she entertains with as she cooks.  (She was off to a Food Channel audition the day after we were last there.)  It's a great walk-around neighborhood, not far from downtown.  There's nothing we would change about The Gastonian Inn.This inn made my trip to Savannah. I was a lone traveler and felt so welcome in the inn by the staff and the other guests.It is an exceptionally beautiful building, perfectly located in the historic district and close to everything. My room was huge and had a sitting area in addition to the bed.The breakfasts were a very pleasant surprise. They were so tasty and the service was very elegant. The bonus is that there is afternoon tea and hors d'oeuvres and late-night cordials, which makes for a lovely way to socialize.I wish I could give The Gastonian more then 5 stars!  If you are looking for Southern Hospitality you must stay here!  The accomodations are clean and beautful.  The concierge is extremely pleasant and helpful.  The breakfast is cooked to order with waiter service and is excellent.  There is an appetizer/wine event daily in the evening, as well as a seperate dessert/coffee nightly.  In the main room there is a wonderful book with pictures and menus of local restaurants.  There are a lot of stairs in the Inn but the concierge is more then helpful.  Each room has a working fireplace and the turn down service was welcomed.  Our stay in Savannah was exceptional!  I would love to return and I would most definetely stay at The Gastonian.  If they'd let me completely move in, I probably would have just stayed!  The price is extremely reasonable once you see all that is included once your there!Can I live here forever? I think the rest of my days would be lovely if I could have a nice breakfast served in my room and eaten on a sunny balcony . Walter, Laura, and Boo are the best hotel staff members ever. The building is about 150 years old and gorgeous. You have a fireplace in your room for God sakes. It has some quirks, such as fold in doors to the bathroom that don't quite close all the way and creaky floors but it is older than everyone on the planet so that is to be expected. Those quirks can also be overlooked when you have a whirlpool tub and one of the most comfortable beds in the world. It is perfect for crashing onto after eating and drinking more than one should. The best part is enjoying delicious canapes served in the parlor where, with the assistance of our friends, Merlot, chardonnay, and white zinfandel, you and the other guests tend to get a little chatty and you find out a lot of interesting tidbits about relative strangers. If you can't get them to say something juicy at tea time try again after some port or brandy at dessert. Interesting tidbit: If you come here with a same sex friend people will assume you are gay as most people here are married couples. It is nice to know that people can be so accepting/tolerant . Our hotel menu was even printed up as Mrs &amp; Mrs. ______.What a great place. I was worried about staying here because when you look at the map of Savannah, it seems like the Gastonian is on the outskirts of town. My assumption couldn't have been more off base. Granted, it's not as close to the water as some other places to stay, but for me that was one of the positives. The waterfront is touristy and tacky. The Gastonian is in a beautiful neighborhood that we got to walk through every night on our way home. The food at the Gastonian was another real plus. Every morning, afternoon and night food was served...and not wine, grapes and cheese, but homemade gastronomic delights. Our room had real character and the grounds were beautiful. Highly recommend.Very nice stay. Breakfast great (ate in the kitchen). Large nice room with large bathroom and excellent shower. Forsyth Park only two blocks walk. Excellent place for walk, jog or run. Wide sidewalks around perimeter; almost one mile around.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-savannah-4,Hampton Inn,3.5,$$,28,"This place is the best! On the last night of our honeymoon, and after a less-than-stellar experience at the Hampton Inn across town, this place delivered a great experience. I really need to say that Kwanisha made the stay extra great for us. She greeted us with a super friendly welcome, and she was actively interested in our stay. When she found out we were honeymooning, she insisted on seeing photos. It was a really engaging experience up-front. I thanked Kwanisha for her hospitality and explained briefly that our last Hampton stay was a little weak. She apologized and reassured us that we could just ask if we needed anything from her. Later that night, Kwanisha brought up a bottle of bubbly, some chocolate, and a beautiful card congratulating us on our engagement. It was a super thoughtful and really humbling gift. She went out of her way to ensure we felt special and she nailed it! The valet parking was great! We loved the king suite. It was clean, the bed was comfy, and the room was cozy without being cramped. After this experience, we are very sure this Hampton will be where we stay in Savannah henceforth. Thanks for a great stay!The hotel offers nearby easy parking. Bell staff and registration staff were very polite and courteous. Everyone is very accommodating. Check in was a breeze. Luggage carts are abundant and the elevator is centrally located. Great hotel location in the historic district of the city. Given the location, nightly weekend rates are very reasonable. The only downside to the room is it is not nearly as large as shown in online pictures. And that's why it gets four stars. Other than that, the room is great.Friendliest staff ever! I can't tell if I'm in love with people from Georgia, or this is typical for Hampton Inn staff, but the people at the front desk were super nice and accommodating. We were on our way to FL and stopped to rest for the night. We were walk-ins. My mom had found a reduced price for walk-ins online, which they accepted with a smile. We also enjoyed the added Christmas tree touch in the dining area.The Run-Down: -Friendly staff-Clean-Complimentary breakfast begins at 6am (not a gourmet experience, but hey, it's FREE)-Complimentary cookies at night (were oatmeal the night we were there)-Size and layout of room was standard-Sheets AND duvet covers are cleaned for each new guest-Can't comment on its proximity to landmarks, as we were only using it as a stomping ground before continuing on our trip, but there were many nearby places to eat (we ate at Ruby Tuesday's). While we found a deal ($89), I believe standard rooms are still reasonably priced.Sometimes the best of plans go wrong. I was suppose be staying at the Hampton Inn located at 201 E Bay Street but ended up here upon the advice that they were both very much the same. Well, similar maybe, the same no. This Hampton Inn isn't as good. The parking hassles even with valet can be nightmarish, check-in was at a snail's crawl, window views not as good, location a good mile and a half from the actual heart of the Historic District, and general interior decor not the equivalent.Worse, a number of amenities, ""Out of Order.""For a Hampton, it's passable, OK, but not up to par with their other nearby location.The 'Historic District' moniker is a bit misleading, especially for most who don't walk a good distance regularly. Obnoxious fridge and microwave, peeling walls, plus $15 to self-park, but otherwise just fine.Ritz-Carlton service at a Hampton Inn rate. William was fantastic and was able to offer great recommendations every time we asked for one - whether it was for pizza delivery (Stoner's) or the best tour to go on.Brad, quite frankly, we wanted to take home. lol He really went above and beyond what's expected and made sure we got where we needed to be - from check-in to check-out. I do wish that this was a little closer to the Historic District - it's just on the edge. Otherwise, we had a clean, well-maintained room. Very quiet hotel even though they were pretty full, but FANTASTIC staff.Well done, Hampton!These folks provide exceptional customer service and made my stay immeasurably better.  William can tell you just anything you need to know off the top of his head!  He and the valet even fixed my computer issues for me!  Iesha is very friendly and helpful.  These folks make you feel right at home.  Another valet, named Blue, is a very kind man.Nice people, decor in sore need of update.  Look somewhere else if you don't like warm showers &amp; green carpet.Overall, this is a great hotel option for anyone looking to vacation in Savannah.  On the west side of the Historic Downtown area, the hotel is located within walking distance of the Visitor Center and hub for most of the trolley tours.  Any and all of the food, drink, shopping and entertainment stores are easily reached by car or foot from the hotel.  The hotel itself is very nice and the staff are all very friendly (William was particularly helpful with food suggestions).  Other features like the amenities (pool, breakfast bar, etc.) are good and the hotel and rooms are very clean.  Because the location is very close to the Historic Downtown area there is a daily parking charge of $15.  Book through one of the online sites like Expedia, Priceline or a membership like AAA and there are discounts.  I would stay at this hotel again.I have stayed at several Hilton properties and this has to be one of the worst. The hotel is humid and there is no AC in the elevators (this means close contact with sweaty tourist who have been walking around the hot downtown area and no air movement). The hallways leading to the rooms also seems to be hot and humid though not as bad as the elevator. The AC in my room sounds like a fish tank or a fountain the water noise is so loud. I am not sure why. Also, I have been switched from one room to another because carpet felt sticky. The room I am in now has sticky carpet too. I am guessing all of the rooms are that way. They said something about the Febreeze they spray in the rooms (maybe because the moisture would make the rooms smell dank or unpleasant otherwise). I come to Savannah frequently for work, but will not be staying at this particular property again. Everything from the air the floors just feels sticky. I will say that the staff are nice and try to be accommodating. It does not appear to be uncomfortable because of a lack of effort on their part.This Hampton Inn is situated in an older building that still retains much of its charm in the lobby area. My room was clean and comfortable, although the carpet was rather worn in places - I noticed the same thing in some of the public areas as well. The staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was typical Hampton Inn fare - I left satisfied.My only issue is with the location. The hotel bills itself as being in the ""Savannah Historical District"" but one needn't wander far before finding oneself in some rather rough looking neighborhoods. I didn't see any of the quaint Savannah I've heard so much about in this part of the city. If I were here on vacation I would probably seek to move, as there is not much to do within a safe walking distance aside from a few local restaurants.For cleanliness and amenities the rating would be a solid four stars. However, the location really hurts. If there was a 2.5 rating that would have nailed it for me.This was an ok hotel. I've been in worse lately which probably lets me rank it higher than I normally would. My room was really big and it had a mini-fridge which was nice except it ended up freezing all of my drinks.The staff was helpful, holding my bags when I arrived too early for check in. The elevators are super slow. The breakfast is ok, standard hotel fare, they switch it up based on the day of the week. The location is not ideal for Savannah - it is a few blocks from the heart of the Historic District, it's not super close to all the restaurants and shops you'll want to go to (maybe a 10-15 min walk). So it was fine, but you can probably do better in Savannah.We stayed here for a night while we visited Savannah. The staff was very friendly and nice and the decor of the hotel was very welcoming. The rooms were a bit on the smaller side. Breakfast was great and had a large selection and plenty of seats. It was a bit out of the way, but still definitely walkable to the river and if you are doing a trolley tour they all seem to leave from right behind the hotel. The hotel pool area looked nice, but the pool was empty (which was okay since it was too cold to swim anyways) Overall, the only thing that wasn't the greatest was the parking lot which is on the small side and so we had to park at a garage a few blocks over, it was only $15 though which was definitely reasonable. We would definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Savannah.Life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get.Thanks for that line, Forrest Gump!  Since a lot of the movie was filmed in Savannah, I felt it appropriate to quote you.  And that sums up the way I feel about Hampton Inns.  Sometimes you get the chocolate covered cherry and sometimes you get the maple nougat. I wouldn't say this place is as bad as maple nougat, but it's no chocolate covered cherry. On the plus side, it was clean, had friendly people, served a decent breakfast and was fairly convenient for visiting the place (although it's a good 20 minute walk to the heart of River Street) .  The beds and pillows were quite comfortable.  Having a refrigerator and microwave in the room was great.  We had four people in our room and I think we were all pretty comfortable.On the negative side, the elevators are excruciatingly slow.  We just used the stairs after the first day.  And the gym is a joke. They had one bike, one elliptical and one treadmill.  And the treadmill was broken the entire stay.I know the two items I mentioned as negative don't seem like a big deal, but I like having a fitness center and I like fast elevators, that's just who I am, man.Overall, this is a nice enough place.  If those two issues were resolved, it would be a four-star review for sure.Charming lobby parking is a hassle but the staff are friendly. Breakfast is good but can be crowded and not enough places to sit inside, although there are places to sit out in the back. The room could do with some updating but the bed was very comfortable and welcome after a long drive.I stayed here with a tour group and it was awesome!! Very clean, super friendly housekeeping staff and the room has a nice refrigerator and microwave. Breakfast is not super amazing but it's free, food and fills everyone up and when you're staying with a big group like I am that's a big plus.The doors are a little thin in the halls the elevator is old but the location and staff especially made me enjoy my time here. Plus only a five or so minute walk to the Juliet Gordon Low house and since I'm staying with girl scouts that's a huge plus!Pretty good Hampton Inn hotel, it's like any other Hampton Inn. Very beautiful pool area, and the fitness area is separate, which is nice. The lobby is classic, but with the Hampton finish. What really gets me is THE BEDS. I slept on the pullout couch, and that even felt like one of the normal beds. Thank gosh they sell them.I rated it 4 stars because there is almost NO PARKING on site. Sure, there is a parking lot designated to the hotel across the street, but you have to cross heavy traffic.I would go any other time i'm in Savannah. GO. PLEASE?I was in Savannah for a job interview, so it was a quick trip, but such a nice comfortable place to stay.  It was fairly close to town, even though I didn't venture out much, I enjoyed my stay and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bed was super comfortable, the bathroom clean and nicely appointed.Last year I stayed at a Hilton property (Hampton Inn) 220 nights.   Very clean and friendly staff.   Stay off the first floor...  Traffic coming off of I-16 in at 4:00 AM is very, very loud! Front desk personal told me the next morning they would be happy to move me if would have call at 4:30 AM in the morning...  Somewhat a mood point!  Stay the Hampton Inn a couple of blocks away!Fantastic location. Clean rooms, lobby, restaurant. Two of the three elevators were out of order for much of the time while there. Had to use the stairs to save time, I would stay here again.","Check Bed Bug Registry first!! Yikes!I am a HUGE fan of Hampton Inn - but this was my worst ever experience in one of their locations.  I would not recommend this hotel, especially when there is another Hampton Inn within walking distance.  Splurge for the one along Bay street.There were many reasons I was unhappy, but the real icing on the cake was that the front door was missing the handles and so you had to walk around the building to the side door, which did not have sidewalk access.Also, the noise was unbelievable.Oh, and their wifi is lousy even in the first floor rooms.  The ethernet connections are available in suite, but there's no cable... so if you go, pack your cable.The staff here is amazingly friendly, and they won my heart forever by honoring my 'do not disturb' tag while i was out. As for the more generalizable experiences: this hotel is pretty close to the juicy parts of the historic district, but it is a 5-10 minute walk to get there, so you're not right in the heart of things. The rooms are big and spacious, with free high-speed internet and a fridge. The beds are comfy, too.Ask for an odd-numbered room if you can, though, as even numbers face Oglethorpe and you can get a lot of traffic and drunk undergrad noise some nights.I'm a huge Hampton fan as you'll find with my other reviews, but this one had one major disappointment - there was no wireless even though the website said there was.  This wouldn't be so bad, except that the ethernet cable provided was 1 foot long, which put me in an uncomfortable position at the desk with no freedom to move.  Other than that the hotel was what you would expect from a Hampton, friendly staff and comfortable room - I'm just annoyed at the false advertising and the back ache I got from leaning over that desk to do some work.This hotel was such a great value! It's conveniently located in the historic district and comes with really great amenities even though it's not a full service hotel. It has a pool, fitness center, and a really great complimentary hot breakfast buffet, which includes a DIY belgian waffle station. There is also shuttle service to the Savannah trolley tour station, which is also in walking distance. Speaking of walking distance, you can also easily head over to Lady and Sons on foot if you're planning to drop in during your Savannah trip.The hotel rooms are clean and very well-kept. We tipped room service each day and she (Latoya) always wrote us a nice thank you note.The only thing that could have made this hotel better was if they offered free parking, but instead you're charged $8 / day. Other than that, I have no complaints. I'd definitely stay here again.Everything was great.  No complaints.  Will stay again.  Walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Not on the river, but not too far.Great location in the historic district. The hotel staff was very helpful and polite. Everything was clean and it appeared recently remodeled. It was a bit tricky to get into the hotel parking lot (you need a code) so that was somewhat irritating being that I needed to park before I could check in. The location was perfect though, and I would definitely stay again.I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about booking reservations at this particular Hampton because it was on the edge of the historic district but my fears were allayed the minute we arrived.  The staff at the front desk was great and welcoming.  The location is actually very good - it's in the historic district, you can walk to the trolley tours just a few blocks away and The Distillery is almost visible from the hotel.  Our room was exactly as expected - king size bed with very comfortable linens. Every thing was clean and in good working order.  Unlike some reviewers, we had no issue with street noise at all.  We forgot our corkscrew for the wine and were able to borrow one at the front desk. (My only suggestion would be for them to have more than one :=)  The breakfast room is very comfortable - I especially noticed the large tables where groups/families can all sit together. What a practical, helpful idea!  The food was very good with lots of choices - eggs, waffles, sausage, bacon, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc. and the coffee was excellent.  We liked that the coffee is available 24/7 and the warm cookies in the afternoon are a great touch. I would definitely recommend this hotel because of its location and the value is great for the rate.  The hotels in the very heart of the historic district are quite a bit more expensive.",,,,"['place', 'best', 'last', 'night', 'honeymoon', 'less', 'stellar', 'experience', 'inn', 'across', 'town',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-savannah-downtown-historic-district-savannah,Residence Inn Savannah Downtown Historic District,4.5,$$,27,"Husband and I originally booked a room for 1 night (since you never really know how a hotel will be until you get there) and immediately went back downstairs after putting our things away and booked an additional night. This hotel was wonderful. The staff was all incredibly friendly, most notably Danae (not sure if she spells it that way) with the dining room staff. She was above and beyond friendly and welcoming any time we were down for appetizers or breakfast. From 5-7 the kitchen offered free beer, wine, tea/lemonade, and a different appetizer each night. We'd never stayed in a hotel that does this but were extremely pleased and impressed with it!Breakfast was always a good spread. Their dining area is very open and the food is set up on a kitchen island and the surrounding countertops. It's very clean and inviting, much different than your typical hotel breakfast.Parking may be difficult during a busier time of year but we had no problem finding side street parking. We were also glad to find we were so close to the historic district and everything downtown has to offer. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Savannah and would stay again ourselves.Ok so I really want to give this place 5 stars for the staff. The staff was awesome!!! Every time I passed a staff member they were pleasant and smiling. The gals that setup breakfast are an absolute delight, truly! The rooms are large, bright and tasteful. The bed was very comfy and the front desk is very accommodating. The free wifi ran great! The breakfast had everything we needed, eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, yogurt, coffee etc. The valet guy greets you every time you walk in the door, even after seeing you a few days in a row, he doesn't skip a beat! In all we had a great experience, we were part of a big wedding group that had booked a block of rooms. If anyone is getting married and you have a large group of people, this place offers a great accommodation! My only complaint is that we were never notified that the hotel was under construction and that the bar was closed. But there are plenty of bars within walking distance or a short 1 mile ride away!On our long drive from Florida to South Carolina we decided at 2 am we needed a place to crash. Every hotel was booked so we got a cottage room here for the night. The lady at the front gave us a room for $149 which was a little high but considering we needed a place we decided to take it for a few hours to sleep. The hotel itself was very nice, especially the cottages. They come with a microwave,  a stove top,  refrigerator. The rooms were recently remodeled and you could even smell the new carpet.  The beds were very comfortable and the room was clean. Only issue I have and not sure if this is usually like this but the smell as soon as you step outside the rooms was awful. It smelled like a dumpster. Everywhere else is Savannah smelled normal but for some reason this location was terrible which was unfortunate because there is a really nice patio we wanted to sit on and enjoy the cold weather. Hopefully this was just temporary.This is a great hotel in downtown Savannah just a few streets from the action. This hotel is located just on the border of what I would consider the safe walkable Savannah. The staff was friendly, especially the breakfast staff. The rooms were clean and roomy. I loved the mini kitchens with everything you need for an extended stay. However, when in Savannah we love to eat out so we didn't use it much. The beds were comfortable and the rooms got nice and cold. Things were quiet at night too so we all got a good nights sleep. The pool is nice but there is not hot tub, which would have been nice on a chilly night. There is, however, a nice fire pit area that overlooks the pool. Alongside the pool are separate cottages that looked very quaint. The free breakfast was a great way to start your day. This was your typical free hot hotel breakfast with most things premade in warmers. They did have one waffle maker that always had a line. The lobby had lots of comfortable seats but not enough table and chairs for dining. Often there was not enough places for people to sit while eating. Overall a nice hotel for a reasonable price. I would stay here again for sure.As a Marriott platinum rewards member, I have stayed in many hotels by Marriott. As always, no disappointments. But, I want to point out that I loved this location.You have the train museum next door. You're within walking distance of restaurants and the Savannah squares. I stayed in a cottage across from the fountain, which was frozen! I got a really nice picture of it. The valet staff was very professional and helpful. The lady at front desk was very friendly and housekeeping did a fabulous job cleaning my room. But let's not forget the bartender!!  My friends and I had a great time with the bartender, she was engaging everyone in the conversation and throwing jokes. We met new friends and ended up grilling with them! Overall, the location, staff, amenities and the customer service definitely deserve 5 stars.This place was amazing. Built in an old historic building, it has six houses out in back of the hotel that they use for lodging as well. When I checked in the front desk told me that I was in one of the cottages much to my surprise. I went out the back door to find several buildings that had eight rooms in each building and they were magnificent. Around the rear exterior is a white picket fence with a garden and Terrace amongst them. This is a property you must check out while in Savannah. I will definitely return with the family.Tip: Arrive early in the evening for managers special drinks and dinner.This hotel is really beautiful.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is moderately priced for a residence inn and is located in the heart of Savannah. The hotel is pet friendly for a fee and the rooms are large and comfortable.Excellent Hotel with huge rooms!  Nice free breakfast in morning.  It's not super fancy but clean, polite staff, and good location.Upon my arrival at the Residence Inn in Savannah, I was a bit concerned since it seemed to not be right in the center of everything - luckily, the Residence Inn - Historic District is right across the street from the beginnings of the historic district and therefore very easy to walk to.  The Savannah Visitor's Center is also a short 3 minute walk from the hotel.The hotel is very clean and all the rooms have the basics of what one needs from a good hotel while traveling.  As with most Residence Inns, the rooms are large and spacious.  They provide you with basic toiletries (no body lotion, though) and all the amenities necessary for cooking a meal in your room if you chose to do so.  They have a nice outdoor pool.  The daily breakfast is actually pretty good and changes daily...eggs, buttermilk biscuits w/ gravy, bacon, waffles...along with cereal, yogurt, pastries, etc.  The Manager's Reception (M-Th) is great - how can you go wrong with a provided happy hour at no extra cost?!?!?The service here was extremely friendly and I would definitely stay here again on my next visit.Pet friendly (for a fee), awesome friendly staff, great location, convenience store next door and down in the lobby, free beer and wine from 5 to 7 and super nice valet parking made this the best hotel stay we have had during our whole trip! Definitely recommend that you book through an online service because it cost more when I called for a price from the front desk...Large Rooms. Stay in one of the cottages. The staff is great. Breakfast was good, standard for that type of accommodation. There is a belgian waffle maker that I appreciated. It was very quiet there. I appreciated having a kitchen and a living room area to be able to stretch out. The bed was very comfy. There is some off street parking around the back if you are lucky enough to get it. My car was fine the whole time I stayed. I would definitely stay there again. It is really close to the SCAD museum and an easy walk to some of the dorms. It was also easy to get pretty much anywhere we needed to go.Great for a family.  Clean, spacious, and updated rooms with a friendly staff and free breakfast and evening happy hour to boot.  Perfect visit to Savannah!So here on business long term. WARNING!!! They allow dogs.... Therefore my room had FLEAS. And I am allergic to animals. The staff seem friendly but not very Accommodating, they can also be rude. the carpet needs to be changed. there is an inch of dust behind the night stands along with a chip bag and general gross stuff. They do have free beer at a certain time. No hot tub... The overall experience... OK.... Advice, clean better and more often. Oah yeah, the breakfast Is not good at all.Truly a great hotel with nice amenities. Hey...a bar next to the lobby ain't too shabby. The free breakfast was the best we've had in a long time. Standard fare but done very well. Done by a wonderful lady as well who came out and greeted everyone with a warm 'good morning' and even bigger smile.She alone made the stay wonderful.I would like to start off by saying that I grew up in Northern VA and then relocated to Charleston SC. Where I lived for over 6 years... so I know what Southern Hospitality is:) I had one of the BEST experiences I've EVER had at this hotel. My husband and I came down from a Tues-Fri visit and stayed here. The only downside was the parking however during the week we had no problem finding a free spot on the road (instead of valet $12/day) But even the valet was super nice (gated with cameras/well lit). The staff was by far the best part of this hotel. Crystal and Kristen were both super helpful! The hotels breakfast was great also has a happy hour with complimentary beer/wine/food!!! Will most certainly be coming back to stay here soon! Large rooms with full kitchen, great little courtyard seating area, exercise room etc. For the money having 2 meals a day provided plus friendly staff is a BARGAIN. Hotel is within walking distance to downtown area bars and food about 10 minutes awayIn a nutshell: My husband and I stayed at this hotel two different times in the space of two years for weekend Savannah getaways. Both times we were 150% satisfied with everything about our stay. Over the last several years we've stayed in many different Marriott hotels but this is definitely one of the best experiences we've ever had. The Staff:First of all, I have to mention the staff. My experience with hotel staff is that they can be cranky, sour, short-tempered, or - most times at best - simply indifferent. Not so at the Downtown Marriott Residence Inn! Both times we've been there the staff has been INCREDIBLE. And I really mean that! They are friendly. They say good morning with a smile in their voice. They ask if you had a good night's rest. They're super helpful and accommodating and they definitely make you feel like they're welcoming you to ""their home"". Definitely A+. The Rooms:This hotel has one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and studio suites available. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite and were very happy with how clean and well-appointed it was. The bedroom was big enough for us to comfortably fit our one year old's portable crib next to the king sized bed. And we really appreciated the fact that it allowed for complete privacy with the closing and locking bedroom door. The living area of the suite was comfortable and attractive with a large desk and office chair in one corner and a high-backed arm chair and sofa grouped around the TV. The pull-out sofa would be great for anyone who needed to sleep a third person in their suite. (There is an extra set of bedding provided in the bedroom closet just for that occasion.) The kitchen was small but cute with gorgeous cabinetry and beautiful soapstone countertops. Our kitchen contained a full sized refrigerator, a convention oven microwave, and a two-burner range. Pots, plates, cups, and other basic cook and service wear were stocked in the cupboards. We appreciated the modern finishes to our room and found the entire suite attractive, modern, clean, fresh, and very functional. The Amenities: -BUFFET BREAKFASTIn one word, their free hotel buffet breakfast is *impressive.* We stayed three days and each day there was a little something new. A sample menu might include:-Hot potato, sausage, and green bell papper ""hash"" (the potatoes were not coated with anything and the entire medley tasted fresh, so I don't think it just came from a freezer bag)-Sausage patties-Scrambled eggs (tasted a lot better to me than the typical ""from the can"" hotel scramble)-Hot cooked grits-Individually packaged yogurt-A fresh fruit, granola, strawberry syrup, and plain yogurt ""bar""-Muffins-Bagels-Toast-English Muffins-Fresh waffles-Cold cereal and milk-Oatmeal-Fresh apples and bananas-Orange and Apple Juices-And just about every kind of condiment you could think of -BARI can't really comment on this because we didn't ever make use of their evening cocktail bar, but I will say that it looked like a nice set up and the bartender always smiled and said hello as we walked passed. -ONSITE RECREATIONThe hotel features a central patio and pavilion area with two BBQ grills, a super cozy outdoor gas fire pit, a covered gazebo, and a good sized outdoor swimming pool. I only wish we had had more time to enjoy them all! They were all very lovely and well-maintained. -EXERCISE FACILITIESThe exercise room was bigger than I would have imagined with a large selection of fitness equipment to choose from. Unfortunately, I didn't use any of it, though, so I can't comment beyond that. ;)-PARKINGParking is not free at this hotel ... but a lot of that is due to the fact that it's just off of downtown Savannah and parking is at a premium there. The upside, however, is that even though you will be charged $12 per day for parking, it is VALET service and your vehicle will be stored behind a secure, gated, barbed wire enclosure when it is not in use. The valet service is super prompt and we actually really enjoyed being able to just drop our vehicle off at the door. So in the end, I don't really see this as too much of a negative. Just factor it into your costs.The Location:The location of this hotel is definitely nice. It's not super premium by any means, but if you're willing to walk 10-15 minutes, you can make your way to just about any of the attractions in downtown Savannah from your doorstep on foot. And if you're not into walking everywhere - the FREE Savannah bus line makes a stop right in from of the hotel as well. The street that the hotel is just off of (Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd) is a little busy, but one crosswalk will take you over a block and it's a relatively quiet and pleasant stroll under the oak trees from there.  So enjoy your stay in Savannah ... and let me know if you found this review helpful! Thanks :)This hotel isn't super fancy, but I found it to be very comfortable and accommodating, especially for business purposes. The kitchenette was a big plus, and housekeeping services did a nice job of keeping everything clean and stocked. The location is a little awkward if you don't have a car, but it's a close walk to everything downtown (just be cautious walking in the area at night). There's a 24-hour convenience store next door, which is helpful.Staying in Savannah at the Residence Inn.  Great city, good location.The people working at this hotel are the friendliest, most helpful employees I have met in quite some time.  The front desk clerk, the valet, the maintenance staff and the barmaid - all a credit to Marriott.  A real pleasure.  JExcellent pet friendly hotel--sometimes places that take dogs are gross, but not this place. Ask for one of the cottages...it's like a big studio apartment.  Quiet, clean, excellent staff. Grounds are spotless (except for where the usual morons haven't picked up after their dogs).  Guys at valet parking were helpful and very welcoming.   Good location, about 10-15 minute walk to main area of historic district, but trolley stops at hotel frequently.  Whole place just has a good vibe.  Bonus for railroad buffs like me:  right next to Georgia Railroad Museum.As a business traveler, I've stayed in many extended stay hotels over the last year. About 90% of my life seems to happen while I have two suitcases unpacked in a 1 bedroom suite.This is the best extended stay I have ever stayed in. I spent a month holed up in Savannah on a work project and the place was a home away from home. Breakfast was of a higher quality than other marriott free breakfasts, bar was open when I needed it, building was well laid out, room was large and comfortable.The staff put the place over the top. Got to know me and how I liked to be helped. Really cool people.Valet parking, nice patio with fireplace, really good price. I had an excellent stay.","We stayed two nights while working in Savannah. We travel often and try to stay at Residence Inns most if the time. This is so far the best Residence Inn we have stayed in. The staff was great, the bar was nice to have and everything was well maintained.We stayed here a few weeks ago to attend a graduation at the Marine base.  Ziphora and Kristin went above and beyond to help is with booking another night on points to avoid us having to switch hotels.One of the nicest Residence Inns I have stayed in.  Very spacious rooms (at least in the cottages) and quiet location. Good breakfast fare too.Amazing hotel.  This really could be a full service Marriott, it is much nicer than many of them.  Easy check in.  Parking on the street.  What else could you ask for?I'm so sorry that it has taken me almost 2 years to post this forthe Residence Inn Savannah, but here it goes.I worked on the movie ""The Last Song"" in Savannah, GA from May 2009-September 2009.So needless to say, I was in the city for quite some time.When I received word from Disney that I would be working out of townin Savannah, GA I had no idea where the Production Company wouldput me up.When I arrived, I could not believe how clean, beautiful and well-keptthe hotel was presented. From the front desk staff, to the housekeepers, to the managing staff....what a professional place to stay.Donnie the general manager was very nice and pleasant. My job required that I pay the hotel bills for our cast/crew members, sowith that said I had to deal with the management very closely.Donna Krohn and I had phone conversations 2-3 times per week, and she was very helpful, knowledgeable, and professional.Each and every morning, breakfast was presented in the hotel lobby.Amazing!!!!And the staff was so nice..If I needed a cab somewhere, I could always call down to the frontdesk, and they would call a cab for me.The gym was very clean, and had enough equipment to geta great workout.The pool was clean as well, and offered relief from the Savannah heat.There was also a BBQ on the property and we used it a few timesto relax and BBQ in the outdoor area of the hotel property.The location was a plus, and I could walk to any/everywhere that Idesired.Bottom line-the entire staff from management to valet was AMAZING!!!!!Thanks guys,DanielI want to tell you about my experience at the Residence Inn by Marriott in Savannah, GA. I stayed there 6/29/13 to 7/3/13 with my 12 year old daugher. We were there for my daughter's dance competition. This is the second year that we've stayed there. We checked in on Saturday and right before going to bed, I opened the night stand and found a condom box with one condom in it. I also found an opened wrapper with lubicant all in the drawer. I was so mortified by this that I did not sleep in the bed. I used the pullout couch, which had pee stains on it. At this point, I had to weigh my options of which was worse. It was also very uncomfortable for my daughter to find condoms in her room. We were both extremely grossed out by this. The next day, I notified the manager which I had to wait quite awhile for him to see me. He offered to change rooms or comp my room. I had already unpacked all my belongs which was a lot. He also told me that the customer before me had been there a month. Now, I am getting even a worse picture in my mind of the room. I decide to search the room thoroughly and I find a bar napkin with a girls number written on it. I am completely grossed out by this point. The guy in the room before me has been staying here a month bringing random girls back to his room having sex. The worst part is obviously the hotel staff did not clean the room properly. The next thought is what else did they not clean. I had the room recleaned while I was there. After all of this, when I was checking out, I requested a late check out. My friend had just asked and the attendant said yes. However, when I asked, she rudely said no. I tried to explain that with everything that I went through with this hotel, don't you think you could accomodate me? But the answer was NO. After this experience, I will never stay at a Marriott again. I travel quite a bit with dance competition and we always have several options. I will never choose Marriott again.this hotel, undoubtedly, tainted my view and memories of savannah georgia.   when people talk about southern hospitality w/ that lovely twang, they surely did NOT mean this place.  when my husband had to travel there for work recently, i tagged along w/ our kids.  we checked in here because the pictures looked good and we are members of marriott.  as for location, it might be considered w/in the boundaries of the historical district, but quite far away from the nightlife and everything worth seeing w/in the city limits.  you will need to walk everywhere if you want to see the good parts of savannah.  the hotel might look good in the pictures, but the rooms are tired and not well kept up.  we stayed 3 long painful nights here.  the rooms were dirty and  all of the dishes and pots were dirty.  the hand towels had stains and the carpet needed to be vacuumed.  their housekeeping are just really, really bad or they need hire a new crew.  i had to do laundry and the tiny room was just filthy.  the bar and lobby is dark and uninviting.  their idea of a work/business center are 2 old computers that are up against the walls and forget about privacy to check on things like your bank accounts.  everyone can see what you doing or typing.  the chairs for the computers are so old, you sink down when you sit.  as if any of this does not make you run away from this place, you have to meet the staff.  oh boy!  most of the ladies in the front desk are locals w/ serious attitude.  they are rude and do not make any effort to perform the basic functions of their jobs.  during the evenings, the staff will congregate in the tiny lobby area and act like it is their own personal living room and talk super loud about anything and everything.  one night, they had their friends hanging out in the lobby and they were too busy yapping than to bother w/ helping guests.  when you need something, you have to wait in between their conversations to get a word in.  i am not sure how people speak in savannah, but the staff at this hotel reminded me of a really bad rap video. i was on the computer late at night, the night girl at the desk spent most of her time on the phone talking w/ her friends, instead of working, as loud as possible and her gutteral and ghetto language was just unreal.  i had to peek my head around the corner to make sure it was not some teenage kid on the phone at midnight.  their idea of a hot breakfast was some frozen potatoes and disgusting frozen meat.  i am not sure if my dogs would eat the food.  i plan to call their corporate office to share my experience and let them know about this location.  be aware of this Residence Inn and stay away!",,,,"['husband', 'originally', 'booked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/eliza-thompson-house-savannah,Eliza Thompson House,4.5,$$$,32,"If you want the Old Southern Charm experience, this is the place to go. Located at the beautiful Jones St lined with trees and cobblestones, it was just majestic walking to and from the house. We were lucky enough to score parking across the street so we just walked the whole time going around. Front desk was friendly and helpful! We got a basic room it was really cozy with views of the courtyard. Small bathroom but works well and is complete with the basic amenities you might need.My favorite part was the cocktails before dinner and dessert with coffee after. It was a great way to meet new people! There is good, free breakfast at the courtyard every morning too! I wish we could've stayed longer and will definitely stay here again.This was my first B&amp;B stay and won't be my last.  I chose the ETH purely on chance.  The hotel that caught my eye was actually their sister property, The Gastonian, but it was booked. We were not disappointed.  We were greeted at the curb by a very friendly bell staff who welcomed us and made us aware of the parking situation (curbside parking only and there are street sweepers on the weekends). He even filled the parking meter after I moved my car to the proper spot. The front desk staff at the ETH was a god send.  I was proposing to my GF this weekend and they pulled out all the stops to make sure I had everything I needed.  The weekend would not have been the same without the staff's help.  They accommodated my photographer as well.  Check in and check out took a total of 5 minutes combined. The property offers free continental breakfast, a nightly wine and cheese social followed by a nightly snack and coffee hour.  The food staff at the ETH is amazing. All the foods and desserts were delicious.  There was also free soft drinks whenever you requested them. The house has free wifi and satellite cable.  They also offer a nightly turn down service and help booking any reservations for tours you may be interested in. No words can explain how beautiful this property is. Their website does not do the property any justice.  They have a beautiful courtyard with a koi pond and fountain. It is truly amazing and it's within walking distance of everything in the historic district.The property also offers a ""stay 9 nights and get the 10th free"" program in association with 3 other properties in the city.We plan to visit again, and you should too!Old old old but lovable. The staff is superior and seem like they love to serve their guests. Not just some of the staff but everyone who we had contact with. Breakfast was excellent and the hours were extended. Be sure to ask about local places to eat or things to see. The afternoon wine and snacks were nice and a chance to jaw with other sojourners. At 9 pm they have decaf and in house made deserts. Another gab session. If you expect all the modern features in this old hotel you might want to stay some other place.Down sides; Internet kept cutting out, parking is on the street. The town of Savanna apparently prides its self on being parking fund raisers on out of town guests.Amazing home and excellent staff, we will definitely return to the home and I highly recommend anyone looking for a quaint bed and breakfast experience to give them a try!!Our room was pretty small, but beautifully appointed and opened out onto the courtyard which offered pretty views.  The service was also spectacular.  Every person we talked to that worked here was a delight.  We hit the wine and cheese hour one day and I was impressed with the spread - lots of different cheese, some dip, some pasta salad.  The dessert at night was also impressive although we didn't stop by too much for that.  I wasn't blown away by breakfast.  I think they call it an expanded continental breakfast which it most definitely is.  I didn't love the seating area for breakfast either.That being said, location was great, staff was great and it was overall a good experience.  I would definitely stay here again.One of the most, if not the most charming BnB I've stayed in. We picked it like shooting darts on a map, but we got lucky. It was one of my best hotel experiences. It has character &amp; the staff treats you like a vip guest. Their wine hour, breakfast and cool beverages during the day are better than most restaurants. It is with great hesitation I write this review, I don't want this place to be booked up next time I return to Savannah. If you get lucky enough to stay here. It's also one of the haunted houses in GA.Can't say enough positive things about the Eliza Thompson House! The location is great, allowing me to walk to sites of interest and to restaurants. The accommodations were charming, comfortable and clean. The premises is inviting, especially the garden court yard with its fountain and seating area. The staff was so friendly and helpful! Would return again without question!Love, Love, LOVED the Eliza Thompson House!My husband and I took a weekend trip to Savannah (and just like other commentators, we've wanted to go since reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil). This was also our first B&amp;B experience.The location couldn't be any more perfect. It's right in the middle of the historic district, so we were able to just park the car and walk everywhere. Regarding parking, there are meters on the street and the city sweeps different sides of the street each night, but there are signs indicating which side each night. The meters are also free on the weekend, but cost on M-F.We stayed in the R. Bruce room and it was wonderful. The ceiling was so neat (as you can see in the photos). It felt like a dream. Service was great...certainly nice to come back to Andes mints each night. Bathroom was okay...but what do you expect when you have a house that old that was converted to a B&amp;B in the middle of the 20th century?Breakfast was good. My favorite part was the biscuits (which were apparently not homemade, but still delicious). The food rotated each morning but it was basically an egg dish, meat, biscuits, grits, muffins/bread and yogurt/fruit/granola. The heated inside area was a little tight, but I'm sure we could have taken advantage of the courtyard as it wasn't THAT cold.We had the hors d'eourves one night (wine, deviled eggs, toast with a spread, cheese and crackers) and the desserts (cream puffs and cake and coffee) as well. Nice touch!I would definitely recommend staying at the Eliza Thompson house on your visit to Savannah.This is one of the best B&amp;B's that we have ever stayed at. Nice and quiet even though its right at the corner of Bull St. And W. Jones. Everything is geared to making their guest feel comfortable and completely at ease. I gave the house 4 stars but Kelly deserves 5 stars and probably 6. She was just stellar. Nothing was too difficult. If we made a request it was done then and there. Overall, this is a great place to stay. Highly recommend.Very nice place to stay in the Historic District of Savannah.  The interior of the house is lovely and comfortable.  The rooms inside of the house are so cool I hated to leave.  Breakfast served from 8:00-10:00 is about the same every day, varied only slightly by what was in the eggs -- sausage or cheese and zucchini, etc.  the wine served with a different cheeses and snacks every evening at 5:00 in the study was a fun social event with my fellow tourists.Overall I loved it.  I only wish that I had been able to book a room inside of the main house instead of the carriage house.  My room was fine, but not amazing like the bedrooms inside of the house -- for the same cost.  I did have a lovely view of the fountain and the courtyard, which was spooky at night with all of the statues.  Very cool.The staff was incredible and very accommodating.   It made for an amazing little adventure to one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited in the US.No complaints at all, historical, perfect location, Friendly, accommodating Staff. Great value. Highly recommended.This inn is located within one of Savannah's old historic homes. The inn is just adorable and has all the old Savannah charm you are looking for when staying in an old historic inn. Historic Savannah tradition of serving breakfast is served out on the courtyard every morning and consists of homemade biscuits, some sort of egg dish, potatoes, bacon, cereal, grits, yogurt, and fruit. Much better than the average continental breakfast and pretty tasty. The courtyard is beautiful and peaceful and my husband and I spent a lot of time just sitting and hanging out in it. We stayed in a more standard room, which was a bit on the small side but we knew what we were getting when we chose it. They have larger rooms available. They also serve lemonade all day in the parlor and have wine and appetizers from 5:30 to 7pm. This was so. Ice, although the wine could have been of a bit better quality. We were very pleasantly surprised when we got back from dinner our first night and saw that homemade desserts were also served in the parlor.  The staff were so helpful and accommodating. Every one of our needs was taken care of. Kelly, the manager at the front desk was just a dream. So friendly and making sure everything we could possibly want was taken care of. The inn is centrally located so you will have an easy time getting around Savannah. It is also located on Jones Street which my husband and I couldn't stop walking down. The oak lined street was beautiful and charming. Each house was unique and clearly about a century old. I would recommend staying here to anyone. Such a great stay here.I wish I could give 2 and a half stars. 3 just is too many but 2 doesn't seem like quite enough.  When we first checked in the woman was helping another couple. Completely understandable. However, instead of telling us ""I'll be right with you"" or something else along those lines, she ignored us. We stood there awkwardly for about 10 minutes. The room was okay. I found a used tooth pick on the night stand - so that was pretty gross. Also, the room didn't have much character. I felt like I was at a hotel instead of a B&amp;B. I wanted to book a B&amp;B because of the character of the rooms. I would have booked a hotel closer to the river &amp; cheaper had I known better. The outside patio was very beautiful. A lot of greenery and fish in the pond.  Let's get to breakfast..it was also okay.. The sausage seemed like microwave sausage, the bacon was pretty dried out. The eggs were burnt on the bottom. It was edible, but not great. Honestly, my favorite food item was the toast, if that tells you anything. The wine and cheese was pretty good - they had more  hors d'ouerves than I was expecting. The staff was all very friendly. The cook came out to make sure we liked the food. ( I'm too nice to tell her it was ""ehh okay"" to her face). Overall it was a ""meh"" experience. I won't go back there. I absolutely LOVED Savannah though, and thankfully we weren't in our room other than to sleep and get ready.This place was cute and felt luxurious.  The staff was polite and the location was great.  The room was very clean and beautiful.  Comfy bed.  The only negatives were the cheap wine and cheese and the walls are very thin.  They don't allow children, so that was a plus for us.No complaints. Wonderful staff, clean rooms, good breakfast...love they have a nightly social gathering with wine and appetizers. Savannah has so many great things to offer and this place allows you to enjoy everything. We didn't mind the walk down through the squares to bay street. Even though our room was next to the breakfast area, we definitely weren't awoken by the early risers! Would stay here again if we every return. Very charming!Book the Lindsey room.  Really beautiful, one of the 2 original rooms in the house with a gigantic king bed. Definitely the best room in my opinion. Breakfast was better than expected. A really nice selection served buffet style (which I prefer to a plated breakfast as is the case at some other B&amp;B's). On the day we were there they had a yummy baked egg dish, hash browns, sausage, ham, grits, warm biscuits and an assortment of breads and muffins. Also, some cold cereal options as well as yogurt with fruit and granola.  Coffee was very good as well. The dessert and decaf coffee spread at night (I think between 8-10) was an extra special touch.  We will definitely return to this House. Pretty special.The room was so comfortable, there were no ghosts and the wine and cheese they had in the parlor was perfect. I Love Savannah!Such a wonderful B&amp;B to experience Savannah from. My girlfriend and I had a great time staying at this comfortable, quaint B&amp;B. While the location is a little further from the river than other accommodations, it also immersed us deeper into old town Savannah than we might otherwise have experienced.I should also note that I'm a noise sensitive, light sleeper but had no problems with noise here and felt well rested each morning.We would recommend Eliza Thompson House to friends.I have a black soul for hotels, and this WAS my first Bed and Breakfast, so take these things into account with this review.  First and foremost I would like to say the Staff was incredible and a delight.  I had absolutely no complaints whatsoever from a customer service standpoint.  The problems come with the actual amenities provided by the B&amp;B itself.  The rooms and beds are quite small, especially for a couple of the ""Girthier"" persuasion.  If you are expected accommodations like a chain hotel, you will not find it here.I freely admit I was probably not the target demographic for this place and that should be taken into account when considering my words.In addition to the room they have a somewhat meager breakfast offering that could at least be said to put food in your mouth but little else considering its 50% of the Breakfast in Bed And Breakfast. In the evenings there is a wine a cheese offering and a dessert offering which was decent but serves mostly to allow you an excuse to talk to the other patrons.Overall I am not, as I said, probably the target audience for the cool B&amp;B crowd. The Better Half seemed to enjoy it, but I would probably have rather stayed in a nice Marriott.My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary last week and it was wonderful! We enjoyed every minute! When we arrived they were busy with another guest but we were greeted and offered wine and cheese while we waited to check in. Warm, comfortable atmosphere and super friendly staff. The coffee and desserts each night were awesome. Breakfast each morning was delicious and the courtyard was beautiful and calm which started our mornings off just right. The lady at the front desk helped us decide where to have our anniversary dinner and made us the reservations. She was really friendly and very helpful. The Inn feels like a home away from home, not a hotel. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like friends visiting rather than customers. All the employees were wonderful from the man who showed us around the Inn to the women who set up the breakfast and people at the front desk. Our room was very cozy as well. They gave us an amazing anniversary getaway and we couldn't have asked for more!","I was in Savannah for a weekend getaway to celebrate a friend's birthday. Everything about the Eliza Thompson House was wonderful!  From the moment we turned onto the tree lined, cobblestone street we were swept away by the charm of the place. The staff was friendly, attentive and eager to assist with directions and suggestions on how best to enjoy Savannah. The Chatham room, which is where we slept, was clean and tidy. I'm always concerned about hotel bathrooms but when I surveyed ours, I was relieved to see that it was in great condition. The B&amp;B is in a good location. In fact, I left the car parked the entire time because we were within a short walking distance of shops and other interesting sites.  When we didn't want to walk we simply hopped in a cab took a shuttle bus. Back at the house, the chats in the parlor over wine, sherry and hor d'ourves were a highlight of our evenings. Made even better when we connected with a lovely couple from Seattle. I'm so glad we decided not to stay in a regular hotel. The Eliza Thompson House made our visit to this charming southern town more authentic. I look forward to the next time!After a recent business trip to Atlanta, I decided to head over to Savannah for the weekend. Eliza Thompson House was recommended to me as a bed and breakfast in a picturesque location. It didn't fail to impress. It's located in Savannah's Historical District, filled with stately homes, beautiful trees, interesting shops, and walking distance from SCAD. Check-in was easy, and I went directly to my room to relax after the four-hour drive. My room was the Eliza, located outside in one of the garden courtyard rooms. At check-in, I was told there is a complimentary breakfast in the courtyard between 8:00-10:00 a.m., an evening reception between 5:30-7:00 p.m., a turndown service and dessert and coffee at 8:30-10:00 p.m. Hungry, I took a leisurely walk over to a gastropub for dinner. Afterward, I sunk into my comfortable bed and immediately fell asleep. Breakfast the next morning consisted of serve-yourself coffee, orange juice, tea; a breakfast cassarole (salsa and egg was served both days), sausage links, fresh biscuits, seasoned hashbrown patties, a selection of breads, grits, and fruit compote. I recommend you arrive early for breakfast for best selection as things definitely get sparse by 9:00 a.m.. Everything I tried was tasty. As it was mid-Fall, there was (heated) seating indoors and patio seating outdoors. The evening reception was served in the parlor and included both white and red wine, a cheese dip so tasty I was required by law to go back for seconds, cheese cubes, crispy crackers and bacon/cheese toasts. There wasn't much seating left inside, so I walked outside and sat by one of the fountains. The property itself is gorgeous, with black wrought iron decorating the various levels of the terrace and surrounded by mature trees draped in spanish moss. It's located in an old house, so you should be prepared to be woken up by the water pressure of other guests taking showers, and chatting along the terrace while they are heading out. It wasn't super-loud by any means and there's something nice about being woken up by happy voices in the morning. Parking is on the street and street cleaning ""alerts"" are handled by the staff well. They keep an eye on where you park so you don't have any problems and provide you with any assistance you may need during your stay. Though I would imagine if there is an event downtown, parking may be a challenge. Free Wi-Fi. Overall, I really enjoyed my two-night stay and hope you do, too!Staying at The Eliza Thompson House was my first B&amp;B experience. The place is very charming, the staff are all incredibly nice and helpful, but if you're looking for the usual hotel room feel, you're not going to find it here. The room we stayed in was quite small, and it's a bit difficult to go from a king bed at home to a full bed that you're not familiar with. None of this is the fault of the inn, and I knew fully well what I was getting in to. I was visiting Savannah for my wedding, and I wanted something romantic. I got that and more, but I'm afraid I am just too modern for another stay with Eliza. Props go to Kevin, the gentleman who helped us with our luggage and each night's turn down service. He was amazing!One other the to keep in mind is that the House does not have their own parking lot, so it is first come, first serve street parking. With that said, we didn't have any problems finding nearby parking on our Sunday-Tuesday visit.A great stay in a fine place in a great location.  The young woman at the front desk was special.  The place is quiet and comfortable.  We were in town to eat so all the food was not necessary.  I overheard people talking who ate the full breakfast (quite a layout - unlike many B&amp;Bs), grabbed a lunch somewhere, ate the 5 p.m. snacks with the free wine and later returned to enjoy the 8 p.m. desserts.  In other words, you can stay here in fine accommodations and not blow your budget at the restaurants.  Of course, that would mean missing out on so many fine Savannah restaurants.  Everything in the historic district is proximal to Eliza Thompson House.The Eliza Thompson house was the best bed and breakfast that I have stayed at. The bellman and the staff were more than accommodating.The rooms are very nice, we stayed in The Savannah Room.There is a wine and cheese hour in the evening. Followed by dessert later on. But the breakfast... Oh so good.The breakfast is served bright and early and hot! Fresh out of the kitchen. They have a great southern egg and bacon casserole , sausage, grits ,hash browns and more . It's set out on the patio looking over the beautiful gardens and they have nice heat lamps too. They feed you so much food that you can skip eating lunch and save some money. Savannah is a great walking town so we had lots of places where I could walk off all that heavy food.The Rooms at the Eliza Thompson house are BEAUTIFUL. And very private. I actually had a room below the bed and breakfast with a private entrance. It was nice because I didn't have to worry about waking other guest up going in and out.There is a local trolley that will also pick you up outside of the Eliza Thompson house for easier access to the downtown area.The street that Eliza is located on is one of the oldest streets and one of the few that is still all brick. It's beautiful ! There aren't enough words to describe all the great things about The Eliza Thompson House. If I go back to Savannah one day there is no other place that I would ever stay.Having dreamed of visiting Savannah for years (yes, I confess, starting with a reading of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil), I was looking for a place to stay that would really make the experience.  I chose well when I chose the Eliza Thompson House.  The house is lovely, located on the picturesque and historic Jones Street.  Just pulling up you know you are in the Savannah of your dreams.  We decided we wanted to stay in the main house and ended up getting booked into the Johnston Room.  This room, at least during the time of our stay, didn't seem quite as nice as some of the other main house rooms, and was long and narrow, but was still nice with plenty of room and with a very comfortable bed.  All the staff was very courteous and helpful.  The breakfast included hot breakfast items and while not necessarily the best breakfast I have ever had, was still better than any other included breakfast I can recall having recently.  The location is outstanding if you want to explore the historic district (as we did).  They are located about a couple of blocks from the Mercer-Williams House and it is only couple more blocks to Forsyth Park.  The Eliza Thompson House is a perfect base to explore all of the various gorgeous squares and historic buildings of the unfairly beautiful Savannah.  In the event you have a car, given the age of the neighborhood, there is only street/metered parking.  However, you will be able to purchase a parking pass at the front desk which will allow you to park at the metered parking near the B&amp;B.  When we were there, we managed to find parking very nearby without difficulty.   We would definitely recommend staying at the Eliza Thompson House.My girlfriend and I stopped at this place on a Sunday night on our way back home.  I have stayed at the Gastonian and this is a sister property, which was suppose to be nicer.  Upon check-in we were greeted with a warm welcome and a generous bellman that helped with luggage and offered vast info about the place and Savannah.  There was complimentary wine and cheese and then dessert an hour laterThe room we stayed was nice, bathroom a little small and outdated.  The next morning we woke up and was expecting a phenomenal breakfast and wow what a disappointment.  We came down at 9:30 and overheard the breakfast attendant complaining if it was 10am yet.  Walking around they offered some kind of egg/quiche/casserole thing then had some skimpy French toast.  They also had cereal, fruit, yogurt, and grits.  Chain hotels for lesser price offers more for breakfast then they did.  Overall the place was nice, but breakfast needs improvement.We love this bed and breakfast and have stayed here 5 times....every time we return to Savannah. Kevin, the bellman is fantastic and willing to help with anything you could need! The courtyard is just beautiful and the nightly wine, hors d'oeuvres, desserts and coffee are great and a nice way to meet people who have traveled to Savannah from all over. Breakfast in the courtyard is also very good...especially the egg casserole. We will be back for sure!This B&amp;B is truly a gem. Gorgeous setting and great rooms! Very clean and extremely friendly staff. They sure do try to fatten you up there! Big complimentary breakfast every morning with all the trimmings, free wine, cheese and hors d'oeuvres each night, and also free dessert each night too! All delicious. Only 2 small complaints. 1- the fact that they didn't put curtains over the blinds on the french doors to the bedroom. So if someone wanted to, they could stand outside and watch you sleep (creepy, but never really worried about it). This doesn't apply to the rooms in the original house though. 2- pillows that were WAY too soft. Unless you like those really mushy pillows that don't hold any shape, bring your own.  Knowing that, I will gladly stay there again and again (and bring my own pillow).Absolutely outstanding bed and breakfast! Beautiful rooms and courtyard! Excellent location, walking distance throughout Savannah's historic district, Forsythe Park, etc. Terrific service! Delicious hot, country breakfast every morning and cheese and wine every evening! Great price! We can't wait to go back!I am not even sure where to start with this place.  It is definitely charming at first glance...However, the rooms are something to be desired.  It seems to be that they are rarely cleaned.  Our bathroom floor was filthy.  The toilet was dirty.  The shower head had SO much build up on it...it was disgusting.  On top of that, the bath tub had black marks and some one else's hair in it. The blankets that were supplied looked like they had newspaper ink on them...We told the front desk about these issues the next morning and were assured that it would be taken care of.  However, upon returning to our room that afternoon, it seemed that nothing had been done.  The bed had been made, but with the same the blankets that were there before.  Our coffee cups were still sitting on the dresser with dried up coffee.  Sugar had been spilled on the night stand and it was not cleaned up.  The robes issued by the hotel were balled up on one of the chairs and not hung up.  The bathroom had not been touched.  I went down to complain and the front desk lady became really defensive.  The next day, it was the same thing...except THIS time the blankets had been replaced, but the OLD blankets were balled up on the chair with the robes...It was unbelievable!  It was really unacceptable.  I would never recommend this place to anyone...It was dirty. The people were rude and it was DIRTY...did I say that already?  Well, I can't say it enough!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/olde-harbour-inn-savannah,Olde Harbour Inn,4.0,$$$,30,"Wow! What a great stay for our anniversary trip! From the moment we walked into the lobby I was impressed. They let us check into our room early, there was a very nice man there that showed us right where to park, and helped us with our bags. When we walked into our room we were sooooooo excited! It was like a mini apartment with a kitchen, and a huge room lit up with so much light, and a great view of the river. At first we thought the bed was our least favorite part of the room, but we were pleasantly surprised by how well we slept! (we are not good sleepers at all) We loved the Wine and cheese at 5:30. We even met some of the other guests, which made it feel homey. The ice cream was a great touch also. This hotel had so many positives. I would definitely stay here again. I would however suggest to the hotel to maybe add some kitchen supplies (pots, pans, plates, silverware, etc. although there are so many great places to eat you might not need them) Other than that, a perfect stay!*edited to add the horrible experience I had after I left (of course).I accidentally left a very expensive shoe (I forgot just the one) there on 1/16 and called up to ask if what their policy was about forgotten things. They said they contact the person regarding the lost item when they found it. They did not do this with me. I had to ask them to look for it and they finally found it. The woman I spoke with took down my address and said she'd send it. A week later I still hadn't heard anything or received anything. I called back. They said the girl I talked to had quit and just left it. Of course. So I asked if they would mind sending it, PLEASE. I called back yesterday (2/10) and they said it had been sent. I asked for a tracking number because I still hadn't received it. The person on the phone, after a brief conversation about not keeping records of things sent out USPS (and paid for by me) put the phone down. A very, very, very rude man came on the phone. When I asked why I was speaking with him and who he was, he refused to give me his name and told me they don't keep records, they couldn't help me and hung up on me. I called back and he said 'OH, SORRY, we must have gotten disconnected.' By the tone of his voice it was very obvious it wasn't an accident. He again told me he couldn't help me, he didn't have records of them sending me my stuff, etc. I asked for the number to their home office and shockingly received it. Called them and within MINUTES (I kid you not) they had called me back with my tracking number. AMAZING.Forget this hotel. No matter how pretty it is, if your customer service is bad you'll never get my business again. No thank you.Stayed in this wonderful hotel in 2004, and couldn't wait to come back....we stayed in Suite 409, the S.S. Savannah.  Everything was as I remember, even though the grand ole place has been updated....staff makes your stay effortless, and the hotel is sparkling clean.I think that Hank the resident ghost moved my ""expensive"" shoe from my suitcase on the last night there....Thank goodness I saw from the corner of my eye, a white bag just slightly peeking out from under the bed....there is no way that shoe traveled that far even if it fell out....just finished reading another post about someone forgetting one shoe earlier in the month.I booked this hotel through kayak and was pleasantly surprised! The room is spacious and clean. The staff has been an absolute delight. When we first arrived to our room, the front desk called about 10 minutes in to make sure everything was good for us. At 5:30 they offer complimentary wine and cheese. Also before bed they do a ""turn down"" service and put Klondike bars in our freezer! The complimentary breakfast was good as well. Overall, I am very pleased and would definitely return. The location is awesome!This is an excellent place to stay whale in Savannah. This Inn is right on the river and you can watch the ships come in to the harbor from your room window or from the windows of the dining room in which a pretty good breakfast is served everyday. Nothing better than buttered grits in Georgia!The rooms are huge, and beautiful. hardwood flooring throughout. Exposed brick walls, large wooden beams and large windows facing the river. There is also a fully functional galley style kitchen if you want to cook...but you're in Savannah man! Why in the world would you want to cook when you are surrounded by awesome restaurants?!? And unlike other hotels they do not leave a little chocolate on your pillow when the bed is turned down. No! They leave ice cream for you in the fridge! WOOHOO!Speaking of the staff, they were all excellent, very friendly and helpful. One small thing I noticed (that I loved) was that whenever we had a question or even addressed the staff, they stopped doing what they were doing &amp; looked us in the eyes when they answered. Southern Hospitality folks!The rates were not that expensive and were well below what some other places were charging. I don't think you would be disappointed if you choose to stay here while in town.Best hotel in Savannah, when compared to their local competition (Gastonian, The Bohemian, The Mansion, The Cotton Sail).  This is based on their huge room size and based on the fact that they are located VERY close to the river walk.Love this hotel! A large space with a functional kitchen! Gives you the feel of having an apartment in Savannah right on the river walk! My wife and I keep coming back here...it is charming, convenient, and the staff are lovely and always accommodating! Room 202 is the best! it is even fun to write in the guest book they provide you with to write about your stay Savannah and your time spent at the Olde Harbor Inn. 1 Star off because it can be a bit noisy in the halls and from Joes Crab Shack but that is really hit or miss! we will definitely be staying here again!Great location. Within walking distance to East River street with shops, bars, and restaurants. Room is very spacious. Living room is separate from the bedroom and there's a kitchenette. Pet friendly is a plus, and they provide turn down service complete with a ice cream treat! Even a doggie bag with treats. Wine and cheese happy hour at 5:00. Supposedly haunted by ghost named Hank- so far only have some flickering lights but will follow up if we get anything good to report. Love it so far.What a charming gem of a hotel.The hotel overlooks River St central to most things. We were given a suite with kitchen, lounge, bedroom and bathroom with river view.Room 309. When we arrived you have to go down Lincoln Ramp and take the first right . I missed this and ended up driving along River St parking in the 2 hr parking and walking up the steps to check in. Dominic who is an excellent ambassador for the hotel came back to the car with me picked up the bags and directed me to the free parking at the end of River St. I read a few reviews knocking the parking but it was easy. The rooms very clean, the breakfast buffet was nice,they offer a cheese and wine horsdouvres and a daily Klondike bar each. To stay in a central place with great staff was priceless.Highly recommended. I held back 1 star as I didn't see the ghost.This was a beautiful inn that my boyfriend surprised me with for the Fourth of July. The inn itself is quite lovely and has a modern and historic look. We checked in and parking was simple as there were spots available near our room. The front desk was extremely helpful and informative and surprised us with a gift;) We were told breakfast started at 7am-9am. Then around 5pm-7pm snacks were provided such as wine, cheese, desserts, and little hors d' oeuvre that vary every day. That is sweet!!! When we opened the door to our room it was as if we entered into a private underground apartment. We absolutely loved the spacious rooms and opened up the freezer to find two Klondike ice cream bars! I then walked into our master room to find two robes laying on our bed with a note to enjoy our ice cream and the weather for the next day. I walked into the living room to find a bottle of wine, two glasses and a box of chocolates that my sweetie ordered ahead to surprise me with. I was impressed and ecstatic. The location of the inn was very convenient as it was just a walk a way to river street. Restaurants and souvenir shops were everywhere and a ferry to get to the convention Center if needed to. I will forever love this olde harbor inn. My boyfriend proposed to me on july 4 in the inn. I have to say there was no better way to end our stay in romantic savannah georgia, olde harbor inn with my fiance!!!I'll be back..... Get ready HANK!!I have no clue if this place is haunted or not. But. It did keep me up all night for two nights in a row from all the ghost stories I read in the room's guestbook. I am a wuss. The staff here is southern friendly. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk lady were wonderful and welcoming. I came with a big group, and they remembered what we did each day and suggested new spots to check out each morning after the continental breakfast. The best two parts... the ice cream sammies that magically appear in your freezer when you come home after a long night of drinking mint juleps and eating pralines. Yummers. And. Wine and cheese hour. Courtesy of the hotel. I great way to start the night of fun or the night of ghost hunting in the loft area of your room.Olde Harbour Inn delivered great first impressions for us.  The check in area is beautiful and a clean country modern type style.  We were also impressed with the size of the room. (Room 302).  high ceilings with a long hallway passing a bathroom and kitchen opening up to a huge bedroom and sitting areas.  (Our room was carpeted.)I'd originally wanted to stay at the Brice, but the rate went up the night before we booked.   I then chose the Hyatt and then did a free cancellation when I saw the Olde Harbour Inn.  (That will give you an idea of the types of hotels we were considering.)The location is very convenient to the river street bars and restaurants, and given that it was Oktoberfest weekend, we still found parking on the cobblestones very, very close to our room.  (Room entrances are in clusters accessible off the street, with 1 keyed door serving as an entry way to a small foyer to access 3 rooms.)Turn down service results in crunch ice cream bars in the freezer - a welcome touch in the evenings!  The bed was very comfortable with multiple sheet layers. The hot morning breakfast buffet is complimentary with the room and had plenty of options to choose from.  We were also pleased with the evening wine and snack reception, also included.  I also made use of the room's coffee maker which was clean.  Hubby would have preferred a larger TV, but I'm grateful that it gave me better odds of getting him out sightseeing and away from the games on TV. :)I'd made the mistake of searching to see if the hotel might be haunted (most of Savannah is, it seems), so my overactive imagination made me sleep lightly when I read reports of Hank.  I think I was sleeping  when I imagined my covers being pulled towards the window (opposite direction from my sleeping husband) because when I checked, nothing appeared to be shifted.  That doesn't seem to line up with the reports anyways.  Like I said, overactive imagination!  We were able to hear the street cleaners in the early morning hours as they made multiple passes cleaning the streets on Sunday morning and the floor above us did creak which wasn't helped by the guest above us having their dog with them to constantly move around.  It IS an older building, so those things are to be expected.Overall, it is a charming hotel.  You can tell the owners have worked hard to create a pleasant staying experience. :)Loved this hotel. The rooms were more like a suite. The decor was beautiful. Yhe bathroom was small, but adequate. The kitchenette would have been useful if we had been staying for more than a day. They provided complimentary bottled water, and Klondike bars at bed time. We could hear the horn of the boats on the river and some of the street noise, but for us it only added to the charm. They even provided a complimentary breakfast with fresh scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, various breads, coffee, juice, cereal, oatmeal...the works. We will definitely return.I really liked this little hotel/ B&amp;B.  Great location, especially for catching the ferry over to the convention center.  Great walkability to just about anything - restaurants, shopping, the river, etc.No mints on your pillow here - you get an ice cream bar in your freezer instead! (The rooms have kitchens.) The staff was very helpful and kind.  The room was clean and had everything we needed - TV, internet, lots of room and a cute concept of a ""Room Diary."" It's in one of the drawers and all the guests write in it, giving ideas of things to do, places to go and kind words about the hotel.  Really cute.Oh, and there's a free wine happy hour every night in the main building. Woo!!True Southern Hospitality!!!My husband and I stayed here a few weeks ago and had an incredible visit. The suites were extremely spacious, very well appointed and decorated, featured a full kitchenette, and overlooked the river. I truly felt at home and relaxed.  The location was great- right along East Bay Street, but off enough to the side to be quiet. It was a short walk to the restaurants and pretty city squares. Despite being on the water, it was surprisingly quiet- I only heard one barge coming through in the morning. The hospitality was fantastic. Not only was there a delicious hot breakfast, but there was a happy hour with wine, soft drinks, cheese, and assorted tasty snacks- they put a lot of effort into creating varied and pretty snack bites. The lounge was warm and inviting - the perfect locale to meet new friends. On top of that, the turn down service even featured ice cream!The service was outstanding as well. Rates were very competitive and parking rates were much lower than most places around. Thanks to Rachel who went out of her way to accommodate us on a very busy night, and to Kevin who truly went above and beyond to help us find some free parking!  I would definitely stay again.The staff here is super friendly! Our room was clean and the turn down service and ice cream was a nice touch. They do a wine and cheese reception with light hors d'oeuvres. The first night was a couple different kinds of macaroons and a tuna salad in a light pastry. The second night was a cucumber slice over a piece of cream cheese covered bread and chocolate chip cookies. The breakfast was much more than I expected. We had a scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, cereal, grits, oatmeal, bagels, toast, danishes, and yogurt. The staff were always very friendly. When we arrived it started raining while we were checking in - one of the staff grabbed us an umbrella as we didn't have one to get to our car and then helped us unload so we didn't have to be in the rain as long. They gave us a full tour on check in as well. The room was spacious and we couldn't hear anything from our neighbors. The bed was comfortable and plenty of everything was provided.This was our first trip to Savannah and we chose this B&amp;B because of its location, price, breakfast, and evening wine. The location was fantastic (based solely on that, I would have rated it 5 stars)!! The breakfast was ok, they had sausage and biscuits but no eggs ... a bit strange. But the sausage was definitely tasty and the biscuits were warm and flaky. I guess my only complaint regarding the breakfast was that I wish they'd had more options. They had cold cereal (but I can't consume dairy) and yogurt (again, dairy) in addition to the biscuits and sausage. The evening wine reception was ok. We have stayed at other hotels that had this and in comparison to the others we have experienced, this one was so-so. They do only have wine (one red and one white, so you may not enjoy it if you are picky about your wines), some cheese, and some very tasty sandwiches and cookies. It is definitely nice to have this available. We were hoping to talk to more of the guests at the reception to get insights into what we should do. But, in the end, it was nice and appreciated!Where the Olde Harbour Inn truly shines (besides location), is it's staff! They are FANTASTIC. Extraordinarily helpful and accommodating, they did everything they could to make us comfortable and ensure that we had all the information we needed to be efficient tourists and have a good time. Hands down, possibly the best staff I have ever met in hospitality!Where the Olde Harbour Inn lost stars with me, was in the level of cleanliness of the bathroom. The tub had hair stuck in the drain (visible), there was (permanently?) stuck dirt on the hair dryer that is attached to the wall, and it just felt overall a bit grimy. I'm sure if we had mentioned this to the staff, someone would have probably come down to take care of it. However, everything else was so spectacular, and they were so nice, friendly, and accommodating, that complaining about something so insignificant at the time did not seem necessary. Had my travel partner said something to me, I probably would have, but who knows ... maybe I'm just overly picky about certain things? I really don't have any complaints about the Inn. It was wonderful, and I would certainly stay here again. The one thing I do want to mention, is that the bed ... can creak a bit. This was our first time in a B&amp;B, so maybe this is to be expected because they are actual bed frames and aren't attached to the floor, but knowing ahead of time would have been appreciated. So there it is. Oh, and if you can, request a room that is not on the ground floor. There is nothing wrong with the ground floor (ours was on that level), but staying on a higher floor and having a view is always nicer!We arrived around 4:00 on a Sunday.  Greeted by two very nice staff members.   Positives: Very large room.  Unique antique feel.  Free wine/cheese/cookie cocktail hour where we chatted with other guests.  Very informative staff.  Close to all the River Street shops and bars.  Convenient parking.  Clean room (at least as clean as it could be while still maintaining the historic feel). Pretty decent breakfast.  Nice robes. Negatives: Shower water was slow to drain.  Low shower.  Ugly carpet.  Outdated decor. View from our downstairs room wasn't great due to construction going on outside our room.  Parking was $12 for 48 hours.  Room smelled like cleaning products.I'm a little vexed by how well they are reviewed elsewhere, but after seeing the fellow clientele I realized if you are thirty you aren't even halfway to the average age, and frankly a savvy selection of review baiting bribes (Gratis wine and ice cream, which is a smart and excellent touch) I feel like expectations might be different for the younger more active yelp set.I will get straight to the important bit, the elephant in the room we aren't supposed to talk about... Do you want to have sex on your vacation? You can hear your neighbors Snoring, Whispering, Breathing, and Talking in hushed tones, etc. That's okay, no crazy acrobatics tonight, just gentle missionary and bite your lip... Bam Bam Bam, The headboard slams hard against the brick walls unsecured, the bed frame (It's a petite hardwood conventional bed frame like at grandma's house) wobbles comically no matter how gentle the antique bed is operated, the broken wooden slats slam against each other on each rebound so both wall and box spring are getting in on the racket. All in all a gentle session sounded like a comical hollywood sound-effects level headboard pounding of sleazy motel, all this coupled with paper-thin doors where your neighbors felt separated by a curtain (The clear visible gaps in the door frame being a likely culprit).The historic parts are great and beautiful and spacious, love the hardwoods and brick walls with exposed beams, but the hotel elements look built in the 80s or 90s and are getting worn. The bathroom was mildewing and most spigots and drains were broken and clogged. The furniture is faded and some elements sticky, for $200+ I feel like these expectations are not out of bounds.Recommended for exhibitionists with a ""Don't wake Grandma"" fetish and Grandmother's who don't mind being woken, for me, not the romantic getaway I was hoping for.For the location, price, service and comfortable rooms, ya can't get anything better in Savannah, period.  I've been visiting Savannah for 20 years now and decided to stay at the O.H.I. for the first time a few weeks ago for 3 days.  I'm just sorry I never stayed here before.  I can't explain how many nights and money I have wasted on other places in the past.  Thanks to all the hard working folks at the O.H.I. for making my stay so wonderful!  No ghosts bothered me at all.  :)O.H.I. secret:  Look for the ""Pam MacDonald"" sign-in book floating around the rooms.","Nice and spacious rooms in a great location!  Great updates in the lobby area and the manager was very sweet and helpful.Oh my!  This place was near perfect!  For starters, it's located next to beautiful Emmett Park.  We enjoyed being able to appreciate the park from through our window or by simply walking out of our door.  The hotel was cozy and elegant.  It had a nice vintage feel to it.  The hotel staff are RIDICULOUSLY hospitable.  Erika, at the front desk, was especially accommodating.  Erika had the answers to all of our questions.  I ask for a water fountain, she introduces me to an endless supply of cold water bottles.  That was just the start of it.This place offered free wine, cheese, crackers, and finger sandwiches.  Turn down service with Klondike bars.  Seriously?  Could it get any better?  The breakfast was pretty good, too.  I recommend cutting the biscuit in half and sticking a sausage patty in the middle.  Besides having to shower on my knees, having my feet and ankles hang off the bed, and having to duck while walking around the loft, this place was perfect.  I guess, to appreciate this lovely and historic inn, you can't expect it to be built for people taller than 6ft.  ;) I really have no complaints.  If you think the location and the architecture are appealing, you should come check out the hospitality of the staff!  Shazaam!We won a gift certificate for a complimentary night here and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly at check-in. Our room wasn't ready, but they stored our luggage and reserved a parking spot for us (parking is apparently free on the weekends). We left the car at the hotel and we went about our day. While on the far end of River Street, it's in a great location within walking distance to anything and everything. We picked up the keys around 5:00. They had already placed our luggage in the closet of the room. The room - my lord the room was huge. We had a room with one queen bed. You enter the room and there is a long hallway, bedroom and bathroom to the immediate right, followed by a kitchenette with full size fridge, and then a spacious living room. I was incredibly surprised at the size of the room. It was tastefully decorated in ""period appropriate"" decor - very ""old Savannah"" and charming. I wouldn't say ""luxurious"" - but charming for sure. We didn't partake in breakfast or the evening reception and in fact, didn't even take advantage of the Klondike bars they left in the room - but all are nice touches. I would love to have the opportunity to stay here again. It was a fantastic experience all around. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommended it to a friend.The staff was wonderful and helpful but the room itself had a lot of problems. The electricity was weird. TV that shut off randomly and the hot water was inconsistent. One day the maid did not show at all and another day the cleaning was really bad. The price was right but  Not sure if I would return.LOVED this hotel. We came during the week and stayed in the king suite. Clean, charming, exactly what I imagined my B and B experience in Savannah to be. GREAT location on River St in the historic district, within walking distance to tons! Staff is very friendly, helpful, honest and informative. The bellman greeted us instantly and brought our bags to our room while we checked in. The complimentary hors devours with wine and cheese, and the breakfast were great. Great TVs, cable, plenty of towels supplied in bathroom, great turndown service with next day weather reports and Klondike bars. This place was awesome, especially for the price and location. We LOVED it. First timers especially, people should Definitely stay here!WoW! The staff was really great. Erika at the front desk made things happen. And Theron was great as well. Couldn't have been more pleased with the service. I was also impressed with the size of the suites. Ours had a full bedroom, living room and kitchenette which was awesome. Great location -- right on river street and within walking distance to almost everything.We returned from a stay at this property today, and I felt compelled to share my disappointing experience (particularly since the innkeeper was unavailable for the duration of my stay and chose not to contact me throughout even though I complained to front desk staff on 2 occasions). The location was great except for tons of stair and no elevators, but they advertised this on their website so I certainly can't fault them. Unfortunately, they also advertised a DVD player in the upstairs loft BR and these were critical factors (separate loft and DVD player) in my selection of the property for my visit with 2 kids under 5. When I called to notify the front desk that we had no DVD player, first I got a busy signal for about 15 minutes, then had to call from my cell phone. The front desk person at that time (very friendly and professional btw) apologized and told me that they wouldn't be able to provide one until the following day since the property was booked. The very next day they did indeed provide one. The next (last) day our room was never serviced by housekeeping. When I called around 4 pm to ask them to service it, Sky (different front desk person) indicated that housekeeping was gone for the day. I asked to receive some sort of credit due to the customer service issues that I'd experienced and she indicated that since the innkeeper (Cristin) was gone, she wouldn't be able to authorize that. I came down to the front desk to ask her to reach her to address it, she (Sky) called while I sat there (told her about the housekeeping issue, mentioning a DVD issue but never explaining it since she says it was addressed so it was a non issue to her). After they spoke for a few minutes, she jotted down notes on a post it and asked me if I wanted the bellman to make up my beds. I told her that I didn't; I'd rather just get fresh towels and toiletries and get some sort of acknowledgment from mgt of the poor customer service. She didn't seem to understand the latter and definitely treated me as if I was a huge inconvenience to her. She left to get the towels (or so I thought) AND NEVER RETURNED. When the bellman (very nice) asked me if I needed help, I explained that she was helping me. Other guests came in to check in and they were waiting behind me. After I'd sat there for quite awhile, I asked the bellman if she was coming back. He said he'd check. He asked me if my issue had been resolved, and I told him I wasn't sure bc she spoke with the innkeeper and instead of telling me the resolution, just got up and left. He left to find her and returned to tell me that the innkeeper authorized her to take $30 off my total bill. I asked why she didn't tell me that and he said that she'd been feeling ill earlier that day but wasn't sure why she'd left. Ironically, when I came by the front desk later that evening to ask for a restaurant phone number, she gave it to me never acknowledging her earlier disappearance and utter refusal to resolve my issue. The mistakes that happened during my visit were not truly severe in my opinion, but Sky's attitude and the innkeeper's clear indifference were terribly disappointing. These should not have been significant issues and could have been easily resolved with just a speck of customer service and social skills in my opinion. I must admit that upon checkout Ericka granted me a half night's credit which was gracious but more importantly she seemed to acknowledge that mistakes had been made and offered sincere apology along with a commitment to improve -- too bad I couldn't have gotten just a bit of that sooner.Unbelievable!!!! Loved this place!! The service was out of this world (thanks to Kevin).A little pricey but it's worth it to get a riverfront room the size of a small apartment (seriously, it had a full size kitchen in it).  Evening wine and appetizers were good, but I had to checkout before I could try the free breakfast.  Take pictures in your room, I got some unexplained light orbs in mine....creepyThis is the perfect B&amp;B for a nice weekend getaway. The prices start at about $250 a night but they are reasonable considering that you get a suite and a tasty southern style breakfast. It is situated right on River Street near the water. You can get all 48 hour parking for $8 and I recommend trying One eyed Lizzy's restaurant nearby for a casual tex-mex style lunch. By the way, apparently there is a resident ghost on the premises but we didn't encounter him during our stay.",,,,"['wow', 'great', 'anniversary', 'trip', 'moment', 'walked', 'lobby', 'impressed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-on-eisenhower-savannah-2,Best Western On Eisenhower,3.0,$$,25,"We picked this hotel on a whim as we were looking for a decent place to stay without breaking the break while visiting in Savannah. All the hotels in the historic district were out of our budget, but we found this hotel online, booked it and drove over to check in right away. The front desk staff were prompt and friendly. I asked for a first floor room, away from the road, to accommodate our baby traveling with us and they were happy to oblige. We would have preferred 1 king bed rather than 2 doubles, but we were told that was all they had available at the time.There was plenty of parking available right in front of the room which was very convenient for unloading all bags. The room was clean, bed was comfy, seemed like they had recently renovated as well. The only thing that could stand improvement was the shower. The water pressure was so wimpy and the temperature was not very warm. Wah! Overall though, we were satisfied as it was quiet, comfy and had all the basics needed including TV, fridge, microwave, etc.We tried to go for the continental breakfast in the morning, but we didn't show up til 9:30 and it was over at 9 (I thought it went until 10). It looked like your basic hotel breakfast of eggs, pastries, oatmeal, coffee, etc. Checkout was a breeze and we were on our way to explore the city again without any problems. Would recommend staying here for travelers on a budget.We got a room that had been infested by bedbugs.  We noticed a couple bites after the second night, but didn't think it was bedbugs.  After the third night, I was covered in bites.  We checked the bed and found multiple bedbugs!  We took pictures and called the health department.  I brought it to the attention of the front desk staff, who was not at all concerned or helpful.  She was completely unapologetic and actually quite rude about it.  I called the manager later, and he was just as unconcerned.  They did give us 1 free night, though I felt we should have been comped for all 3 nights seeing as we slept 3 nights in a bedbug infested room.  And that does not even factor in the over $500 we spent because of the infestation, including getting new suitcases, laundering and dry cleaning all our clothes, visiting urgent care (I had a bad reaction to the bites) and getting anti-allergy medications.    Will never stay here again and recommend everyone else avoid it.One of the cleanest and best maintained BW we've seen.  Although when I called to confirm the clerk I reached was curt and impatient, the desk staff were all helpful and friendly during our stay. Compact economy rooms but comfortable with effective maid service and the hot water was fast and plentiful. It's not a beautiful area and it's a 15-20 minute drive to the historic district but the price was right. It's worth staying at --- saving your money for the pricey restaurants and tours. There's a good cheap diner across the street-- better than the motel's bare bones breakfast. There's a great restaurant not too far -- the Sweet Potato Kitchen-- inexpensive and superb. One of the biggest features of Savannah is the HUGE amount of pawn shops everywhere. It's a sign, I guess, of persistent poverty.When I go to a hotel I have pretty basic expectations. Reasonable price, no roaches, and no hookers. At least no visible crimes occurring. This BW was a very reasonable price. They also offered a military discount.The beds were very comfortable. They actually had non-smoking. It was very quiet, checkout and check in was very simple. A lot of people complained about airplane noise. Seriously? You're in a city. I live by an airport and Langley Air Force base. Imagine the noise I incur daily. This place was a lot nicer looking than the La Quinta Inn down the street. I would stay again.Good, clean, quiet and friendly staff. The breakfast is free and good. Lots of choices and the eggs and sausage was above average. I would stay here again. Nice pool too.I had a different experience here than what is described in some of the other reviews.I stayed here two nights and had no complaints.  The room and facility was clean and well maintained.  There was no evidence of any bugs or any kind of infestation as is mentioned in some other reviews.  The room was quiet and comfortable and I had no problems sleeping.  I did not once hear any airplanes from the nearby air force base.  The free wifi, by the way, was excellent with a very strong signal in my room.This is a motel style property where the parking is right next to the rooms and the rooms open up directly to the outside.  There are two floors.  If you are concerned about staying in a hotel with rooms that open directly to the outside, this isn't the place for you.  However, I did not see that the area was sketchy or gave me any concern.The prices here are much lower than what you would pay in downtown Savannah, and yet the motel is an easy six mile or so drive into the city down Abercorn St.I actually liked the area it was in because there was ample shopping opportunities nearby.  There were several large shopping centers with Publix, Kroger, and Fresh Market nearby.  The rooms in the hotel come with a refrigerator and microwave, so if you're on a budget you can get food in these markets to supplement your dining out.  The rooms also have coffee makers in them, so no need to run off early in the morning to a Starbucks or other coffee place.  There are also numerous dining choices in the immediate vicinity if you want to eat out without going into the city.  The dining choices in the area are more in the line of the chain restaurant.There are also some other similar type hotels in the area.  I would really recommend this motel or this area if you are trying to save money on hotels.  It's a little bit out of the city, but not so much that you feel you're spending too much time driving during your holiday.Horrible service. The front desk staff hung up on my grandparents when they called for directions and said ""What, haven't you ever stayed in a hotel?"" when she couldn't find their online booking. When my father and mother called to speak to management the same girl hung up on THEM. She proceeded to make my 70-something grandparents leave the hotel because they had their reservation ""didn't exist"" and ""wasn't paid for,"" even after my father faxed her a copy of the confirmation AND even sent the credit card a second time. Management supposedly won't be in untiltomorrow, and now my elderly grandparents, who have been driving for 12+ hours today have no place to stay. Absolutely mortifying.Air condition cleaned NEVER did not work hot water just like warm.. Horrible bleach smell to everything.  Sheets maybe 100 thread count...Dated but in great shape, beds and room comfy. The breakfast was good for hotel fare with a delightful southern belle operating the ding area.Easy to find location and for driving around.Shuttle to all the tours was great, saved a lot of leg work on cobbled streets.As retired Navy man I enjoyed the Army choppers roaring back to base next door, Fort Stewart, home of the 3rd Army. I love seeing my tax dollars at work.Hoo yah! ( that's Navy for Hooah!)we were very put off when we arrived to check in, because the hotel clerk said she did not see our request for an ADA or first floor room.  i checked my reservation request and it was clearly there. this was the very first time something like this happened at a best western, or anywhere, for that matter.other than that, a nice property. breakfast selection was very good. the towels need replacing...everything else was very good.they said they would email me a receipt...we checked out april 22, we're still waiting.Things worked out for us !! Thanks for the move hotel staff that made the arrangements work!!!Comfortable beds, clean rooms. The best bet for an incredible price in Savannah. I always lodge there when I come and visit Savannah from Atlanta. Easy access to downtown, Tybee, Whole Foods... It is almost my second home. I buy blueberries and almond milk that I store in my room fridge so I can enhance the breakfast and make it more wholesome!Great hotel! Very clean, comfy beds, VERY well maintained. A good breakfast and very friendly and helpful front desk. And at a great price too!! I will be staying here again.For 70 bucks a night, this hotel is as good as its gonna get if you are on a tight budget, but yet do not want to compromise safety. It is 15 minutes away from downtown Savannah/ River Street and 30 minutes away from Tybee Island/ Fort Pulaski/ Beaches. It is around the business district so expect some traffic when you come out during rush hour time. Late in the evening, there are 3 24-hour food joint you can go to: Waffle House, The Diner (across the street) and ...  - Denny's - i think - ... Don't rely much on the free breakfast as the only protein in there is boiled eggs. The rest is bagels, croissant, plain grits from a packet, yogurt, cereal, bananas- coffee and juice... nothing too exciting really ...The room itself was quite decent. This is actually one of the rare occasions that a ""non-smoking"" room actually didnt even have a hint of stale cigarette. The room came with a fridge, microwave, and a blow dryer which are so essential for budget travelers like myself. The bathroom and the room in its entirety is clean. We didnt even get to use their TV, but it was your good ole flat screen- they did offer HBO. Check out was a breeze as all we needed to do was dial 0 from the room phone and tell them we are on our way out. Parking was easy, and they do have an outdoor pool - but then again, I am never into that stuff. All in all, a really good deal. I recommend :)I stayed here for one night and my this place wasn't so bad. I only paid $58 because I got an online deal from Expedia. It was clean and you get a free breakfast. The breakfast wasn't much though.. Like there weren't any sausages or scrambled eggs or anything. Just cereal, waffles... Plain stuff. The room had a microwave, large TV, &amp;mini fridge though. Not bad for $58...I also forgot to mention, this place is nearby EVERYTHING it seems like. Oglethorpe Mall, lots of stores, and restaurants too.If you have ever dreamed of sleeping on a runway then this is the closet you can get and still stay safe as the runway to an airport is located 100 yards and the planes fly over at all times. The lobby will welcome you to Savannah with a toxic smell that is unlike any other. The room is nice, the black mold in the bathroom is not. Every morning around 9am a man would walk by with a leaf blower and make sure the motel was clean though no observable trees with leaves are near the property. The motel architecture is the nice, all centered around a pool that's very charming, as is a nice shell gas station pawn shop and title shop all located within stones throw. A local at a dining establishment told us this hotel was the #2 hotel for prostitution in Savannah behind the Econolodge which is located right across the street. To the Best Westerns credit I never saw one so seemed pretty safe. The maid service was very nice and helpful. Overall not a nice hotel just but seems to be on the upturn.If you want easy access to a waffle house and a pawn shop, this place is for you, but they do have free WiFiWonderful clean room and bathroom. The grounds are immaculate. Very friendly staff. Loved the people at the front desk. Helpful and very accommodating. The breakfast was excellent. Everything from fresh fruit ,waffles ,eggs ,sausage , yogurt ,bagels, cereal, bagels and cream cheese, sausage gravy and biscuits. Will stay again.rooms have a fridge and a microwave... but, they also have HORRIBLE Pillows, non-functioning Internet, and the person at the front desk was an unhelpful ass.Yes, they're cheaper than most, but that's for a reason, I would suggest you look elsewhere.Best Best Western I have stayed in, in decades.  It's an older facility, but very very well maintained and updated.  Huge staff works hard, and they run a tight ship.  Pool is old school, in a good way, with a 8 1/2 ft. deep end.  Saltwater, no chlorine.  Grounds are groomed, with proud gardeners.  We normally stay at pricier hotels, but this is one cool time capsule.  We got a room on Priceline for under 60... Girl at desk was very friendly, and helpful.  All the freebies, and fridge is a good size.  The b'fast is the standard for these places... Great cable.","I stayed here for 4 days recently for a family event, and I have to say if your looking for a cheap place to stay and don't care about bugs, this place is for you. I found many roaches in my room, crawling in the bathroom, walls, and even in the middle of the night went to check my phone on my nightstand and yep, roaches!!!  My mother who was staying in another room, different building on the property also experienced roaches in her room. She contacted the management and asked if the rooms could be sprayed and they told her not a problem.. (this was the 2nd day of my stay). I didn't see anyone come by to spray the rooms, and didn't find any dead roaches, only live ones, so either they lied and never sprayed the room, or they weren't using the right stuff. Also, this hotel is located right under a military airstrip and if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is not the place. My 1st  two nights staying here, military aircraft was flying over (probably just a few hundred feet above the roof) and they were ear piercing loud jets, helecopters and propeller planes. This continued some nights untill around 10pm and was an all day event for my 1st 2 days of stay. The rest of the nights the runway was less active and it was much quieter. Another thing, I don't know what kind of poor excuse for a comforter this place has, but basically the comforter is in a cover, and not attached properly. You will find in the middle of the night, the actual comforter will slide off the bed and you will only be covered by the comforter cover, and when you go to pull up the rest of the comforter that is lumped in the cover, its like a half filled sandbag that you are trying to warm up under... Not good! One plus was the free breakfast which actually had a decent amount of food. Eggs, waffle maker, a few different juices, toast/bagles were offered for free every morning, and even though they tasted horrible, at least there was a free breakfast.A few positives were things included with the room... The room had a good sized flat screen tv, a mini fridge, non smoking rooms which was nice, but pretty much standard now for most hotels so not a reason to give thumbs up. Overall If I was driving through and needed a place to crash, and didn't care about bugs, then this place would be idea for a quick nightly stay, but I've been to many other hotels, even other best westerns, and experienced much cleaner environments.Also a mentionable.... I did wake up with bites all over my legs and a few days later these bites were still visible. I wore a pair of shorts a few days later that I had slept in at the hotel, and felt constant crawling/biting sensation on my legs. Not sure if this was from the hotel, but with the lack of cleanlyness, I could almost bet that the place has bed bugs or no-see-ums. I also was not the only one in my family that had bites on them, and they stayed in different rooms.The prices are amazing for what you get....except for the fact that my room came with a broken microwave..and the floor was flooded when I took a shower...and the toilet stopped working towards the end of my stay LUCKILY.  I want to say that it has been renovated and it looks nice, except for the functionality of everything.  Possibly, it could have been a fluke.I wasn't impressed... Yes, they are cheap and have a refrigerator, microwave, and Internet... However, it wasn't worth it.  The  service at the front desk was unpleasant. They did not deliver items to the room, so we had to go outside and walk all the way to the reception area every time we needed something. The coffee was horrible, so we had to buy coffee every morning. In the weekdays breakfast ends at 9, so we didn't even eat the complimentary breakfast. I would recommended spending a bit more and going somewhere else!Roaches in the bathroom, scum all over the shower, stained chair and ottoman. No complimentary extra towels if you need them--they make you write your name down at the front desk to get towels! I've NEVER been to a hotel that makes you do that! Not to mention my boyfriend is covered in bites and we don't know where they came from. Not doing it again...EVER. The breakfast is sad too. Cold pastries, waffle maker, and cheap coffee.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Doubletree by Hilton Savannah Historic District,4.0,$$$,53,"Was really impressed with this place!  It is in the heart of the action in Savannah--close to everything!  Very clean and well decorated.  The valet was very friendly and fast, especially for as busy as they were.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The food at the breakfast buffet was nice.  Pros:Close to EVERYTHING!  Very well decorated.Incredibly friendly staff.Nice touch with the cookie at check-in.Cons:You have to pay $25 per day to park your car.The food was rather expensive--the breakfast buffet is $17 and although good, not worth that much money.The hotel is conveniently located in the historic downtown area within walking distance of the market and shops. The valet was great and so was the front desk.  They offered us a trolly to put out luggage in and then take it up ourselves, which is the first time I've had to do in a hotel. Our room was next to the conference rooms and we could hear their talks and applause and even the chairs being moved afterwards.The noises from outside were very loud in the room to the point that we could hear a could arguing outside and I can even tell you why they broke up. I loved the location, unfortunately I was not able to sleep well during our stay :( thus the 3 star review.Some of you that follow me here on Yelp may know that my home away from home in Savannah used to be the Hilton Desoto.  Well, that is no longer the case.  From the moment I was met by the valet, to the warm chocolate chip cookie at the front desk, to the magnificent view out my room's window, I was realized I had found my new Savannah home.  As a Hilton Honors member, I was treated like family throughout my stay.The room was amazing, comfortable, and relaxing after a long work day.  The bathroom was a bit small for the price point, but it was very clean (which is extremely important for me) and upgraded with nice granite counter tops, tiled shower and huge backlit mirror.  But enough about the boring stuff, lets get to the niddy-griddy: The people!  As I mentioned before, everyone from the valet to the front desk personnel to the bartender and finally Shelby, the Food and Beverage Manager, were all warm and inviting people.  They laughed at my bad jokes, gave recommendations for drinks on and off the menu; and did I mention the warmed chocolate chip cookie?  If you were unfamiliar with Doubletrees you may not have realized there is a restaurant within the hotel.  That would be a shame.  Though it is somewhat hidden and tucked away, it does exist and I highly recommend it.  The food was awesome, filling and fairly priced.  As for the drinks, I love a good Old Fashion.  It is surprisingly difficult to find a bartender that can make them good... consistently.  Well, Julie (I believe her name is) can make a mean Old Fashion!Moving back to the room now for some extras just to make the stay more comfortable.  On the desk I found ear plugs (individually wrapped of course), a white noise maker and the lamps had USB plugs to charge your devices.  They literally thought of everything to make you feel like you are home.I only have one negative comment:  The air conditioner.  I like the room to be a bit cool when I sleep.  Well every time the A/C would kick on it sounded like a diesel engine cranking up.  If it weren't for that, I would have given all 5 stars.GOOD:- Check in cookie. Obviously needs to be listed first.- Friendly valet.- Charming, hilarious bartender. He was just great. And dealt with my beer snobbery well.- Front desk agents. Very nice and accommodating! Chatted with one about what it's like to work in hotel guest services. Nice nostalgic moment!- Shampoo.- Earplugs. You will need them.- Location. Close to River Street's shops/restaurants/bars.EHH:- Noise. Good god, noise. After the first night, we changed rooms. And still, there was noise.- Slow internet that needed to be refreshed each day. But hey, it was free.- I got hurt (face-planted on River Street), rushed back to the room to clean myself up, and the temp was reset to 60 degrees in there. Not cool, housekeeping!Solid hotel. I'd stay there again if I ever go back to Savannah.And I need to go back to Savannah.We had a fabulous experience this weekend!  Dre at the valet stand was amazing, and the ladies at the front desk were super friendly and helpful.  Couldn't be happier with our experience!  Best customer service we have seen in a while.  Everything was very close to the hotel and we were able to walk to River Street and the Civic Center.  Great location and even better people.If you are looking for a hotel with character, and not a typical Hilton chain, then this is the place. Lovely hotel redone in the heart of Savannah with friendly staff to boot. To seal the deal they have nightly complimentary drinks to tempt you, and we were lucky to experience a perfect drink that is a speciality of theirs.  Although if you are looking for a quiet spot,  this may not be the spot, but who would get a hotel in the heart of the city if you need that.....there are always ear plugs if needed!!!!!Amazing hotel!  Everything from check in to check out was wonderful. Friendly staff. The valets always called us cabs when needed. The minute you walk into the doors it smells wonderful. The room was very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. Thanks for a wonderful stay!  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Savannah.Staff was welcoming. DO NOT GET ROOM 224! Even after a few drinks the trucks and motorcycles will keep you up all night. They have a sound machine but that just adds to the mess. Location is perfect and close to everything riverfront and the market place. But if you want a restful night of sleep get an inside room. Valet folks were extremely helpful!The buffet for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year evening are awesome.  The food, beverages, and the yummy desert coupled with the fabulous  service helped me make great memories with my family and friends.This hotel is located in the beginning of Bay street and is fairly convenient to most places. The rooms are a very nice size with new bathrooms,  a nice work area/desk and a comfortable bed. The only drawback for some people is that it has a full shower instead of a tub, works for me but probably not for everybody.This hotel is in a great location and close to City Market as well as River St. Very beautifully decorated and very clean. All the staff were kind and courteous. The only complaint I have is the overwhelming air freshener in the lobby. Because of my sensitivity to perfumes I was unable to sit in the lobby or bar to enjoy more of the hotel.Great hotel in all, and in a great place in the middle of everything in Savannah. The interior is really elegant and looks amazing. They dont really tell you the extra fee's and charges at check in which would have been nice.The beds are good and the room is large.It's not the best doubletree but it's not the worst. Parking is valet and expensive, breakfast is not really anything special and the ""gym"" is smaller than the hotel room. We only stayed as a pit stop, so the location is great (near the highway). There's fresh coffee and tea station in the lobby which is nice . Service was good.The hotel and accommodations are all excellent. We had a wonderful time staying here but before you make make a reservation be aware of many hidden fees. Vallet parking = $25 a nightWifi - $5 a day. (There is a basic free WiFi that comes with the room but the Internet speeds compare to that which were standard in the mid 90's)Security Deposit - $50 per night. This will be returned after your stay if nothing was damaged within the room but it is billed to you on check in. They do serve breakfast but it does not come with the room. Other than the hidden fees this hotel has been excellent. The rooms are well cept and modern. The service is very quick and everyone is friendly.Very nice stay! For $117/night the room was extremely spacious with 2 queen size (super comfy!) beds. I received great customer service. Best part: walking distance to River Street! The only con is the valet parking that you HAVE to do if you want to park at the hotel. The parking was $25.This hotel is amazing! They booked a very clean and spacious room while we were driving into town. We booked a whirlpool tub, which is a MUST after a long day! The restaurant was the only negative. Room service stops at 9 and took FOREVER. Then, the shrimp scampi linguine came without any noodles! And also without bread, which was on the menu. The pork chop dinner was delicious. Aside from the restaurant, we would give the hotel staff, room appointment and cleanliness 5 stars. The concierge was also knowledgeable and friendly! Take the trolley tour that hotel recommends! We would definitely stay here again &amp; hope the kitchen staff is better equipped for us next time.This place is incredible.  Awesome views of the historic district and everything is in perfect walking distance.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and well kept.  The entire staff is super friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Two people who deserve extra kudos are Constance and Penny at the front desk.  First impressions are important and the two of them went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the beginning of our trip was fantastic.  Thank you so much Constance and Penny for your great customer service! Because of your service I look forward to returning here again.The hotel is lovely. The front desk staff were courteous, polite, and super helpful. The valet parking personnel were totally sweet and awesome! I stayed for only one night at the end of several day trip to the area and, for the most part, the stay was great. I had many choices when deciding where to stay in Savannah and chose The Doubletree because I have stayed at Doubletree hotels in other cities and because I joined their rewards program. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and was informed of the new policy (which took effect this month) that persons booking through a third party do not get rewards points! I didn't even get free wifi! That really sucked. It left me with a sour feeling about staying there. The location is nice with a great view of the bridge, but I could have stayed at a comparable hotel on the waterfront! There are two other hotels on the other two corners of the street, either of which had the same views and may or may not have given me no extras. No rewards points and no wifi because I booked through a third party was like a cloud which hung over the stay. Now that I know this, I will keep it in mind when booking in the future. I stayed at a Doubletree in TX, a few months ago, which was also booked through a third party (package deals are easier for this consumer) and I received my rewards points. I'm not sure if most people prefer to book flights, hotels, and rentals separately, but removing the rewards when it's done seems like a bad idea.How do I know DoubleTree made a deep impression on me? Because every time I start fantasizing about  vacation my first thought is, ""I wonder if they have a  DoubleTree there?""It's rare on vacation to have SPECIAL MOMENTS occur *IN* the hotel as well as *OUT.* The hotel wasn't just the designated, ""This is where we sleep and get dressed"" spot, we actually CREATED memories that actually MADE the vacation even better!We only paid $82 a NIGHT for a DoubleTree Hilton Hotel and we couldn't believe what a STEAL that price was! It was even cheaper than the Holiday Inn Express! It was our mantra for the entire vacation. ""Can you believe this is $82 a night?"" PROS: - The beds felt like marshmallows wrapped in sheets! They were outrageously soft! I was tempted to investigate what kind of mattress they used to buy myself at home!-  We must have been in Get Smart's ""Cone of Silence"" because I didn't hear a peep from the street below, the interior hallway, the neighboring guests, or even the staff!-  One of the highlights of vacation that didn't cost us a dime was using the lemon scented shampoo to use as makeshift bubble bath. We turned off the lights and then just relaxed in each others soapy arms, letting the warm water melt away all the worries and cares. Next time I'll have to splurge on a whirlpool bath AND bring candles from home. That would be even BETTER! - The decor of the hotel seemed to be inspired by color and grace of the flower Bird of Paradise as well as British occupied Bombay. The entire building had a fresh scent and an airy, bright look!- We had the hot tub all to ourselves in the morning! BEST. VACATION. EVER!- The hotel is a stones throw from the River and a five to ten minute walk anywhere in the historic district we wanted to go.CONS: - No Bathrobes. (Not a big deal it just would be nice to have one as a cover up going to the pool.)- The coffee in the room AND downstairs in the lobby was undrinkable. It tasted like burnt water. However, the tea selection was great!The vacation was a whirlwind of pleasure from treating our taste buds to scrumptious Savannah delights, enjoying the sexy hot tub and the makeshift bubble bath, as well as reading in the park or at The Coffee Fox. It was the best vacation EVER. Thank you DoubleTree for making our vacation so special! We love you and Savannah!Nice hotel at a great rate in a really convenient location in the historic district. It's not the most modern hotel, but everything is nicely taken care of and fits in well in the historic district. There's a nice space to pull your car in and unload rather than struggling on the street. And there are a limited number of refrigerators available for rooms, so if you want one call and ask quick!","A little construction? A LITTLE CONSTRUCTION?? How about telling your guests when they're booking that jack hammers will be coming through their ceilings. FYI - the entire 5th and 6th floors are closed due to 'renovations', but the sound can be heard throughout, and into the street. Checked out faster than I checked in, had to scramble for a new spot to stay. Vacation!Only parking is valet at $25 a day. The lobby had a very overpowering perfume shop smell that will make you nauseas! But other than that it was comfortable, didn't have they're food. Why would we when there are so many restaurants in walking distance?! But we did get free margaritas at 5:00 which were very tasty! And did I say free?Girlfriend &amp; I took an impromptu trip to Savannah and booked a night at this Doubletree last minute.  Considering the location and a sub $200 a night bill:Location: A. walking distance to River StPrice: A the least expensive hotel close to River StAccommodations: A it was clean, had free wifi and the rooms were at little average but the shower was very good and the beds comfortableDownside: parking. They will tack on $18/ night for valet parking. But it's still cheaper than anywhere you'll find in walking distance to River St. We will likely stay they again when we return to Savannah!The location is great!  The hotel is right on Bay Street and you can walk to the riverside shops and restaurants Amanda you are on the edge of the Historic district with valet parking so no worries!  Parking is tight in the historic district so this is a big deal.  The room was larger than average and I was not on the honors floor so that was nice extra.  Beds were comfortable.  Note that your great location on Bay Street means that you have the noise of Bay Street so if it bothers you ask for a room on the back side of the hotel.  The staff from valet to front desk were very helpful and friendly.  They also had a nice sitting room with a fire in the hearth.  Great for reading or chatting.  The only down was the pool is under major construction.  This a great spot for business travel or a fun weekend!The rooms here seem to be pretty standard for a Doubletree, in terms of size and appointments, with the exception of the four post bed and the lamps made from old books. Not many of the rooms here have balconies, which is a bit of a disappointment -- and the balconies on the corner rooms are small and wedge-shaped. This is what we ended up with.  It was nice to have, but I wouldn't have wanted the upgrade if it cost me any extra. I would also have liked a refrigerator in the room.  In the past at other locations (even Hampton Inns) I've been able to call and have a fridge brought into the room when one was not included.  I didn't try this here, so that may be a possibility.The soap/shampoo/conditioner stuff smells really good, ""Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Citron"".  I'm not a connoisseur of such things so that's all I can really tell you. There is a bar area downstairs amongst the several nicely appointed common rooms, and the bartender there was friendly. Another room has a big comfy couch in front of a fireplace.Breakfast is buffet-style, with pancakes, waffles, and omelets made to order.  There was plenty there to fill me up, but I wouldn't say that the food was too memorable. At the normal price of $15 per person, you're better off skipping the breakfast in favor of an in-town option unless you get the breakfast for free through the HHonors benefits.Finally, valet parking (which is mandatory, you cannot park yourself) is $15 a day, so don't forget to factor that into the price.  I wish the Hilton properties that do this would stop and at least factor the charge into the advertised room rate.  Better yet, drop the charge altogether because we all know it's a meaningless crap charge.Wife and I were there for the ladies marathon on Sat 3/28. Stayed 3 days in this beautiful hotel. Upon arrival valet immediately removed our luggage placed our bags on carts, and waited til we checked in. Deion our valet was super courteous, and helpful.   He took our bags upstairs and unloaded our belongings, and hung up our clothes bags. The front desk was just as attentive. The room was clean and nicely appointed. Beds were very comfortable. One small issue was the bed  sheet was rather small for a king size bed. Couldn't tuck in the ends at all, so after a nights sleep we had to retuck the sheets as best we could. First 2 nights were quiet, less the street noise from traffic if you get a room facing busy Bay St. But we still slept quite well. Now comes the 3rd night and low and behold the guest in rm 412 started fighting at 2 am. We finally complained around 3:30 and management quickly sent up security. Was quiet for about 5 min and it started again. This time management sent the police to have them removed from the premises. Finally it's quiet but it's also 5-5:30. Not much sleep. We decided to just get up an check out about 8:30-9. Front deck comp us just $25 for parking, but said we should call the GM later. When we got home I spoke to management and they asked what would make me happy. Of Coarse I said one night deducted from my $700 bill would be nice. Didn't get the ladies name but she said consider it done to the tune of $213. Thought I'd be in for a tough time but she was extremely understanding. Not their fault two guests had no consideration for other guests. Will always stay here whenever we visit Savannah, which is usually once a year. Thanks to the staff again for making our stay one to remember. And by the way great coffee.I have stayed here numerous times. The hotel is in a great location and it is very clean. The staff is also helpful and friendly. I also love the warm cookies at check in !The beds are incredibly comfortable and I want to steal the pillows. The staff k is very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is within walking distance of all the fine dining you could want. The breakfast is buffet style and is 16.00, which is a little pricey...however the food is really good. Try the quiche!!! highly recommended.Awesome beds!!!  Quiet room and super friendly staff!!!  Steps from city market and river front!  Well worth the price.While this Doubletree is still in an awesome location and is still a beautiful hotel I had so many issues with it on a recent stay that I have to lower my rating of this hotel, which makes me very sad as a loyal customer and HHonors member of the Hilton brand. I checked into my room and everything was going great. I got my free cookie and guest welcome package (2 waters) from the front desk. The room looked great and had all the amenities that I've come to expect of this and other Hilton hotels. Then that night I lost my credit card while I was out at dinner, which will be important later in this review. After getting back from dinner I called my credit card company and reported my card lost. I then went to bed which is when the trouble began; I was awaken by an awful smell like raw sewage coming into the room from a nearby paper mill. Although I know this isn't the hotel's fault, they should still have some sort of filter on their AC that would prevent outside smells from trickling into the room; especially when they are charging over $150 for a night. Then the next morning were issues with the valet parking. I called valet to retrieve my car and the lady there wanted my valet ticket number which I didn't have because the previous day the valet didn't give me a ticket but just took my car. I told her this and gave us a description of my car which they were able to find after a short period. When checking out I complained to the front desk about the smell that came in my room and woke me up the previous night. The lady working the desk just said that was not their problem, that the plant causes that smell. No sorry, no free cookie, no nothing from here. As I walked out to leave she called me back saying that my credit card (from earlier in this review) had declined the charges for valet ($15), I explained to her that was probably because I reported my card lost after checking in and paid her the $15 valet parking fee in cash. After getting in my car it smelled like cigarettes; not sure if they smoked in my car of if it was the plant. After returning home I called Doubletree customer service to tell them the complaints I had with the hotel. They said they would contact the general manager of the hotel and that the manager would have to get back with me. A day later I get an email apologizing from the hotel manager about my complaints and once again blaming the plant for the smell that night. A couple of days later I log in to check my credit card. Well, well the $15 for valet parking did go through so I called to complain about. I contacted the hotel which said and shows on their statement that they did issue a refund to my lost card for the $15, but it never made it to my credit card company. I called the credit card company that has not received any sort of refund for the hotel. I then contact the hotel again that insists that they refunded the $15 and that there was nothing else they could do for me. I now have to put the $15 overcharge in dispute with my credit card company wait. This use to be such a great hotel, but not sure what the hell is going on with it now. From now on when heading down to Savannah I'll just pay an extra $20 a night to spend the night at the Hyatt across the street, which hopefully won't lose my car, smell, and overcharge me.nice place to stay with  updated rooms! the only flaws was the loud music  at the city market and the lady at the front desk with the bright red hair (didn't get her name) who's answer to questions she didn't know was "" I don't know I've been off all week so I haven't seen the renovated rooms.""I've never stayed in a Hilton before. So I was pretty excited when I learned this was the hotel my university's group had booked as our lodging back in October. Frankly, I was expecting the toilets to be made from gold based on the Hilton reputation.Wrong. So wrong...There was seriously nothing special about this place. The decor didn't even match... I've stayed at Holiday Inns, Best Westerns, etc. for the fraction of the cost and had the same-if not better- experience. And they offered a FREE continental breakfast. $15 for a ""Southern style buffet"" that was just mediocre.True, the staff was really nice, and that makes a difference. The location is good, too. But these are the only real positives.Here's a list of my other grievances:-No fridge, microwave, etc. (Don't plan on eating that famous Savannah food later...)-The coffee maker in the rooms was nice, but there were only two cups and enough coffee for one person.-Bathroom essentials were lacking in quality and quantity.-There weren't even enough towels for myself and my roommates.-We also had to wait a few hours after our check-in time until our room was ready. I understand things happen, but this was the cherry-on-top for my letdown of a hotel experience.My advice: There are some other great hotels in the historic district just a few blocks away that are cheaper and are, in my opinion, better. If you don't mind walking two or three blocks, save yourself the trouble and book elsewhere. From my experience, I recommend the Thunderbird Inn (my personal favorite), or the Comfort Inn.This is a beautiful hotel, right in the heart of Savannah. My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay and the warm cookies! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, it's valet only, which was slightly confusing because when we arrived there were no signs of where to park, however; we had a great overnight stay and the room was more than adequate!Staying at this hotel at a room for over $160/night before taxes/fees was a huge disappointment. The room did NOT have- a fridge- working phone- the standard bathroom kit with shower caps, q-tips, and so on- robes- working iron/remotely functioning ironing board (see below why it was important)I was getting ready for a wedding and needed an iron since I flew in from DC and packed my outfit. The first iron dropped its bottom as I lifted it. I called the front desk on my cell phone since the room phone wasn't working to ask for a different one. The replacement phone poured water on my dress as I attempted to iron it.The next morning we heard a pipe burst left many of our friends without water. Eh.Ever since my first visit to Savannah a few years ago, every time I have gone back, I always stay at this hotel. The staff has always been very accommodating and the location is perfect for historic district.Let's make this quick, as we're all busy people here.Hotel location is great. Walking distance from the River Walk, for some fine tourist trap time, if that's what you in for. The Rooms are clean and beds are very comfy. If you're lucky they will give you a view of the bridge that is very nice. Breakfast buffet is nice and with enough variety to make it worth it. The bad: They charge you $25 A NIGHT to use the valet service and park your car, and you won't find alternatives there, as Savannah is terrible for parking on the street. I think it would have been more honest to add it to the room price. It just feels like one of those bail-and-switch things that just piss you off. With that said, the warm cookie they give you when you check in is nice.Great location for all restaurants &amp; shops in area.When we booked room over the phone, I asked for big bath tub in my room, but I got handicap room by mistake. Unfortunately hotel was fully booked so we had to stay in the handicap room but hotel have us complimentary breakfast tickets for apology. Breakfast was buffet style &amp; not many choices. Free so ..it was ok. If you have to pay regular price of $14.95 for this breakfast, I won't recommend!  Hotel was old but clean &amp; well maintained I had to leave 3 stars because elevator is REALLY REALLY slow.Such a great hotel!  I loved my little suite but the best part about this hotel was the staff.  I'm not sure that they knew what they were getting into by hosting a group of 2000 ""runners"" this past weekend, but they handled everything perfectly and with a smile - from the never ending supply of beer in our hospitality suite to graciously offering laundry services when we all walked in covered in swamp water and mud.I think that they enjoyed our shenanigans as much as we did.The Doubletree was running a great special, so it was time for a road trip. The hotel is very nice and in a great location, near River Street. So you are in the thick of the action. The hotel was clean. The rooms were fine. Nothing out-of-the-ordinary. The staff was friendly, and they let us check in early. The breakfast buffet is a little pricey. It's slightly better than your average, mid-range hotel buffet, but I would eat elsewhere, if you can.The biggest thing I hate about going to a Hilton is the fact that some of my money may find its way into Paris HIlton's pocket. Makes you think twice.HHonor Diamond member here...Booked a King non-smoking room 4 months in advance....Was given a double smoking room...""Mark"" the manager was of no help in recitifying.And bless their heart...it tries to be a nice hotel...but I would try the DeSoto a few blocks away next time.","On a whirlwind trip to Savannah, my colleague booked this hotel through Priceline. We got it for a steal of a price: $80 per night. The hotel is clean, gorgeous, and located in the heart of the Historic District. Our room was on the sixth floor, the top floor. We also had an odd numbered room, which had a beautiful view of the park and old church across the street. Upon arrival, we had a swift check in and the concierge gave us complimentary bottles of water and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies: a Doubletree signature. During our week-long stay, we dined at the hotel's restaurant for breakfast. Our business booking allowed us free coupons for the buffet. Even though we misplaced some, the front desk was more than accommodating to issue us new ones. Breakfast itself was acceptable with lots of Southern cooking: fried grits, three kinds of egg frittatas, bacon, two kinds of sausage. A few healthier fruit dishes would have been a treat.Our double bedroom was spacious with modern decor and a white cotton washable duvet. My colleague and I both had the best night's sleep here, and even dozed through the alarm one morning. Doubletree is definitely a home-away-from-home!The location of the hotel worked great for us, as it was in walking distance of many local restaurants, parks, and unique shops. City Market is just around the corner as is the riverfront. Plan on doing a lot of foot travel. The only downside to the hotel is that since it is within the Historic District, parking is sparse. Doubletree charges $17 per day for parking and has valet.There aren't really any other options for self-parking, so in addition to the daily fee, you have to add a tip for the valet service. However, I believe all the other positives of the hotel outweigh the parking; besides, Savannah is a walkable city!If you're looking for a great place to stay for business or pleasure, Doubletree comes with my highest recommendation!I love the location.  Everything is walking distance.  Very friendly service.  We asked if they had a refridgerator to keep our leftovers in for the night, and they brought a minifridge up to our room within minutes.  I love getting a warm cookie when I check in.  The room was ok.  Big bed but no desk and no counterspace in the bathroom and not much room to move around.  We got a corner room so we heard no noise from other guests.  Typical breakfast buffet, but that costs extra.  It's valet parking and that costs $15 extra per day.  There is a small assortment of complimentary toiletries at the front desk if you forget something.  Nice pool deck on the second floor.  This is one of the few hotels in Savannah with a hot tub.Although there were a couple things I didn't like about it, the good things outweigh the bad.  I would stay here again.The hotel has given us an early check-in twice and a late check-out twice.  They were very accommodating when we had a room that the air wasn't working properly in, they immediately switched us to another room and comped our parking for the day!! Excellent guest services.  The breakfast and lunch buffets are wonderful.  I will definitely stay there again!Ohhh my gosh, I love Savannah. It's SO beautiful and has such a unique charm to it. You'll never want to leave. And this hotel was the capstone to a wonderful week in the south.The hotel is very well-equipped, with friendly staff, a starbucks on the main floor, very nice suite rooms. Everything you can want. AND it's RIGHT on the water, so if you're lucky enough to be on the right side, you can see the iconic ferry boats cruising down the Savannah River.At night, walk down the water side and have your pick of tons of restaurants, bars, candy stores and the like. It reminded me of a cross between the AC boardwalk (but waaaay nicer) and New Orleans. It's so incredibly romantic, too -- complete with kids selling single roses on the boardwalk. Too bad I was with my boss... AWKWARD!Anyway, loved it. Think I'll retire here.Thought the customer service was outstanding!  Great location!  I was very impressed with the room for the price we paid.  Any staff we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. Most importantly, the beds were so so so comfortable!The is is a prime location for seeing all the touristy hoopla of downtown Savannah.  You can walk to anything worth doing easily. For that alone it's worth the asking price. The hotel is very nice , the staff is very friendly and the room was awesome. We booked the bed and breakfast special. So the price included comps for the buffet.  The beds are big and comfy. i slept like the dead! The bath tub was big enough for full submersion. So I indulged in a long hot soak. The supplied coffee was surprisingly tasty. And of course the DT cookies are the jam!The breakfast buffet was a lot larger than I had anticipated. There were a ton of choices and everything that I tried was pretty good for heat tray food. The only downside is the 15$ add on for parking, It wouldn't have been an issue if the valets had been available any of the times we went back for our car. We had to hunt them down to get our vehicle. Inconvenient but not a deal breaker.I stayed there one night and would definitely go back - the valet parking person, Eric, was awesome - recommended places to go; spoke with me every time I ran in to him - made me feel welcome and part of the family.  My room wasn't ready but he parked my car (extra charge for parking -- $15) and took my bag to my room - it was there waiting for me when I got there a few hours later.The room was amazing - big bed that was beyond comfortable.  All the staff were very helpful. Its in a good location.The only thing I didn't like was that the tub was so shallow.Friendly staff, clean rooms. Beds were extremely comfortableThe staff was fantastic!  We arrived late in the evening and their staff provided excellent service from our check-in to our check-out.  I had a complaint in our room however, it was handled immediately.  In result, we were accomodated in a upgrade and not charged the difference for our inconvenience.  They pride in customer satisfaction and our party was very satisfied.  Keep up the good work and I hope to visit again.I almost stayed at the Westin, which was hooked to the convention center (which is why I was there) and I am SO HAPPY that I did not stay at the Westin.  My stay was wonderful.  And that warm cookie upon check in makes a nice after midnight snack when you are coming back from a fun night at Savannah Smiles, walking distance from the hotel.When I made my reservation they only had a room with 2 doubles available, but upon check in, they were able to upgrade me for no extra charge to a beautiful and spacious suite with a large soft bed and their signature 'sweet dreams' pillow on top.  I had a nice roomy workspace with free internet connection and the one day I ordered room service (for lunch) they were prompt and the burger was delicious.  I also enjoyed the full breakfast buffet, which was a bit on the pricey side (about $12.95) but it hit the spot, and was a quick way to fill up before a long work day at the convention across the river.I am not sure if the water taxi to Hutchinson Island is free all the time, but at the time of my stay, the water taxi was a 5 minute walk and completely free to the convention center/Hutchinson Island.The only part that I did not particularly enjoy was that your car had to be valet parked, which is wonderful, especially when you are me and have a hard time parrallel parking!!!  BUT on the morning of check out, EVERYONE was checking out, which resulted in having to wait about 30 minutes for your car - if they knew that everyone would be checking out that morning - I wish they had more staff.Other then that, I had a pleasant stay, very good location, walking distance from everything, and I look forward to staying there again!This was suppose to be my honeymoon!  We ordered room service and both my husband and I got food poisoning.  We were so sick we had to pack ourselves up and drive home while we had to stop every 30 minutes because we were so sick.  They did comp our room, which they should have since they caused this experience, but they never apologized for ruining my honeymoon.  The General Manager and his staff were so incredibly rude, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  So sad since they could have made this a better experience even after we got sick.Well located in Historic District.  Good room and service, including free Internet service in lobby. After returning home, when I reported an item I had left in my room, the hotel promptly returned it. Hotel has a restaurant, where we had only breakfast. Other meals are available. It also has a rooftop pool.",,,"['really', 'impressed', 'place', 'heart', 'action', 'close', 'everything', 'clean', 'well', 'decorated', 'valet', 'friendly', 'fast', 'especially', 'busy', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-savannah-midtown-savannah,Fairfield Inn Savannah Midtown,2.5,$$,22,"I stayed at this Marriott once before and have had a lovely time both times. The room I had was clean, everything worked nicely, I didn't see any bugs, and it was very quiet and peaceful. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The morning free continental breakfast is fresh and delicious, and you can even have homemade waffles! Plus they have freshly baked cookies every day, and lemonade too! Overall it was a very nice experience. While this is not a 5 star hotel, I gave this a 5 star review because of the value I had staying here. The nightly rate was reasonable, I felt safe and it was walking distance to Publix, clean, had free breakfast and free wifi, and excellent front desk customer service. Keep in mind that this is not near the Historic District/downtown/River Street so if location is a big deal to you it might be a little inconvenient to have to drive downtown every day. However if you don't plan to be downtown your entire trip, or plan to go out drinking at night frequently and don't want to stumble back to your hotel/get a cab, I'd highly recommend this hotel! If you're like me and on a budget and want to stay somewhere with great value I'd say this is a great deal for your Savannah trip. I'd definitely come back on my next trip to Savannah!We stayed here over St. Patty's Day weekend and spent 15,000 points a night for Friday and Saturday, a much cheaper option than staying downtown for $350-450/night. Considering this is basically a motel, there isn't too much I can complain about. The room was clean, the ladies working at reception were incredibly helpful, the breakfast wasn't too bad, the wifi was free, and housekeeping didn't wake us up.The location isn't great, but shuttles and taxis will take you downtown for $10/person. That was the rate over St. Patty's Day weekend though so they may be cheaper under normal circumstances.Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, room and breakfast  was not up to company standards. I posted pics of the dirt and dust left on the lamps; and dirt and rust in the bathroom. Breakfast items were lacking, no fresh fruit or meatnThe room was fine.  The elevator is in a very awkward spot right inside the door with another door into the lobby.   There's always confusion when the doors open and you have to figure out which way the people coming off are going so you know where to stand to not be in the way.   The maids are incredibly rude.  On more than one occasion in the awkward elevator area,  in a situation when you would expect an employee with a big cart to move to the side and let you pass with your luggage,  they kept barreling through forcing us to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.   Next time we'll pay the little bit of extra $ to stay downtown and avoid the rudeness.Recently, we stayed at Fairfield Inn in Chattanooga and was so pleased we thought we would stay again after finding a great rate deal. First  of all access to the rooms is exterior and upon arrival their are a group of people  hanging about out outside. ok not a big deal. Entering the lobby you have to squeeze into a glass enclose next to the elevator ummm AWKWARD! During the remodel I hope the address this! Check in staff were cordial at best and to  give them the benefit of the doubt they were extremely busy.  Wait, we are in the South where southern hospitality is suppose to reign supreme right?   Room checked in and off we go back to squeeze into the little space to use the elevator to go upstairs to our room. The room is clean this is good! Time to sleep.Sleep? No Way... people running up and down and you can hear every sound there is no sound proofing in this hotel. It would be better sold to a Motel 6 that have Marriot on their name. I  have not finished.. Its Breakfast Buffet time... again its extremely busy and they have a very small seating area... and not enough places for the crowd to seat. The staff which are barely visible must be having a horrendous time in the kitchen  because the food is not stocked to keep up with the demand,Not the Fault of the hotel by any means I witnessed people picking things up and replacing them to which I then took them and threw said items away! Seriously! People don't handle things at a Buffett! Gross!!! Not even  the plates or cutlery  if you do use it or toss it! Read this if you want more on that topic  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp43oJF-5H&amp;s=3ca879f6bc80f81db822595a99a7f32e614b69192d38fdc1ffc94b2da0d8ecfb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">wp.me/p43oJF-5H</a>  Please read it!Lastly the coffee or should I say water... We brought Starbucks Via with us knowing that the coffee would not be great and Via would be a good alternative. however either the creamer or the water was very off!!! Leaving our Vias non-drinkable! they had the funkiest taste we determined it had to be the water because  The Man did not use creamer! We have stayed at far worse, however we will not return to this hotel, and will seriously reconsider staying at other Fairfield Inns.FYI We are Frequent Marriott guests.I just visited trip advisor and saw management had responded to many months of positive reviews but not negative. This earns them -1 star for LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE in social media forums.Definitely a motel and totally not worth the 129+tax for one night. Very disappointed!Had a very short stay here last week.  Checked in late (around 11:30) and was expecting the typical Night Auditor check-in.  The process was quick but the woman was very nice and friendly enough for the hour.The set-up is strange.  Floors one and two have exterior corridors.  The third floor has interior corridors.  We had a third floor room.  The room was standard with the bathroom being a bit small.  Or at least it felt that way because there was very little counter space.Our ceiling looked like it had been patched multiple times which doesn't all give the best impression on a rainy evening.  My roommate didn't feel like her shirts were clean.Breakfast was available right on time at 6:30 the next morning.  Plenty of good offerings including waffles and biscuits and gravy.  We ate and hit the road again.Overall a quick stay.  In general I would say everything was A-OK but it wouldn't be my first choice if I were to return to Savannah.This hotel has much to improve! The bathroom was gross! The toilet seat was the wrong size so it was like sitting on bricks! Solid water stains throughout the tub, spotty linen, and incompetent staff! I prepaid through cheap tix and they charged my card again! I have had to call three times to get these charges reversed! This place has seen the last of me!!Visited Savannah for less than 24 hours. Arrived on a Sunday after 1pm and  left the next day after 10:30am. Very short visit. Hotel looked outdated from the outside but okay looking inside.  The rooms were fine for what you pay for. I like that they have makeup remover towelettes for the ladies. Wasn't a being fan of the hotel soap. Had a funny smell to it. The free breakfast was okay too. Wish they had more healthier options.Nice an affordable place to stay while in Savannah,not to far from Hunter Army Airfield.Basically, they publish great coupons and refuse to honor them, even if customers comply with absolutely all stipulations on the coupons.  So, this place is a total scam.I purchased a groupon for this location.  According to all published information, the groupon was valid on the date I wanted to stay, and I was reserving the room prior to the expiration date.When I called the hotel, they told me that I could only stay for full price on that date, the groupon would not be valid.  This brought the rate from $69 to $125.  They claimed this was because too many people had tried to use a groupon that weekend (but rooms were available, mind you!).  There was absolutely no information about such a possible situation in the groupon.  Next, I called corporate headquarters for Fairfield.  They informed me that the local hotel could refuse accept the groupon at their discretion at any time.  Also the groupon would not be accepted during a single weekend in the entire month that I wanted to travel.  At their ""discretion"" meant that the groupon was absolutely never valid.  Luckily groupon was able to reimburse me.I would never stay at this place because they publish coupons that that don't mean to accept.This is a hotel wanting to be a Marriott.  The breakfast was horrible.  The room was extremely small a first for me in a Marriott.  The bathroom was terrible the toilet was so low to the ground that we thought it was a child's training toilet. The shower curtain smelled awful. The mattress cover had stains on it. I will never stay there again!!!It's definitely not the nicest place to stay in Savannah &amp; it's a bit far from the historic parts of town, but it's affordable and clean. If we're in Savannah again for the weekend, we'll definitely consider it just because it's affordable, not too far from uptown, and centrally located if you're trying to get to Wilmington Island or Tybee.We stayed here for one night when we came into town to see the sights of Savannah.  First of all, this place is a screaming deal for one night.  For $75/night plus tax, we had a room on the third floor with a small fridge and microwave and a smallish bathroom as well as a king size bed (no closet).  Second, for what it is, the place is clean and quiet and the staff is very nice.  We had a continental breakfast, which was typically average fare (cereal, hard boiled eggs, toast, yogurt, make your own waffles and biscuits with gravy), and it was tasty.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a quiet place outside of town.This is basically a motel with free coffee and breakfast.  So if that is what your looking for them this place is fine but if your looking for a marriott hotel then you will be disappointed. Linens were clean.  Bathrooms are tiny.  the sink is in the same room as the beds.We found this hotel in a discount book we picked up traveling through SC. We called while traveling and made the reservation confirming the discount price with a helpful employee.  We arrived to meet a friendly and efficient front desk employee.  The price was what was advertised and confirmed by phone.  The hotel even smelled clean and was pleasantly decorated.  We were pleased with our room.  The hotel was very convenient to the expressway, Starbucks and Cracker Barrel.The only thing I would add is there was no blanket in the room.We booked here because over the Memorial Day weekend 2011 the downtown hotels were all booked solid. we had a two-night stay here. First, I have to say the staff are courteous, and the continental breakfast good. Also, their laundry room is conveniently located on the second floor and is very clean. The parking space are plentiful, unlike the downtown hotels.However, its WiFi Internet did not work! To me, that ruined the stay. I told the staff twice that either their server is down or the signals so weak that I could not access the Internet, but no one seemed to work on this issue. I had no problem logging on to the Hilton affiliated hotel WiFi down the road (hhonors network), but since I wasn't staying there I could not use it.  In the night of the second day the WiFi finally worked,  but it was spotty at best, requiring constant reloads. I took my laptop to the lobby and it was the same. I might add that my Acer laptop has a very sensitive WiFi detection unit and it can ferret out even the weakest signals. It was worse than the days of the dial-up connection! I gave up at the end, and relied on my iPhone's 3G to get on the Internet. (By the way, they do have a wired computer in the lobby for the guests, but it was occupied most of the time)I suppose the motel is OK if you don't need the Internet, but if you do, go somewhere else.I stay here on my way between Boston and Orlando during the winter and it is my favorite overnight stop. Everyone who works here is extremely nice and welcoming and the rooms and areas around the hotel are very clean and comfortable. I never wake up in time to get the free breakfast, but I'm usually lucky enough to be in my room when they come by with the free snack cart in the early evening. You can also grab a free bottled water from the front desk whenever you feel like it.If security is a concern, ask for a room on the second or third floor. While the first floor is open to the parking lot, the second and third floor are both accessible by elevator only and you need your keycard to use the elevator.This is also a great location for visiting Savannah as you are only about a 10 minutes drive from the historic district.Booked this hotel because of a Groupon offer.  I checked the hotel online before I purchased the coupon.  The pictures depict a nice and very clean hotel.  After driving for 12 hours, I wanted to cry when I saw this place.  There was a sign on the door letting us know that they place was being renovated and they apologized for the current condition.  The gentleman who checked me in was very friendly and incredibly courteous.  Since the lobby looked (somewhat....the chair at the computer desk had lovely electrical tape on the arm rest) like the pictures on the website I thought, ""Okay, no problem.  This is going to be fine.""  WRONG!My sister and niece went up to the room before me while I parked the car. When I came into the room they were both just standing there looking a little freaked out.  My sister told me not to worry and that it was going to be okay because we were just spending the night and leaving first thing in the morning.  The first thing you notice is the heavy smell of damp/mold. The room looked nothing like the pictures on the website.  I mean NOTHING.  The carpet was dirty, the shower liner was moldy and also covered in soap scum, there was hair in the tub and floor and the bed skirts were really wrinkled and the bottoms were completely frayed.  I called the front desk and the gentleman was very apologetic and immediately offered to move us.  He even went to check the room himself before he had us move.  While this room looked a little cleaner and the damp smell not as heavy, it was only a fraction of an improvement overall.  The room also did not have fridge like the first one did.  What it did have was one big honking dehumidifier that sounded like a dying animal when we turned it on.  I tried to find another hotel, but it was past midnight and unless we drove another two hours we were out of luck.  So we sucked it up and spent the night.  I'm not sure when this hotel went from (according to the other reviews) clean to filthy, but I just can't wrap my head around the odd disconnect between the very friendly front end staff and the rest of the employees.  Clearly, some don't give a what when it comes to having pride in their work or what they are offering for services or accommodations.This is a great secret.  This facility is not an ordinary Fairfield Inn.  It is better.  Spent 3 nights due to business.  It is an easy tide to the historic district, less than 10 minutes and don't forget Tybee Beach.  Outdoor pool, several exercise machines, but hey, just use the stairs.  Very secure.  Clean,  how about spotless and shinning.  From the minute I checked in every one was helpful, delightful, and very conversational.  If you forget you laptop/tablet, don't worry the lobby has a PC, and the hotel is wi-fi.  Need to fax, they handle it at no charge.  ManAger offered to scan the documents and email to me in a PDF.  That was a big, WOW moment.  Not to mention, one block was a LOFT clothing store, Fresh Market, Publix, ABC, Five Guys, Bonefish Grill, and more.  Here is the best part, they had customer appreciation night and grilled hamburgers and hotdogs, with the fixings and potato salad and fruit salad. Breakfast was expanded.","Great clean hotel at a great price! Family enjoyed our stay!Outside looks a bit dated and it has exterior ""hallways"" but the interior seems recently renovated. Clean, decent, up to date room. Ac was a bit funky... Made the room feel damp. Loud noise around 9 or 10 pm that freaked me an my husband out. I think it was a plane. Didn't expect that. Good free breakfast... Biscuits and gravy, delicious belgium waffles (make em yourself in the waffle iron), variety of cold cereals, oatmeal, fresh fruits, juices, coffee, some other baked goods, yogurt, Jimmy dean microwaveable sandwiches. Friendly staff. Check out is at 12.",,,,"['lovely', 'time', 'times', 'room', 'clean', 'everything', 'worked', 'nicely', 'see', 'bugs', 'quiet', 'peaceful', 'staff', 'attentive', 'helpful', 'morning', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baymont-inn-and-suites-garden-city-garden-city,Baymont Inn And Suites Garden City,3.0,$$,22,"Dont let the desolate area fool you, this place is decent enough to stay in if you are visiting Savannah. Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, huge flat screen tv, microwave and refridgerator. The bathroom was clean, and the shower worked wonderfully. Breakfast was amazing, lots of options! The only thing I felt that went wrong was that the maid came to our room at 10:50am when check out was at 12 noon. I dont like being rushed. There was a do not disturb sign visibe on our doorknob. I kindly told her we'd be done by noon. Other than that, they have shuttles to Savannah attractions, and all the pamphlets you need if you want something to do.Changed rates from quoted price of $65 then bill you $80 says there is a new revenue tax....other hotels aren't aware of by the way. Due to a reservation issue they didn't have a room for me for my extended WEEK. Charged me $180 for one night in this no frills hotel in February. Night desk was nice but had no power to fix anything after a rude discussion with the manager. I left there and stayed in pooler ga way cheaper with nicer hotels for another week at a set rate of $55 a night..don't stay here when 10 minutes away you have nicer areas.Really nice hotel. When we first saw the neighborhood we weren't expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was large and comfy (king size bed) The room was clean and fresh. However, room 124 is located right across from the entrance for the pool and ice machine which means lots of foot traffic and noise. The ice machine is loud. We booked our room with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and decided after to extend our stay so we booked again. The staff was able to keep us in the same room for both bookings. The staff is very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast is basic but good and satisfying. The hotel is just minutes from downtownWe stayed here for one night because we made a last minute decision to stay in Savannah an extra night. I would give one star, but I was only worried about two things: cleanliness, and a bed. They were clean as far as the eye could see, but the bed was horrible. We were up all night. It was like someone folded the mattress In half and the indent stayed. Or a very few hundred men laid directly in the center and left a hole. It was kind of like a sinking ship. Just trying to crawl back up to the sides of the bed. Good thing my boyfriend and I don't mind cuddling. If you don't mind a rough NIGHT then this if the place for you.Stay 8/18/15-8/19/15. Firstly, our family was moved 5 times in less than 12 hours due to a refrigerator not working which was frozen completely solid with a thick sheet of ice from top to bottom on the back wall ( my son has IDDM and we HAVE to keep his insulin cold!) which is imperative for us...then the second room they wanted us to move to because the night clerk JR said theres no way to switch out a refrigerator at 11:00pm (we arrived after 10pm) stunk like a mix of nasty gym socks and clothes and sour pickle juice...ugh...and after opening the door we immediately had to close it!!  So...off to number three!  By this time it was midnight and we didn't get settled in until 2:30am but happy we had a working fridge for the insulin!!  At around the 3 o'clock hour I woke up coughing and not breathing well because the room was sooooo hot!  It was 76 degrees and the air conditioner was sounding like chatty chatty bang bang!!  It had also leaked out onto the carpeted flooring directly beneath it where I had all of my shoes mind you, and which were all now soaked!!!  Soooo calling the front desk again who assigned us a FOURTH room  with yet again no working fridge!!! Sooooo my husband pulls out the fridge and underneath was an opened tube of hydrocortisone cream!!!  When he pulled out the fridge to check it the tube squirted out the cream all over the carpet beneath the fridge which was filthy and I had to clean the used hydrocortisone cream off the carpet!  Awful!  Then behind the fridge in this fourth room was a large canister of coffee creamer!!  We had to move fridge #3 into the 4th room!  Next was a ""free"" upgrade to a larger suite which remained at 76 degrees because the thermostats are locked and preset to cut off after 30 minutes of no movement in the room!?!  We thought we could deal with just the heat of the room after all the moves and this was room #5 so we tried to settle in after finally being reassured a night would be credited for us (after pushing it because they only were going to give us a 50% discount for the bad night!!)! also, didn't mention that we didn't get moved to room #4 until 6:00am!  Soon breakfast time!  Right?!?  Well, sort of!  Whenever we placed toast in the toaster and gosh forbid used the microwave at the same time it would trip the octopus strip sitting right behind the toaster and I had to keep cutting the strip back on myself!!  Uuugh!  So we thought we were going to finally get some sleep...right?  Wrong again!  The maid, unannounced barges in the room with all 4 of our family members sound asleep and begins cleaning the bathroom!  She then walks into the sleeping area and I was scared to death and I sat up in bed which scared her and she just said oooooh sorry and ran out of the room!!  Soooo off to room number 5.... The great upgrade, we were thinking that sleep time was finally approaching us when on Wednesday August 19, 2015 while laying in bed my adult daughter noticed a bug crawling on her white shirt. It immediately crawled onto her chest. We took photos and identified it as a bed bug and notified staff who came in our room and saw the bug and took it with them.  They actually did not want to give a receipt or refund as we checked out!  The night duty clerk, JR stated that they could do nothing about it and as  for us we would have  to stay the night until the morning and in that same room!!  He also  denied it in front of people standing behind us!  This is THE MOST UNCLEAN HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! WE DECIDED IT WAS FINALLY TIME TO LEAVE!!! Plus when we tried to check out the night clerk started yelling at me, standing up pointing to a note on the wall yelling that there was nothing he could do about giving us a receipt showing we checked out after telling me on the phone 20  mnutes earlier that we would get a refund for the next 3 nights we were not going to be there. When he stood up and raised his voice at me, my husband put hs hand on the counter and told him to slow down talking to me, his wife, that way and the night clerk started shaking and violently squealing for us to get out of his hotel and all just for asking him a question about our receipt and asking for a copy of us checking out!!!  He ran in the back so weird like and called 911!  It was like a Saturday Night live comedy sketch with yelling from the clerk!  Unbelievable! Needless to say we WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!!!We stayed here the night before running a half marathon in Savannah. It was reasonably priced, right on the highway and not far from downtown. At first glance, everything seemed fine.My friend and I got a room with 2 queen beds. I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed something moving in my bed. It was a bug. I hate bugs so I woke up my friend, thinking it was just one bug but needing her emotional support for me to get rid of it. Nope, turned out there were 3 bugs that I found in my bed and 2 in hers, as well as a palmetto bug (aka a cockroach) on the wall. We lifted up the sheets, didn't seen any bugs so I don't think they were bed bugs. There were all different kinds of bugs... Needless to say we didn't get a good night's sleep before our half marathon.Everyone kept on writing about the ""shuttle"" like it's such a ""convenient"" service. Lol. Let me share my experiences with you in regards to this. Don't rely on the shuttle during three of their busiest time of the year, which is: New Year's Day, July 4th, and St. Patrick's Day. You will be waiting forever for your ride back to the hotel.Unfortunately, my husband and I tried their shuttle service because everyone was mentioning how ""wonderful"" it was. Well, on July 4th, their service was terrible and very poorly managed. First of all, fireworks in Savannah was scheduled for 9pm and they posted 9:30pm in their hotel. How do you not know this information for such an important event? If your hotel was new and you were new in the business, that's one thing. We spoke with a few folks from the hotel when we were all stranded waiting for the bus (2 hours) and some of them were angry that they missed the fireworks because of this mislead information.You basically get dropped off at the ""Hyatt Hotel"" and get picked up at the same location. It takes about 20 minutes (one way without traffic) each round.My husband, son, and I were lucky that we headed out early to explore Savannah and asked a local man when the fireworks was supposed to start so we made it on time. It was spectacular and worth watching! I highly recommend Savannah for vacation, just not at this hotel if you can afford a better one. We paid over $100 bucks a night, stayed for 2 nights. Basically, this is NOT a hotel, it's a MOTEL quality. Anthony Melchiorri from ""Hotel Impossible"" should visit this hotel.They posted a shuttle bus schedule, this is where it gets REALLY interesting. They scheduled it hourly and for some reason they didn't service their shuttle around the 10pm session. So you get the shuttle from 6pm to 11pm, EXCEPT the 10pm hour. Does this make sense to you? The fireworks ended around 9:45pm, why would you not pick up your hotel customers at the 10pm hour? Especially, those of us with children? Around 11pm the shuttle came and of course there were 30 of us sitting in front of the Hyatt hotel trying to fit into this 1 mini van that fit about 7 people, LOL. The motel has 2 vans. I'm not upset at the staff who worked at this hotel because they were all working hard and they were very professional with me, when I was pretty tired and pissed off by the time we got back to the hotel, which was 12:30am (I'll tell you more later how we managed to get home). The manager might as well put robots behind the counter because NOBODY could call the shots since NOT a single manager or ASSISTANT manager was on duty during the 4th of July weekend?! REALLY?! How the hell do you run a business without a ""boss?"" The manager wasn't available ALL weekend (one of the busiest time of the year) or intelligent enough to appoint an assistant manager to take care of customer concerns, because the lady behind the desk insisted that there was NOTHING she could do.Clearly, a second shuttle bus was needed to be sent out, but NOBODY was ""high enough rank"" to call the shots on that. Umm...really? It's a no brainer you know which events are the busiest time of the year where you locate your business and don't you want to make a profit for your business?! That's fine, you need to manage your motel better and hire people that can actually take care of things and problem solve. If your staff can't do it, then do it yourself.How did we manage to get home? My husband, 4 years old son, and I were sitting on the curb right outside of Hyatt. It was 11:45pm and my son was getting tired and sleeping on me. A lovely gentleman ran over and goes, ""Hey, would your family like to share a cab with my wife and I? We'll pay for it. You have a kid, he should be in bed, come with us. We would like to help."" Talk about the kindness of strangers...amazing! I felt really bad when I found out that they were on their honeymoon and this was the lame shuttle service they got on their honeymoon! I should have gotten their motel number and send them a basket of goodies. I probably will never see them again, but I wanted to make sure that my story was told and to let the MANAGER KNOW (I'm being respectful by not calling your name out, MANAGER), please take care of your staff and don't set them up for failure. If you had inform them properly on how to take care of things on a busy weekend because I'm sure this wasn't your first 4th of July, then things would have been less stressful for everyone. From a leader to a leader and from the bottom of my heart, ""take care of your people and your people will take care of you."" Without our staff, crew, or employees that work under us, our leadership means nothing if we can't guide them properly to achieve success or in your case, great customer service. No hard feelings, good luck to your business. To the amazing strangers that I met from this trip, you were the best part about this experience. Thanks again for your kindness.I had a great time at this hotel. We flew in from San Francisco and spent Halloween (and the following week) in Savannah. It's like, 3 miles from town. Maybe a 8 min shuttle ride at tops depending on traffic. Even if you take a cab into town it's only like, $12 at tops. Not bad at all. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We had a room with one king size bed and everything was perfect. They also can pick you up and drop you off at the airport for free. Just make sure to call ahead and schedule it/ let them know at the desk. We will be back!Not a fancy place, but clean with a comfortable bed, new linens, and friendly staff. We had a complaint when we checked in (the bath tub wasn't properly cleaned), but when I alerted the front desk staff to the issue, someone was cleaning it within 2 minutes, and apologized for the oversight. We left a note for housekeeping the next day asking for extra towels and coffee and they were both provided for us.  The room appeared recently renovated, stone countertops and a tile tub surround, dual flush toilet in the bath. The outdoor hot tub was down while we were there which was a disappointment, but the pool was up and running with a fun little waterfall faucet that looked new.  The neighborhood is industrial, but feels safe. Overall a pretty good stay for the price.Hotel was about 2 miles from the city center and there was a free van ride over that could be arranged (although we didn't use it).  Beds were nice, bathroom was good.  The pool was closed for renovations so not sure how that was.  Area around the hotel was industrial, but the price was good for being so close to the city center.Hey all your Girl Scout Troops planning your troop trip to Savannah! This hotel is perfect for troops (families too).  The staff is VERY nice &amp; accomadating to large groups, the rooms are nice, breakfast was good (something for everyone).  And you cannot beat the price of the rooms!  It is about 10 minutes from the Historic District, but well worth it.$98 ($110 w/ tax) for 1 night around Columbus Day. located outside of town in more industrial / strip mall area, but short drive to historic savannah, plus a shuttle. The condition of the hotel was disappointing, there was a smell in the a hallway that could turn your stomach, blood on the curtains, and the smoke alarm in the room was literally laying in pieces (battery, plastic cover, wires sticking out of the wall). don't sleep in either, the free breakfast is from 6-9am -- pretty stingy hours for families or folks on vacation. surprisingly bad for a chain hotel -- price can be reasonable, but definitely look harder if you want value.Just stayed in this hotel for 3 nights this past week for our trip to Savannah.  While my husband and I were initially ~spooked~ by the grisly seeming looking location, the hotel itself is wonderful!!  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and our stay was quite enjoyable.  As others have mentioned below, the hotel is very close to downtown Savannah and the free shuttle makes it easy to get down there and back without worrying about parking (or who's gonna be the DD!)  The breakfast was just your average free breakfast and the hours were restrictive (6-9) but it was good and made for a good start for the day.  Also the free cookies are 6pm are a fabulous touch!  All in all, this is a great hotel for the price (we paid less than $75 a night on Expedia) and you will be pleasantly surprised!! :)We recently stayed at Baymont Inn and Suites and we thought we were getting a great deal! We booked our room a week in a half in advance. It was for $70 a night. We got a confirmation sent from the hotel that the reservation was made. We decided to come in a day early so we booked that one night on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for $60. The first night was great and that is where it ended! The next day we went to explore Savannah and when we returned our room key was deactivated. We went to the front desk to find out that our reservation that was booked a week and a half earlier was canceled by the front desk staff. We then found out that they rebooked our reservation for $20 more for each night. We were told by the front desk staff that they could not do anything about it and we would have to wait to talk to Suneel, the manager. They did not tell us a definite time he would come in, sometime in the morning. Well, they charged us double the original rate at this point because they didn't know what they were doing! Then we had to interrupt our breakfast and our visit to Savannah to stay on the phone with Suneel to fix the problem. We explained that we needed a refund for the amount charged and after having to basically demand the refund from Suneel, he CHARGED US AGAIN!!! Now at this point we were charged $300 for a two night stay! We chose Baymont because of the great price! Suneel was horrible. He at one point told us to come back to the hotel and get our bags to leave his hotel! I couldn't believe it and please realize we were by no means being rude, irate, angry, or anything toward him. We jut wanted our money back. We checked out Sunday and the issue is still NOT resolved! We will NEVER stay here again and will NEVER recommend any one of our friends to stay here. It is not worth the hassle. Honestly, the ONLY problem was our interaction with Suneel. He needs to go back to customer service training. I am appalled at the way we were treated by him.This place was awesome! We stayed here for a wedding downtown, and it was so much cheaper than anything in the city, however, the quality was nothing less.  Yes, it isn't walking distance to downtown Savannah, but there is a free shuttle that runs pretty frequently back and forth, and even a taxi ride is only about $12 bucks.  There is also a free airport shuttle which was very convenient.  The breakfast was way better than any free continental breakfast I have ever seen, complete with fruit, make your own waffles, yogurts, juices, eggs, etc! And this is not to mention the cookies that come straight out of the oven in the evening.  Complete with a computer and printer access, and a nice pool with a great hot tub, you can't go wrong.  Even after we checked out, we were still able to use the facilities for the rest of the day, including the shuttles, and last but not least, the staff was great, ESP BIG MIKE!!!! :)Very pleased with our 2-night stay here this weekend. Hotel was extremely affordable and located about 5 minutes from downtown Savannah. Complimentary continental breakfast and shuttle to the downtown area were nice touches. The room itself was very spacious (though the bathroom was a bit tiny) and featured a 40"" Panasonic flat screen, very comfortable king size bed, and small kitchenette with microwave, fridge, and coffee maker. 15 minutes after checking in the front desk even called up to our room to make sure everything was acceptable. The entire staff, especially the maintenance guy/shuttle driver was super friendly and made us feel welcome. I would definitely consider staying here again when visiting Savannah.This hotel is only a mile or so from downtown and it's much cheaper than anything closer. It's clean and they're very nice and helpful. They've got the usual free breakfast and pool and all that jazz. If you don't want to blow a stupid amount of money on a room you won't be in for more than sleeing then I definitely recommend this hotel.My family stayed at this hotel during our recent visit to Savannah.  The hotel is very good for the money.  The staff was very pleasant, our rooms were cleaned very well and overall we were happy with it.  Downtown was about three miles from the hotel and very easy to get to with the shuttle the hotel provides.Check in was quick and easy, but as soon as we got in the Hotel staff tried to sell us a tour of the City.  I later found out that the company from the tour company places employees as hotel staff to push their tours.  I thought it was a little cheese, but I did not buy the tour anyways.  There were cookies when we got in but I think these were also planted by the tour company.The hotel was good, clean, well priced, and close driving distance to most of Savannah.  There are no close restaurants in the area but driving to the city for dinner was fine, as parking really had no issues as it's free parking after 5pm on the place we parked.The continental breakfast is a bonus as we traveled with 6 people comes out to be a savings of 30 dollars a day.  Nice touch on the tv's that they were all flat screens.  My two young kids under the age of 10 really enjoyed the pool.The cons: The A/C unit seemed a little noisy, but since you sleep so well after being so tired is really not an issue.  The beds are pillow top so if you really like soft beds you would be in heaven, I hate them bad on my back.Great location and price.  Room was clean and up to date.  Breakfast was okay, mostly carbs, so be prepared.  Love the availability of the free shuttle to downtown.","The front desk receptionist was terrible. Everything was fine until I mentioned that i had a dog with me, and was told there was a $60 additional fee, not the $25 that was stated online. The room was actually pretty nice, until my mom found a cockroach in the bathroom. She thoughtlessly killed and flushed it down the toilet before I could show it to the front desk. I told the same receptionist who really couldn't care less, much less apologize. It seemed like she didn't believe me, I'm sure a lot of ***holes make up that complaint to get a discount but I am fully aware that my stay is non-refundable.  She just responded nonchalantly, ""oh, thanks for letting me know"".  The hotel is pretty close to downtown Savannah, but the area is sort of industrial and ghetto. I booked the place because I thought it was cheaper than staying downtown, but since it ended up not being any cheaper, in hindsight I should've just booked a nicer hotel downtown.My daughter's Girl Scout troop stayed here during their recent trip to Savannah.  Accomodations were great.  Rooms were clean, building is well maintained, pool was clean, and each room had refrigerator and microwave.  The evening maintenance man (Kent) was a wealth of information.  He advised us on where to park in Savannah and when parking fees were charged, what to see (St. John Baptist Cathedral was not on our list of to-dos but on his advice, we squeezed it in and were in total awe), where to eat, and multitudes of other tidbits of information.  We would stay at this hotel again.",,,,"['let', 'desolate', 'area', 'fool', 'place', 'decent', 'enough', 'visiting', 'room', 'comfortable', 'king', 'sized', 'bed', 'huge', 'flat', 'screen',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Hilton Garden Inn Savannah Historic District,4.0,$$,51,"Family road trip and this is our 2 Hilton garden inn we stay at! Gotta say it was very clean and the staff was great! Our concierge Ed recommended the best tours with old Savannah tours! And I also yelped them it was great! The hotel was clean and I should of Taken a picture of the water fountain Omg! It glistened I've never seen such a shiny water fountain! 5 stars plus!The breakfast was great it's buffet style and the best part was the French toast! Wow!Location: It can't be beat. It's in the heart of Savannah's historic district and is walkable to everywhere. If you don't want to walk, you can Uber for 5 bucks. Amenities: The gym and pool area are great! The gym had treadmills, elliptical, stationary bikes, free weights, and medicine balls. Everything is in newer condition and clean. The pool goes to 9 feet deep and has ample seating and views.Breakfast: Wow. This breakfast buffet (that comes with your room) has everything. Scrambled eggs, omelette bar, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, biscuits n' gravy (THE BEST OF MY LIFE), fresh fruit, cheeses, smoked salmon, pastries, bagels, croissants, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, assorted juices....am I missing anything? Probably. Room: I had to take into account that this is an older hotel. A lot of fixtures are old and rusted. The shower curtain definitely needed to be changed to a new one. The beds weren't made with a fitted sheet but a bed sheet, a comforter, then another bed sheet. We had a leaky toilet the second day we were there but it was fixed within 5 minutes of us calling downstairs. I would have given this hotel 5 stars if they did some updated renovations to the room.Don't use the valet parking at this hotel. They do not know how to park and will damage your vehicle.  Then they do not have good lighting to check out the damage when they bring you the vehicle back. So if you want your vehicle damaged and them tell you it's not your problem, then use this hotel it's for you.  Already informed my company to not book anyone else into this hotel or any of their other Hilton hotels . Most of the valet drivers looked to be 18 to 22 years old. Would you trust someone that age with a very nice vehicle much less a clunker .The staff at this hotel are incredible accommodating and courteous. The hotel location is fantastic for all things touristy!!  Breakfast is ok, but service is better. My only complaints are that the rooms and linens and starting to show some wear and rooms facing the street are excessively noisy.We really enjoyed our stay at Hilton Garden Inn while in Savannah. There is a $25 per day parking charge if you have a car, which is just an extra expense to add to the room, but it is valet which was great. All of the valet's were very nice and speedy- and did a great job as well on crazy days with lots of check in and check out. The staff at check in and check out were great- very friendly and helpful. They also have a concierge- but we did not need to use her while in town as we had our plans ready- but we did see several other people using their services and they seemed pleased.Our room was very clean and in a good state when we arrived, and the cleaning service was excellent throughout our time there. This location is great- right by the city market- which has lots of shops and food available- and is a short walk to many other destinations in Savannah. We actually only needed our car once and that was because we were running late. I would definitely stay at this hotel again as the staff, services, and rooms were great.We had a room on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the river. If you ignored the cheap hotel across the street, it was a great view. Room was nice, relatively updated. Did not enjoy housekeeping trying to enter twice on a day I was checking out. Great location, able to walk almost anywhere. Friendly staff.Great atmosphere in the lobby area. The desk staff was helpful. The bathroom was stocked with lotions, shampoo, mouthwash, and make-up remover wipes. The view was not much to look at. The shower was well-pressured and I enjoyed the hot shower.4 stars for quiet rooms and location... I walked every where I visited in savannah when I stayed here.  Minus a star for expensive breakfast and lack of charging options in the room.I have a track record of not picking the best of hotels during our travels mostly due to trying to save a buck or two.  I don't look for the barely in business dumps but I do stray away from places that push toward having too many dollar signs (call me cheap but I don't want to drop two bills for a room that I don't plan to do anything in other than sleep).Being that the hotel was located in the Historic District, we couldn't be happier to be close to all the action, restaurants and sights we wanted to see in this area... plus most of it was walking distance. Parking is ""mandatory valet"" service which is $18 per night (NOT per visit)... but you know your car is safe being that the parking garage is beneath the hotel and no one can just freely walk around in there.  I should know, I went into the garage to fetch something from the car and one of the valets asked what I was doing in the garage in a mater of minutes.The lobby of the hotel was lovely and had plenty of chairs, tables, couches plus a dining area and a concierge... and SUPER FRIENDLY... and I mean everyone (front desk staff, valets, maids, everyone) always ended every single encounter with ""Have a nice stay"" OR ""Hope you're enjoying your time here"".I thought it was interesting that they had no vending machines;  instead they opted to offer guests access to their mini-market located beside the front desk (behind a wall so guests don't have to see it.  Nice when you want something more than a cold soda or water.And our room was as impressive too... clean, comfortable and a balcony to view the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, the Savannah River and the gorgeous Savannah City Hall (the golden dome).If I was forced to make a complaint I could only think of two.  (1) the pillows were full sized but sink to nothing when you place your head on them.  And (2) my balcony view also included a view of the dumpy Quality Inn across the street (but I forced my eyes on other focal points).Speaking of the Quality Inn (a chain that surprisingly does offer decent locations around country)...   that hotel wanted $25 more dollars each night....  they may include a continental breakfast but it's the old-style hotel (room doors exposed to outside balcony walks, just two floors and no elevators).  I'll save the money, give up breakfast and stay in this classy hotel any day over the Q.Great bang for the buck and surprisingly cheaper than I expected.  Inside and out, the hotel is impressive.  This Savannah hotel was my saving grace... making up for a real doozy I chose in St Augustine Florida and another poor choice I made in Charleston SC.Saw reviews about bad customer service.  Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  Location is great.  Room with a balcony.  Not easy to get in Savannah.  Only downfall was room was a tad outdated,  but very clean.  Yay housekeeping!They were extremely accommodating and friendly. Cleanliness was great and all the little details were in place (coffee and fresh fruit always available, helpful concierge and valet, fast wifi, clean fitness room and pool) that made our stay that much more comfortable. We were staying at the ""thrifty"" choice in the historic district and ended up switching to here after one night. With prices almost the same, the quality here is especially that much more pleasantly surprising.Staff is four stars. Room cleanliness, same. Great, very clean fitness center. Good breakfast. ($15 for complete breakfast.)Why not give it four stars overall? NOISY. Very, very noisy. Even getting a City Market-side room, it was noisy. We could hear the kids in the room above getting up early and playing, and every person walking down the hall. Thin walls. Oh, and the leaf blower at 5AM. Ouch.The hotel is clean and well located, within walking distance of Market street. The lobby looks old and tired. The small bar is not inviting.  My biggest turn off was the $25 charge for parking at check in. The hotel across the street had free parking and this was not a busy weekend or seasons.  Plus it is Savannah, not Chicago or Miami or LA, where I've paid $25 for parking.  The room was large, clean and with a nice view of the river.  The shower had very little water pressure and the water wasn't hot enough. I'm a Gold Hilton Honors member and was a but disappointed by this hotel.Great value for the price. Courteous efficient check in, and free wifi and bottled water for Hilton Honors members. Rooms are updated and clean. Keurig coffee makers, microwave and fridge in the room!  Breakfast buffet with eggs to order in the morning. Best grits and perfect eggs Benedict. I've never had such friendly service at a hotel breakfast. This staff is top notch. Wish I could have gotten names...I would have sent a note to Hilton corporate !My favorite hotel in downtown Historic Savannah.STAY HERE!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Great place!!!! The place was clean and the staff was friendly!! It's in a perfect location! Quick and easy walk to all the hot spots!! We will definitely stay at this place again when we come back!!I am a  Hilton Diamond member and I was not pleased. The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because of Trina - the concierge. She recommended a good tour for us to take.  She was about the only one that was helpful at this hotel. Seriously!The front desk was less than par. The one girl when we checked in was quite rude. We didn't even get our room cleaned the first night. This hotel needs some major upgrades.  The outdoor pool is gross and the hot tub had hair floating in it!Ok - now thinking about it I recant my 3 stars and must provide a 2 star. This breaks my heart to do so since I'm such a loyal member of Hilton Honors. Next time we will definitely choose another hotel other than Hilton. Sadly.The location was good, but that was about it. Service needs major improving!!I would choose this HGI again.Pluses:  convenient location near the river in Old Savannah, clean rooms with comfortable Hilton beds, happy hour 7-9 pm with discounted drinks provided you choose well drinks, outdoor pool, underground parking, tasty made-to-order breakfast with healthy options such a sliced grapefruit, balcony rooms with river view on the West side, and friendly staff.Minuses: Even after asking, no self parking at $18 per day, no draft beer, and no discounted drinks during happy hour except for well drinks.Tip:  Choose the rooms on the West side for both River View and Balconies.If you think this review with photos is useful, funny or cool, I'd appreciate ur feedback by clicking below.Not what I've come to expect from a Garden. Room furniture showed significant wear. Grout in bathroom was grayed from dirt and traffic. Tub drain/stopper was rusted. Tub grout cracked and needs repair. There was hair on the bathroom floor that was not mine (when I noticed we'd already unpacked and were getting in the shower at the end of a very long day). Bed and pillows were very comfortable. Traffic outside was very, very loud until 3a (windows and curtains closed, we even used a sound machine on full volume). The location is convenient, but at an expensive price and loud/interrupted night of sleep. I would not stay here again, but instead would consider a midtown hotel that is quieter, less expensive, and still located very near the historical sites.We enjoyed our 2 day stay. This is in the heart of the historic district. Everything is convenient and most within walking distance. The consigliere will give you a map of the historic district and help you plan events.The breakfast is hearty. You can order omelets, French Toast and a few other things or eat off the buffet. Of course, there is grits and biscuits to accompany your meal. The servers are polite and helpful too! There is free Wi-fi service in the entire place after you login. Yelper's gave us plenty of places to eat within walking distance.  For lunch walk to Papillote, a French place. Also try Rancho Alegre. We drove to Rancho Alegre, about .7 miles away, for dinner. At Savannah Bee Company, we had the free honey tastings and bought some for ourselves and a few gifts. That was fun and different!In addition to the basic room price add valet parking ($18 daily), Occupancy Tax, State Tax and Downtown Lodging Fee ($1.00 daily).I'm sure this would normally be a great hotel, but this was definitely the worst hotel experience I've ever had. Upon check in, we walked into our room and it was still being cleaned. Mind you, we checked in at 9:30pm. Also, there was no hot water in our shower, our key card kept malfunctioning, and the front desk staff was very rude and unprofessional. Our neighboring rooms sounded like they were filming a porno. I emailed Hilton directly and it took them two weeks to respond (I got a confirmation email saying I should expect a response no longer than 48 hours). The response was that they forwarded the email to the property manager and that I should have to wait another 48 hours for a response. It is approaching three weeks and still no response. Hilton Garden Inn policy is: if you are not satisfied, you don't pay. I am filing a dispute with AMEX today. Don't stay here, there are plenty, cheaper options downtown in Savannah.","I was not impressed by the Hilton Garden Inn.  Upon arrival, I learned that this hotel does not provide inclusive parking, but charges $25 to valet the car! After ex pressing our reluctance to pay such a heavy price EVERY time we come and go from the hotel, the parking attendant offered to park our car for $10 ""under the carpet."" Completely shady!  When dealing with the front desk, the staff was monotone and bored, offering little greeting and absolutely no enthusiasm!  I definitely would not recommend this hotel. Although centrally located in the historic district, choose a hotel without such hidden fees and poor customer service.The rooms are just ok but here are the pluses: great polite service, super comfy bed, nice amenities (neutrogena), and the best darn hotel breakfast I've ever had.Easily 4+ stars!  During a recent trip to SCAD, we roomed here and thoroughly enjoyed this location in the heart of the historic downtown district.  Everything we needed, except a convenient drug store, was within walking distance of the hotel. SCAD, numerous restaurants, the river front area, retail shops, coffee shops, desserts, ice cream - all easily walkable!  The hotel is extremely quiet, even with the music and late night activities wafting up from the streets below.  For me, the beds are comfortable - my back did not start aching the following day which is often the case.  The rooms are extremely well maintained and the valet service is outstanding!  The gentleman who greeted us on  arrival was spot on - helping unload our bags, park the car and then he wheel our travelings to our room - nice surprise.  I must also compliment the front desk staff for going above the call of duty with directions, recommendations and solutions for not having a drug store nearby.  I guess I'm spoiled by having 24/7 Walgreens on what seems like every corner in the larger cities.  The hotel's buffet breakfast was reasonable given the location and quite tasty!  This included a hot made-to-order buffet along with cold items such as fruit, cereals and baked goods.  You could also order a custom omelet and other items.  It was so refreshing to see a hot breakfast available as many hotels have gone to all cold and DIY waffles - but not here!  The waiter service was first class, engaging, helpful and attentive. Overall, a very positive experience.We were super happy with our stay here. The hotel is located right near the river area on Bay street, we were pretty much close to everything that we wanted to see. The girls at the front counter were courteous and helpful both during check in and check out, the valet guy hooked us up with a cab to the airport, even switched the times for us without it being a hassle. The room was clean, up to date, had great views of the city, and comfy beds. We didn't use the fitness center or the pool but you can see them in the views from our room. My husband booked this through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> I think so prob got a better price but we couldn't cancel, which was fine because we didn't need to. We had a good night's stay here, def recommend to anyone looking for a hotey in the area.I loved staying here on my recent trip to Savannah for my sister's bachelorette party. This hotel was clean, quiet, and convenient to everything we wanted to see and do in historic downtown Savannah. Everything about the reservation process and our stay went smoothly and without any random hitches. They were extremely accomodating and allowed one of us to check in early ahead of the rest of the group so she could decorate the rooms for my sister's bach party. Even though I thought they were little expensive our stay was well worth the cost. The beds were comfortable and the view from the 4th floor was beautiful! I recommend this hotel to anyone who asks me about our trip to Savannah. The concierge service at this hotel is also extremely helpful and the $12.95 breakfast is AMAZING and worth every penny.I also really liked how they had a little table set up in the main lobby that was constantly stocked with water, tea, and coffee. It was so convenient to be able to grab a drink whenever we happened to be passing through!Five stars here! Without a doubt one of the nicest, cleanest and quiet hotels we have ever stayed out.Located in the historic district of Savannah, you are within walking distance of many shops and restaurants; the breakfast buffet was pretty good, and the coffee is great.The only draw back would be no external sink, only one in the bathroom.A great room, I would definitely recommend it!Money was stolen. I stayed at the hotel during Memorial Day weekend. It was my first time in Savannah and Ive been working hard to finally afford Hilton hotels for my recent trips. I had high expectations of the hotel and the city given the great reviews. I wasn't disappointed with the city or the hotel until I forgot my mother's wallet there due to a misunderstanding. When I got home, I called and asked the hotel employee to look for the wallet and sure enough it was found where we left it in the room. The room was already cleaned at that time and had no new occupants since we left. The hotel employee mailed the wallet to us within 2 days as promised. However, a large amount of cash was gone except about $10. Good thing the cash was enough for the thief to spare the $500 LV wallet. I took my 57 yr old mother on this trip because she works too hard and never gets to go anywhere. She loves the hotel and Savannah so much that she was already recruiting family for the next trip. Instead of making her happy she is now very sad because her hard earned money is gone. It's not easy for a first generation immigrant to make money. We are very disappointed in that hotel employee that we want everyone to beware of their belongings when staying. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay there. Great location, great smiles at the front desk, and helpful valet staff. $25 parking fee seems to be the norm for hotels there so I'm not going to complain about that. I'm just asking the manager to at least investigate and get rid of that employee. That person shouldn't be in the hotel business not to mention the reputable Hilton family.I'm not entirely sure how I ended up staying here.  I'm usually more of a Hampton Inn girl, but I guess that it was already booked when I reserved my room for the weekend of the Savannah Rock and Roll Half Marathon.  I know that I picked it for the location.  You simply can't get a better spot in the city, particularly in terms of night life - just a block off river street and a block from City Market.  Unfortunately, some of the noise from city market did hit against the beautiful picture windows of our 6th floor room, but I was so exhausted that I didn't mind too much.  And it ended by 11pmish I believe.The rooms are pretty nice, particularly with those windows.  The bathroom door is awkwardly close to the room door, particularly if your sleeping companions leave the bathroom door open when you leave the room.  But there is a mini fridge and microwave, so that's nice.  It's not really set up for working, without easy plugs at the desk, but then again, who expects to get much work done when they're staying on Bay Street?Parking is valet, which is worth it since parking in downtown Savannah is no picnic. The breakfast is decent, though not as good as some other HGI's that I've been to.  Also, there are happy hour specials at the bar, but I didn't get a chance to partake.  Since I was there for the race, I didn't need to bother with the fitness center, which I believe is on the 2nd floor.  Only half the employees were helpful, but that fits for a location that's so popular that it doesn't have to rely on excellent staff.I'd go back, but I think I'd try to get a room at the Inn at Ellis Square or the Hampton first.#Yelp365 - 318/365My mom and I stayed here for four days and three nights - it was a great experience! It was quiet, clean, and convenient! It had a laid-back, light airy environment. The location was great, a street away from the river front walk, and a street away from the action on the other side. The beds were made every day while we were there; they were comfortable and clean. The bathrooms were a good size. We didn't use the pool but went and checked it out, it was a nice private little pool on a second floor outdoor balcony/courtyard with a hot tub and a few dozen sun chairs to lay out on. I wish we had an extra day to relax and lay out there! I would definitely come again! The staff was happy, polite and helpful; the valets were quick and nice. Thanks Hilton Gardens, we had a great trip.Definitely 5 stars, everything was perfect. I was in Savannah for a conference, and the staff was phenomenal. We never had to wait long for a shuttle to take us to the convention center. And when we wanted to shop at a mall, they helped us call a taxi. When we needed an extra blanket, or towels, or lotion, it was instantly brought up to our rooms within 5 minutes.There was free wi-fi, free printing, and there was always coffee and tea available downstairs. Around noon, they had lemonade, and cookies! And it's location is perfect! right across from it, is a little square with small shops and restaurants. The riverfront is also pretty close. My stay in Savannah was too short, hope to be back someday, and when I do, I know where I'll be staying ;).Right on the river, walkable to any location in the historic district, with convenient valet parking. My queen bed room had a nice armchair and ottoman, also a kuerig coffemaker and a mini fridge which is always appreciated when travelling.  Three big fluffy white towels that while not supersoft were also several levels above the sandpaper towels in many basic hotels. Staff were friendly and incredibly responsive.Great location and good price. Very clean and staff is friendly. They have a concierge if you need one and they also offer free coffee in the mornings. I would stay here again.Out of all of the holiday inns I have stayed at, the staff here, including the valet has been the most helpful and pleasantVery nice hotel in a great location for tourists. I'm here for business and found the hotel clean, friendly, and efficient.  I would stay again for sure. Very close to river street and the city market.The really great part of our stay at this establishment was that the hotel let us check in when our train rolled into town at about 8am. But alas and alack.. it all went down hill from there. Mom and I were on our second annual Amtrak Vacation, and this hotel was one of our options. Yes, they offer an ""accessible"" room, but the layout is inconvenient, i.e. no towel racks near the sink AND the crappiest hotel shower in one of the darkest bathrooms we've ever seen. The front desk staff literally will not give out any advice, not even the nearest coffee!, without turfing you to the ""concierge"". The concierge is paid by Old Savannah Tours, so guess whose tickets they sell ya? Even when one of you is in a wheelchair and those shuttles and trolleys ain't accessible, and neither is the Tour company. At all. (Go with Savannah Dan's walking tours, seriously, he's the bomb). Kid you not, a random (but totally awesome) stranger in a wheelchair rolled up to us in one of Savannah's beautiful squares and handed Mom a guide to accessible Savannah, but not our concierge. And really, bartender? You couldn't remember me from one night to the next when you average around 3 customers per night? And Mom and I get plastic cups, not glass like the men at the bar? Dude, you might like your job better if you tried harder. As for the hotel restaurant, please do yourself a favor and skip the all-you-can-eat buffets. Yick.I am at a loss to explain why this hotel is included in Amtrak's vacations when they don't seem particularly interested in the tourism industry.In other words, it's a totally serviceable hotel in a convenient location with some service-oriented work to do. If it weren't for Emmit and the bellhops (thanks for all your help, guys), we would have been unhappy!This hotel is a great deal if you want a clean, nice room with a comfortable bed, you want to be close to pretty much what Savannah has to offer and enjoy having a hot shower right when you want it.  I am not a fan of paying to park though and that is why I did not give this place a 5 star review - well that and the fact that they charge $10 for a breakfast buffet that you can get for free at pretty much any Comfort Suites/Ramada/Best Western, etc.  However, we did enjoy our 2 night stay here and would definitely stay again if we are ever in Savannah again!Very close to historic amenities. However, since you can walk everywhere safely in this city, one doesn't need to be in this noisy, busy area of town. Over priced restaurants are allllll around here. Good food, but really???  Best bet is to stay in central city and enjoy the quiet parks/amenities and then set out for your day. Hotel check-in and mgmt. staff liked to pass the buck when glitch occurred in our reservation. Beware of internet reservations and having anything changed once you arrive, whether your fault or their's. ""I'm sorry"" was heard often but not sincerely. Problem resolution came hours later, after going over someone's head to go over someone else's head to only have to go over their's. Had to keep a reminder of looking at credit card statement verifying we would not be double charged.  We weren't.Valet is $20 day which is not what is stated on web site.This is in a great location and is reasonably priced. The hotel is very clean and the staff is beyond helpful. We had a balcony room overlooking the pool area. We had no complaints about noise, but then again, we weren't in the room that much. It is Savannah, after all. They also give you lots of fluffy pillows. Too fluffy. I had a crick in my neck for two days.Affordable. Clean. Friendly staff. Pool and hot tub. Convenient downtown location. No problems at all. Valet parking is stupid but it's hard to avoid when staying downtown. I will definitely be back!Do Not Stay!  They tried to charge us for things we never even got, then got mad about it when I brought it up.  Place is dirty and smells.  The front desk help is lazy and cares less about customer service.. Especially Mariah! She's a real c---!","For a last minute deal we got a great price with a water front view and a great staff that made you feel like you were home. I definitely would stay here again when I go back to visit bc you are right in the historic district where everything is.This place has a great location for a weekend in Savannah.  It's easy walking distance to River Street, City Market, and the best of Savannah's Historic District.Some HGIs are a bit hit or miss, but this was a hit.  The rooms came with a mini fridge and microwave, if no minibar.  Everything was very clean, and the staff was great about splitting the charges.  The little pantry store had emergency provisions.  (Yes on wine, no on sewing kit.  But they also sold individual CD-ROMs with cases, instead of a bundle of 100 that I don't need.)Great hotel for a great price! Downtown Savannah, within walking distance of most of Savannah's must-sees. Our room was the Bay Street side, so we were worried we might not be able to sleep well with the traffic, but we had no issues with the noise. Always enjoy staying at Hilton Garden Inns.This was a relatively pleasant stay but I'm also extremely easy to please. I don't complain about a whole lot. The valet, Armonde, was probably the most friendly part of the experience. We did, unfortunately, encounter a rather rude and attitude-filled front desk attendant but she did redeem herself later on when she seemed to be in a better mood. It was also somehwhat awkward that we could clearly hear the TV in the room next to us, that made it kind of difficult to sleep. All in all it was a nice hotel.What a lovely stay! The staff at the Hilton go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. The facility itself is stunning - with a lovely 2nd floor outdoor pool and hot tub, workout facility, and restaurant. The hotel is located in the heart of the historical district and only blocks away from the riverfront, city market, and Paula Deen's Lady and Son's restaurant. I would recommend this hotel with enthusiasm!    * Liked -- Great customer service, clean and classy facility, great accommodations.    * Disliked -- A bit pricy ($100+), but well worth it.The staff at this hotel is very good and friendly and makes up for some things beyond their control.  This was my first trip to Savannah.  Our room the first night was on the Bay St side of the hotel (front).  At night the noise was no problem, but early in the morning, like 7:00 on your vacation, semis and motor cycles started driving by and can CLEARLY be heard in your room.  I spoke to the general manager at the front desk and he moved us to a different room that was much better.  The breakfast each morning was very good and plentiful again with excellent service.City Market is right behind the hotel and the river shops are just across the street.  Make sure to give yourself extra time with the valet service as it always seemed to be backed up.Overall our stay here was good and enjoyable.Very nice hotel located in the heart of Savannah, very convenient to just about everything.  My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and we were very pleased.  The staff at the front desk is very friendly and accommodating.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again in the future.Excellent location in downtown Savannah. Clean and excellent service.Easily the worst wallpaper I've ever encountered.  The pale green stuff in the hallways looks psychedelic under the fluorescent lights.  The bathrooms have clearly been upgraded with granite counters that look just awful next to the overly patterned cream and coral wallpaper.Clean, affordable, centrally located, it has AC, the staff has been generically friendly (must be their ""can do"" training), it's good enough.  I'm just wishing room service ran past 11 now that I'm realizing it's 11:04 pm, and not 8:04 pm.  Drat.  (*next night update: tonight I come to find out it actually closes at 10.  Maybe I was still foggy from the cross country flight the day before, but I could've sworn she said 11.  Either way - super disappointing.)  And I may not have a mini bar (boo, I want an overpriced half bottle of crappy red wine), but I can change the firmness of my bed!  It's not a sleep number, but I have a little dial I can mess with and you can believe that I'll be screwing with it for at least 10 minutes before the novelty wears off.I'm really enjoying the episode of South Park my neighbor is watching.  Sounds exciting!  Also, I have no idea how close I am to the kitchen up here on the 5th floor, but the smell of breakfast woke me up.  Mmmmm.*day three update: a phone call requesting a fork was met with, ""I'm on my lunch right here, I'll have to see if I can find someone to bring it up.""  Suggestion: maybe you guys should keep a set or two of cutlery in the room if you're going to offer microwave meals in the lobby and have microwaves in the room.  Did I ever get that fork?  What do you think?Great location... Stay here to be close to everything Savannah, GA has to offer. Check in was super easy and the staff is very accommodating. Even though there was a large party staying the weekend, they upgraded us to a balcony room. After day one, the upgrades just kept coming... We went to breakfast at Goose Feathers and strolled around Savannah for about 2 hours only to come back to the hotel to find that all of our stuff had been moved to a 2 room suite with a balcony. The service in this place is by far the best I have ever experienced at any hotel. Could not ask for better. You can literally walk to everything in the historic district. The only thing that could be a little less expensive would be the $15 a day to park, being that the historic district is just outside and you can walk to everything, the car is useless unless, though still less expensive than flying here from Orlando. If every we decide to come back to Savannah, we will be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn again.Great location clean comfortable hotel super staff definitely the place to stay in Historic

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-savannah-midtown-savannah,La Quinta Inn Savannah Midtown,2.5,$$,31,"I stay almost exclusively at LaQuinta Inns. This property is middle of the road. I am an Elite Rewards member so I am not sure if the quality of the room was better than others. I am not sure about the price as I used my points to stay here. I have stayed at nicer LQ's for lesser points thiough.The room: It was clean, sheets smelled clean and fresh, the bathroom was clean with no hairs or other signs of uncleanliness. Shower was hot and the sink was clean too. The toilet area was a bit small to sit down in as you have about 6 inches from the door and 6 inches from the tub. Plenty of toilet paper, soaps, shampoos and towels. The lighting in the room was ok. The switch adjacent to the exterior door did not work and bathroom/shower area light was not bright.The TV's settings were a little dark which you could adjust and the volume was limited to 25%. So I really did not enjoy the TV. The room itself was spacious enough for the 3 of us.The parking: The parking is not very plentiful. I had to drive around a lot to find a spot for my GMC Acadia to fit in. Although the spaces are very narrow and even though if you could park square in between the lines, it is difficult to even open your door wide enough for you to get in and out of your car. What this a chore though was that people do not park square in their spaces. Compact cars do not have much of an issue but if your vehicle is any larger than that, good luck on finding enough room for your car. Door dings will be common here.The front desk and breakfast: The front desk was great, friendly and accommodating as always at LaQuinta Inns. Check-in took me 30 seconds. Breakfast was good but the breakfast area is too compact. They need to enlarge it for the amount of rooms at this property. Too many people in too small of a space. Food was fresh and plentiful It was stocked with waffles, bagels, muffins, fruit, grits, cereal, juice, coffee 5 different teas and 4 different types of bread for toasting. The breakfast attendant made sure things were stocked but her attitude was a little negative but at least she did her job.The pool: The pool was warm and clear. The pool attendant was a little rude and gruff. He could have been a little more polite when we were told that the pool was closed.I stay almost exclusively at LaQunita Inns.Wow...Did LaQuinta franchise to a "" Ghetto Stay""??The lobby is kinda nasty... The carpets and wallsIn the hallways smelled of things I only envisioned in a 1980's David Lynch movie???  When was the last time the wall were painted ?  That wall texture was quite unusual ??  Hmmmm?Best of all it felt like dogs are allowed because theK9 artwork left on our room carpet was a VanGogh unto itself!Pretty sure the Chapel in Rome wasn't painted in dog urine on the carpet? But our compliments to the artist!Finally.... We liked the on location police officer on site to protect and serve .Yuck ... NO A/C either!In the stink o meter it ranks a solid 9.5...We cleaned the roaches out of our ice bucket!The room was filled with doggy smell. My son complained that he couldn't sleep well because of the smell.Other service and facilities, such as breakfast, bed, front staffs and location, are okay, but I will never stay the hotel again.NOT WORTH THE MONEY. At almost $100 a night, this is more of a motel - not hotel. After providing nothing comforting for our stay, we were then kindly woken up at 10A to drilling outside our door for over 45 minutes that we had to call the front desk to beg for them to stop. False advertisement of photos and not worth the money. Spend a little extra, and stay in downtown.This place is amazing! IF you like your bath tub to have black stains in the bottom and rude customer service! For instance our room only came with 3 bath towels and when I called the front desk to ask for more the lovely lady at the front place me in hold to talk to her co worker about her vacation she's going to take to Disney land, after my hold I was told that the lady cleaning the rooms had towels and was ""out there somewhere"" and to go find her myself. After I lengthy search I found her and asked for four towels, one for myself, two for my children and one for my husband so we can dry off after a swim when I asked for the towels she promptly responded with ""why u need fo fo"" I was so impressed with her language skills that I had to walk away. When we got to the pool the outside was nasty dirty towels were laying everywhere, trash, cigarette butts and dirty band aids. The FREE continental breakfast was cold and stale and served on filthy counters. The rooms where however decorated nice, and the beds were comfy. But my first impression ruined this hotel by the lousy customer service. None of the help is nice or friendly and they look miserable doing their jobs which makes me wonder if they're doing their job or just half assing it. WILL NEVER STAY AT ANOTHER LA QUINTA AGAINAlways try to stay at LQ when traveling with pups.  I think they are a great mid level chain that's not trashy but not super pricey. We have had great service so far.  Room was nice and clean.  Small free continental breakfast. My only complaint was a little noisy because door is on outside.  I could hear other guests and outside but it wasn't too bad.  I love that we got package of dog treats at check in :)This place is ghetto, from dirty floors to having to lay a towel in the bathroom tub, because the tub was too dirty to stand barefoot.  Room smelled like mold.  On the positive side the air conditioner worked well and the staff seemed nice.After a long couple of days traveling to Savannah to see my son stationed at Hunter, I was traveling from the west coast. I got to the LA Quinta midtown, I arrived early and I mean early well before 9am on the day of my arrival - they were still serving breakfast. I held out little hope for an early check in request, to my surprise not only did they check me in early - they made me feel welcome and like it was no trouble at all. The desk clerk went out of her way with a smile on her face and was happy to help me. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed very nice and the recliner in my room found me taking a nap in it within about an hour of getting into my room.All in all this place is a bargain compared to most of the places to stay in Savannah. If you want a 5 star hotel and the price that goes with it then stay downtown on the water and you will get that. But if you at looking to stay some place that is in my opinion a bargain -  affordable, clean and safe then this may be your place. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and kind. At the end of my check in, the desk clerk even shook my hand and said ""Thank you for your service sir"" knowing I was a veteran, that extra touch and moment she took made my day even better and a little brighter. They went above and beyond in my book to make a tired old man after a long couple of days feel welcome and appreciated.00034While like many others have stated, this hotel is old and not as nice as the la quintas that many of us are used to staying in. The rooms were kind of gross, but the bed was still a comfortable la Quinta bed. The carpet was badly stained so I tried not to walk around without my shoes. The were plenty of stains throughout the room that I noticed. With that being said, it was a conveniently located, decently priced 2 nights in savannah that allowed us to bring along our dog. House keeping left us pleasant notes and the front desk clerks were so professional, kind, and productive. So where the rooms lacked, the customer service was superb. I believe the gentleman's name was Louis at the front desk. He was able to get people's needs taken care of in a very quick and efficient manner with a genuine smile on his face. Those lasting impressions really matter with us.The floors are so dirty. Our baby was crawling on the floor &amp; when I picked him up he had black all over his legs. It's nice that we could bring our dog &amp; cat, but it's so dirty!I had recently stayed in another La Quinta while visiting Tampa... with ZERO issues, ZERO complaints, ZERO problems, it was CLEAN, the staff were FRIENDLY and the place looked WELL KEPT.Based on that visit I had no reason to expect anything less;  or at a minimum, I had no reason to expect any sort of disaster.Arrival was no issued; easy to find, plenty of parking, walk over to the check-in counter.  The check in clerk issued us a room and with bags in hand we walked over to our first floor room.  It took all of 10 seconds for us to know we were in for a doozy.  Opening the door had this strong mold or mildew smell hit us like a Mack Truck.  OMG, what the hell is that stank?  We didn't even enter the room.My complaint to the check-in clerk was taken in but he sure didn't seemed surprised in the least and to top it off he offered no apology or explanation; just that he would get us into a better room.  The new room was on the second floor.  ""Walking there"" was our next issue.  The stairway is outside and the steps are not concrete;  they were severely rusted metal stairs.  Rusted enough to make us actually concerned of falling through them.  At least the room didn't have that scent of death (although it didn't smell all that sanitary either, kinda like a moisture issue in the building).  We woke in the morning, checked out with a more apologetic counter person and headed out.  We were so turned off by our stay that I immediately got on the phone with the hotel customer service phone number and complained how shocked we were with this location.They issued us a ""FREE FUTURE VISIT"" voucher, which I was in no rush to use... I ended up giving it to a family member since I was so turned off.  I did stay in another La Quinta after this experience and guess what... it turned out to be crappy too (read about it too if you dare)....  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-charleston-riverview-charleston#hrid:iDHLN_TCxDP88QDoHIScQg/src:self"">yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-i...</a>This is the third hotel on my 7 day vacation and the best out of those 3. For the price. It's clean, enough. The bathroom is small and the tub is chipped. Minor mold. But you get what you pay for. The beds are actually comfortable. Pillows could be bigger. The staff is very accommodating. Brought a roll away bed almost immediately upon asking and sent maintenance to fix a drain that was a result of user error. They even called us to check on our room. The breakfast selection was small. Offering little bagels. Muffins and make your own waffles. Would use la Quinta againBooked me in the same room as an extremely sketchy individual. Pulled up with our bags and saw him walk right into our room. Then the checkout lady was much less than pleasant. Overall, dirty, sketchy, disorganized.Totally an example of you get what you pay for. It's great there is a hotel for those traveling with pets, other then that I saw very little perks of this hotel. First off the shower water Temps are awful, it was either super hot or freezing. The AC units never shut off so they run all the time but it's better then hearing it click on and off i guess. The breakfast is nothing to be wowed by, its cereal or waffles and that gets old if you and here an extended period like we were.  O and to top it all off some random person was able to open our door while we were getting ready and half dressed. We then had to take everything we didn't want stolen to the car each day. Front desk gave us new keys but who knows if it was a worker for the hotel because we couldn't chase after him. So not very safe for the amount of gentlemen that just hang out in the parking lot most of the day and night. Our room was also not cleaned one day and when we asked for towels because of this we were told to go chase down a worker. Our AC unit was covered in mold. Our room was no cleaned most days and if it was all they did was straighten the sheets and give new towels, they didn't even empty the trash cans.We chose this motel despite some of the poor reviews as a midway stop between Virginia and Florida. We were traveling with our dog and this motel accommodates pets without the non-refundable pet fees other hotels make you pay. Their was no sign of bug infestation in our room. The room was clean and the beds were comfy. No strange odors. The staff that greeted us was friendly and professional. Plenty of hot water for showers. However I will say that I'm 5'6"" and the shower head was barely above my head. If you are looking for top notch accommodations or have pet allergies this is not the place for you. It was a typical motel. If you want a microwave and a fridge you need to request a room with them, as not all rooms have them. We were in a hurry to get on the road the next morning so we did not have the breakfast there. It wasn't to far for a nice visit to the riverfront, just follow Abercorn street down town. La Quinta midtown served it purpose for a place to sleep and room for our dog too!Homecoming!!! The hotel was pretty good. It served its purpose. It was a place for me to lay my head. Make sure you don't get room 163. You will hear running water coming from somewhere else during the majority of the night.Someone was smoking pot on the 3rd floor; a/c didn't work; sheets smelled like urine and were wet. The desk clerk was the only worker in the entire hotel, so she couldn't handle all of the issues. Police were NOT called for the pot smokers nor were they asked to leave; sheets weren't changed and a/c wasn't fixed, so after 45 minutes, as the marijuana smell started coming into our rooms, we demanded our money back and left. When we asked for a refund--because we weren't staying in a hotel where people are doing drugs--she wouldn't give it to us and even lied on the phone to her manager about  how long we had been there. This was THE WORST hotel experience ever!!! We ended up staying at the Comfort Suites, which was MUCH better. NEVER will I stay at a La Quinta again. EVER!We stayed here a week before moving into our house.  The room was clean, and nice.  It's in a safe area, convenient to most of SavannahThe employees were not overly friendly, bt not rude either.Our air conditioner, despite saying it was 60 something in the room, never really went below 80.  It was hot in the room and we talked to them about it a couple times, but they always said there was no where to move us to.BEDBUGS :( Walk away from this bug-infested hotel. I checked in fair-skinned and checked out rash-covered. I am forced to give them a star, because their bugs have my blood. So the star is for my poor blood. The hotel gets starless :( rating.Just your good basic hotel. Nothing fancy but clean.","Okay hotel, very nice about an early check in but had to pay for two nights. Not that clean but it's okay. Close to most major stores, mall is a few minutes away. Parking can get tricky. Thought they would make the beds in the morning and change the towels but they didn't. Other than those things everything was ok.I have no idea what everyone else is talking about. I got a room here for an excellent rate and the staff was friendly, the room was totally clean and smelled fine, and the beds were comfy. If I was looking for some 5 star qualities of course this place doesn't match up, but for a 2 star hotel, in midtown Savannah for under 60/night... this is bloody perfect.Filthy rooms. I was put in 106, nothing else available for handicapped person traveling with me. I posted photos of room 106. Absolutely awful!  Should be 0 stars! Do not stay here, pay $25 more and go to Hampton InnTV was not working properly, phone was broken, smoke detector was ripped out of the wall, front desk was rude.  Totally not recommended at all!!The room was filthy! The sheets had obviously not been changed from the previous guests and the towels were dirty!  There was black hair in the tub and on the bathroom floor. The room had not been vacuumed and there was a yellow ring in the toilet that was not a stain....it was from lack of basic cleaning! I was almost physically ill. The manager was very nice and came to the room when we called the front desk. She had the room cleaned and the linen changed. She said maids had quit and one was sick but agreed that it was unacceptable. She cut our room rate from $129 to $75 per night....still not worth it. We were looking to leave the place, but were almost late for an appointment and were staying 2 nights. Never again! I booked with La Quinta because I have always liked the cleanliness of their hotels. I contacted the corporate hotel management and they apologized and said that they were currently operating without a manager at that location  and were getting ready to renovate the whole place! Then they should close until they are ready for guests! That was an unacceptable response!Not sure why there are anything negative said regarding this hotel.  Absolutely for the price you get the best hotel money can buy.  I just paid $58/night and got a flat screen 32 inch tv, got to take my dog, fluffy towels, great air conditioner, nice breakfast bar and a huge bed with lovely comfortable pillows and more pillows.  It is an ok area.  Not skummy at all.  Starbucks across the street and a straight shot down Abercorn to the river front.  In fact we headed to Atlanta and found another La Quinta and I would give this one a 3.  Same deal but carpets aren't as nice.Friendly staff. The rooms are old and could be cleaner. I HATE a/c units that kick on and off all night. They do that here. The tv has a sleep sound enhancer. Use it to cover noise from outside.Hotel is a little older but staff was very friendly and room was clean. Location isn't bad and price can't be beat. Only real complaint was ""free high-speed internet"" isn't much faster than dial up.Not that nice.  Found beer bottles behind the pull out couch.  The sleeper sofa was awful, like sleeping with a bar pressing into your back.  Motel was not that clean.  Don't recommend this place.Stay elsewhereThis review would have been a good solid 2.5 stars, maybe even three. Up until the point I found a live slug in the bed. Let me say that slower for those of you who think you mis read......A   LIVE   SLUG. To start off the price was right, and thats the only reason I booked it, I had plans to stay at The Holiday Inn Express, but when I went onto Travelocity and saw this for literally $90 less a night, I could not resist. I am normally a fan of La Quinta when going for a low end chain. THis La Quinta is in a decent location, about 4 miles from downtown, and near shopping, and food. The area seems a little shady, but not scary (as always...valubles out of sight). The room was adequate, but had a bit of a mossy smell, and wasn't outright dirty, but wasn't as clean as I would have liked. The free breakfast had yogurt, bagels, waffles and eggs, cereal and juice.  Basically, the cleanliness left something to be desired. The real kicker was on checkout noticing something blackon the sheet, getting closer and seeing a little slug gyrating about. At that point we left Would I stay here <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fagain.NO&amp;s=d8236d867e4d3357a899ef33154accb08c028f8851eedf432b49fb81b5ef461e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">again.NO</a> way.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hamilton-turner-inn-savannah,Hamilton-Turner Inn,4.5,$$$,24,"We had a five star stay at the beautiful Hamilton Turner Inn.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The service was fantastic.  We had a gourmet breakfast every morning.  Their yogurt and homemade granola were heavenly.  Ask them for the granola recipe.  It is a must have.  We stayed for three days and had eggs and biscuits, decadent blueberry pancakes, and scrambled eggs and cheese.  In the afternoon they had freshly baked cookies and brownies.  In the evening red and white wine was served in the living room with a selection of cheese and crackers, hot beef empanadas, and a vegetable platter.  When we returned from our dinner on the town a carafe of port was awaiting us in the living room.  Wonderful hospitality and well worth the price.  Most beautiful inn in Savannah.Lovely inn! Delicious breakfast, yummy cookies at night, beautiful room!  Great location!The Hamilton-Turner Inn is a historic inn located on a beautiful quiet square in the heart of Savannah's Historic District.  While we stayed only one night, I watched multiple trolley tours stop in front to mention this place.  For an old grand Southern mansion, it's remarkably well maintained.We stayed in the Juliette Gordon Low room, located on the third floor.  As others have mentioned, if you have heavy luggage or for other reasons don't want to take stairs, this might not be the best room.  They appear to be multiple first floor and basement level rooms as well.  But we found the Juliette Gordon Low room to be clean, cozy, and comfortable.  They have wifi throughout the building and DirectTV in the room.  Checking in on Yelp got us a bottle of Cava which was nothing special but still a much appreciated gesture.Other amenities include a large first floor dining room, where breakfast is served but which we also commandeered at dinner time to finish off our lunch from earlier in the day.  They also have baked goods in the afternoon, a wine and appetizer social in the early evening, and Port at night.  The people who took care of us at Hamilton-Turner Inn were outstanding.  The guy who handled our check-in helped us find street parking around the corner and brought in some of our groceries from the car, before eventually escorting us to the room and bringing leftovers to the basement fridge.  The innkeeper, who we met the next morning at breakfast, was also a very gracious host.My only issue was with the breakfast, and this may be a matter of personal preference.  They have a breakfast entree each morning (which they post the afternoon before) and during our stay, it was a described as a ""Southern-style Croque Madame.""  While other guests appeared to really enjoy it (one asked if he could lick the plate), I found it to be insanely salty.  It's as if they poured salt on the ham, the eggs, and the Hollandaise sauce before putting it on a biscuit.  I could only eat about a quarter of the dish before giving up.  My g.f. was equally unable to tolerate more than I few bites.  Thankfully they also offer homemade granola, yogurt, and fresh fruit so we sated ourselves on that before leaving.Overall, a great place to stay, quiet and comfortable, easily walkable to all of the major sites in historic Savannah.  High marks for the service, particularly the guys working in the afternoon and evening.  I'd stay there again, but maybe request a lot less salt in the breakfast.Hamilton-Turner Inn is a great B&amp;B in downtown Savannah.  The rooms are perfect B&amp;B rooms, and if you are lucky Mr. Foo the resident kitty cat will stop by.All the rooms are well done, and the setting is perfect for the area.  There is no elevator, so if you need one this is not the place for you (check out the President's Quarters).  If you can afford this B&amp;B this is absolutely the place to stay when you come to Savannah...and you should absolutely come to Savannah.The B&amp;B is quiet.  The inn is historic.  It's the first home in Savannah to have electricity.  Breakfast is served every morning on the first floor, and it's not a menu but something original every morning.  There is no parking, but you don't really need a car in Savannah.There's only two places I would stay in Savannah and this is one of them.Staying at the Hamilton-Turner Inn was SO wonderful!! We stayed in the Noble Jones suite and could not have been happier with our stay. The location is fabulous, close to the water front but nestled on Lafayette Square with tons of options for food, shopping and entertainment nearby. The inn itself is stunningly gorgeous, built in the 1800s and full of character and charm. Wood floors were nice with cushy throw rugs for comfort, huge king size canopy bed and a fancy, clean modern bathroom with a GIGANTIC shower, beautiful claw foot tub and double sinks. The room was clean, bright and honestly so beautiful. (Built in window shutters on 12'+ tall windows - so much character!)The staff is so friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you want/need - you feel like a friend of the family visiting. The included breakfast was great, but there are no options so you get whatever they are serving that day.  The little things were wonderful staying here - delicious cookies with turn down service, next day weather and local activities for the day on a card every evening, tons of towels and free water bottles. We will absolutely stay here again next time we are in Savannah. Highly recommended!!!If you are looking for a 4 star B&amp;B experience, this is it. We stayed on the third floor and had a view of the fountain in Lafayette Square out one window and St. John's out the other. There were chocolates and champagne in the room when we arrived. I went with friends, but this was still a nice touch. It was very quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was nothing short of impressive and the Inn keepers were very attentive. One our second night, we went on a pub crawl so that third morning we went to breakfast in our pjs and the lavish robes they provided. I felt like a riff raff but the staff welcomed us and was quick to offer extra coffee ;) They gave recommendations on what to see and offered to make arrangements for us. The location was perfect and made it convenient to walk all over the city. The Hamilton Turner made our trip to Savannah really special!Such a beautiful house! We were only stopping over for the night but what a treat it was to stay here. Far exceeded our expectations. The staff was so welcoming and knowledgeable. Also the location was perfect and picturesqueBeautiful place and great location but....The A/C didn't work correctly both nights even after I told the person at the desk. There was a puddle of water in the bathroom floor after each shower due to the glass not going down to the tile. The sheets were so worn they had pilled. We could hear every conversation from the Eli Whitney room (we were in the Habersham room)Our room wasn't ready when we checked in. So the  gentleman took my number and said he'd call when it was ready. He never contacted us. During breakfast on Monday the lady serving referred to my wife as ""not an egg girl"" because she didn't care for her Eggs Benedict runny. And she dissed the statement of us going to Tybee Island for the day.Be advised the Habersham room is below ground so there is no view.I almost rated this review 3 stars but I didn't because I don't want to rate it on my lack of liking the place.  The Inn itself deserves more but I personally wouldn't go back.  I'm a bit jaded since visiting Mast Farm Inn and this place was a little too stuffy for my liking.With gold inlay dishes and very prim and proper everything, I just couldn't get comfortable.  I like a more laid back environment where I feel like family.  All that being said, the spaces and the house itself is beyond belief.  It's a great throwback to yesteryear and a true example of what it must have been like to be a wealthy landowner in Savannah GA.Stayed one night at his B&amp;B, but that's all it took to feel the warmth of the owner and guests.  We were in the ground/basement-level room, which is small (~10' x 10'), but it was well organized and decorated.  The bathroom is surprisingly big in comparison to the room and has more of a modern style (perhaps recently renovated).  We also had our own private entry.  They serve cold and hot breakfast in the morning.  The breakfast was average, but the friendly hosts and guests made the experience special.  Strangers actually smiled and said ""good morning,"" shocking this New Yorker. Street parking was plentiful when we were there on Labor Day (Sunday-Monday).  The Inn is centrally located, so you can walk to most attractions.  Although we were in the ground/basement level with brick walls, the Wi-Fi signal was strong.Well done with this B&amp;B.  I'd stay there again.Magnificent!  We stayed 3 nights in the Ogelthorpe suite.  Southern hospitality at it's finest ~ excellent breakfast is included in the price.  Centrally located with easy access to everything.  There is no elevator, so keep that in mind when making your reservation!We stayed in the John Habersham room for 1 night. Do not stay in this room. It smells like feet or a wet dog in area right outside the bathroom.  I have to hold my breath every time I walk by. For the price we pay and being ranked #1 on Tripadvisor, I did not expect this.  So the stars goes down Bc of that.  I do like the private door in and out from the garden/basement area. Great service. Great location. But we are here to sleep. So the room has to worth the $$$ we spent. I may come back but probably choose a different room and hope to not get the same stinky experience.The home is absolutely gorgeous and the area is beautiful. The price is a little expensive, but was worth it in my opinion. Right in the middle of everything, but far enough away to be a bit away from river street. Lots of little things were included: little sweets, wine in the afternoon, a nightcap, etc. The breakfast was awesome- homemade granola, yogurt, great cheese, blueberry French toast, thick cut bacon. Would definitely stay here again.I don't give 5 stars often but this place deserved it. The location is perfect - right in the historic district. The Inn is very pretty, inside and out. The service was really good. Morning breakfasts were good - though not healthy. Afternoon cookies, evening wine and late night Port every day - what's not to like. We stayed in the Oglethorpe room and found it to be quite nice. Highly recommended all the way around.Great B&amp;B! the room was beautiful, the breakfast was excellent, as were all the other refreshments available throughout the day. The staff was exceptional. It was very convenient to have a stop for the free city-wide shuttle service just directly across the street. I would definitely come back. It was a great honeymoon!This place is top notch all the way not only beautiful inside and out but the staff is just as warm and helpful as you could ask for. This is our first time in Savannah and we have loved it we will be back. Oh and the chef made breakfast every morning is 5 star worth itself!! Great place great people worth every penny.Wonderful place to stay in Savannah! It's definitely worth the price, the inn keepers and staff are so wonderful and helpful. This is my first stay here but it's the first of many. This will be the only place I stay in Savannah. You know it's good when the locals say this is their favorite place... during my visit, I had 3 locals (all at various times throughout the trip) say they would pick H-T if they were to stay somewhere! The breakfast, evening wine and the nightly port are a nice way to socialize with the other guests and learn different things to do around town. The food is delicious, just wish I could have tried the french toast that another Yelp-er mentioned, I was only here for 3 days though. I can't say enough good things about this place!My husband and I stayed for three nights over Christmas 2012 in the Isaiah Davenport room. The room was charming and we enjoyed the private entrance.  The Dunlops and their staff are gracious, attentive, and very helpful. We enjoyed the comfortable room, excellent breakfast, pleasant company, and great location. Everyone made us feel welcome. We had a lovely visit!While in Savannah we stayed at the Hamilton Turner Inn.  All the hotels were full and this was the last place available in the area, it was also cheaper than the hotels.  We were there for the inaugural half marathon so we assumed we would not be able to get a place in down, but to our surprise we found this gem.  This place sits right on Lafayette Square and is absolutely gorgeous from the outside.   I have to admit the house did have sort of an odd smell to it, but I had to remind myself that this place is so old that it was the first house to have electricity run through it (History tip one).  Being that it was the first house to be able to turn lights on, Hamilton actually put in floor to ceiling windows so his neighbors could see it had lights on (History tip two). The room was decent, we stayed in the basement area and the bed was comfortable. The trickiest part about the whole stay was the shower.  It was an old fashion shower and there was not a lot of room in there. But oh well.  The owners and staff were super nice and helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed the Port night cap waiting for us when we returned from a hard day of tourism.   Also be sure to make reservations for breakfast the following morning, because it is really worth it. I would definitely stay in this location again!Excellent!! Nice rooms!! Great staff!! Perfect location!! Walking distance to the river front and restaurants","If I could give 0 stars I would. We stayed in the carriage house. Lovely room. We got in around 4:30 and I immediately could hear the people above me moving. This went on for about 10 minutes. We had to walk over to the main house to ask them if they could do something about the noise above, trying to nip in the bud what could be bad at night for us. The mgr. at first said there was nothing she could do. She came over about 20 minutes later and told us she heard nothing and the people weren't even in the room. We proceeded to go out to dinner. Came back at 11 and went to sleep.  At approximately 1:00 am I was woken up by loud walking upstairs. Since there was no phone in our room we walked over to main house. No one on duty but numbers for the owners. We called them. First time he hung up on me. Second time she said I was making the noise. At the same time out toilet chugged so we told her. In the am there was a note saying they were in the carriage house at 3:00 am and heard nothing. By then the upstairs people were sound asleep as opposed to me being wide awake. I proceed to bathroom at 8 am and there's a flood. Go back to main house. Mgr comes over with a check and tells us to leave. He said we caused the flood. He was belligerent. And started throwing our coats from the closet on the bed. I called the police because he was being aggressive and I felt unsafe. And ironically I asked to use another bathroom and he said there was one behind our room door  I opened the door and that one was flooded as well.  So i guess i damaged 2 bathrooms in spite NOT.  After he called me some choice names we got the car loaded. It's a sorry state where you accuse your clients of damaging their own bathroom.My husband and I have stayed at many inns, but we knew we had arrived at a special place when we arrive at the lovely Hamilton-Turner Inn.  The service was impecable, from the moment we arrived until we sadly had to leave!  We both felt the attention to detail, was evident everywhere we looked.  We stayed in a lower level room with an exit to a lovely patio area, so we had the best of both worlds....privacy when we wanted it but only a few steps away from fresh lemonade and cookies or a delish breakfast.  Our only complaint is that it had to end.My husband and I stayed here for three nights in January and had a great stay. Susan, Will, and Abby were immensely helpful in suggesting places to eat and tours to take and made a number of reservations for us. It's clear the staff is as willing to chat with you as much or as little as you want. When we checked in, we were upgraded (free of charge) to a bigger room. It was spacious and the bed was super comfortable with the most indulgent sheets I've ever had the pleasure to sleep in! Before a yummy breakfast each morning (the stuffed French toast was incredible) coffee and newspapers were available in the living room. In the afternoon sweet tea and refreshments were waiting for us when we got back from several hours of strolling the historic district. Prior to dinner each night, hors d'oeuvres and wine were waiting for guests to enjoy.In terms of location, the Inn is on one of the most lovely of all the squares, right next to St. John's Cathedral and across the way from the Andrew Low House - it's an easy walk to River Street and all the action and I'm really happy we stayed here and not along the more well know Forsythe Park which is bounded by busy streets.I've stayed at a number of B&amp;Bs through the years and this one is definitely among my favorites. When (not if) we go back to Savannah, we'd definitely stay here again.I stayed here for two nights in the Juliette Gordon Low room, which was the only room available. It was in a corner on the third floor, nice room, beautiful decor. There is no elevator, and it is nearly 60 stairs up, so make sure if mobility is an issue, ask about room location. Its a great location, walking to everything. Breakfast was nice, as was the tea, evening wine, and night time cookies and port. It was a beautiful place, and I would return.",,,,"['five', 'star', 'beautiful', 'turner', 'inn', 'room', 'spacious', 'comfortable', 'service', 'fantastic', 'gourmet', 'breakfast', 'every', 'morning',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-savannah-midtown-savannah,Hilton Garden Inn Savannah Midtown,3.0,$$,24,"This hotel was great!!!!  The staff was amazing!  From the front desk staff, house keeping, and staff in the dining room.  Our rooms were clean, beds comfy, and location was fantastic.  Your are only about a 5 minute drive to the historic district and you have a grocery story right across the street in case you want to grab snacks, etc. for your room. My only complaint was the organization of the breakfast.  The weekend I was there was the weekend of a children's soccer competition and the food and wine festival.  So it was crazy busy.  However, they did not keep order as to who arrived first, and they constantly ran out of food.  I mean the wait times were ridiculous.  There was also one gentleman who was working his butt off, and his co-worker was a complete slacker and stole tips off the table. It was a bit ridiculous.  But when you were able to get food cooked by the cook, it was delicious.Parking was a bit hectic as well.Overall, I'd say stay here.  Great location, clean rooms, and good onsite food.Would not stay again  ... The rooms were nice, had the jacuzzi rooms for myself and spouse plus one for my parents.The breakfast option and frustration over the slow service is why I would never visit again.  The service was so slow we left and found somewhere else to eat.  This was after orders were placed and the kitchen seed to not care about anyone.I got so frustrated I ended up reaching over the counter and serving myself sausage and bacon, only to get yelled at by the cook.  The same cook who was not too pressed to get orders correct or served timely.My suggestion - stay at the Springhill Marriot closer to Downtown, same price for the rooms (had to pay parking though) and the free breakfast is a good selection.We stayed only one night in this hotel, but we have nothing bad to say,we did not expect much but we were surprised, great location nice rooms good cleaning. Good hotel! :) The Staff was really friendly. The room was super big and clean.

My wife and I stayed here on February 14, 2016 after a long weekend in the Smoky Mountains. We chose to stay, to break up a 12 hour drive back to Florida. The property is centrally located in the richly historic, mid size, town of Savannah, Ga. This hotel boasts a clean and sleek atmosphere while also providing relaxed and comfortable amenities in the common areas and your private room.  The check-in process was fairly quick (given it was busy) and uneventful. Our room was clean and comfortable and offered a small living area and two queen beds.  The bathroom was spacious and the ever-important water pressure was perfect.  After a quick de-briefing from a 6 hour drive we both headed down to the hotel lounge.  The bartender was a very nice woman who was doing the job of three people! She never complained and was very attentive to our needs.  After a few cocktails we ordered a salad and a  chicken alfredo dish to share.  These plates certainly exceeded our expectations.  Our experience with typical sub 4 star hotels in the in house dining department have been less than  satisfying.  This hotel has a very good made to order restaurant and the food was delicious, served hot, tasted fresh, served on real dinnerware and was reasonably priced.  The prices may seem a teeny weeny high but the amount of food you get is worth it.  We left the lounge/restaurant very satisfied and a little tipsy.  The beds are comfortable and very clean as we slept like babies.  The check out process was quick and easy as we did express check out.  The neighboring business is under construction and what looked like what could be a problem never was and our experience was never impacted!Originally planned to stay at the Hampton Inn (100 feet away), but I had made the mistake of not reserving a room the day before at that price, and the price had shot up to $180.00 for one night by the time I showed up.  ---  So I walked 100 feet over to the Hilton Garden Inn and they had rooms avail for closer to 80.00 :-) Standard Hilton Garden inn with the nice lobby, free breakfast(for HHonors Gold members), and updated rooms.  For under 100, cannot go wrong!  ((I mean you could pay a little bit less for a non-chain discount hotel in Savannah, but then you might be walking into the bathroom and find that 6 or 7 of your small uninvited 'friends' are having a little party in there!)) So yep, do the Hilton Garden Inn.  Great Hotel at a Great Price!The hotel was just okay. They do not have a free breakfast option, which is not shocking but they pester you about eating there anyway. My husband and I were placed in a handicap room where we could hear everything the people next to us were saying and doing, which grew extremely tedious. Also, no one told us about the adjustable bed, so I had to snoop around the mattress after coming to the conclusion that no bed should be so firm without some way to fix it. Overall, I'm unimpressed.Super clean.  Check-in was a little slow but it was busy and the people in front of me were being super obnoxious.I only stayed one night, as I was going to another hotel in the Historic District the rest of the weekend for a conference, and for $110 I was completely satisfied.  Bed was great, awesome water pressure in the shower, and the bar (although pricey) was nice.  Didn't eat there, walked across the street to Bonefish.I'd prefer free breakfast but this seems to be getting more and more rare around Savannah.This is a great hotel to get night rest.  The staff is very nice and hotel is very clean. We have enjoyed our stay. Our room was spotless. If you want to get away from all the noise of downtown this is the spot to be.We did not like this hotel. The walls are too thin because we could hear the people in the other rooms. Our room was also closest to the ice machine and it made loud noises throughout the night. Sleep for me was not as good as it should have been. The thing we did like is that there is free parking.We just came from the Hilton Garden by the Airport and move here today to be closer to our kids dorm. I got an email to checked in via eCheckin on the internet and it said I can choose my room. This was not a good Idea after I did that. At first the sound of checking in via internet was great and able to choose your room. I logged in and chose my room and I double check to see if I still have the King Bed Suite, I even have screen shots that it says I have King Bed Suite. After I confirmed and check back to my room preference, it gave me just the King Bed room and not the King Bed Suite. Even though all of the rooms suggested from picking your own room showed it was a King Bed Suite. So I quickly called the hotel and spoke to Avis and she changed it back to King Bed Suite. Thank you Avis for getting us back to our reserved room. No more eCheckIn for me, because the rooms you are offered to choose from is not the rooms you reserve during reservation. I'll just do the normal wait in line and check in for me.Now that we are here, the Staff are friendly and attentive to your needs. Wireless is a little bit slower than the one at the airport. We will be here for a few days and lets see how it goes with our stay. I hope we don't have to send a note to the Hilton general manager for issues. I'll update this in a few days and finalize the review.1) First night was good and the room was clean but has a very slight mildew/smoke smell. We left in the morning for breakfast and came back early and the room was clean by 1:30pm. So far so good.Came back from a show, crabbed a small bottle of wine and came to the room. The room still had the very slight mildew/smoke smell. I guess its because its been raining and the hot/moisture in the air is bringing the smell out. Just had to get use to it, even though i can't stand second hand smoke.2) Second night was good also. We left in the morning to get some breakfast and was gone most of the day. The staff was friendly while we were on our way out saying good morning with a smile. Came back to the room late and parking was ok for a Friday night. Everyone must be out still out in the city having fun. The room smelt ok and welcoming. It did not rain today so the room was ok.Well its almost midnight and I guess the people are back in their rooms. The room next door has their TV on so loud I can hear it through the thin walls. The are also talking loud but I cant understand what they are saying. I hope they don't stay up to late making all that noise. I would complain but by the time the staff would notify them, they may go to sleep already. Lets see what happens in a half an hour or so.3) Third night was... (pending till I get back home)Ok for under $100. Stayed during a business trip. Hotel is extremely clean with up to date rooms. Gym has free weights, a weight machine, and several treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals that are quite old. Nice looking bar and restaurant, but did not eat.       Quite, with comfortable beds, but internet is very slow. Frustrating when you have work to do. Would have given better ratings if 1. Breakfast was free 2. Internet was faster and 3. Gym updatedWe booked this hotel to stay one night in savannah.  It was what you would expect out of a Hilton garden Inn for the most part.  The rooms are relatively updated and the lobby is nice.  It's not right in historic savannah but it's neat enough to be convenient. We had a room with 2 Queens and a pull out couch. The reason I'm giving it two stars has to do with pull out couch.  We pulled it out and it was horrible.  Not only could you feel every spring,  but you could also see stains on the mattress.  We decided to call the front desk and ask for extra blankets to make it more comfortable.  We could not get the front desk to answer and had to go down to the lobby to get help. They agreed to bring a roll away bed and extra blankets.  That seemed like a reasonable solution until we saw the roll away.  We put it down on the floor and it was covered in dark brown stains.  It was absolutely disgusting!  I posted a picture for you to see.  I wouldn't say never to stay here because the actual beds were fine and the room was generally clean,  but I would expect a Hilton hotel to replace a roll away with so many stains.  I'm a bit disappointed.They were completely booked on a Saturday night so we had to stay down the street. The rate did go down $20 for checking in on a Sunday rather than Saturday so take that into consideration. The staff was nice for the most part but check-in isn't until 4pm and they will make that very clear. The facilities are very clean. Nice look lobby and breakfast area but the meals cost ~$10/person. The parking lot is SUPER small. We had to part about 100 yards away at the Hampton inn one night and the TV's audio didn't match the picture so we couldn't watch Tv.  Overall nice hotel but room for improvement.Booo!  I don't plan to ever stay here again!  I stay around 100 nights a year typically at HGI all around the country. Normally I am thoroughly pleased. Here in Savannah at the HGI midtown it started the same way. Nice lobby, friendly staff, clean elevator and room.  Super comfy bed. AC works great, big flat screen tv.  That's great because I travel with my ps3. I connected the hdmi cable, powered it all up and......hmm, how do I change the tv to HDMI? You can't, and the front desk wouldn't help. I travel a lot and typically have 5 hours every evening to kill.  I play my ps3 or xbox. If I can't do that I will stay elsewhere. I can't think of any reason why a hotel would deny me access to this. They're not losing any money. Nobody is going to watch 5 hours of pay tv every night. I'm upset and disappointed. I wish I could stay here and am pretty sure in the past this wasn't an issue.Looked like a nice upscale place, but on arrival they told me they had overbooked, even tho I had a confirmation number! I had to stay around back at the Hampton which worked out fine with the grandkids.Within it's class, it's a clean hotel that suits my needs,  that's why I gave it five stars.   You cannot compare it to a resort or a high-end hotel... Poor comparison.  I use it for business and always receive friendly service from desk staff and bartender. Rooms are always clean.  You can walk across the street for a restaurant or groceries... And Starbucks.  There's even a few stores for shopping next-door. This garden inn serves lunch and dinner, although I've never eaten here If you are visiting savannah, stop being cheap and go down town. This hotel is perfect for business travelers, overnight travelers. If you are a tourist, you would want more amenities. This has a decent hotel gym and a hot breakfast.  Pool is a typical lame outdoor pool within this class of hotel.In town for business. Stay at Hilton properties a lot (HH-Diamond). Staff is friendly, room was clean, but I was next to the ice machine. Not what I expected for the status. Parking is very limited as are the TV channels.Came here on a business trip paid for the company.  Nice and clean operation, very friendly and professional front desk, Ty at the desk when I picked up my electronic key.Good room with comfy room and bed.  Only drawback was some hair in the sink.  This is not the end of the world, but something that should not happen at a Hilton property.Free wi fi if you are a Hilton member, which I am.  But system blocked hbogo.The staff was friendly and genuine, the entire hotel smelled fresh, the atmosphere encompasses everything someone could enjoy. The location is a little distant from downtown, but the price:location ratio is one of the best anyone can find!Problems:*Toilet paper was dispensed from a jury-rigged contraption underneath the sink. It took me a few minutes to find it.*Channel-changer had many sticky buttons, obviously not regularly maintained.*Interior door handle was pivoted 90 degrees, angled downward. Very awkward.*The ice machines on the bottom few floors did not dispense ice our entire weekend.Likes:*Staff was friendly &amp; happy to assist with anything.*Refreshment hutch was unique and well-stocked by housekeeping.*Concierge provide valuable advice on hot-spots &amp; transportation.When we return to Savannah, the Hilton Garden Inn Midtown is a definite choice to stay at!Great so far! Limited parking but nice staff! We went in May, and we had access to their outdoor pool as well as the indoor pool in the hotel behind theirs.","we were hear at new year's. We have small children so had to come back from town early. The bar was closed. Poor show, but forgivable on New Year's Eve. But the next night, the bar closed early too. Good job I'm not an alcoholic. Come on Hilton. Either have a bar or not, but don't slum off early (8:30).Nice hotel, good location. I come to Savannah somewhat regularly and have been making the rounds to different hotels. This location is good, especially if you aren't looking to be downtown. It is within walking distance of a Publix and some other shops/restaurants. We opted for a king bed and whirlpool tub, which were well worth the extra money. The room was clean and nice. The hotel staff was very friendly and even called prior to check in to verify what time we'd be arriving, etc. The hotel was very full while we were there due to Georgia Southern's graduation, and we didn't get a lot of noise or anything. Wi-Fi's free, but our connection on the 5th floors was a bit spotty. There is also a pool, fitness center, business center, and a bar/room service.The parking isn't very good. When the hotel is full, as it was this weekend, there aren't enough spaces and you have to park at the Hampton Inn's garage next door. It's not terribly far, but annoying enough. Also, the elevators were a bit slow. They really need a service elevator, and people need to stop being so darn lazy and taking the elevator down 1 floor!! Talk about ""this is why you're fat!""They were not full, but still put me on the second floor next to the ice machine and elevator (HH member, no discount, put in the worst room in the place).  Avoid.  You can do better in Savannah.Well the room was quiet and location is great BUT was there for a swim meet. We leave Early - 5:30am so when I awoke to no running water at 4:45am I was told there had been a leak and the water would b back on at 5:15. Hmmm- 3 people hot muggy Savannah needing to showering in 15min. Well- 5:15- no water. 5:20 a trickle to brush teeth but no shower pressure. I asked to have my bill adjusted- I was offered 2 free breakfast. Hmmmm NO. The staff was nice- the managers were rude acted like I was off base to request an adjusted bill for $200 a night stay. ( yes- I booked late a crazily paid to much!!!) I left with no adjustment  but was emailed by front office manager with a sorry and a here's a lane room discount! I'm tired of discussing it- clearly they win this way. My friends keep asking why I stay at Hilton's- we constantly have issues. Oddly usually involving water! Well guess I will finally move over to Marriott !",,,,"['hotel', 'great', 'staff', 'amazing', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'house', 'keeping', 'staff', 'dining', 'room', 'rooms', 'clean', 'beds',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-points-by-sheraton-historic-savannah-savannah-3,Four Points by Sheraton Historic Savannah,3.0,$$,51,"Great location and excellent staff! Came here on business and was greeted by the Valet staff (valet parking only option here). I handed off the car, they gave me some instructions that I didn't remember and away I went. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by the front desk peeps. They were almost as energetic as me!! I got checked right in and they told me that the Manager's Reception was going on there there were free food and drinks... OK!!!I wandered up to my room and dumped my bag and banjo on the bed and high tailed it to the reception. I was greeted with some free beer and food!!  LUCKY!!!!!  They were pouring up some Sweetwater 420 (delish!) and they had some marinated/baked chicken and veggies for food. It was not bad at all! I was surprised.The room was very clean and comfortable. I had a great view of the riverfront. This was not my first stay at a Four Points, so I was accustomed to the amenities. The location is great. You're right at the end of the ""strip"" where you want to be in Savannah for some night life. Easy to walk to the restaurants and bars and back. I definitely recommend this hotel is you're in the area!!!!A common complaint about the hotel are the billing errors. Keep an eye on your banking account during your stay.We enjoyed the hotel.  The room was clean and the staff were friendly.  We did have the issue where the Hotel charged us almost $2000.00 for our stay from our checking account, but Sheraton made good on the mistake and we got a good discount.I would've given this hotel 4 stars, but sadly the room rates were $350.00 per night where they normally were $100.00 .  This hotel is $100.00 per night max.First impression where is the front door? Found it off to the side and texted hubby where to go having dropped me off and parked on side of hotel.  There is no sign indicating the front door!Probably THE smallest room we have ever had! I think our bedroom at home is larger and that says something! Smelled a bit and couldn't figure out what it was.For the bad:Room sizeSmall drawers and not enough of themShower with no tubNo room at bathroom sink for itemsNo comfy chair to sit at. Computer chair onlyHard to control heat/air. We finally turned both off.Valet only at $18 a day.Positives:Nice size flat screen TV lots of channels and pay per viewFree water !! Decent location within walking distance to things!Great cleaning staff for the rooms.Great staff overall.Overall OK- but if we went again we would probably try somewhere else.I am someone who travels a lot for work. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a hotel. Staff is very rude and we were blown off since we pre-paid through their website. Also was treated badly since we were not with the group that was coming in. Since I pre-paid I lost the money but found a better hotel in town. We will never step foot in this place again. I am someone who doesn't like to give bad review if a review at all but this was just awful. The only thing they were willing to do to help the situation was give me a free breakfast at their breakfast buffet. Look at my next review to find a better hotel in town.Great location to stay. Only one and half blocks to City Market which is great! About 5 blocks to River Street. Hotel staff is friendly and room was clean. We had an incident where they charged our debit card, that was only supposed to be used for incidentals, $1260! Needless to say I was not a happy camper when I opened my bank account to find their error. The 3 night stay was supposed to be $700, so no idea where they came up with that amount. Had to spend half hour at the front desk with them and the bank getting it corrected. If it wasn't for their major mistake, I might have given the hotel 4 stars because of the location and clean room. It also didn't help we stayed the weekend of the marathon when a typical $100 room was jacked up to $350!!! Definitely not a$350/ night hotel. We wanted to get away so we caved, but I do not suggest paying for than $150 for this place.I stayed here for a wedding weekend in Savannah.  The staff is quite pleasant and the lobby of the hotel is clean and renovated with the charming allure of Savannah. However, the actual rooms are dated and definitely need a make over. My particular room had an odor.  The beds had horrible mattresses that were ill-fitted. On a positive side, the room was clean. But I honestly wouldn't stay here again solely because of the poor quality of the room.4 Points rates a 4 star!  (5 in the bargain hotel ratings!). This place is great. First, location is magnificent. On edge of historic district and walking distance to most of the interesting Savannah sights. But it gets better. The hotel is a beauty and the photos posted by the hotel are accurate (if not slightly unflattering to the actual).Valet/bellhop and checkin service friendly and efficient. Beautiful, big lobby befitting a hotel in Savannah (or Manhattan for that matter) Rooms-lots of unexpected extras included in rate which is already very reasonable. Free wi-fi, LG wall mounted LED TV, VIEWS, generous closet and drawer space, clean updated bathrooms, nice, ambient + ample lighting, full length mirror and mirrored coat hanger, free coffee and coffee maker, free bottled H2O and free amenities include travel sized Scope! Bed is nice and firm, better than avg bedding in a tastefully decorated room all around. I'm a hotel snob and have experienced 6 star resorts that cost $1000+/night but I've never seen such nice little extras before in a budget hotel anywhere. Kudos to Four Points Historic Savannah for pulling it off. PS Almost forgot the room service menu with $10 full breakfast!!-REALLY! (the works incl coffee&amp;juice!, choice of meats, potatoes, eggs, toast or pastry/English muffin etc.  (20% tip, $2 serv chg, and tax added after but it's an amazing, unusual find for room service). Rest of menu similarly priced. Compare all this to customary $15-20 wifi, $50 room service bills for similar food,, and other ""nickel and dime you to death"" features of luxury hotels costing 10x more,! This place is a breath of fresh air!I gave them 5 stars because they do have nice people working here... We had a baby with us and most rooms do not come with a mini fridge. You would have to rent them for $10 a night. They gave it to us free of charge for 2 nights; that just means they truly care about their customers. I completely appreciate it.I booked the hotel through priceline and got a great deal with a nice view of the lake with double beds. The cleaning lady was super friendly and attentive to us. The room was nice and clean. The only peeve I had was the sticky floors, but I had my sandals so I didn't mind. There's a bistro inside the hotel so it's convenient to get something decent to eat if you're stuck with no car. Their towels were super soft by the way. :) We enjoyed our stay.Great location, awesome staff, comfortable rooms. I bought our room on Priceline and was a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but I could not have been happier with our stay.  The front office staff as well as the valet staff was out of this world. So nice and accommodating during every encounter.We were happy to have a room with a mini fridge, and the complimentary water is a nice touch. On the evening of my birthday, after returning from a night on the town, we were surprised with a bottle of champagne, strawberries, and a card from the staff. That really set the tone for an amazing stay. The rooms were nice, the property is clean, but the hospitality is what will bring me back.Reasons it didn't get a higher rating;The parking issue could have been solved if they allowed self park on the vacant lot next door. They said the parking below the hotel was secure and it wasn't.The location, price, rooms and service were more than adequate.The Four Points by Sheraton - Historic Savannah is located on the western edge of the historic district. The area around the hotel to the west is a little seedy, and the hotel/valet parking entrance (which is actually on Bryan Street) isn't clearly marked and is *very* narrow - I almost couldn't fit my Acadia around the bend in the entrance way between the brick pier and the parked cars.Inside the hotel is very nice and is clean. The room, however, is *very* small; the bed and desk take up almost the entire living area. The closet is also small. The hotel does offer complementary bottled water and a decent coffee maker in the rooms, and WiFi service is also free (although since we have our own hot spot we never use the hotel service).You have to use valet parking here ($18/night); there is no place to self-park.It's a short walk to City Market and a slightly longer walk to the River Street shops.Overall, this isn't a bad place to stay. I'd definitely look for a package, though; don't think I'd want to pay the going rate (we got this through Priceline).Great location just one block walk to City Market area and all the restaurants, shops, bars, etc. Stayed here with a Groupons Getaways deal. Would have been disappointed if we had paid full price, as the hotel room definitely wasn't as nice as the photos portrayed. The lobby was very nice, seems they've renovated all of that area and need to do a little to spruce the guest rooms up.Looks can be deceiving! From the outside &amp; lobby, the hotel seems fine. BUT once we got to our room-what a change! Our room smelled like sweaty armpits &amp; was very damp &amp; sub par. We stayed here for a conference &amp; had I been able to make other arrangements, I would've.. The Andaz or Westin is great.. Don't stay here. The pool had green algae, water bugs in the pool &amp; No towels-even after I requested them-no towels!! A little shady around the hotel... Only valet parking. I would NEVER recommend this place! Hey hotel manager, FYI, u need a facelift in the rooms &amp; nobody like a smelly room.Location is about the best thing this hotel has going. I'm beyond disappointed with the overall up keep of this particular Sheraton...did not hold up to the 4 star rating. The lobby is as everyone has stated. When I tell you that I wished I'd been more attentive to other reviews about cleanliness and this horrible smell. To be honest the staff didn't impress me at all, very nonchalant and attentive to the needs of the guests. I had to ask for towels and do you think you can clean the dirty ring from around the bathtub.I have previously stayed at other hotels a little further away from the river that were in better condition with friendlier staff and cheaper.I wished we had more time when we stayed in Savannah.  The hotel was nice and our room was clean.  The hospitality of the staff is phenomenal and they didn't want us to leave.  We got a good deal for one night and it is located close by everything downtown.  We walked to the historic area and most places was less than 15 minutes away.  The only gripe is the valet parking, which is $15 a day.  Don't the hotel make enough money as it is?  Sorry, I had to knock a star off for that.  We recommend staying here to anybody that wants to be close by everything.We stayed here for a couple nights while visiting Savannah. The hotel is in a perfect location. We walked everywhere easily. Across the street is City Market and behind the hotel is River Street.Check in was easy, we arrived around 11am and were able to check right in. The young man offered us suggestions of tours and maps. The room was on the smaller side but manageable for 2 nights. It and the hallways looked recently redone. Housekeeping was friendly and delivered a tidy room. The complimentary bottle of water in the room was nice, though I'd suggest 2 bottles instead of 1. The room were were in could of used a full length mirror since the only other one in the bathroom was short. We chilled by the the pool for an hour each day when no one was around. Towels were easily available outside the entry door. Parking is a $15 valet charge only, you may be able to find cheaper in a lot but in and out will cost you more. Street parking is metered with 2 hour limits until 6pm.The location of this hotel is perfect. It's on the edge of the historic district and you can walk right over to River Street, City Marker, and Brighton Street. The staff was so hospitable - I've never felt more comfortable at a hotel than I did here. Everyone made conversation with us and we felt so welcome - as if though we were truly their guests. The breakfast buffet was delicious and convenient before we headed out for sight seeing. The omelette station was amazing - so fresh and delicious! The concierge made great recommendations for our trip. The staff even heated up our leftovers from restaurants, which we stored inside the small refrigerators in our room. Our view was of the bridge and the river - loved it!The only downside was that the wi-fi was super slow, but I can compromise that for the kind of service that we received.Lovely hotel in Savannah.  Very nice rooms, great location, friendly and professional staff. I look forward to staying here again when I return to Savannah.The hotel looked attractive and beautiful online, so my boyfriend and I booked a room through Kayak.  We wanted something close to the historic area that was in walking distance. When we arrived, we both were surprised that literally right behind the hotel was a lower income neighborhood. We didn't feel safe. There is minimum parking available at the hotel, just street parking that's right near this neighborhood. It's $18 to valet park your car. Total rip off.The lobby is beautiful, but when we got to our hotel room---there is no comparison.  It's completely out of date, has a sour odor that appears to be in the carpet, and the bathroom just looked run down and not all that clean. The room is small and doesn't appear they clean the actual blanket on the beds, just the sheets/pillow cases.  We were on a road trip down the east coast and stayed in many hotels along the way, this hotel takes the cake it just being a big let down.There is no microwave, fridge, or anything complimentary except a free bottle of water in our hotel room.  We couldn't wait to leave the next day!  And yes, the staff is friendly...however we both thought it was a rude a staff member knocked on our door at 9am to see if we were still in the room for cleaning purposes. Check out is at noon and she could check with the front desk to see if the room was vacant. After exploring the historic area of Savannah, there are hotels that are closer to the area and may be $20-30$ more expensive-- it's worth it in our opinion to choose one of these other places.The Four Points by Sheraton Hotel in the historic area Savannah, Georgia, is an absolutely fantastic property. With a great location and a smaller, boutique feel, this hotel is possibly the best in Savannah.What stands out most of all about the Four Points is the staff and their incredible service. Every staff member we encountered, from the property manager to the valet, makes you feel welcome. You get the sense that the staff truly appreciates each guest. I cannot say enough about the staff - outstanding, to say the least!The hotel itself is beautiful inside. This is not a huge walk-a-mile-to-your-room hotel. It has five floors, with an outdoor pool on the second. Our room was very nice and clean. High ceilings, modern amenities a spacious bathroom. Very comfortable. Don't let the outside appearance deceive you! The outside of the building isn't anything special, but is well kept.There is a small restaurant in the Four Points that has a very good breakfast buffet, including cook-to-order omelets. There is also a small, casual bar with a relaxing ambiance. On Wednesday evenings, which was one of the nights we were at the hotel, the hotel staff has a poolside cookout with complimentary beer and wine. The staff, once again, does a great job interacting with guests and making everyone feel welcome. This may be a seasonal promotion, and worth your time if you're there on a Wednesday night. From the hotel, it's an easy walk to River Street, the squares in the historic district and to City Market. Next time you are planning a visit to Savannah, consider staying at the Four Points. Overall, it is a great hotel. I don't have a single negative thing to say about it. I'll certainly return to this property!","The worst customer service ever!!! We booked our room thru reserves and they changed the price at arrival. Told us if we had a problem with that to call the 800 number. This hotel is in the ghetto!! We saw five different people being arrested in two days at the gas station next door. We will NEVER stay here again!!!Would rate it three and a half if I could. It's nice here but nothing impressive as far as the accommodations are concerned. The staff and customer service is pretty great though.We were only here for a night, but I was pleased! We had a very late check-in (2am) so when we got there, the door was locked and it took someone a while to realize we were there. Also, the valet guy was MIA, so my husband was kind of ticked. We had just completed a 16 hour drive from Groton, CT, so he was quite cranky and just wanted to get to bed. The room was nice! The breakfast was amazing!! I think we will be back on our next trip through!This place is near City Market and convenient to River Street if you don't mind walking a few blocks (which apparently some people do). The staff is very friendly and accommodating and overall the rooms were adequate. I did notice the occasional stain on the carpet and upholstery in the lobby, but generally the place is clean and well kept.The price was reasonable ($89 per night from Priceline during the off season) but I regretted it when I found out they charged $15 a night for mandatory valet parking. After tips, I'd spent nearly $60 on parking in an area where there is plenty of parking. I guess you're paying for security but I would have taken my chances.If I had my pick, I'd stay at the Bay Street Holiday Inn Express, which has free continental breakfast, reasonably priced parking next door, and is literally across the street from River Street.Clean, friendly staff. Valet parking $18 per day. Free bottles water. Nice clean, pool. Small fitness room. Beds a little on the firm side. If you don't like very soft pillows, bring your own. Air works amazingly. Flat screen TV, coffee in rooms. Fridge in selected room not all. Large walk in shower.Overall the hotel is nice.  Seems new.  The location is right on Bay Street and MLK, making it within walking distance of everything you probably want to get to.  Our room was really, really small.  I laughed when we opened the door.  I thought the bathroom door was going to lead to some sort of sitting area.  If you don't plan on spending a lot of time in your room, it's tolerable.  They have complementary bottles of water, a rarity in hotels.  Valet parking is mandatory, which is $15/night.  There are better hotels along Bay St, but when you book with Priceline you don't get to choose.I booked my hotel for St. Patrick's Day weekend a year in advance. Upon arrival at 3pm I was told there were no more parking spaces available. My husband had to ride around in bumper to bumper traffic for an hour and a half searching for a parking space. He wound up paying $35 per day to park away from the hotel. We were with several other couples that were also staying in this hotel. after checking in and visiting the other rooms and then getting settled into our room we found our room to be much smaller than the others that paid the same $237 per night that we did.  We did not have a refrigerator in the room or a remote to the tv and had to fill the ice bucket up to keep our drinks cold.   I called to the front desk and told her my issues she said that they normally don't put people in that room but they were completely booked for the night. I was surprised being that we made our reservations a year in advance! I talked to the manager on duty and she said that Graham, the GM would call me back to discuss my issue the next day. After 2 days I never received a call so I contacted him. He informed me that all rooms were the same size which is not true. He acted like he didn't want to help me even though I paid the same price that the group I was with and they had a more luxury room with a refrigerator and  much cleaner. He said that he would look into it and call me back. 2 more days passed and never received a call so I called back and spoke with the front desk manager that said he agreed to refund me $20. I was not happy with the refund amount or the way that I was treated by the GM. The front desk manager was very nice and apologetic. When I questioned about the parking he said that they had more rooms than parking spaces which makes no sense. The hotel is a great location and walking distance to all activities.Very affordable! The lady who checked me in was very pleasant and attentive to my needs. I was allowed to check in early and check out late the next day due to a late afternoon flight. The Maritme museum is next door to the hotel. The riverfront is across the street and the Savannah College Art &amp; Design is walking distance. You might only need a taxi if the weather is bad or you can't crawl home. Plenty of bars in the area. I will stay at this hotel again!I enjoyed my stay at the Four Points. It's in a great location, the rooms are clean and the staff is friendly.  A couple of minor points:1.) The room service cards are inaccurate.  They tell you to dial these extensions, when in fact, you're supposed to dial 0.  I thought my phone was broken. When the tech came up, he saw the card and promised to bring it to the GM's attention.2.) They really need to stop putting syran wrap on some of the hot dishes.  I arrived after a long day and ordered room service that first night because I was too tired to go out and find dinner.  My burger tasted like plastic.  I know that it was intended to help keep the food warm, but there's got to be a better way.Great location but awful cleaning service. They didn't refill our shower shampoo dispenser and we came back to a bed not even being made. I'm not a neat freak but I'd at least think they would notice leaving a dishelved bed.Room was smelling; I think because of the carpet. The blanket was a little old and they should replace it. Hotel is convenient to downtown though.Awesome location.  Blocks away from City Market and River Street--and The Velvet Elvis! Hell-O!The room was clean, the halls were nice, the cleaning staff was friendly.Nine dollar all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, Soy Milk, coffee, teas, waffle maker, and a guy who made omelets.  If there was any amenities you needed, or if something wasn't to your liking, talk to the staff.  They were incredibly helpful in every respect.We gave the omelet guy a fat tip for being such a bad-ass.If you're here for any type of special event near downtown Savannah--of even just to stay the night, I totally recommend this hotel.NPWH = Nice People Work HereThat's really all I can say for this place.  Yes, the staff here is friendly, but my stay here this weekend left me underwhelmed.  My room was on the Starwood Preferred level.  Great, except that the bathroom wasn't cleaned before I checked in (providing new towels and wiping down the counter doesn't constitute being clean).  The room was large, it had a large flat screen television, and a very comfortably king sized bed.You can't beat the location as you're only about a block or two from River Street and everything Savannah has to offer.  You can definitely beat the price as there are several other hotels almost next door that are less and seem to offer more (a view of something other than a roof would have been nice).Outskirts is the best description for the location, any further from the historic district &amp; I would have felt cheated. Cons- (If it's a big deal, yes one block west is a section 8). You all but have to use valet $15 &amp; our room had a funny smell. Other than that if you get a great deal this place is worth staying. Pros- Everyone was friendly &amp; helpful. Our room was clean (minus the smell) &amp; well stocked. You are next to the beginning of the riverfront  area &amp; most/all of the resturants &amp; pubs are within walking distance. Got a deal? Stay here.Great location, but I have to give it 2 stars because our room was dirty! Several random stains throughout the room that made me speculate that the rest of the areas that appeared clean weren't that clean either. We were staying in a Starwood Preferred Guest room on the top floor, so if our room looked like this, not sure what the rest would look like... There was an overall musky smell throughout the room floors, although the lobby areas looked/smelled great. On top of that, I saw a HUGE dead bug on my hall... which was still there a couple hours later when I returned to my room.In addition to the cleanliness issues, the valet parking was $15 a night, which I think is a little bit high.LOCATION: On the edge of the historic district very close to attractions such as Riverwalk and Broughton St for shopping. AMENITIES: They have a small pool and gym which were of good quality. On Wed evenings they have a free cookout at the pool with free grilled hot dogs and beer (Sweetwater 420) which was very nice as Wed is when we happened to check in! Free newspapers at each elevator. Free bottle of water each day and complimentary coffee each morning. There is a fridge in each room that is empty and not stocked with overpriced alcohol. Complimentary wireless internet. There is also a computer lab hooked to a printer but we did not use any of that. Not much for upgrades with SPG. We were not able to get the green option in exhange for SPG points as they do not offer that.  ROOMS: Clean and sufficient with flat screen tv's and a comfortable bed. No complaints. We go a room with a view of the bride over the river which was nice although it also did over look the ugly parking lot in the back.PARKING: They will tell you that valet is mandatory in order to charge you $15 per day but if you go down the street there is the Whitaker St Parking deck where you can park for $6 per day with the visitor's parking pass that can be purchased at the Visitor's Center on MLK.  They can't make you park there! Sheesh.PRICES: We paid 4K SPG points for each night so we stayed for free! SERVICE: No problems here. Service was very good. CONCLUSION: Overall nice stay without any problems.  Clean rooms, good service with nice amenities. Not super fancy but of good quality.I am an SPg member, but somehow I am on the second floor in a room with double beds. The jacuzzi was gross with mold and other water mold all over the jets, and the grout between the tiles ranged from black to yellow.  The bed covers looked so old, I was afraid to sleep in the bed. I decided the only safe part are the sheets, but tried not to touch the covers. For a honeymoon, this is not ideal at all and I am upset I used extra points to get a ""deluxe room"" because I am not sure what is so great about this. I am scared what the regular rooms are like. I stayed at a four points in Chicago and I guess it really set my expectations high.(Most of) the employees were very friendly. The person at the front desk really tried to push us to use the valet garage parking (valet only - $15/day + tip). Even though we found street parking, they still tried to charge us for parking for both nights we stayed, though they rectified the bill quickly when prompted. The rooms are nice, nothing special. The surrounding area isn't really inviting to look at, until you realize you're directly across the street from the edge of the historic district and can walk to a number of cool places, including the river. Overall, unless its price was really a lot lower than the other hotels, I wouldn't stay here again.Great time. Fantastic location. Friendly staff!The staff, especially the valet (Sam) were very attentive and professional.  The room was exactly as pictured, the pool area was very nice, and bottles of water are free from the concession area right  by the front desk.  Our room was a double with an awesome flat screen tv, a mini fridge and its own wall thermostat.  The desk was huge and it had an extra pull out side table.  Awesome.  Although at first we thought the neighborhood was a bit seedy, we soon realized that all of the historic district is dirty-eque (harmless homeless asleep on park benches, etc.).  We could walk to the middle of shopping in the historic district in 15 minutes easily from the hotel.  The fire alarm went off due to a smoking clutch parked in the garage at 10:45 p.m.  My sister and I filed out of our room along with sleepy children and roller-laden ladies.  The staff had us back as soon as the problem was checked out and cleared and were so apologetic.  Plus dinner is served in the hotel dining room from 5-10 and the bar is right across from the restaurant.  Cute place, great price, prime location.  We will be back.  The valet park the cars in underground garages.  No safer place for your car, I promise.  Parking on the street would not have been a good idea in this town.P.S. stay away from Tybee Island.  Dirty water, RUDE people, also as it turns out shark infested.  In 2006 a 7 yr old girl was attacked in 3 feet of water.P.S.s.  If you need extra towels, stop at the door by the pool on 2nd floor and grab some.  They had plenty.","At first the hotel looked very nice. The hotel is in downtown area with hardly any view. The room was just a little larger than a walk in closet. The valet charged $18 per day for what they said was underground parking. I then found my vehicle parked outside on an empty lot that was not secure at all. While staying here my senior citizen father was threatened by a vagrant man because he wouldn't buy something from him. The next morning as the family was headed toward our destinations we had to avoid the cleanup of a stabbing that had recently occurred. I usually stay at the Westin but they were full this time because of an event. They referred me to this location because it was their ""sister"" hotel. The price for both were the same and this hotel does not come close to the same quality. I would rate the other location as a 5 star. If you stay here good luck. When I brought all this to the attention of the hotel staff they simply said ""sorry""Be careful if you book here! I used a deal-finder booking website to get a room for cheaper. I checked in a 7pm and was told that all of their king rooms (which is what I reserved) were already taken. On top of that, the room they gave me was right above the busy street and hadn't been fully cleaned. I called down to the desk, and they promptly sent up a non-English speaking woman who had no clue what she was supposed to do in my room. I had to show her where things needed to be cleaned. The staff was very friendly, and their $10 breakfast buffet was pretty tasty and a decent price for downtown Savannah. Also, it is right on the end of the historic district, so DO NOT take a direct left if walking from the hotel. It turns into a shady area very quickly. Plus, you either have to pay the $15/day valet parking or try to find a spot on the street.This hotel is by itself, across the street from the Doubletree.  I was lost and called for directions.  The hotel staff said it was next to the Doubletree parking lot.  It is NOT.  I drove around in circles a few times before my partner got out of the car and noticed the Sheraton across the street with a small sign that said Four Points.I guess the omelette maker only shows up on weekends.  I never saw him/her.  I did not like the hot items on the breakfast buffet and would not have breakfast here again.  The rooms are relatively clean but mine felt claustrophobic and dark.  There is not much lighting in the room.  There was room to walk around the king sized bed but not much more space that that.  My room had a desk and desk chair but no other chairs.  I asked for a quiet room and they put me next to the pool which was nice and quiet.  You do hear people closing their doors in the hallway.  Boom, boom, boom.  Sometimes it was ridiculous.  The rooms were pretty clean and the beds were comfortable.  I had no trouble sleeping.I got this hotel on Priceline.   I would probably not stay here if I had to pay full price.  There is a Best Western and Quality Inn a block down the street.  I'd probably stay at one of them instead.While I was there, the computers ""went down"" for several days.  Apparently they couldn't take any credit card charges.  They could book charges to your room.  It seems rather strange that they could go so long without a working computer system.Wifi was free, which was great!Room was clean, but the housekeepers had a tough time keeping up with that.  The beds were very uncomfortable.  The staff made up for all of that.  They were very helpful.  It was a little further away from the downtown than I would have preferred.Stayed here multiple times and I would come back again. Very close to many restaurants including Paula's.Hotel located just blocks from the River Front, but is located on the intersection of two busy roads; I could hear cars revving their engines and taking off from the red light all night long.  While the first floor/entrance is very updated, the rooms are a bit dated, but comfortable.  A bar is in the hotel, but I didn't try it.  Blackout curtains did not black out.  At check in, they said they were a green hotel, but I didn't really get that feeling during my time there.It's a shame because the hotel is in a nice location and the hotel facility itself is probably a solid 3, but I had the worst customer service experience ever at a hotel here and won't step in this hotel again if someone paid me.  First, the maid service would come in very early, like 7am without knocking.  Our room didn't have a ""do not disturb"" sign, we called the front desk and asked for one, we were told the maids would leave on in our room that day, but they never did.  That was annoying, the people running the valet service were down right rude.  They broke my keys apart, only gave me my car keys back, when I asked where the rest of my keys were, the gentleman shrugged and walked away.  Spent an hour tearing the car apart and the valet closet looking for my remaining house keys.  Found them far underneath the passenger seat.  So annoying.  Because you can't stay here without dealing with the rude valet service.I recently stayed here for a long weekend with a few friends as we worked to plan one of the girl's upcoming weddings. First things first, the location. Not bad. Felt as if it was right on the outskirts of ""Historic Savannah,"" but in walking distance to many of the sights &amp; River Street, etc. Check-in was a bit slow, and the employees all a bit rude - with the exception of the bartender &amp; valet. By the way, valet is the ONLY option - so add about $18 to your bill, each day. Our room was pretty standard, what we expected. Nice blackout curtain &amp; TV. The bathroom was so-so, although they only stocked three of each type of towel &amp; there were four of us - I had to call twice, each day to get enough towels for our group. Aggravating. They also have a free bottle of water on your day of check in. However, when we came in late one evening, totally parched &amp; in need of water, there was NONE to be had. Not at their little ""convenience"" stand which was the only place to grab a drink/snack in the hotel, except for their overpriced restaurant - which had been closed for hours. There was literally a few packs of crackers, chips &amp; a cookie &amp; the only beverage options were beer, wine &amp; regular Coke. When I asked about a bottled water/water fountain/vending machine I was told that there was nothing in the hotel. Nothing. On my way back up to the room, frustrated, I noticed that the bartender was cleaning up for the evening. I asked her about getting a water &amp; explained where I'd already gone to ask, she went away &amp; came back with four mini bottles of water, at no charge. She was very accommodating &amp; understanding, and we left her a generous tip. So, bottom line, other than the so-so location and friendly bartender, this hotel isn't worth much. The service was quite sad, and there really are no other positive factors worth mentioning. If you're looking for another, fairly inexpensive option, I would try the Holiday Inn Express next time - mainly because of their superb location &amp; consistence of service.Nice location. Helpful front desk, surprisingly. Small room but expected amenities were in place.  Located on the edge of all the ""action.""We stayed after getting a great deal on a room at the last minute from a deal site.  I was a bit worried after reading some reviews that it was near a sketchy neighborhood, etc. but once we got there we realized that it was in a great location to historic downtown Savannah and River St.  Sure there are hotels that are right on River St. but a 5 minute walk wasn't bad.  All the staff we met there were very warm, friendly, and helpful.  They offered a roll-up bed for us since we just had a king size bed room with 2 adults and 2 kids.  The valet parking does cost but we just parked across the street from the hotel where there is free parking and didnt have an issue.  The pool was great but not the best for smaller kids since its lowest depth is 3 1/2 feet but it was a nice place to cool off at the end of the day.  The room was very clean and well stocked.  The bed was a bit hard but I sort of expect that from hotels.  The only issue I had was the noise because our room faced Bay St. and a lot of trucks go up and down that street at all hours.  One night the trash truck came right below our room at 1am!!!  Also, for two nights in a row the housekeepers vacuumed the hallway at 9pm.  Thankfully it didnt last long but it was annoying.  Lastly, the wi-fi signal is not very strong and kept cutting out.  There is a breakfast available but we instead chose to walk a few blocks to a local cafe &amp; bakery.  We would definitely go back again if we got a similar deal.Great location, attractive enough, nice concierge. The king room was the smallest I've ever seen, the furniture has been miniaturized to make the room look larger.  The bathroom was tiny. The room shakes whenever anyone on the hall closes a door. Our room was NOT cleaned on the only full day of our stay. I called down to notify them when we returned to the room at 5 and when we returned at 11pm it was still as we left it. At that point I just requested new towels. Only two pillows on the bed that weren't decorative. The valets were not what I'm used to when I come to Savannah, very inattentive and immature. Many other reviewers complained that they had to pay $15 per day for hotel parking but other downtown Savannah hotels charge more than that so no biggie. I would only stay here again in an emergency. It's a hotel with a motor lodge mentality or a maybe a motor lodge masquerading as a hotel.",,,"['great', 'location', 'excellent', 'staff', 'came', 'business', 'greeted', 'valet', 'staff', 'valet',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cotton-sail-hotel-savannah,The Cotton Sail Hotel,4.0,$$$,45,"My husband and I stayed at The Cotton Sail for the first time over Valentines weekend, and we couldn't have been more pleased! We generally visit Savannah/Tybee several times a year, but this was one of our favorite trips. We stayed in a River View Deluxe King with Balcony on the 5th floor, and it was absolutely tops. They've done a wonderful job maintaining the integrity of the historic architecture of the building, while incorporating all of the modern creature comforts we're accustomed to. I saw that there were some negative reviews on rooms on the 5th floor due to noise from Top Deck. I can report that we had no issues with that in our case. However, as we were checking out, it appeared that a couple DID have an issue with the noise on our floor and were requesting a different room. I can report that the hotel staff was nothing but gracious and accommodating and made whatever moves necessary to make sure they were happy and taken care of!The price for valet parking was a bit steep, but for us it was worth it. The hotel is located so centrally in the historic district that there is literally no need for a vehicle during your stay. My husband drives a large truck, so the gentlemen handling it offered to keep it curbside right in front of the hotel, rather than trying to maneuver it into a different parking area and risking damage, which we appreciated. Overall we had a fantastic first stay here, and I'm sure we'll be back!It's midnight and I don't see sleep in my near future at the Cotton Sail Hotel. My husband and I have a room on the 5th floor, which is directly beneath the rooftop bar called Top Deck, which has been playing booming, pounding music for the last couple of hours. I hear party-goers outside and it is just the day after Christmas (well, technically 2 days after, since it's past midnight now).When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see how close to River Street and the general downtown area. You can walk to many places from here and if you park in Whitaker Street Garage, you can avoid the $25 daily valet fee. Our short trip started out well and we were impressed by the beautiful hardwood floors in our room, as well as the clean and modern appointments in our room and those throughout the hotel.But beware, if you are looking to sleep at all at night. I can't speak for the other floors and wish I'd seen the TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews before so that I could have refused a room on the 5th floor. The noise I hear outside can probably be heard from any of the floors, but the dragging of chairs, people dancing/walking in the bar, and the incessant pounding of dance music immediately overhead is enough to drive one over the edge. The beauty of the hotel, its convenient location, and even comfortable bed do not make up for the infuriating noise that impedes slumber. I highly DO NOT recommend this hotel.Stayed her in early November as an anniversary trip. Started out wonderful. Great spot, great room, great location. Then it happened. Roaches in our room. Now that is awful in itself, it's an old historic building so I get it. The probably have paths worn in that their roach ancestors have used. And that's not the reason for my poor review. It's what happened after that did it. So firstly I try to kill them myself (and yes there was more than one) and they both scurry under large furniture. So my wife calls the front desk and it now night so the manager on duty, Duane, speaks with her and after my wife expresses her concern he ask ""what would she like me to do, come and kill it"" so it's at this point my wife is starting to loose it. I didn't hear his reply myself obviously because my wife had the phone. Anyway they send the house keeper. With a rag. And we ask if she has Raid because they are still alive and we want them dead. She was not prepared for that answer. So she panics. Again cause of live roaches. So she runs off to try to find some Raid. 15 minutes later and no returning housekeeper the wife and I both go to the front desk. Duane is there and my wife expresses my concern again and adds the piece about the house keeper and the rag to clean up. (Oh and to add insult to injury we see the housekeeper who is suppose to be looking for raid leaving for the night as we are walking to the front desk)Duane proceeds to ask again, in my presence this time what he is suppose to do and proceeds to give us instructions on how to kill the roaches. This is where I step in. Having heard it with my own ears. I calmly explain to him I know how to kill roaches. That is not the problem right now. We have 2 roaches that are in a room can't be reached by us. Your house keeper came unprepared for what we needed done. And oh she just walked out. I calmly explained that 1. As much as I was paying for the room for 5 days his response was way beyond unacceptable. And 2. His level of urgency to the situation needed to have the following hierarchy medical emergency, fire in guess room, and a guess expressing a concern particularly since us coming there is helping pay his salary. They discounted our stay. But that more than cemented this bad experience for me. I would never stay here again.I know this took me a while to write this review but I really wanted to write this in a calm state of mind. But this experience was too vivid to forget.Everything was outstanding from the minute we got out of our car until we left!  We had a room with a balcony overlooking the River and it was fabulous.  We had no problems with noise or anything and we were on the same level as the concierge.  The rooms were clean, beds comfy, and loved the glass shower!The Manager was the friendliest guy who explained the entire set up of the hotel, how to get down to the River Walk, up to the Roof top bar and restaurant, and check in was a snap! The Valet attendants were ridiculously sweet and helpful and I truly felt like we were guests at this hotel.  Southern Hospitality to the Max!This was the perfect place to stay in Savannah IMO.  On the River, walking distance to so many places, trolley pick up for tours, and very safe.  Oh, and as we were checking out at 10 AM, someone came in early and guess what? They let them check in early! I had a big sad face when we had to leave but we will be back and we still stay longer next time!Thanks Cotton Sail for the perfect first time experience in Savannah!Absolutely love, love,love the Cotton Sail! The customer service is top shelf and they always take grand care of me, will stay no where else when I come to Savannah.This hotel is very beautiful and modern,  great location also.   We valet parked (hurt with a $25 per night charge to park! Charged at checkout)  but we didn't need the car for the two nights there, we walked every where.  The hotel was clean and modern, the rooms very nice and comfy.   I loved the bathrooms they were decorated cool and the shower was refreshing!   My friend was a pain in the butt and kept calling the front desk to ask questions and request things. ... and they were great!....answered all her questions and sent someone up to give her a guide to the tv (lol told you she a pain) The rooftop bar/lounge also decorated beautiful and cool place to hang out!My Fiance and I decided to take a weekend trip up to Savannah this weekend and as it was the last minute, we decided to stay at a place that we've been at before as we didn't have time to research other establishments and I can honestly say that I'm glad we did. Everything seemed far more efficient than last time--from the valet parking to the service in general.  We arrived early and called to see if we could check-in early and were enthusiastically informed that we could. It took less than five minutes to set up parking with the valet and upon entering the hotel, we had our room key cards in our hands in less than 10 minutes where as it took over 45+ mins on our original stay. We were housed in a deluxe room with a king bed and balcony on the fourth floor and had no issues with footsteps overhead due to the fifth floor separating us from the roof top lobby.  If anyone is to stay at this hotel, stay away from the fifth floor at all costs! I'm still amazed at how quiet it was on the fourth floor compared to the fifth.Room and the view was spectacular, but we were also tricked into the room on the 5th floor under the rooftop bar. So crazy loud.  Such a bummer. Everything else was great. Make sure you don't accept those rooms!!We loved this hotel.  Our room was riverfront, and had two huge floor to ceiling windows and beautiful hardwood floors.  The view at dusk was spectacular, and we opened the windows to hear the saxophone player in the square below.  The beds were very comfortable, and the room was spotless (thank you, Simone).  The hotel has valet parking, and an elevator down to the riverfront.  It's close to all the historic attractions, and many good restaurants.The amenities in the room are very, very basic.  There were small tubes of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.  Starbucks coffee in the room, along with a couple of tea bags.  Free Wi-Fi.  That's the extent of it.  No book with info about the hotel, dining, etc.  The shower was cool, but there was nowhere to put soap or hang a washcloth.Other reviews mentioned noise.  We didn't have an issue, but could see how it might be a problem during the busy season.  We loved it here, and would stay again the next time we visit Savannah.Awesome hotel right along the river in the heart of historic Savannah. Very close walking distance to all the sights and restaurants of old town. The rooftop bar is great and offers awesome views of the river. The staff is great though the valet was a bit lb the slow side and there was no bellman to help with bags at check in. The gym was not huge, but had everything you need and was nice and quiet. The room was very comfortable and quiet, even with the gym and elevators across the hall. The cost for parking at $25 a day is a bit steep. The Cotton Sail makes the perfect base for exploring Savannah. Very cool, trendy, modern, but comfortable.Every moment here was wonderful. Each staff member was helpful and hospitable. The location was perfect and the room was breathtaking. The price for a king size bed with a water view and balcony was reasonable. I need to explore the rooftop next time. However, we are already trying to plan our next trip back.I stayed here over the rock n roll marathon weekend and was highly disappointed with the hotel. I had read reviews talking about the noise level, so I specifically asked for a quiet room and they put me on the 4th (lobby level) floor, practically IN the lobby. I heard people all night long hanging out in the lobby, going in and out of the elevator etc and was not able to sleep at all. Certainly not ideal for the night before running a marathon. My room was also cramped and dark and there was no room service or mini frdige. Will not being staying here again.One of my favorite places in Savannah. The conceirge Patti is awesome. We deliver bikes and pick up guests there all the time for rides and trips and from the moment you get there they are taking care of you. Keep up great job guys you have a beautiful hotel and staff .....Savannah On WheelsGoing again for the Thanksgiving weekend. 4th stay since November last year. Love, love, love this place. We always stay in a room with a balcony. Such an amazing location!  The hotel is clean, very clean. And smells great. The only reason I might not recommend this hotel is because I don't want to risk not getting one of our special rooms!  The big cargo ships going by are really a sight to see.Beautiful hotel, great location and a helpful, friendly staff. Rooms are beautiful and modern with hardwood floors and exposed brick. Do yourself a favor and ask for a room with a balcony. The rooftop bar is a separate company from hotel, but it has a great view of the river &amp; bridge, awesome drinks, good food, and friendly staff as well.Exceptional housekeeping staff, polite, friendly, and professional.Knowledgable concierge.Shannon and rest of front office will go out their way to make your vacation everything you want it to be. This was our first trip to Savannah but not our last, and we will definitely be returning to the Cotton Sail.We booked two rooms overlooking the river - one for our kids and one for us - and arrived several hours later than expected, around midnight.  After apologizing for the absence of any signage showing how or where to park in front of the hotel, the desk clerk directed us to a local bar and grill to grab a quick meal.  By the time we got to bed it was well after 2 a.m.  Our room was cramped and poorly designed, with the TV extending from the wall to almost the foot of the bed.The next morning our son was awakened at 11 a.m. sharp when a hotel employee tried to enter his room without knocking.  He fell back asleep, and 15 minutes later the employee returned with the manager, pounding loudly on the door.  It turned out that the check-out time was 11:00 (something we had failed to note and the desk clerk had failed to mention when we returned to the hotel from our meal at 2 a.m.).  No one from the hotel ever bothered to call my son's room, or ours, to communicate about the check-out situation.We wound up paying a half-day's rate to check out at around 2:30 that afternoon.   We are already planning to return to Savannah for a longer visit.  However the Cotton Sail will not be on our list of possible hotel choices for that trip.We literally pulled into savannah and this was the first hotel we were referred to by a local. We walked in and LOVED the decor and the feel of the hotel. We asked rates and asked to see a room and fell in love with the modern/hip vibe.  We booked two nights right away. From start to finish we had a wonderful experience. The staff we encountered were always friendly.The hotel has only been open 3 weeks at this point. I wanted an extra blanket and had to open it out of its package bc it had never been used!! Haha. Pretty coolThis is a newly opened hotel which is truly wonderful.  The rooms have high ceilings, are modern,and very comfortable.  Staff is pleasant and it is right in the middle of everything in Savannah.  Beautiful views of the river.What a wonderful hotel! The location is perfect (right next to the Bohemian and across the street from Moon River) if you want to be between River and Bay Streets. We opted for a city-view and it was very quiet despite the busy, bustling holiday weekend. The room is much larger than many I've stayed in throughout Savannah. The decor is modern, clean and yet still has that Savannah feeling--especially on the outside. Very nice, knowledgeable staff. They even threw a little party (with free pizza and a cash bar) on their new roof deck for the fireworks on the 4th, which was nice. We didn't have to fight for a place to stand or deal with the crazies on River St. Valet is pricey ($25/night) but that's to be expected in Sav. We will definitely be back.Great hotel, perfect location and the staff was wonderful! Will def stay again next time I'm in Savannah.","Right up front, this hotel doesn't have any free parking. You can either valet for $25 or park in the garage across the street for $16/day. Charging this much for a room should grant you free parking. Heck - increase the price of the room by $16, buy a block of spots in the garage, and give me ""free"" parking. Impression management 101, folks.While walking to the doorway on the beautiful front deck, the first thing that hit my mind was ""What's that smell? A barn? It smells like horses..."". The front deck stinks. Badly, and this never changed. I think its because of the restaurant dumpsters that are stored in the alleyway below. Once inside, the hotel is gloriously beautiful. All the style, deco, and fluff you would expect at this price point. Staff were attentive and eager to please throughout our stay.The room is modern, and tastefully done. The amenities are top notch and the Starbucks coffee pod is a nice touch. The floors were wood/laminate and I thought that was kind of cool. Never saw that in a room before. The television remote was a joke. The buttons appeared to randomly work, and there was no 'guide' available. You have to click through each channel to see what's on and decide what you want to watch.We left the room and went for dinner (Tubby's. Get the Captain's Platter. Thank me later) and the skies decided to open up on us. On the way back, we noticed that the hotel has a floor at the canal-level, so we decided to try and take the elevator from the canal back our room. Oopsie! No go. The ground floor elevator doesn't work. Off we went, back into the rain, up the block, up the stairs, past the stinky patio, and into the lobby. Our room was overlooking the river. Marvelous view - horrible for sleepytime. All the noise and activities of the street come right through the closed window. There was some fella playing his sax out there till after midnight. It was nice for an hour or so, but when I wanted to sleep - his playing was like nails on a chalkboard. Speaking of sleep, those cool wood/laminate floors in the room? Yeah. They transmit every stinking step of the people above you - directly into your room. When our upstairs neighbors came stumbling home, they apparently decided to dance the jig in their concrete shoes. Every. Single. Step. They. Made. Broadcast directly into our room as if they were in it with us. Between the sax player and the shenanigans upstairs, we got about 5 hours of sleep before we were up and out at 7 am. Wood floors - they look cool, but they're not idea for a hotel floor unless you're going to soundproof the hell out of them. The bed was comfy but had a massive pit in the center. Yay,All in all, a disappointing stay. It was not a cheap room and you can score a better deal elsewhere in town. We won't be back.Comfortable, Modern, Beautiful Rooftop deck to watch the sunsets over the bridge. This hotel was fantastic, very welcoming and stylish for an affordable price. We got a nice deal showing up last minute so very grateful we were able to get a room. The room was big, super clean and comfortable. All the staff we met were friendly and happy to accommodate us on short notice. Also safe place to park your vehicle. Loved how centrally located it was to local shops, restaurants, and dancing. Riht on the river walk to with a lot to check out. Highly recommend and will stay whenever we go to savannah.Cool atmosphere but drinks are a little pricy. Good drinks but expect about $10 for a mojito.I literally left the hotel after checking in 30 minutes earlier. I had planned a vacation for my husband and I, which consisted of 3 nights in Charleston and 3 nights in Savannah. I was very excited to make this trip as these are 2 cities I had been wanting to visit for quite some time! We spent the beginning of our trip in Charleston which was fantastic! Our hotel was great and I thought that the ""southern hospitality"" would continues here, but boy was I wrong.I spent a lot of time researching hotels in Savannah as I wanted to be centrally located in a safe, yet fun area. I tried to make some reservations at different hotels, but found them to be all booked up. I reached out to one of the hotels asking if they could recommend a hotel in the area at my price point and one suggested I call the Cottonsail Inn. After reading the reviews online I was a bit hesitant, especially when I read things like avoid certain floors, noise level was high and someone was arrested outside their hotel room on the first floor. I decided to take the initiative and call the hotel to book over the phone 7 weeks prior to my arrival. When I called I spoke to a gentleman explaining to him I would love to stay at the hotel, but would like a room on the upper floors. He and I had a lovely exchange and he went on to book me a room with a balcony as well, as I figured I am on vacation live it up! I became excited to visit this place! I reviewed my invoice that day, and right on the invoice it stated ""king bed with balcony."" I called 2 other occasions speaking with the manager ""Wendy"" confirming my reservation and paying for my room in full prior to arriving. Fast forward: we arrive. We arrive at about 5:30, after a long car ride from Charleston. We are greeted by 2 fantastic valets and 1 girl who was AMAZING! I was starting to not be so worried about the reviews I had read. Upon entering the hotel, I walked across this massive deck with tons of seating, which I could see being a hang out place for people. My husband and I head over to the desk, and begin to check in. As the gentleman is taking the information, I asked, we have a room with a balcony correct? He replies, no ma'am, we are all booked. Ok, now I thought I BOOKED and PAYED for a room with a balcony. I don't say anything, as I am on vacation and trying to make the best of a situation. He hands us our room keys and says, you are on this floor down the hall. So, now no balcony and I'm not on an upper floor -- well glad I payed top dollar and for some reason got nothing I payed for. The room: I still say nothing and my husband and I head to the room, which was adjacent to the massive deck out front. My husband and I both looked at each other and said, we can't stay in this room. I dug out my paperwork and right there are the notes on receipt, ""king bed balcony room."" He headed out front to speak the gentleman who checked us in. About 20 minutes later, my husband returns and explains that they only have 1 room left on the same floor. At this point I had had enough. I headed to the front desk, and asked are there any rooms on the upper floors, to which I was told no. They did offer a room on the same floor with a balcony.The service: I explained to the gentleman that I had booked and payed for a room, with 2 simple requests - a balcony and not the first floor. The rooms was 300.00 per night and I was pretty upset that a room which I booked 7 weeks prior was unavailable. The gentleman then turned to me and told me because I booked through a third party, they have no control. Ummmmm, HELLO I DIDNT BOOK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY. He then asked where I got my receipt from -- I explained the hotel. I went on to say spoke with ""Wendy"" and confirmed, and his response was she no longer works here, so there's nothing he can do. I then said well I guess I'll be leaving, to which he said that's fine. Apparently my money isn't green. I walked out of the hotel and the 3 amazing young people I had just met upon arriving were shocked we were leaving. They asked what had happened and I explained. The girl went crazy trying to help me find another hotel and even offered me free valet service. We explained to them that none of this was there fault. Those 3 young people were amazing. Needless to say, my husband convinced me to give the hotel a try, so I went back inside and said, ""I guess I will take the second room."" The gentleman replied, ""we are all booked sorry."" In the midst of all this, I witnessed 3 different families check into the hotel. So, let me make sure I have this correct, there were no other rooms on any other floors available? RIGHT.....the hotel manager never came out to make the situation right. As far as I'm concerned I just wanted what I payed for, nothing extra. I am unsure why I was being punished for not using a third party site, the hotel overbooking, the employee leaving and prepaying....:/The room was beautiful. We had a corner room looking over the river. It was clean and the staff was really friendly. They gave us a free bottle of wine for our anniversary. It's a great location. You can walk to dozens of restaurants and bars. The valet parking is expensive but we parked in a parking garage across the street for 10 bucks a day.Our room was perfect. We had a beautiful view of revived street and they have an incredible roof top bar! I got to watch the hawks play while the sunset was setting! Front desk was wonderful as well. Had an issue with the valet but it was cleared up promptly!Very nice, clean, friendly staff and VERY CONVENIENT to the best of Savannah. Just don't stay on the 4th floor on the city side. People can see into your room so you have to keep the curtain shut. Would have liked to keep them open for more natural light in the mornings. Not a huge deal as we were hardly ever in the room, but something to be aware of.Hotel and beds were nice.  However trying to sleep is another story.  Had a similar experience as another reviewer but this was on the 4th floor,  which is the lobby. This seemed to be a one off situation where there was a celebrity,  wedding party,  and more at the same time.   Management was very apologetic and refunded our stay.  Beautiful hotel though!Above and beyond service with a perfect location! A fresh new Gem in an old city.Upon arrival, I was greeted by three different helpful people who informed me of every parking option and it's cost. They helped me find the best solution for the weekend. The hotel shows so much character with an older feel yet it is still very modern. I ordered chocolate covered strawberries to surprise my wife for our 1 year anniversary. Nicole was so extremely nice that not only did she set them up on an arranged plate on our bed but she had a beautiful gift bag with a hand signed card to congratulate us. Just as we settled in our room, Nicole knocked on the door with extra robes and a beautiful bouquet of flowers for my wife. I never ordered them or requested them at all! We were so floored by such an amazingly warm welcome. One of the coolest things about the hotel is the Topdeck bar which overlooks the river. The location is perfect as well. We will not have to drive anywhere for the whole weekend. I am extremely content that I picked Cotton...Sail for our riverside stay in downtown historic Savannah!The food was delicious! And of course the view was amazing! I was impressed with the service. Rebecca was our waitress and she was friendly and patient, as we had a group of 12 ladies. Very attentive. And the chef came out to say hello...she was lovely! I can't wait to go back!Stayed here for New Years 2015. The hotel itself is gorgeous, within walking distance to everything and the staff is abnormally friendly (I am a city gal, not use to such niceness, but greatly appreciated it!). I only have a few gripes with regards to the hotel itself. First the $25.00 parking fee, we ended up paying it because the hassle of finding somewhere to park wasn't worth it. I just think this price is a tad steep, but for such a tourist filled area, its pretty much expected. Second, the room we were given, although it was pretty and the bed was comfy it was extremely narrow and had we stayed more than two nights this would've drove me insane. Also we had a city view room which was at street level so we couldn't even open the shades the entire time unless we wanted to put on a show (hmm). We arrived at 3:30 (check in is at 3 pm) and our room was not ready, we didn't receive a call that it was ready until almost 2 hours later. Our plan was to arrive and take a quick nap after the long 8 hour drive. My BF mention this to the front desk on the day we checked out and not only did they comp one nights room charge they also comp'd one night valet fee. I thought this was awesome to say the least! I do wish it would've been a gesture made by the hotel, but heck I am not complaining too much that we had to say something because they could have simply said sorry and left it at that. All and all we had a great time while visiting Savannah, and would definitely return, maybe not to this area (way too tourist(ee) for me), but great just the same.I stayed at the Cotton Sail Hotel for a weekend back in February (2/21-2/23). We (my fiance and I) went for a weekend to celebrate our 7th anniversary. We were immediately impressed by the decor of the hotel, and the room itself was pretty immaculate. We had a gorgeous view of the river! The weather in February is completely perfect so we also really enjoyed the deck. We were on the 5th floor, near the elevator, and most likely under the rooftop bar so I was nervous about having trouble sleeping. However, I found it to be mostly quiet but my fiance said he heard a guy snoring. We could definitely hear some noise transfer but it wasn't terrible. Now, the parking cost was steep. But I thought the valet parking was pretty handy and they were fairly fast getting our car out when we needed it. But really this hotel is in a great location so you can walk anywhere downtown! The downsides? When we booked the hotel we made note on the booking that this was a special anniversary trip. For the cost of the room and the quality of the hotel, I guess I expected them to go the extra mile? Maybe leave a little note? Anything, really. This is probably a really minor complaint.. but we spent so much money on this trip, drove a long way, and were just a tad bit disappointed :(. I still liked the hotel and realize I'm being picky, but I would probably select a different hotel next time considering the price with no real extra incentives (no fridge in the room, extra cost for parking, etc). And of course some of the noise issues were kind of annoying but I got by. The cleanliness and gorgeous room/view may have helped. The staff were also friendly. :)It's a new hotel which seems to be working out a few bugs. It's interesting of how  differently people view things. I saw a review that complained about wooden floors where I thought they were great because you are sure they are clean versus carpet. The hotel is super clean and the river view is great. I'd stay there again.This was our second visit to the Cotton Sail.  After finding this fabulous hotel, we'll never stay anywhere else in Savannah.  Originally a warehouse, the Cotton Sail is charming with beautifully appointed rooms.  This trip we had not planned to stop in Savannah, but were nearby.  Savannah is our favorite city to visit so we called the Cotton Sail sure they wouldn't have a room.  We were happy to find that they did.  Granville, the fantastic concierge, remembered us from our first visit and greeted us with warmth.  This is one of the only hotels in Savannah that has an elevator that takes you directly to River St where the party never stops.  There is also a rooftop bar to sit in the evenings and watch this gorgeous city.  The Cotton Sail has become our ""go-to"" hotel.This place is beautiful. Came to the bar for a date the roof gives a gorgeous view of downtown Savannah and river street it's on the pricey side but the view is so worth it and everyone that was working were really nice and attentive. It was a great night so you should give this place a try :)We went to check this place out. New Luxary Downtown Hotel next to the LONG Standing Hyatt Regency.   HmmmmmHotel was nice . Beds are comfy but but the bar upstairs is terrible . Don't stay on 5th floor!!!!! The bar is right on top of you . They play the worst pop dance music and every time a chair moves you get woken .This lasts till about 2:30 then cleaning guy gets there at 7am start the noise all over. The ""balcony"" is a joke , you can't even fit a chair . the hotel should inform customers about the crappy bar, the noise and the lame ""balcony"" .No they wouldn't even give us a discount . They took no responsibility at all. All they said is "" they are not affiliated with the bar so they have no control over noise"". They also said ""it's river street , it's going to be noisy "" . We party just not till 3 in the  mornGreat location and hip hotel. Front staff not particularly helpful, but they helped us in  the end. Housekeeping staff impeccable. Rooftop bar killer. Some rooms small and stuffy. Make sure to get a room with a balcony.I want to start by saying that I wanted so badly to be able to give a 5 star review, but there were a few things that were very lacking on my stay. Firstly upon checking in a bit earlier than the 3 pm standard (advertised) check in time, we were greeted by Dwayne and there seemed to be confusion/lack of communication on his part about our room. He acted very confused about the fact that we needed two king rooms (for 3 people) instead of just one. He took our information, after some looking at the computer, he decided we did indeed have two rooms and informed us neither of them were ready, but that we could go ahead and check our luggage with him, and the car with the valet and he would call us when the rooms were ready. So we walked to City Market to get some lunch and kill some time until we could check in. Around 3:40ish we walked back to the hotel since we had not received a call and it was 40 minutes after check in. Once again we were helped by Dwayne who tried to take our credit card information again, which he had already taken and checked us in previously, after more confusion about needing two king rooms instead of one, he told us one room was ready and he would call the room when the other room had been cleaned. I also requested our luggage that had been checked previously so we could  begin unpacking in the one room, but there seemed to be confusion about this as well, so he told us he would have the luggage delivered to our room and took/kept my baggage ticket. So after waiting in our room for about 20 minutes, I finally went back up to the check in to request the luggage and check the status of the room and was helped by a lady who told me she would have the luggage delivered to the room, which only took about 10 minutes or so, then after about another 20, I went back again to check the status of the room, to finally be told that it was being cleaned but that she could go ahead and give me a key to the second room. So finally about an hour and a half after check in time we had both our rooms and were able to change and get back out to see the city.The other reason I rated this hotel 3 stars is that the cleaning crew is super, super slow. I know this hotel hasn't been open very long, and there is a learning curve, but there is no reason that the cleaning crew should still be cleaning rooms at 4:30-5:30 each day. We left out early each morning, and then would return in the afternoon to change for dinner and rest a bit to head back out, and every evening when we did this the cleaning crew would just be getting to our rooms, which is ridiculous for a hotel in this price range. One day we didn't even get the room cleaned, only towels and coffee because we wanted to be able to stay in our room and change... so we told her we would pass on having the room serviced that day.Another big downside to this hotel, which we we already knew about before booking, is that the elevator does not go down to river street level, which is very inconvenient. You have to walk next door to the Bohemian and take the elevator down to the river level, this is unacceptable considering the price range of this hotel.There is a bit of noise that can be heard from the other floors/rooms, but not as bad as some of the reviews previously stated.Other than the above mentioned items, the stay was lovely. Our experience with all the bellhop staff and valet staff was exceptional, everyone we came into contact was very nice and helpful. The hotel's overall appearance is nice, with beautiful hardwood floors and high ceilings.For the price, I'm not sure we'd stay there again unless I knew beforehand that the rooms were cleaned earlier in the day, and there was river street access.We just came back from a 6 day vacation in Savannah, GA. We stayed at the Cotton Sail and we had a wonderful experience. The hotel is only 2 years old so everything is brand new.  The decor is modern and funky.  Our room was very relaxing with big plank hard wood floors and a ceiling to floor window.  The bed was comfortable, fluffy and cozy with a long body pillow to boot!  The bathroom was very modern with a large shower stall and a lighted makeup mirror.  We  loved everything about the room except one thing: no mini fridge! That's ok, we learned to live without it.  We had a street view which looked down upon Bay St. We enjoyed the busy view, although we didn't spend much time in our room. There is so much to see in Savannah. The staff was wonderful, helpful, friendly and always had a pleasant greeting for us. We booked tours through our concierge and she gave us a lot of good information. There is a roof top bar that serves food and great drinks which we took advantage of on our last night there. I wish we had gone earlier in the week because the view was amazing along River Street.  It was very well decorated and there were lots of tables and sofas outside the bar area. The one downfall of our stay at the Cotton Sail was the $25 daily fee they charged to park your car. There isn't a whole lot of parking in Savannah so they valet the vehicle and park it in a garage somewhere up the block. We didn't know this until our arrival and at that point you really have no choice but to pay the fee. I still feel we would return to this hotel because our hospitable experience outweighed the parking fee. It is a beautiful building located right along the river and it's conveniently located.  We even extended our stay for an extra night because we didn't want to leave Georgia!","What a fabulous find:) I had booked a room at a chain hotel that recently had some negative reviews on Yelp...fortunately, I was able to cancel my reservation and check in here. From the valet, the front desk, bellman, and concierge....everybody was soo friendly and accommodating! My daughter and I had a wonderful stay. The location was fabulous...what an  amazing view....I could watch the ships forever! We were treated to a fabulous firework display on Friday night:) The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable....very green and upscale at the same time. I will definitely be back to visit Savannah soon and will not consider staying anywhere other than the Cotton Sail Hotel:)Our stay at the Cotton Sail was great!!  We visit Savannah at least once per year and love trying new places.  This property is just a couple of months old so it was perfect.   Located between Bay St. and River Street;  the location is stellar.  You never have to use your car in the historic district as it is central to all trolley stops and free shuttles.  The staff is wonderful;  very friendly and accommodating.  Make sure you drink the tea in the lobby!!!  It is YUMMY!!!!  We booked a deluxe river view king room with balcony and it truly was just like the website depicted.   The website never shows the ""bacony"" and for good reason.  It really is not a balcony like one would think (see photo).  Please understand that it is for standing only; if you are brave!!  Do not book this room category if you're wanting a tradional balcony that you can sit on; this balcony is about 2.5 feet long and 18 inches deep.  Men with large feet may not fit unless they stand sideways.  That said, it may not be worth the extra money if you want an outdoor area to enjoy.  The valet parking at $25 a day seemed a bit steep so we chose to get a visitors pass at the Visitors Center; 2 days for $12 (weekends are free).  Found a great spot on River Street and stayed there our entire trip.  The Top Deck bar has a great view with decent food and beverage options.  All in all I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.Our first stay in Savannah and this hotel was a great place to start.  Got into town early and called to see if our room was possibly ready so we could take advantage of valet parking.  It was 11:30 a.m. and they said our room was ready.  Standard check in time is 3 p.m.   All of our parking attendants were very helpful in loading our goods and taking us to our room (and retrieving things my husband had left in car) and when we left in the rain, offered umbrella escort to keep my hair dry!!!  You guys ROCK!  The River View room was FABULOUS!  Celebrating our daughter's birthday, the roof top bar was very cool.  Would definitely stay again, free parking would be nice as well as fridge and microwave in room.We stayed at the Cotton Sail Hotel for one night in Savannah and we wish we never had. We could not have been more disappointed and dissatisfied with the way we were treated by the staff. We had booked and paid for a 'Deluxe 1 King Bed, Balcony, River View' room with the hotel through Expedia; however, upon check-in we were put into a room without a Balcony. When we confronted guest services about the discrepancy, we were told that according to their computer system we did NOT book a room with a Balcony - which we have received confirmation for - and that there were no more vacant Balcony rooms to switch us into. In attempt to appease us, the front desk representative promised to ""take care of things with Expedia"" before our check-out the next morning. 10 hours later...we hear nothing and gave front desk a ring once again. This time the assistant manager picked up. She claimed to know nothing about our issue and after questioning the validity of our story and stating that it is ""entirely Expedia's fault"", she finally said she'd make a phone call for us. Couple minutes later, she informed us that she was not able to reach anyone at Expedia, reason being that the staff were off for Memorial Day Wknd and that there was nothing she can do for us until the next Tuesday at the earliest. She even accused us of booking with a third-party vendor instead of directly with the hotel!At this point, we were more than frustrated and felt greatly disrespected as customers; the assistant manager's attitude and demeanor were apparent that she did not care about any issues that had to do with a third-party vendor. Outraged, we proceeded to call Expedia, got an operator on the phone, got the assistant manager of the hotel on the phone with us, and obtained the appropriate refund within all but 5 minutes of time!! Wow, obviously she [assistant manager] did not try really hard...We are disheartened to see that the management of Cotton Sail was never serious about resolving booking issues for their customers like us from the get-go. And worst of all, not one sincere apology was given by the assistant manager before we stomped out of the hotel. We should have known better and avoided booking with a Just Opened (big red flag!) hotel with staff that lack proper training and an uncaring, incompetent management. Feel free to stay at the Cotton Sail if you wish to have an management that will no longer view you as equals when you book through a third-party vendor. We certainly will never step into their doors again, nor will our friends and family.I was recently having lunch with three ladies downtown savannah.  After lunch we where walking past the cotton sail hotel and thought we look around the foyer and check out the dinner menu.  There were two ladies inside the lobby and they could not have been ruder even if they tried.  We all agreed we would never go there again.",,,"['husband', 'cotton', 'sail', 'first', 'time', 'valentines', 'weekend', 'pleased', 'generally', 'visit', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'favorite',

Clean,bright,friendly,efficient with convenient if somewhat expensive parking, there is a public parking lot next to the property that is a rather less expensive option is not using your vehicle everyday.Rooms are large ,bright,spotless and airy with a large Television that seemingly features every ESPN station known to man.Charging stations abound and lighting is plentiful...even the windows open if fresh air is your thing but our AC unit worked overtime on that unseasonably warm late December weekend.Beds are firm but comfortable,bedding crisp and pillows plentiful,Bath room and amenities top notch with a mini fridge in every room as well as free basic WIFI. {A most welcomed perk}I omitted 1 star simply because in a world class city accommodation a powered mini safe is essential in easing a traveler's mind that all their electronics,credentials and valuables are secure.I have stayed here before but have never been so impressed!  From the moment we pulled up to valet to our (well worth the extra price/endless choice) breakfast, the staff never failed to impress! We were in Savannah for a conference and although we elected to walk to the meeting,  The Courtyard made our stay well worth it.  Shout out to the following for making our stay!!--Front Desk: DeAundra and JaketaBreakfast: Michelle and ShaniceEntire valet staff and pretty much everyone else I encountered! ! ;pThis will not be high end but it's decent. The room is comfortable. We were there over a holiday weekend and you could tell they were not use to being busy but they tried and they were nice. It is in a good location, across from the civic center and railroad museum. Would stay there again if the price was rightI give this hotel three stars because of the nice staff and the great location.  First, the staff.  These folks did whatever I asked and did it with a smile.  The staff kept tanks of infused water/sweet iced tea/lemonade full as often as possible.  When it is 98 degrees and 100% humidity, having the fluids available in the lobby is key.  When we asked the staff to hold onto our bags after checkout, they did so. Second, the location is ideal.  Everything we wanted to see, do or eat in downtown Savannah was within walking distance. The hotel has valet  parking, but there is also a public parking garage.  You don't want to park on the street unless you want third degree burns when you touch the door handle.But there are some problems with the room.  The bathroom was not very clean.  The floor tiles are discolored by brown gunk that appears to be permanently attached to the grout with no serious  effort to clean the tiles.  The bathroom was also swarming with a veritable army of small ants.  That isn't a huge problem, but it also isn't a sign of a well managed hotel.  I had that problem at home - I hired an exterminator and the ants never came back. If I can handle that, a hotel should be able to do so as well.  The bathroom tiles look like someone tried to kill the ants with a sledgehammer.  They are cracked in multiple places near the shower and sink where the maintenance staff was apparently chasing the ants.  So the bathroom needs to be renovated and the cleaning staff needs some training.Another weird problem- the mirror in the hotel room proper is blocked by the TV.  If the mirror is so unimportant that it is blocked, take it out or mount the TV on the wall.  The hotel management should probably have been able to figure all this out without my review. This hotel also needs to buy fitted sheets that actually fit the mattress.  Were were constantly fighting with the sheets and remaking the bed.Nice location (main reason I gave an extra star), it's only a short walking distance to the Riverfront area. The hotel was up to par. Parking on the street is free on the weekends, so if you can find a spot grab it, I didn't pay for valet. There is a parking garage across the street, I'm not sure of the rates, but I parked there one night for 5 bucks and the attendant just waved me out the next day.Beautiful place to stay while visiting Savannah.  The staff are very helpful and friendly which always makes things so much easier.  Although our group arrived a bit early, the manager was kind enough to allow us to utilize one of their conference rooms to store our luggage until it was time to check in.  The rooms are really nice with a most splendid comfy bed and a spacious bathroom.  The hotel is located in a pretty convenient spot and you're able to walk around quite a bit to explore the area without feeling like you're fall over from fatigue.  A most pleasant experience with one exception...one of the night managers said someone in our group was causing problems by knocking on other peoples doors but she couldn't give specific details which was a bit strange.  Anyway, aside from that, I'd say it was a great stay!I enjoyed my short stay here in the historic district of Savannah. This hotel is in a prime location within walking distance of the beautiful historic homes, brick sidewalks. and quaint squares of Historic Savannah.The valet service takes forever here and seemed to be a bit poorly organized. They left the keys to another guest's car in the cup holder of our car. A potential huge inconvenience to another guest! Luckily - they didn't need their car in the short time we were gone. The lobby is spotless, well decorated, and cozy. I loved sitting by the fire as I happened to be in Savannah during a cold snap. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. My room was also spotless and well decorated. The bed was IMMENSELY comfortable! I didn't try the breakfast buffet myself - but I heard mixed reviews on the waffles :)I would definitely stay here again.Well it all started when we got there and we tried to check in and they told us they didn't have a reservation even though we had a confirmation number. They called our reservation FRAUD!! Of all things fraud. The front desk clerks attitude was terrible she acted like she didn't wanna be there at all. Then we found out it was valet parking only!!! I thought to myself if they mess up my car then I will sue, come to find out when we leave the license plate was completely bent and messed up and the girl who drove it up there acted like this was so rare and asked me if had always been like that... Come on lady you think i will have my license plate completely horizontal!!!! They tried to fix it but there will need to be a replacement plate. Overall customer service was awful and terrible. Only one employee seem to be the nicest and smartest apple in the bunch.The actual room itself could've been better. I found a blood spot on a pillow... I'm thankful i brought my own. The walls were super thin and u could hear the people moving around in other rooms. We got back one day and there was a wet spot on the floor... I'm guessing they spilled the ice bucket cause it was empty when we got back, the wet spot stayed the whole time. The view from the room was nice but it was noisy. The elevator was very crappy and had dim lighting, creaking walls, awful smell, and moved very slow. The mini fridge in the room was set too cold, froze my drink and made a soda explode.The little kinda cafeteria by the front desk was very convenient and nice. The pool and hot tub were very nice. Location was amazing.  I Would never recommend this hotel to anybody. Just an overall terrible experience.I'm giving this hotel 2 starts because the lobby is pretty and the staff is extremely nice BUT there was a HORRIBLE smell throughout the hotel that I could smell from inside my room-- the kind of smell that makes your eyes water. At first I thought it was coming from outside so we called the front office to inquire, only to be advised that there is a nearby factory that secretes this odor, which in turn is pulled into the hotels central air system through the outside air intake unit.  Simply uncomfortable and unpleasant.  I will not stay here again!If you're going to visit Savannah, be sure you stay in the Historic District. Even if you pay a bit more for your hotel, you'll save time since you can walk to pretty much everything. The Courtyard fits that bill, and it's a beautiful hotel. It's not huge - five floors, I think - and the lobby and rooms are beautifully decorated. I uploaded several pictures to help you decide if this is the place for you. The location really is wonderful. You are within walking distance to several bars and restaurants, one block from the Old Savannah Tour trolley stop, and a 10 or 15 minute stroll from popular tourist attractions like the Mercer-Williams house. As for the hotel itself, it'd be five stars if the staff picked it up a notch. Generally, I found the staff here wasn't quite up to the standard I expect from Marriott, but no huge problems. They could be a bit dismissive and borderline rude at times, but oh well. Savannah is easy to navigate, so hopefully you don't need to rely on Marriott's employees here too much. The room I was in was a standard king, and also had a couch, desk, and flat screen. Bathroom was fine - nothing special (and the floor could have used a bit more attention...). Whomever Marriott hired to do the decorating in this hotel is a keeper. Everything is classy and beautiful, from the dressers to the little decorative pillows on the couch in the room. No restaurant in the hotel, but there is a bar and lounge area. Still, if you're in Savannah, spend as little time in the hotel as possible - it's an amazing, beautiful, richly historic city!Excellent stay. Everyone from the valet to front desk to bartenders to breakfast server to housekeeping was incredibly kind and made this a great stay. Happy hour is such a deal. We loved sitting outside in the courtyard it was our favorite spot.From the second you walk in the front door, you're family. Miss Jackie made our 3 day stay wonderful. A sweet caring person that everyone looks to for the right answer. Gym good. Breakfast excellent. Location, 3 blocks from the action. The place is looking a little tired. I'm sure an overall is going to be done in the near future. Ironically the other Marriott we usually stay at was closed due to renovations. Lucky are we.Overall the hotel, personnel and service was very good.  I would recommend this property as it is in a very good location with respects to the downtown area and the rates are good.  The only negative is the valet service.  The hotel recommends that you call down 30 minutes ahead so you car will be ready at the time you wish to depart, however, you still have to wait an additional 20 to 30 minutes for your car to be brought up.Hotel staff is all very friendly.  I had a corner room and had 2 large windows in my room that provided a beautiful view.  The breakfast staff was my favorite and exceeded my expectations.  The water pricing in the market was a little high but they do provide free cups of water.This hotel is absolutely gorgeous.  It looked like it was created by one of HGTV's great designers- everything was so beautiful!  Bed and pillows were really comfy and the staff was friendly and helpful.Location is a few blocks from where all the restaurants are but if know Savannah, you know you will be walking a lot.  I personally like the walk because it's beautiful, gives you a chance to see the  city and lets me burn off some of those calories I'm sure to consume while there!!  The hotel was one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, and I've stayed in some 5 star $300+/per night places.  They also offered free sweet tea, flavored water and coffee throughout the day which I thought was nice. The only negative was that there wasn't a huge amount of counter space near the bathroom sink, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Oh, and the only parking at the hotel is valet and it's expensive.  Luckily, we were told that there is a lot of street parking nearby (very very close) and the city doesn't check the meters on the weekend, so we parked for free the whole trip.It's a Marriott. It's a Courtyard by Marriott. WiFi is free if you do not mind it being a little pokey but I have been to other places that make the free service seem fast here. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The area off the lobby is large enough to burn time comfortably if you have a late flight out of town and car retrieval is pretty quick for valet parking.The location is really good for almost anything SCAD and of course Savannah itself is a wonderful city to explore.I was going to Savannah for the first time and had no idea where to stay. I looked at a map because I wanted to be close to the action where I could walk a lot. My budget wasn't big, so this place fit that also. The location ended up being really good. I could be down by the river by walking in about 15 minutes. Also, it was right by the Savannah Visitor's center, so I just went a few steps and was able to buy a ticket and jump on the trolley. **Big tip: at the hotel you can pay $18 to valet. Which isn't bad, but I learned from some fellow travelers that you could park at the Savannah Visitor's Center for ""Free"" if I think you bought a trolley ticket. I don't remember the exact deal but a lot less than $18 a day. Plus they said it was super safe! The valet was way too slow! Only one girl out of the whole crew was busting her butt to try to make it run smoothly. That was annoying the morning I was trying to get out of Savannah. I waited for like 20 minutes to get my car which was annoying! Everything in the hotel is modern which I like but it kind of disguises problems. But, honestly I was barely in my room, so it was fine! The wi-fi was slow, but free. I didn't like that they made you pay $11 for breakfast, so I just found my own around town. I would rather do that anyway. All around though it was a fine hotel. It was affordable and like I said a very good location. Savannah is a wonderful city and if you're like me you won't be in your hotel much.Staff was great , rooms clean, I would like to personally say thank you to Frances who took very good care of our group of 16 for 2 nights . She had our conference room cleaned &amp; prepped with coffee &amp; drinks &amp; snacks. During the evening she covered for the bartender who was out on maternity leave then coming back in early in the morning to set up our room again . She actually followed up with us to make sure everything was ok. Frances is a rock star !Great place for the whole family! Unfortunately it rained during our short stay. Otherwise, not only the rooms are very clean and roomy, but the whole area was a nice place to experience.The grounds had a couple of awesome pools with slides.  The beach wasn't too far to walk to. The location was exclusive all you need at your grounds.This is my first Yelp review.  I'm a long time Marriott rewards member and have been very loyal to Marriott, in particular the Courtyard product.  I travel for work a great deal and stay at a Marriott 2 to 3 times a month.  This is literally the first bad experience i've had with a Marriott.  The lady checking me in was too busy eating her lunch and checking her cell phone to check anyone in.  Forget anything complimentary, a small bottle of water at the front desk will cost you $3.00, i would hate to think what anything else costs.  The ""workout room"" looks like something out of the 1980's.  The hotel room was humid and there is constant traffic noise.  I will be coming to Savannah again but not staying here.  There is a Springhill Suites one block closer to the river.","Nice hotel with a nice location for getting around. The beds do need to be replaced as they are way to soft but other than that, very nice. the concierge lady, Sharon?, was so pleasant and loved booking our tours with herThe hotel was clean and efficient.  About a 15 minute walk from both Forsyth Park and River Street.  Valet parking was never an issue.  Don't bother to eat breakfast there. There are plenty of decent coffee shops and cafes nearby. The front desk can get backed up, especially during prime check-in and check-out times.Overall, I'd stay again.  It was decently priced, clean, and well located.  We didn't spend much time in our room as we were busy exploring the city!At checkin we were told no parking except on the street which was full. Only other option $15 for valet. Rooms small and outdated with bathrooms from 70's. Mini fridge empty and had to go to the ""mini market"" downstairs. Felt more like a hostal than a hotel. Location is ok but a bit of a walk honestly. Try another hotel in the area if u can. Clean comfy beds but that's all.We stayed two nights passing through on our way home from Florida. The hotel is situated in a nice location convenient to everything. We found the accommodations very comfortable and were especially thankful for their very comfortable bed.The staff at this location are wonderful! So professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping took the time to greet us and ask us if we needed anything. I don't know if it's a management thing or a southern hospitality thing but they have it right 100%!I arrived at 11 pm and they were sold out.  The staff were so great that they found a room where the carpet was drying after some spilled water and they gave me this room.  It meant so much to me be able to sleep after a day of travel.  The room was beautiful.  Thank you!!This hotel is in a great location, within walking or a short driving distance of Savannah's famed historic district. Its luxuriant courtyard and pool are a lovely oasis in the middle of the city. I particularly liked the friendly, very capable staff. Upon learning about my birthday, the check in clerk pleasantly surprised me by upgrading my room to a spacious suite. Breakfast was delightful because of the friendly, knowledgeable servers, Jerrylean and Michelle, who never left our cups unfilled. A concierge booked our restaurant reservation in less than a minute. They made a big birthday very special. I really appreciated it. Thank you, Jan G. St. Simons Island, GAGreat location, convenient to much of Savannah's offering.  Staff was friendly, the place was pretty quiet.  We had a room on the top floor, at the corner of MLK and Liberty Street. Very spacious and had a gorgeous view of the bridge. It was a bit noisy late into in the evening (truck traffic on MLK), but it did not cause a sleepless night.  Parking is valet-only at a cost of $14/day with unlimited in/out. Staff was nice, our room was clean and comfortable.  Across the street is a great beer bar, The Distillery, and the bartender there had nice things to say about the Marriott staff.  Right around the corner is also a great beer bar--the Crystal Beer Palace. Check it out.  We decided to stop in the restaurant for breakfast on the morning of our departure--it is a limited buffet (think continental plus) and not quite worth the price tag.This hotel grants discounted rates for South University students. 3/1-3/3 was my second visit. Currently, they are remodeling the rooms and I must say they are nice. I gave this hotel a low rating because  I had things missing. When I went to class I left my dansko and medication in a bag in the room. Apparently, the maids/cleaners liked my shoes and medication. No, it wasn't narcotics. It was blood pressure medication and 800mg motrin. Why would anyone want my work shoes?? Yes they are nice and comfortable but WTF. Management said they were filing a claim. why would managment tell me theft is not a problem at their hotel when my cardizem is gone and my shoes?? What do i have to gain by having to buy more meds??Watch your possessions!!!! Hide your medications and dansko prospective studentsThis is the 1st time I have ever stayed at this paricular hotel in Savannah.  It is 8 years old, and still in great shape, carpet a little worn in the room but all else is modern, clean, and in good shape.  The rate was very good, so frees up more money for more important things like cocktails and snacks down by the river.I have stayed at several hotels in Savannah over the last 10 years, I have to say this one is equal or better, but at about 1/2 the cost as some of the others like the Marriott on the river, which is old and run down in comparison.Service was attentive and concierge was adequate. Rooms were nothing too fancy but price point was perfect -- and for ~$100 a night you really can't complain. If you feel like spending a little more, I'd suggest getting the suite (I paid an extra $20) and it is more room than we knew what to do with. Included a balcony, huge room (with desk, sitting area, etc), and a massive and separately doored living room. Probably total size was 2-3x that of a normal room for an extra $20, seemed worthwhile. Also I was surprised by the lack of free toothbrush, but after a call to the front desk they sent two up from their internal store free of charge.Short walk to anywhere you need to be in Savannah as well. Across from the Distillery and a very quick morning stroll to Gallery Espresso.If there was an option for zero stars, I would choose that. I had a very bad experience at this hotel. I stayed for seven nights.Firstly the room layout is very poorly designed. The sink mirror is so far away that you have to shave using the closet mirror. The sink lighting is also very poor, distant, and dim making it difficult to get ready. The toilet never stops flushing unless you take off the top and pull up the bladder. The bathroom ceiling light fixture would violently fall off every night, waking me up and cracking the tiles on the ground. Of course the cleaning person reinstalls it each day so when I'm in the bathroom I have to protect my head incase it fell on me.The condition of the room was awful. The AC smelled like potent mildew. I could smell the mattress through the sheets (a mixture of body odor and mold). The pillows were old and uncomfortable. The bedspread had spots of dried blood on one side. The TV remote was crusty. It looked like it had never been cleaned. The carpet was gross, I had to walk around in sandals because I would find toenail clippings from previous guests stuck to the bottom of my feet.They said it was one of the best rooms in the hotel so I can't even imagine the others. You're supposed to call ten minutes ahead for valet in the morning, except they are so understaffed that they rarely answer the phone. If you continue to call, it transfers to the concierge where they answer and hang up immediately just to stop the phone from ringing. This means you have to be in the lobby at least fifteen minutes ahead of when you would normally leave to try and flag down a valet driver to get your car.I happened to break the handset on the phone. They charged me $250. I went back to the hotel to attempt a negotiation with the hotel manager a more reasonable price. She began the conversation with an arrogant and condescending approach as if I were a criminal, not a customer. I mentioned that I spent over $1200 over the past week at her hotel and she proceeded to tell me that's irrelevant because my company was going going to reimburse me. She then said I was trying to ""strongarm"" and ""intimidate"" her? She then pulled the feminism card, saying she doesn't appreciate when men treat her like a woman. This came out of nowhere. She then threatened to call the police so I could answer for the phone's broken handset. Really?? She refused to help me. After about a half hour of her finger-pointing and threats, she ended up reluctantly agreeing to charge me $50 for the broken handset. I left with a horrible taste in my mouth feeling abused and beat down. I was shocked how poorly she handled the situation, especially from a professional standpoint. I will never be returning to this Marriott, and potentially any Marriott for that matter.staff was friendly. Price is low - which is good.Valet parking is reasonable priced....BUT they dont offer one-time free toothbrush....We have stayed at this hotel five or six times. Will never go back .  Terrible customer service from the manager down to the bartender.  Room dirty, loud traffic noise, on and on a bad experience.Nice hotel!! Great location, walking distance to River St. For the price you can't compare to others around that are way more expensive. Nice and clean with very comfortable rooms. We got a better price right there at the hotel than anything else online. Very friendly staff as well!It's is remodeled but rooms were halfway done. New carpet and paint but old furniture and beds. Owner got greedy.We had a great stay at this hotel! Very nice for the money. (We paid $146.) Great furnishings, very classy. A great location, just a short walk (or bike taxi!) to the City Market Arts District and River Walk. Amazing architecture in Savannah, with TONS of great restaurants and galleries. I look forward to staying there again!We stay at the Marriott every time we visit Savannah.  It's centrally located, across the street from the Welcome and Transportation Center (Which is where you hop on the tours and trolleys.)  It's in the gorgeous Historic District of Savannah, and well within walking distance to most anything you'll want to see in Savannah.The hotel is very Southern Elegant in decor, with printed wallpapers, window treatments, and wall sconces.  The front desk staff is always cheerful and welcoming, and the bellstaff go out of their way and really earn their tips.  (It was the bellman who pointed us to a ""Local"" Soul Food joint just up MLK Boulevard that was just fantastic.)The rooms are spacious, with large windows, and insanely comfy beds.  There is also a large flatscreen TV, free High-Speed Internet, and a desk/sitting area.  Seriously, though, the beds are AMAZING.The courtyard in the rear is a nice place to chill, with a pool and chaise lounges, but the view north is a bit... shall we say... ""Old Savannah.""  While I found it part of the charm, and ran out to photograph the crumbling buildings and bent wrought iron gates and fire escapes, some might find it ""dilapidated"" or ""ghetto.""  (Side Note:  Savannah itself is a quirky juxtaposition of Southern Gothic Charm and Run Down, Rotting History.  It's fascinating.)Their prices are definitely right, for a business-class hotel with great service that's right where you want to be, you can find rates near $60 a night. I guess that's why we keep coming back.This is a conveniently located and comfortable hotel. The staff is pleasant and the room is acceptable, although the interior of the hotel could use a bit of polish.For me, the only real negative was parking -- they offer valet only. I don't like to valet park, I don't like waiting for the valet or in general, to have strangers in my car. Note that I really, really DISLIKE valet parking. Only adding to my dislike was the line of well over 10 cars (waiting for ONE valet attendant on shift) when I pulled up on Saturday afternoon. It caused me brief waves of distress (additionally, I felt an urgent need to pee and it was making me cranky). And so, instead of waiting, I found public parking spot nearby and came bounding into the lobby. However, public parking is not easy to come by and this hotel does not have sufficient charm to compensate for what I consider a fatal flaw.We generally enjoyed our stay.  The courtyard and pool area is charming and seemed to be secure but the run down area behind it is a little creepy.  The hotel employees go out late at night to smoke and prop the gate open which made me feel a bit unsafe.Parking was limited but valet is reasonably priced.It's within walking distance of all the cool places to go near the river and the historic neighborhoods.  The walk to the river is a bit of a hike but not terrible.There are more expensive hotel properties that are closer to everything but I'd stay at this Marriott again.It was a really nice hotel with very helpful staff.The concierge, Karen, is very committed to helping you enjoy Savannah. I have to say that the staff in the restaurant in the hotel don't want to be there and you can tell.The one biggest thing I have to say that I thought was a negative mark, was having to pay for the internet in the business center, and using a broken down browser to do so.But in the end, it's just another chain hotel.","Love the new lobby and room renovation the only place I stay while in Savannah.Mmmmm... Wonderful hotel.I stayed here for business.  The conference rooms were decent, the conference food was well done, the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful.  I found the business center useful and convenient.  The ladies in the bar were a zany hoot.  The beds were comfy and rooms were warm with nice toiletries.But, truthfully, the best part of this hotel was location, location, location... these are things I would not want my business partners to necessary know, but post-conference, this hotel is walking distance to get your drink &amp; boogie on!  Blocks away from shopping and great bars like Jinx and The Bar Bar (no that's not a typo), just down the way from Corleone's Trattoria, a short walk from the river front... and the best news?  When you have had your fill of drink... you can WALK home!  I love a safe and convenient downtown area.Room was fine, price was right. I wouldn't stay here again, if I could help it.Nice Courtyard hotel.....staff was friendly and nice and had a lovely garden and pool area and enjoyed our stay here well enough.  Was not the Top but not to bottom either.  Good value for the money.I still cannot get over how friendly everyone is here. Every single employee that walked by would go out of their way to greet you and ask if you needed anything. There are a few hotels closer to downtown but for this price the extra walk is worth it. Besides you can park for free downtown if its the weekend. The only thing that bugged me was in order to use the laundry facilities you needed quarters and there was not anywhere convenient to get change.Nice and clean with comfortable beds.  The walls between rooms are super thin so you get to listen to you neighbor's TV and hear when they take a shower. Also wifi signal is pretty weak.Staff was good, Manager Sylvia is totally useless. Avoid the restaurant, they do not know the basics and do not seem to care. The location of the hotel is good, close to the DOT stops, couple of attractions, walking distance to some good food spots. Valet is a rip-off but I guess parking in Savannah is a commodity. Run of the mill courtyard.The staff is wonderful! I truly believe that is what makes, or breaks a hotel, and they are awesome! The location is good, not right in the middle of everything, but we could walk anywhere from the hotel and not be totally exhausted.Decent hotel for the price. Undergoing renovations in dining room and in the exercise room. Parking is 14 a day, breakfast is $8. Sort of a walk to river street if you're not the hiking typeWe stayed here November 2008.  We got a good rate through Marriott's friends and family. This hotel is on the outskirts of the historic district but, happens to be right across from the Savannah visitor's center, all the trolley tours and a public parking garage. My recommendation would be to get an $8 parking pass at the Savannah visitor's center across the street that is good at all public parking garages and metered parking areas that are 1 hour or more in all of Savannah. The pass is good for 48 hours. Then tell the hotel you have the pass and they can take off the $12 a day fee. The hotel and staff were very nice. We will definitely stay hear again. If you are looking to stay in the middle of the historic district, this hotel is not for you but, it was an easy walk to many places and a very nice hotel.Free coffee, friendly staff, good location.We stayed here as part of a Southern swing road trip, and were pleasantly surprised by this location.  The rooms are large and spacious, the beds are large and comfy, and the hospitality is warm and friendly.They also have free coffee, which is a good way to get in my good graces.Parking is valet only ($12).  I'm led to believe they might have a small crime problem in this neighborhood, since there is no near street parking, and the hotel locks itself down every evening.The location is this hotel's best asset.  It's at the edge of the historic district (about 10 blocks from the heart of the district), and it's practically across the street from the city's official visitor center and the railroad museum.  It's very easy to catch a trolley tour from the visitor center to see the rest of the city. (See: Oglethorpe Tours)Well where do I start... I am typing this as  I lay in bed on the night before we leave....My husband got some free vouchers for a 2 night stay at a Mariott hotel and they were upgraded passes so we got free breakfast for both days of stay. We were so excited about a quick get away with our sons on Labor Day weekend. First of all we checked in and the front desk person did not take our vouchers. He said to keep until we check out.(Keep in mind this wasnt the first time we used vouchers like this). I thought this was strange but we agreed. He then asked for a credit card to hold in case of accidents...etc... So that was fine... Well a couple minutes later I checked my bank account and $200 was taken out. So we confronted the front desk again(same person) and e said that it was just a hold and it would be put back on there the next day after checkout. Ok fine.... Well we had a great day. The next morning checked our bank account and another $240 was taken out....by now we are furious... You don't mess with my money! So we went and talked to front desk. (This time we spoke with a front supervisor). We explained that now $440 was taken out of our account not as a hold but a transaction. Well long story shirt we talked to the GM and he could not get our bank account to release the funds. It was going to take 7-10 business days to reverse the transaction. Bull crap!!!!!! So after all that the GM offered a $100 gift card so we could go home with some money. Thank goodness so we can get home! But still we are out $440 that we were going to use for fun stuff for us and the kids on vacation and it was ruined by someone that cannot do there job by running my card for a trip that should have been 100% free. Oh and the GM said that the card should've not been ran and the vouchers should have been collected at checkin. If the not so smart person that checked us in knew how to do his job, then I would be going home with a lot more money. I hope my money gets put back in my account ASAP. On a good note,the room is nice,breakfast was good, the staff were friendly, but what they did messing with my money I hope they would realize what it would feel like for me to pull $440 out of their pocket and not give it back for a few days. I grant you that they wouldn't be happy either. If you would like to stay here, just make sure you take any available money out of your account so they can't touch it...then u should be just fine.....signed broke and furiousI never met a Marriott that I didn't like and this one is no exception.The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of River Street and the City Market as well as being located in the the Historic District.  I parked my car at the hotel and never needed it again, until the end of my stay.  The hotel has a bit of sweet southern charm.  The valet service, front desk and entire staff is professional, plus warm and friendly.  The Marriott has a beautiful lobby where you can relax and make new friends.  The back patio is beautiful and romantically lit in the evening.  My guest room was immaculate and nicely decorated.  It was a very relaxing experience to stay here.Meh. This was our first time staying at this hotel, and it was just okay. When we checked in, the ladies at the front desk were short with us and weren't very friendly....they obviously didn't want to be there. Parking was a bit of a hassle since they only offer valet, and when there are a lot of guests coming and going you often have to spend a lot of time waiting for your turn. The valet service itself was okay, although they left our car sitting out front by itself for about an hour (doors unlocked!!!) before parking it one evening (this was after dark...the hotel is located at MLK and Liberty)...we only discovered this because we decided to go across the street to grab a quick bite to eat. The room itself was clean with ample air conditioning (thank goodness because it was unseasonably hot while we were there). I was annoyed when I realized the room did not have a mini fridge...because of this, we couldn't bring back any leftovers when dining out and our drinks got hot the entire trip, but that really wasn't a huge deal. The hotel is conveniently located, which was nice, but use caution when stepping out at night...again, it's located right on MLK Jr. Blvd (which despite how much Savannah has improved over the last few years, is still a somewhat sketchy area). We were approached by panhandlers twice while in this area. We'll probably stay somewhere else next time if possible.This Courtyard is located on the outer edges of the historic district of Savannah. It is extremely convenient to the main highway as well as the Savannah History Museum. However it isn't the most ideal location to all the attractions in Savannah. Nonetheless, if you don't mind a little walking, this is a lovely property to stay at in Savannah. The garden deck is lovely! The staff is extremely friendly. The rooms are very neat and well maintained. The only downfall is that it can be a little shady walking from the hotel toward the River Street area at night time. Just make sure you are with friends!",,,"['second', 'courtyard', 'undoubtedly', 'conveniently', 'located', 'historical', 'district', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'shopping', 'river',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/savannah-bed-and-breakfast-inn-savannah,Savannah Bed and Breakfast Inn,4.0,$$,57,"Wonderful breakfast: Different specials each day with daily option of eggs cooked to order any way you like and side of fruit, bacon, or sausage. What a treat! Other amenities: Iced water with fruit available 24/7. Afternoon tea with pastries and cookies in the evening with milk. Grounds: Wonderful courtyards with fountain, guest fridge and microwave, lovely house cats.Other: Wonderfully comfy room and incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Free WifiOverall: Recommend without any hesitation!The location and amenities were above average. The front staff was great. The rest of the stay needs grand improvements. My girlfriend and I flew in from California and stayed here for the well overpriced cost of 250 dollars for a night. Whatever, it's a bed and breakfast close to downtown. The price was reasonable but too high for what was provided. We hit the town that evening after checking in and slept in a bit after our evening out and missed the designated time for breakfast.... We filled out a form the prior night for breakfast to be served around 9am I believe but we woke up a little after. we proceeded to the kitchen and was told that we missed breakfast and that they would try to make us something which was kind of them to do. However, while they prepared our scraps (really bad) they came outside where we were seated and lectured us on being on time and how we were holding up the staff.. NOT once, but TWICE. another gentleman came out to tell us the exact same lecture. It was like being part of Groundhog Day but no one was laughing and Bill Murray was no where to be seen. This bed and breakfast needs to get there staff under control and realize sometimes people are late and we didn't force them to provide breakfast. Will never return....A trip to Savannah has always been on my travel bucket-list, and with a friends' wedding nearby, this was the perfect opportunity. I've always had an incredibly romantic image of this town, as I'm sure many people do, and was pleasantly surprised to find that is was very charming, indeed. With your pick of B&amp;B's and hotels throughout the downtown area, it was a hard choice narrowing them down. Our needs? Inexpensive (comparatively - some places charge upwards of $300 a night? Are my towels dipped in GOLD?!), close to the action, and breakfast that doesn't include pre-packaged pastries. I am so glad we found Savannah Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast, because it offered so much more than what we thought we needed.First, I did not know before coming to Savannah that free street parking is a thing of the past. Naive perhaps, but I had hopes of finding some. Nope. ""SIBB,"" we'll call it, offers complimentary parking passes to guests who 1) Stay more than 2 nights 2) Stay during the week. Remember that. I know that they put quarters in for you on the day you check out, and they have a nice system of marking your parking space so they know which to pay. They will explain it all.Second thing I did not know I needed, Bedtime milk &amp; cookies, and Afternoon tea. Sweet tea is serious in the south, and it was nice to drop into the main building for sweets throughout our trip. PS the rooms are scattered throughout 3-4 brownstones, and the main building is marked with a flag.Third, a made-to-order breakfast. Served by waitstaff. On an insanely cute porch overlooking their courtyards. With cats. I never would have known just how much I looked forward to that each day. The food was pretty great, and you can order as much food as you want! BUT you must mark it the night before on your food ticket in the main building. Also, note that there are time slots you 'sign up for' when you turn in your ticket, so the place doesn't feel like Black Friday at the mall when you've still got drool on your face before you first cup of joe.We stayed in the Pulaski room (a value room) and it was really all we needed. It had AC, a TV, a reading chair, a huge bed, and somehow we wound up with a bathroom the size of the room. It was definitely worn, but it was clean and the room was cozy. The view was nothing, but we knew that would be the case. There are 3 tiers of rooms, I'd recommend the 2nd tier, unless you are used to high-end accommodations, and try to get a view of Chatham Square, it would definitely add to the whole experience.Get out and explore Savannah - the waterfront is definitely TOURIST CENTRAL, but worth a walk-through. All the gems are scattered throughout, and really all you need to do is take a stroll and they will find you. The locals are the sweetest, and most were excited to draw us up a list of their favorite spots. We took their advice and were so glad we did. We would definitely give SIBB another go next time we head south from chilly MN!My wife and I spent three nights at this very well redone B&amp;B in the historic district of Savannah. The staff was exceptional and the rooms were decorated perfectly. Breakfast was well done and the location was close enough to the River Walk but far enough to be very quiet. We stayed in Lane cottage which gave you very private quarters but we're a 30 second walk outside to the main dining room, warm cookies and other older couples. The only problem we had was with the slow internet, so we had to set up a personal hotspot from our cell phones. I can't wait to go back.This was our first time in Savannah and our first time at this B&amp;B. Both the city and the B&amp;B lived up to what we had been told. The B&amp;B staff was helpful and nice; the breakfasts were good and the room was beautiful. My one (very minor) complaint was that the stairs leading down to our courtyard and up to our room were a little overgrown. Didn't bother us much but that  could definitely turn people off of this particular B&amp;B.This B&amp;B is a quick walk from Forsyth Park, a few SCAD buildings and the Synagogue- but then again it's a short walk from one side of the historic district to the other...For the price and the good location in the heart of Savannah, this is a sweet place.  We did the innkeepers special for two nights and were placed in the Treetop room which is up three flights of stairs from street level.  No biggie except for hauling up our medium size suitcase up the slightly narrow old stairwells.  The room was nice and has a little kitchen area with a microwave, sink, and fridge.  Also a three seat table and a couple chairs in the living/dining area with a TV.  Nice queensize bed which was pretty firm which we liked.  The headboard is up against the windows facing the street and they aren't very insulating of temp or noise....a little drafty.  I actually thought the window was open as i could hear outside so clearly but it is an old brownstone so that's part of the charm for sure.  Bathroom was fine but not much space to put your bathroom things out.  Free in room Wifi had some issues when it rained but was fast when it worked.Now i'll talk about the second B, breakfast.  We enjoyed two and they were both nicely done...french toast and then eggs benedict with juice and coffee in a communal dining area in the main entry house.  They also serve a nice array of warm tasty cookies at 8 pm each evening.  Get em and then head out for drinks and walk around the beautiful historic city.Parking was a snap as there was a decent amount of available spaces and the hotel takes care of the meter with quarters on travel days and parking passes on full days.Relative stayed in the Azalea room which is on second floor and has two queen beds in two rooms with the second being a main room with chairs and a TV and bathroom.  View is out the back which is nothing special at all.  You'll have to walk through 1st bedroom to get to 2nd bedroom.Great and very hospitable hotel staff.  You'll enjoy your stay.  It's quaint and reasonably priced.Second visit here, and just as perfect!  The beds are very comfortable, the breakfast is delicious and the staff treats you like a favored friend. It is a very comfortable atmosphere, coffee is available all day.  The rooms are lovely and spacious, the bathrooms are just big enough with plenty of towels and toiletries. Be aware there are steps--a lot. There is absolutely NO access to anything without a few steps, street level is down two steps. Most of those rooms have access to the courtyard for breakfast but you have to let them know you are there, the staff will bring it to you. Order breakfast the day before, the staff is very accommodating to special requests. And the food is great. Take your coffee over to Chatham square in the Togo cup provided and enjoy the view. This visit they were completely booked, yet we felt like we were the most important guest. The staff has guest service perfected!There are a few things this B&amp;B has going for it:  it's very conveniently located in the historic district, almost everything is within walking distance, and the staff here are very friendly.  We stayed for three nights in the Blue Cottage.I found our cottage to be surface clean.  I just had an icky feeling about the carpet that made me want to not be barefoot at all.  The tub mat in the bathroom had a tacky feel to it when I first put it down.  The bathroom wasn't very clean when we checked in...and bathrooms are my biggest point of contention.  The water pressure was just tolerable, but there was plenty of hot water for us.  All of the linens were clean--I could smell the (great smelling!) detergent on the towels and bedsheets every day.  The bed was firm, but there were six pillows of varying degrees of squishy and firmness.  Other than that, mirrors were clean, floors mostly clean, but just to be on the safe side, I washed the mugs in our room before using them.Breakfast.  Hmm.  I am a personal fan of breakfasts, but there was something to be desired about the breakfasts I had.  The first day was huevos rancheros (the beans had not been properly drained and as a result I had a yolky-bean juicy dish), second day was two eggs cooked to order, a biscuit, sausage or bacon, and grits, and the third day was a choice of cinnamon french toast or white truffle french toast made with grocery store sliced bread.  The breakfasts weren't bad, but they weren't necessarily gourmet, either.  I had a peek in the kitchen and found Kirkland's brand ingredients.  Like a couple others have mentioned, you fill out a breakfast order slip the night before with your choice of seating time, however these aren't really regulated, and every day it was a battle to find seating for the three of us together.There were four cats that roamed in the courtyard.  Some people claim allergies, but the cats leave people alone for the most part (unless you chose to eat outside, in which case there was one black longhaired cat that was particularly fond of bacon).  Other than that, the cats were off elsewhere doing cat things and I rarely saw them.  They didn't come looking for attention and didn't try to go in any of the rooms.Would I stay here again?  Absolutely, if I had a good deal.  They take care of parking for you, and they make an effort to learn names for those staying a few nights.  The location is just unbeatable, and some breakfast is better than no breakfast at all.  Just don't forget to pack a pair of slippers.The rooms are very cute.  Not for tall people as I've hit the ceiling fan twice. Breakfast was great, but the front desk staff is not very friendly.We loved everything about this charming 19th century town home set in time with all of the modern day luxury conveniences. The rooms were lovely with beautiful hard wood floors, exposed brick walls, updated bathroom, high ceilings, that led out to a private patio. The staff leaves out afternoon tea, snacks, cake, peach flavored water, and cookies and milk before bed.  The inn is across from Chatham square, near forsythe park and a short walking distance from everything that beautiful Savannah has to offer. We will definitely be returning and I would highly recommend this to family and friends.Not impressed. We paid $169 for one night and have had better hotel rooms with free breakfast for half the price. My husband and I stayed in the Mercer room. The bath tub felt like it was going to fall through the floor and it was extremely slippery even with the slip proof mat in the tub. The water went from scalding hot to ice cold with no middle ground. The bed was very uncomfortable and there is rather small. The bed frame is way larger than the mattress so you can't help but smash your legs on it, I have many bruises. The overall ambiance is very nice. I loved the historic feel of the building and the room. We had a back door to our room that went out onto a roof patio that had stairs down to the breakfast patio which was very cute. The staff members were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was underwhelming. I got the egg white omelette (delicious) that came with toast (one piece of dry wheat bread, had to ask for butter) and a side of seasonal fruit (the smallest piece of watermelon I've ever seen... I've had larger ""sides of fruit"" in a cocktail). My husband also received dry toasted bread and had to ask twice for the bacon and sausage that was supposed to come with his breakfast. I would not stay here again, especially for the price. Rather disappointed.Love this B&amp;B in Savannah.  Great location and good accommodations.We really enjoyed our 4 nights here. The B&amp;B operates a dozen or so units on the block which were formerly separates attached residences. We stayed on the second floor of a renovated carriage house (Camellia Room) and found it quite charming. Very spacious rooms, comfortable beds, quiet and somewhat frou frou old timey decor. Room wasn't particularly dark if that is a major concern for you.A series of cute well-planted courtyards connect many of the rooms and several cats laze about all day. Staff was very attentive and friendly. We enjoyed the quick breakfast service, as well as the complementary afternoon tea and chocolate chip cookies in the evening! We ate our breakfast on the back deck overlooking the courtyard, sunlight filtering through the big moss-covered oaks and loquat trees. Location is fantastic. It's right on Chatham Square, 90 second walk to Bull street and Forsythe Park. Good food in the area too with Mrs. Wilke's and Crystal Beer Parlor right around the corner. We didn't have a car until the last day, but the staff apparently pays your metered parking from 8-11AM so you don't have to wake up early! Only downside was the wifi was spotty at times.Overall very pleasant experience. It's not the most luxurious spot so don't come expecting posh, but its more than adequate and really quite charming. Would stay here again and highly recommend. Did I mention the free cookies?No complaints here! We stayed in the Tomochichi room for two nights last weekend here. The room is actually named after the native american chief that originally sold the land Savannah was built on to General Oglethorpe. Actually all of the rooms at the inn are named after something historic in Savannah. Kind of a neat little thing if you're into the history of the city. Checking in was a breeze. Joey helped us get situated promptly, including a short tour of the inn and it's amenities. We were quickly in out room and settled. The room itself was pretty awesome. Most of it was old exposed brick on one side and the other had several windows and door facing the center patio of the inn. The room was decorated eloquently and it really felt like an older, rustic room, with modern amenities of course. The adjacent patio was really nice, with a garden and plenty of shade, and plenty of cats! This is where we ate breakfast both mornings. I really enjoyed the location of this place. It's right next to Forsyth park which is beautiful. It's also a short walk to River Street, crossing trough several of the squares. It's an even shorter cab ride back, if you've been on RIver Street too long.I'll definitely be returning for another stay here.What a gem! The rooms are beautiful, staff is    extremely nice and helpful, and they have gingerbread and brownies waiting for you. I couldn't be more pleased.Tons of character and way quieter than the riverfront, which is only a 10 minute walk away.We stayed two nights with the Summer Special. The first night we were in the Red Cottage. It was a fantastic two-story with living space downstairs (with a pull out couch and two chairs for seating and a mini fridge and microwave). The sleeping area and bath were upstairs.  The second night,  we're in the Azalea room, which consisted of two rooms. One room had a nice seating area with two chairs and it had the bathroom.  The second room had a bed, a couple of tables, and a smaller chair. Both rooms were nicely decorated and clean. Check out their pictures, not doing it justice. Also, the staff was very friendly and made suggestions on things to do and places to eat. The breakfasts were delicious and be sure to try the afternoon tea and the milk/cookies!We stayed in the Camellia room (up the stairs, through the dining room, out the back door, down the stairs into the courtyard, up the stairs to our own private building) and it was almost perfect.  The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, the temperature controls spot on.  The location is in the middle of the historic district, with everything we wanted to see within a short walk (the tourist area along the river was about 20 minutes walk but enough said about that place).  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast choices were superb.  Parking is on the street, but there were plenty of spaces and the Inn provides a permit to put on the dashboard - free parking.We stayed for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.What was less than perfect?  Nothing serious.  The shower was almost hot enough, and the wifi a bit weak.  All things considered I would recommend this place to anyone.This was a ""I'm passing through on a road trip"" stay.  And it was nice.  An old traditional Savannah row home that was charming and the staff was helpful.They are a little walk down to the water, but the walk moves you through a few nice parks and neighborhoods.The rooms are large and comfortable and noise from other rooms isn't an issue.Breakfast is included and I'd recommend getting there early or right near the end to not be crowded or wait for seating.All and all a great alternative to hotel/motels.We were staying in the Live Oaks suite. It was very spacious and is at the end of the street overlooking Chatham square. It had a private entrance right on the street so it was like having a whole house to yourself. The room also had a microwave, fridge, and coffee pot. The queen bed firm but comfortable. Would have liked some fluffier pillows. The water pressure was nice in the shower. The bathroom is off the bedroom. Breakfast the was very good and portions were filling. They gave you 2-3 different options and the previous day you fill out a card letting them know which option you want. The bnb will also schedule tours for you and place them on your ""tab"". The concierge was very helpful with suggestions. I highly recommend and we will def be back. For the price you can't beat it for your own place downtown.Stayed here two summers ago and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was amazing, the room was clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was very good. Within walking distance to Forsyth Park which is absolutely gorgeous and if you like walking it's a very beautiful walk to almost any location. Also extremely easy to get to Tybee Island from here.I loved it here so much, I'm going back this summer and taking my fiance. I can't wait, I'm so excited!","This place is just adorable. Our accommodations were elegant, comfortable (oh, those beds!), and clean. I stayed in ""Mercer,"" which has one pro that is also a con: it is very quiet, but its view isn't great. It looks out over a roof and courtyard, not Chatham Square. I much prefer this however, because I can't enjoy a view from my bed as I'm tossing and turning due to traffic noise. The only other negative from my room was that I had no hot water for my evening shower (at 11 pm).The public spaces are beautifully done and well looked after. Breakfast was delicious and a vegetarian option was offered. Staff were friendly and helpful. All-in-all, I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Savannah.We enjoyed our stay.  The location is fantastic.  I suggest you stay in one of the  carriage houses,  or cottages,  if you would like more privacy.  The breakfasts were amazing.  Both days our food was delicious,  unique,  and the portions were generous.  We had the pleasure of speaking with the chef,  he was very nice and even gave me his sauce recipe after I complimented it. We live in atlanta and look forward to coming back soon,  this place is perfect for quiet weekend getaways.Great service, Hugh rooms...suites.  Clean. Good breakfast, would stay again.  They even have dehumidifiers.  Our unit had a kitchen too.  Live Oak is very nice and comfortable.PERFECT LOCATION!  We wanted to be far away from the cheesy Riverfront...this is the place!  Jasper house was great, and the breakfasts were delicious.  Heaven for walking.... Great shops and restaurants were close....a true Savannah experience!!Great location, they paid for parking, and the room was clean.  However, we really wanted to like this place more than we did because the website oversold it a bit.  The room was ok but the service was not nearly as friendly as indicated on the other reviews.  The most disappointing aspect was the food.  We expected it to be more gourmet and instead received food we could have made ourselves at home.  Even the cookies at night were just ok.  It was also a little off putting to see tip jars everywhere in the dining room, mentioned it in the welcome sheet and an envelope for tips in the room.  We expect to tip the housekeeping staff but usually the owners or innkeepers handle breakfast.  This is really more of a small hotel acting as a bed and breakfast.  Also beware that the stairs are steep and narrow if you have mobility problems.This place was very average, food was just Ok, staff is helpful.  This facility lacks strong management and organization.   The rooms are surface clean.I was under a little stress to find a nice place to stay for this trip. My boyfriend had a meeting he had to attend and put me in charge of finding a hotel a month in advance. Of course, almost all of the bed and breakfasts in Savannah were booked and the ones that were available for far too expensive.I felt very optimistic about this place as the reviews were good and the price was not too high. It was also extremely close to the location of my boyfriend's meeting.Shortly before our trip I received a last minute notice that cause our arrival time in Savannah to be pushed back. I was so glad to know that there would be someone to let us in, even after hours.We arrived at 11 p.m. and a kind woman showed us around the inn, gave us our keys and showed us our room. I felt so bad about being late but she immediately made me feel at ease!Breakfast was wonderful. I think my boyfriend would have preferred to have more than one choice each morning, but it did not bother me too badly.Despite previous reviews, I did not find the coffee to be bad at all, maybe it's improved!After we got settled in our room, we went out for a midnight walk which was wonderful. The inn is located seconds from Forsyth Park, so it's much quieter than River Street and areas closer to the river.We stayed in the Mercer room, which was much prettier than it looked in the pictures. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of room to stretch out for a couple of days. It is up one flight of narrow stairs, so I don't suggest bringing large suitcases (fortunately we pack light!). The walls are a little thin, but our neighbors were very quiet.We didn't spend too much time at the inn, but when we were there it felt wonderful. It was so delightful to sit with other guests at breakfast, snack on milk and cookies right before bed and sit out on the patio during the evenings. I cannot attest to the afternoon tea, but I'm sure it was lovely, as was everything else at this place.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bed and breakfast in Savannah. It isn't as expensive as the rest and the staff is amazing.Comfy beds, cookies and milk, eggs Benedict for breakfast. I'm a happy gal!Gorgeous little B&amp;B. I have never stayed at one of these before so I don't have anything to compare it to. However, this was a gem of place to stay at. I stayed in the Egyptian room. It was cute and cozy with Egyptian artwork purposefully placed in all the right places. The bed was big and comfy with pillows that resembled fluffy clouds at the end of a long day of walking through Savannah. I could not have asked for a better place to stay at. Best part-- Afternoon cookies and tea!!! However, the cookies actually turned out to be cheesecake brownies (even better than cookies!!!!). I can't comment on the night time milk and cookies because we were not back in time for that. My only recommendation for this place is for them to consider playing background music throughout the Inn. It was so quiet all the time that I always felt like I needed to whisper when I was roaming the grounds. Also, they need to work on their coffee. It was so weak! Tasted like coffee-water, blehhh.I don't frequent B&amp;B's very often, so maybe this stuff is all normal to those that do...but several things about this place bugged me.#1 - The room (we stayed in The Jasmine) was dusty and the bedsheets and blanket were covered in small yellow food stains. It as gross and we asked for new sheets.#2 - There was a huge (and I mean HUGE) hole in the wall that broadcast voices and the AC vent noises all night. The owners obviously tried to hide it by placing a table in front of the hole, but you could still see it while walking around the room.#3 - The decor in the common room and our bedroom was similar to an old ladies house - lots of dust, doilies, heavy furniture and kitschy trinkets. #5 - I came back with some crazy large bugs in my clothes from when I set them on a chair...gross!#4 The rooms had a stale smell, like mothballs and old grease.HOWEVER....The front desk guy was really friendly, and the location was gorgeous. You could walk to great restaurants and nearby parks, and it was on a very quiet street.My fiance and I also really liked the back porch, where we sipped some wine and watched a passing thunderstorm...very relaxing!All in all I was a bit disappointed, especially given the great photos and reviews I'd seen online.This establishment had a very dirty bathroom floor in the Masters Suite (my socks stuck to the ""tacky"" floor).  They did not respond to my e-mail addressing that concern and the fact that they did not comply with the terms of the LivingSocial deal (with a ""premium"" room a bottle of champagne was to be included).  A simple response from this establishment would have been appreciated, but as they did not even bother to respond at all, I conclude that customer satisfaction is not high on their priority.  So bottom line is ... avoid Savannah B&amp;B.We really enjoyed our stay at the Savannah Bed and Breakfast Inn!  It was so nice.  We stayed in the lane cottage and it was very private, which we liked.  I left a bunch of clothes in a drawer on accident and they called me almost immediately after and held onto them for me until I could come back to get them.  I thought that was great customer service.Breakfast was good and the ambience is very nice.  We felt very fancy staying there!  I'd definitely recommend staying.  They offer a budget stay where you can just pay a lower price per night and not choose where you'll be staying, and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbedandbreakfast.com&amp;s=9ebc00b3a2a058d70a4641d86ef3260fec8b1c48c2436b64f87f545fc850fdc6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bedandbreakfast.com</a> offers a lot of deals that can help you knock even more off the price!I loved the Inn.  All of the staff was friendly.There was also street parking that the hotel will pay for, but you do have to look at the signs to make sure the street sweeper isn't coming that night.The Ivy Cottage is fantastic! The small spiral staircase might not be for everyone, but we loved it! The cottage had the bathroom and bedroom on the first floor, and the living room and kitchenette upstairs. There was a great balcony right off the living room. The bed was kind of high, but it was comfy. I'm really picky about the bed, and this was really good. The cottage was clean, and delightfully eclectic. The kitchenette had a sink, coffee maker (with coffee,tea and supplies), a microwave, mini fridge and utensils. Having the flexibility to choose what time frame(7:00-9:30) we wanted to eat breakfast, was a plus. The cook was super friendly, always coming to see what else he could do for you, and the wait staff was also fantastic. They have a snack and tea in the evening, and fresh baked cookies at 8. My 18 year old daughter and I were so impressed with everything.We had stayed at the Doubletree in July, but we much prefer the Inn. I will definitely stay here again, I can't wait!I chose this place over a place I had stayed before and for over $200 a night I really wanted to love this place. All-in-all my experience seemed a contradiction in terms. It's much larger an operation than the traditional B&amp;B - almost a wannabe boutique hotel. Perhaps it's going through growing pains which might explain why they're trying too hard or not enough. Following some confusion over my reservation (which was handled brilliantly and professionally - actually all the evening desk clerks were friendly and helpful) I was shown to a very nice room, where insulated windows was appreciated as I was on the street side. The blinds didn't do much to keep out street lamp light, however. The room was comfortable in spite of too much faux antique furniture but he Internet worked right away which was a plus. I had concern with the lack of hot water. There was the usual card for saving water by hanging up towels, yet after 10 minutes of trying to get hot water (both days) I gave up and went for the cold shower (maybe hot water cost extra). Breakfast was also odd -- all this wait staff hovering like a fine dining room yet the first morning I had to explain my order ticket (name and a couple of check off boxes). I was concerned it was me, but then I heard someone else explain an order that seemed super simple. The grits were amazing and the eggs benedict ok. The ham was the rectangular packaged lunchmeat and I couldn't cut the English muffin (sigh). Day two I scheduled the first seating and had to leave without eating because the food wasn't ready and I had to get on the road. So the kicker to all this was the tip jars and tip envelopes everywhere. Extremely off-putting (especially since the trash in my room wasn't emptied - could have made my own bed). A lot of things not consistent with traditional B&amp;Bs. Probably will go back to my other place next time.This was a nice B&amp;B---though somewhat industrial (i.e. large).  I guess the size helps them offer the B&amp;B amenities at scale, and thus keep prices down.The top floor room that we stayed in was nicely decorated and spacious.  It had a TV in the room and a roomy private bathroom.  Two large bedroom windows overlooked the square.  The location of this B&amp;B is excellent.  The square it is on is beautiful and quiet and it is within walking distance of everything in historic Savannah.  The reason why I knocked one star off was the breakfasts; in one word: awful.  Both mornings we unfortunately opted for the hot breakfasts.  The B&amp;B breakfasts made Waffle House look gourmet and high quality (this is not a dig on Waffle House... I love Waffle House).  Unless you inquire and they tell you they have re-done their breakfast menu, opt for the cold breakfast (yogurt, cereal, fruit, and coffee).  The juice they served with breakfast was horrid (tasted worse than watery tang) and I can make a better hot breakfast in my sleep.  The one place this B&amp;B cheaped out (and shouldn't have) was on breakfast.  Beds and rooms were great.  Breakfast could have used a slight budget boost per person to bring it up to par with what you would expect from any self respecting B&amp;B.  In fact... simple eggs, toast, fruit, and good coffee would beat out what they tried to pass off as a 'fancy' breakfast.Free parking was a great perk.  Free wifi was nice (though it was a bit of a struggle to get my computer to connect; I had better luck downstairs than up in the bedroom).It must have been destiny because my girl friend found this place 2 months before St. Patty's Day when most everything was sold out in the Historic District or way overpriced. We stayed in the Ivy Cottage and loved the suite. It was a small two story place with the bedroom on the ground floor and the living room/kitchen upstairs. A steep spiral staircase made it all the more fun. The rooms were clean and AC worked just fine. Silverware, plates, glasses were all provided with a mini fridge. And there was a flat panel TV with the basic cable stations...We only had the breakfast once but it was apart of the buffet and was good. Not sure why there are complaints but if you need something in the early AM, it works. Plus you should be out eating the local cuisine in Savannah and not getting stuffed at a Bed and Breakfast, right? Shoot , morning of St. Patty's they served wine and juice...awesome!The B&amp;B is a fun 15 minute walk to the river but with all the things to see, you won't even notice the time. And coming home at night after partying was great...it was like staying at grandmas because the main lobby would have cookies and water or ice tea left over...can't beat that! But it is a bed and breakfast so if you are the rowdy type, don't go, but if you are coupled up, this place is as good as it gets.I hesitate to write this review because I don't want everyone finding out about this gem! BUT, lucky for you, I believe in spreading good news. I love staying at this inn. The building and rooms are beautiful and well kept, the staff is super friendly, and the morning breakfast is delicious and homemade! I love sitting in the courtyard having tea and fresh omlets.The location too is perfect. This square is not the most beautiflu in Savannah, but it's lovely and only steps from Mercer House and Forsyth Park.The most amazing part is the price though... I cannot believe a place like this exists that is so affordable. But don't let the affordability throw you off: this place is every bit as good (and perhaps better!) than its more expensive counterparts.Excellent for the price. Great staff. We had the Ivy Cottage, a great room with bed and bath downstairs, and a tight spiral staircase leading to a kitchenette, living room and balcony. Not the room for you if you can't do stairs. Breakfast wasn't special, but enough to start the day. Anyway, you want your appetite in tact for all that Savannah has to offer.Tea and snacks in the afternoon and milk and cookies before bed add a nice touch.Location may seem far from the river, but you don't want to miss all that you'll see on the walk. I'll stay here again.Our first bed and breakfast experience, and it was such a great one. Our room was very nice and had a great view (the Parkview room), and I even started to enjoy the walk up the two flights of stairs to get there. My mom rented the only other room on that floor, so it was very homey feeling. The four poster bed was very comfortable, and the exposed beams and the old furnishings made the ambiance something wonderful.The Inn is located close to EVERYTHING. Savannah's downtown/historic district is small and totally walkable, so staying at the Bed and Breakfast Inn was a treat. We were able to walk to the Sentient Bean in the morning for coffee (at the other end of Forsyth Park), grab a new toothbrush at Brighter Days Natural Foods, and then head back down to the waterfront very quickly.The staff were all extremely nice and accommodating. Bob, the owner, has many great stories to part with, and you are taken great care of. We especially loved the nightly milk and cookies, and the weekend wine and hors d'oeuvres. The daily breakfast is cooked fresh and is often shared with other guests around one of the big wooden tables. A great way to get to know some of the other folks enjoying the B&amp;B with you.This is not the type of place for people who don't like interacting with other guests or engaging in conversations. This is a very social place and all the better for it! We spent Christmas night playing trivial pursuit and chatting with other guests over milk and cookies.If we come back to Savannah, we will definitely stay here again!First off - I am a dodo. I made my reservation for last thursday. The guy asked me for my name, I told him, he said he couldn't find me. I looked at the confirmation email - it had us checking in last week. We stared awkwardly at each other and I asked if he could honor it since it was already paid. He said that he would. Whew! And we booked the mgr. special so we had no idea what we would get but ended up in the Ivy Cottage. The inn is nice, the dining room is standard fare I'd say. A dead charming courtyard in the back. Super cute. The Ivy Cottage is separate from the main house which is nice. The bedroom is very European sized, if you know what I mean. The bathroom had just a shower but was a very decent size. A spiral stair leads you to a sitting area with a kitchenette and  a little balcony that overlooks the courtyard.For breakfast, you fill out a card and in the morning they ask you your room so they can bring you your meal. Fine by me. They offered grapefruit juice so I was happy. Selection wasn't huge but it was definitely wide enough. Location is great too. No, it's not on Bull and LIberty but, as a native of Savannah, this is the more charming area of town anyways.I loved the location and the overall feel of the B&amp;B but the filling out a card for your breakfast the night before and not having room for everyone to sit down for breakfast was a letdown. The rooms where nice, the bed felt ok and the bathrooms where newer. But the rooms needed to be cleaned maybe a little better for my taste. I think the night staff guy was nice he walked around and knew who you were. The day front desk lady was impersonal and didn't know what was going on. A suggestion if you're going to spend some time here pack two small suitcases if you're on the third floor it'll kill you carrying up a large suitcase up narrow stairs. I would also bring wet wipes. Savannah was fun and beautiful you really don't spend that much time at the B&amp;B anyway. -T 8-)","Very nice option for staying in downtown Savannah.  Our room (Pulaski) had great working A/C (still needed in November), and was nice and quiet.The bathroom could be better, and they could have been a little more generous with the towels and whatnot.Breakfast was big and tasty, totally satisfied.Savannah Bed and Breakfast Inn is a little gem in the heart of the historic district situated across from Chatam Square was the perfect starting location to explore Savannah.  I stumbled upon this B&amp;B after doing some Internet searches.  I ultimately went for this particular B&amp;B due to value.  I was able to get a room for $99/night.  Quite a bargain for the historic district.  Not only was breakfast included but I also considered the following a bonus: paid parking, afternoon tea &amp; baked goods, evening cookies and milk.  My room the Telfair, was simply charming in decoration.  Located on the second floor this might pose a challenge for some not comfortable with stairs.  I, however, would hesitate to recommend as the room looked out on to the square and was high enough to be sheltered from any street traffic noise.In the spirit of full disclosure, there were several items not quite to my liking that prevent me from giving a higher rating.  1.  There are multiple cats that call the outside deck/courtyard home.  I am extremely allergic to cats so these areas of the property were off limits to me and anyone else who has dander allergies.  2. I also found it slightly odd that this B&amp;B didn't have a formal living room receiving room. The majority of the common space was taken up with breakfast tables.  So, outside of sitting outside or a table there was little space to escape your room.  3. The free Internet signal is not available in all rooms and in the Telfair the signal was extremely weak.  Also,  If you are a B&amp;B breakfast snob, this is not the location for you.  The breakfasts were good but nothing special to write home about.  I stayed 3 days and the best option was the pancakes served on my last day.That being said, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The accommodations and service were top notch and this far outweighs any slight inconveniences.The Savannah Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn is a charming little B&amp;B on a beautiful tree-lined street with relatively easy street parking.  They give you a parking pass so you can park for free at any meter in the city, as well as selected parking garages, so it's also convenient.  Our room was small but cute--the only complaint we had was the extremely hard bed, with hard pillows to match.  However, the delicious breakfast each morning somewhat made up for that.  Everything is homemade and fresh--the highlight for me were the addictive cheese grits and buttery mushroom quiche.  Even better were the fresh-baked, warm chocolate chip cookies that were left out each night around 8pm.  There was also a wine and cheese hour between 5-7pm.The staff are sweet and helpful, and it's located close to pretty much anything you'd want to do in Savannah.Nice little inn in a great location. It's about a 15 minute walk to the riverside. The room was clean and had the expected historic charm you'd expect in Savannah. Granted this isn't the Ritz Carlton of bed&amp;breakfasts though, so don't expect anything extremely fancy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast every morning was excellent. It'll be on the top of my list when we go back.Super sweet people, awesome chocolate chip cookies, cute inn, great location. The bummers were: the coffee was awful - ugh. The bed really wasn't that comfortable and you could easily hear people walking by your room. Overall good deal for the price.Ok, granted that this is was my first Bed &amp; Breakfast stay BUT, I was highly impressed with this place. My future Mother in Law spent 3 wonderful nights and 4 days! Everything was immaculate! And the service was superb! Milk and cookies at night and wonderful breakfast! Our rooms had the most gorgeous and intricately carved wooden beds, feather pillows and softest sheets I have slept on in a loooong time! My only complaint was, the bathroom. Its very small and oddly put together. I am a bathroom freak. I love for a room I stay in to flow and it seems off. But then again it can be expected if its an old house turned into a bed and breakfast. It was also close to everything I wanted to walk to and it was wonderful walking all of historic Savanna and not have to worry about parking! I really really really want to stay here again as soon as my fiance comes off deployment and visits!A seriously magical bed.Ready for too much information?Good.I got up in the night to pee twice and both times thought I wouldn't get back to sleep, but each time my head hit that pillow?  Zonk, right back under I went.This place surprised us in how gorgeous it was.  The house, the rooms, the furniture... even the breakfast was amazing.  Savannah certainly is the hostess-city!  The owner came by in the morning, introduced himself and asked if everything was all right.  It was just perfect. It is also right by Forsyth park, which makes for a nice, picturesque early morning jog or walk.Great location away from the tourist crowds but still close enough walk to shops and restaurants. Typical B&amp;B decor in that it's very fancy...and dated. Breakfast was good. Cookies were great. Good value for the money. But beware, checkout time is at 10am!!!Our favorite place to stay in Savannah.  Just a half block or so behind the Mercer House, and tucked away next to a quiet square.  They offer pretty reasonable rates, especially during the slow season.  It's laid back and a great place for those that aren't totally into the ""Bed and Breakfast Experience"" as there is a bit more privacy.We have stayed their 3 times, and are planning our next trip in a few months.A sweet little BnB, great location and very helpful staff. Breakfast was average, nothing special and in fact if I went again, I would rather venture out to try something new and yummy instead of wasting a meal there. Short walk to the water, gives the opportunity to wander and explore. It felt like staying at your grandma's house-- weak AC, lots of clutter and kitch, old but clean bathrooms, old beds, old blankets. This was my first BnB experience and probably my last. I personally prefer the uniformity and cleanliness of chain hotels. We stayed in the Tea Olive which was HORRIBLE (right under the stairs, could hear everything going on upstairs and outside) and the Tomochichi (better location in the courtyard).Just returned from my first visit to Savannah and I would love to go back soon!  This Inn was a wonderful, affordable place in a beautiful city.The Inn is located on W. Gordon between Chatham and Monterey Squares. It is a picturesque row of houses, with curved stairways and wrought iron railings, on a tree-lined street. The location is great. It is easy walking distance to all the squares and to beautiful Forsythe Park.  About 15 -20 minute walk to River Street.Four of us stayed in the Jasper House, which is a lovely three story row house. It has four bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, remodeled kitchen, living room, formal dining room, and formal parlor (even has a chandelier).  The rooms were very spacious, very nicely decorated, and very comfortable. The house has a very ""period"" feel, yet all the modern amenities , including washer and dryer. There is air conditioning and ceiling fans in all the rooms and on the deck, so the temperature is well-controlled. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast was great. They also serve iced tea and cake in the afternoons, and wine/cheese on weekends. Warm-baked cookies and milk are served in the evening.We has a perfect time! I would highly recommend renting the Japser house for groups of 3 or more sleeping solo...it can accommodate up to eight but that would include bed-sharing.I loved this place and would definitely go again. You can have your own HOUSE for the price some of those high-end inns are charging for a room.**Couple things to be aware of : They have a few cats..really cute and sweet. They stay out on the decks, and in the courtyard, so you can avoid them easily if you are allergic or something.  Also, there are stairs to the front entrance and stairs to each floor...so if you are using one of the bedrooms on the third floor, you are doing quite a bit of stair-climbing.Sadly, I will never get to share the great experiences of the other Yelpers who stayed at this Inn. I pre-paid one night's rate to hold a reservation. When we had a conflict and had to postpone our travel, I promptly emailed the management to let them know the problem. Their reply was, ""no problem, let us know when you will be traveling"".  Seemed great, until they called me the night I was originally scheduled to stay, left a message asking where I was and when I contacted them in the AM, they told me my deposit was forfeited. Ugh. Anyone know of another awesome B&amp;B in Savannah??!This was a nice place, and the people were very friendly. The location of the B&amp;B was great. The breakfast was great and the people were great.We stayed in the Chatham room which was really quaint and looked out on Chatham Square. The decor was traditional and very pretty, and the bathroom was completely redone and modern. The only drawback was that the room was not really well insulated sound-wise, and when our neighbors were in their room next door, we could hear everything (in their bathroom anyway). But still, I would recommend this inn.This is a really good place to stay, the location is excellent...away from the touristy places yet not far from the historic district.The staff was very polite and helpful.We stayed at the tree top room which had a living room, kitchen and a bed room.You get the classic features of historic Savannah house without the haunting...lol.WHAT A GEM!!!  Yes, I had to put that in CAPITALS.  I found this place via a last minute internet search 2 weeks prior to my vacation to the East Coast.  I offer huge thanks to Google that they were all the way on top.  All of the other B&amp;Bs were running over $200.00 for the week of June 25, but the boyfriend and I snagged a BEAUTIFUL Egyptian themed room for WAY under $200.00 because of a SUMMER SPECIAL that they were running.  Even without the special, the rates are a great deal.The breakfast was good and the sweet tea available during the afternoon tea was DELICIOUS.  We were pleased that the B&amp;B offered free internet.  Plus, our room overlooked Chatham Sqare, which is lovely during the afternoon.The hotel is close to Forsyth Park (BEAUTIFUL) and is about a 15 minute stroll from the riverside.  Yet, hands down, this is one of the loveliest hotels that my boyfriend and I have stayed at.  The staff made us feel at home and I would definitely  stay here again, if given the chance!My husband and I recently were lucky enough to stay in the Cottage on the Lane, a converted carriage house that is part of the B&amp;B. It was very private, and had a downstairs parlor and kitchen as well as a lovely bedroom upstairs. Everybody who worked at the Inn made sure we had a great time, and for the value, I think it would be hard to beat staying here. It is located in a more residential area, but walking to the more commercial parts of Savannah only takes around 10-15 minutes. The highlights of course were eating breakfast in the courtyard and grabbing chocolate chip cookies before bed at the end of the day. If we return to Savannah, we will be returning here as well.",,,"['wonderful', 'breakfast', 'different', 'specials', 'day', 'daily', 'option', 'eggs', 'cooked', 'order', 'way', 'like', 'side',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-savannah-downtown-historic-district-savannah,SpringHill Suites Savannah Downtown/Historic District,3.5,$$,55,"Stayed here for two nights recently with the family and my daughter's soccer team for a tournament in town.  The lobby and breakfast area are nice, i really like the layout, pretty open.  They could use a little more seating, but otherwise good.  We had a double-queen room, it was in the corner near the stairs so I think it was a little larger than most of their rooms.  In any case, the rooms are fairly large with a separate sitting area and desk.  It's not totally isolated from the sleeping area, however, it's a little separate which makes it nice with kids who go to bed earlier.  The hotel is clean, modern, nicely decorated and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The location is pretty convenient to the historic district and restaurants, only a few blocks away, and in a reasonable neighborhood (some parts of Savannah are a little run-down and sketchy).  Would definitely stay here again.   Positives: Clean, modern hotel with a nice breakfast area and lobby.  Large rooms with 2 queen beds (not doubles) and pullout sofa.Negatives: Cold in the hallways.   Paper-mill smell in hallways sometimes, but rooms were fine always.This hotel is nice. The front desk staff has always been very accommodating. The valets are very friendly.   Sometimes there are strange things in the room like one washcloth  or one trashcan for the entire room but these are minor things. Hate to rate the hotel one star but the problem listed below clouds my judgment of this hotel chain. My big problem with Marriott as a company is the customer service of their rewards program. I have called several times to try to correct a problem that is falling on deaf ears. When I signed up for the rewards program I selected miles, unfortunately the airline that was associated with my account went out of business years ago. Once I realize the account was going towards miles versus points, I tried to get credit for the last couple of stays that have occurred within the last six months.   The customer service agents and the supervisors have all  chirped like a bird and said you have to deal with the airline. This must be a rehearsal line they cannot deviate from because they can't seem to understand that the airline is out of business. One supervisor offered to give me 1000 points, this is nowhere near credit for the four nights stay that I deserve.   The service that I have received from this department is the horrible.  I am a very reasonable person and do not ask for things that I do not deserve.Let me start by saying the concierge, the front desk staff, the breakfast staff deserve 6 stars, they were friendly and professional.  I am a faithful Marriott patron, I will drive 50 miles to stay at a Marriott if need be.  I checked into the Savannah Spring Hill Suites on Monday, February 23rd, scheduled to check out on Thursday, February 26th.  Due to a need to extend my stay, I contacted the hotel staff and made a separate reservation, checking in on the 26th, departing on the 27th.  The type of room I was in was not available for another night, so I was required to change rooms.The morning of the 26th, I was able to check my luggage with the front desk staff for retrieval later that day when I returned to check-in again and move to my new room.   The problem ensued the morning of the 27th, upon departure, I began to check my room to be sure I had all my belongings.  I sleep with socks on and they typically find themselves off my feet by morning.  So in usual fashion, I pulled the covers back to check for socks and found blood on my sheets.  I was immediately livid and sick to my stomach. I started to just write the staff a note and leave it at that until, I grabbed an unused towel and applied cold water to the towel.  I took the lightly moist towel and applied moisture to the largest spot of blood on the sheet.  The blood began to smear, letting me know this was not a stain that had been previously washed and unable to be removed from the sheets, this was a stain on sheets that had not been changed after another individual laid or slept on them. I took a picture of the sheets, with my date stamped record of stay.  There were three stains present on the sheet, to prove it was not my blood, I cut a portion of the area I applied the damp towel, in addition to the dry spot to the right of the photo frame.Upon checking out I spoke to the Front Desk personnel, in which the attempt to comp my stay and/or provide points would suffice for this egregious violation.  I responded I did not want my stay credited nor the points; and at that time I was unsure of my course of action, but would be in touch.  To date, the only communication since my departure has been with my attorney. I have not been contacted by anyone from the hotel, even after contacting Corporate.  I have never in all my life experienced such disgusting practices.  I have traveled domestically and abroad this experience has forever damaged my ability to place trust in the hospitality industry and their regulated or lack thereof sanitary practices.I have tried several hotels in the Savannah area. The Courtyard Savannah Downtown/Historic District -- nothing great and the rooms vary wildly in experience. The Hilton Savannah DeSoto -- more of a landmark than a great hotel experience and expensive as well. Then while walking around the downtown Savannah area, and being bumped once again trying to get out of town, I decided to give this place a try.I am really glad I did. The pricing is great and everything feels new -- not only literally but also in the slick design of the suites. For me this was a huge step forward from the other places I have tried and there is no downside on the location. Great for exploring downtown on foot from the front door and still a nice location for everything to do with SCAD.Newly renovated and looks like it. Very nice lobby, modern with sweeping curves; room was clean with an extra sink/toilet room; bed good (a great mattress earns a fifth star); location walking distance to all shops and restaurants. Valet parking handy and the attendant, Vincent was engaging.Ok, Pros: Location. Right in the middle of the historic district, walking distance to a lot of cool places. Beds. They have one of the best hotel beds we've had, and we've stayed in plenty, and that's big for us.The layout. The bathroom and the toilet area are  separate, which is a big plus, especially when traveling with more people. Staff. Very friendly and helpful. Price was reasonable and included free breakfast. Now, cons: The layout. Yes, it is both in pros and cons. The room seemed small and the layout was a littler awkward, wasn't too much privacy allowed in the bathrooms, everything could be heard. Not much room to walk around either. The comforter for the sofa bed had what looked like a burned stain, wasn't happy about that. Breakfast left much to be desired, weren't too many choices, coffee was ok, but good thing they had a waffle station. So, to sum up, 3 stars as had too many cons for me, and I'm usually good with giving out stars, but I guess should be expected, considering the price, which WAS good, compared to other hotels in the area.It is still good to keep this location in mind, maybe will give it another try.This hotel is about a 5 minute walk from where the action is.  I spent almost a month here and I really enjoyed this place, the staff is very nice the rooms are clean and there is a nice heated pool. The only drawback (IMO) is that they force you to valet park. Rather than waiting for someone to bring me my car I opted to walk to the public parking one street over. While I don't mind paying for parking, I hate having to wait for my car. The other issue was that the hotel seems to always be filled with kids that crowd the breakfast buffet in the morning - nothing against them, but I did have to go elsewhere for breakfast several times because there was no room in the area. Overall the staff though made up for the minor shortcomings and I would definitely stay here again.Pros - Clean room, clean hotel in general. Super comfy bed! Very nice staff. Warm poolCons - Slow wifi. REALLY hard water with a strong sulphur smell. I can't be the first person to tell them this. There was a white film left on my skin after the shower and my skin felt dry. My hair was crunchy after washing it AND even still after using a deep conditioner in the shower. You need to install water filtration/softeners on your sinks and showerheads. I'm from NYC where the water is very soft so I'm definitely not used to it.Industrial cleaner odor, bathroom door broken, lumpy beds and shower faucet that needs a strong arm to turn on. Disappointed.in the process of renovation, but still comfortable and clean with plenty of space for a family of 6. front desk was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants etc in the area.This is a new location (for me anyway) in Savannah's Historic District.The lobby is huge and slightly inviting, IF there's someone to greet you at the desk semi-centered in the room. The concierge area/desk is a little odd in that the concierge is actually seated behind a desk. There are no chairs for guests to be seated while having a conversation with the concierge but that could be strategic in that they don't want/anticipate the guests to linger. Complimentary breakfast offered, We didn't partake so I can't offer a review of the offerings. Overall, the hotel is clean. Our room was clean and had the basics (microwave and refrigerator, beds).  I did like the toilet area being totally separate from the shower/tub area. that was a plus especially when traveling with women. the location was perfect walking distance to everything in the area (River Street, City Center, Henry's, and shopping).We are planning to keep this one in mind when planning visits to Savannah.#tellingyouwhatithink #dpursuitisrealChecked in on a Thursday for a long weekend, Government discount took care of the 20 dollar fee each day for valet. Valet service was very efficient. The hotel itself is in a great location, helpful friendly staff, free breakfast and great free 24 hour coffee stand. Room was very clean, tv is in an odd location (but it swivels) bed was not the most comfortable however sufficient and bathroom/shower lay out is a bit odd. Overall great value for your money and if we ever get back down to Savannah, GA we will stay here again!Spacious room and friendly staff.  Microwave and fridge nice to have.  Great shower.  Valet was prompt and courtesy.   Walking distance to various attractions.  Potential areas of improvement: stains on floor and ceiling, bottle of whiskey bottle (1/3 full) in closet (??!?), slide door of toilet area (shower is in a different room) did not fitted properly against wall so gap doesn't allow for privacy, only two small drawers in closet so unable to unpack luggage, charge for using wireless phone if more than two devices, parking fees.Overall the stay was nice but a few things bugged me as we stayed here.  First off, housekeeping seems to think everyone staying there wakes up at the crack of dawn.  We live on the West Coast, so when they were banging on our door to clean the room at 830 in the morning, it was 530 to us.  A few of the days, I did not get to the door fast enough to tell them to come back later and she just used her key to barge right in.  I explained our situation but each morning we were awoken by housekeeping at a VERY early hour. On a positive note, they were VERY friendly.I also did not like the lay out of the bathrooms.  With the type of sliding door that they had, if anyone was laying on the far bed, they got a good view of you doing your business.....just what someone wants to see on vacation.  Same with the shower. The TV was also off to the side in a very odd location, so if you were laying in bed you had to turn your neck to see the TV...you don't see that often in hotels. I also didn't like that valet was your only option here.  We were there visiting family, some living there and some staying at other hotels so we were out an about a lot and it was very inconvenient to have to get your car out of valet each time you leave, not to mention pricey as you have to tip the valet attendant each time in addition to the parking cost.   The room was very clean and the staff were all very friendly.  If not for those small issues, I would have been 100% happy, but waking papa bear up too early does not make for a good day, just ask the kids.Overall a very pleasant stay. They room was clean and quiet- my top two requirements for a hotel. Staff was mostly good but service could be slow at times. Its location can't be beat and for a reasonable cost. In March (spring break) we paid $139/night and were only minutes away from most anywhere we wanted to go in the historic district.The pool was small but clean and the hot tub inviting. The breakfast was an absolute waste of time unless you drag yourself out of bed early before the rush. We learned that after the first morning. We ended up downstairs by 9:30am and found every serving tray scraped clean. The only thing left was something that resembled ham. It was the most disgusting shade of grey- I guess no one wanted to eat that! The following mornings we were downstairs by 8am and had no trouble getting grub. Food was blah- but it was free. Oh, and they had grits, which was a nice way to warm up on a chilly morning. With so many great dining choices in Savannah we'd eat just enough at the hotel to tide us over until we ate lunch by 11am. The room itself is a little odd. The toilet and shower are in two separate ""rooms"" with pocket doors. The toilet room is about the size of a closet. The entire room is very narrow and laid out in a shotgun arrangement. The frosted door of the shower ""room"" isn't very practical. The separate seating area has a pull out couch. It was a tight squeeze for 2 adults and 2 kids. But overall we had a nice visit and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.I absolutely loved this place.. Service was impeccable, rooms were clean and up to par, valet was on point. We stayed for valentines 2014 and had an excellent view of the city from floor 6. Although it's not exactly walking distance from downtown, well atleast not if you're wearing heels. It's still pretty close. I recommend trying to book through Hotwire or Travelocity as the at desk price can be a bit high. Average price is about 180. If you want something special though it's worth every bit of it. Two thumbs upThe lobby was open and clean. Parking is valet only unless you find street parking on your own. I would not count on street parking. The location is nice and allows easy access to much of Savannah. The layout of our room was strange. The television was inconveniently placed and the toilet and shower were in different, unconnected rooms. There was free wifi which worked well for light internet browsing. Our room had a nice view of the south side of town.Great location and very nice and helpful staff members.  Everything is very close, good breakfast and very clean. Rooms aren't as big as i expected but nothing else found offers any better. Free internet is slower and cant be used for Netflix.First of all I am definitely a fan of Marriott hotels. I am a silver elite member and probably stay in 10-12 Marriotts a year. In fact this is what I told the manager when I complained to him. This Marriott was ok but not up to Marriott's tip top standards.1. Walked in to find the pool was closed down -- the 1st week in Aug.?? Good planning there. The manager told me it was Marriott's fault not that hotel -- I said well at least they could have told me a head of time. 2. Then they put us in one room and then asked us to move so they could deep clean the room we were in. Ok, no problem - we moved.3. I thought the desk staff was slow. As I paid more attention the lady working there, alone, was an intern. 4. We loved the guys in valet parking - they were super friendly but once it was raining so we asked if they could call us a cab. They said the front desk would do it -- as you can guess slow front desk, we waited a while and then just ended up walking.5. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. 6. Location was great and super convenient for walking!7. I see some others complained about the cleaning staff waking them early. They over compensated. Our room was not cleaned by 2:30 pm and we really needed some towels to take showers. My daughter called and asked and they said some one would be up. After 30 min. I went down the hall and just grabbed some off the cart. 8. I did personally complain to the manager and while he seemed nice he didn't really have any solutions other than summer is busy. He asked me several times what could he do for me. I wasn't going to demand my money back as the situation was not that drastic -- after the 3rd time he asked I said - ""well you can give me some extra Marriott points"". I am guessing he forgot because that never happened. I know I sound like a complainer but this is not a bad hotel it is just not up to Marriott's usual excellent standards!Great location! And So relieved to be at Spring Hill Suites that I give it 4stars just for having room to accommodate my friend &amp; I last minute. Small, cozy room &amp; fresh, clean &amp; modern. PLUS no yard cockroaches like at the place we checked out at here in Savannah (where I also was robbed by the housekeeping staff). Whirlpool &amp; pool are outside so it's nice but sucks when it rains.","It's not the Ritz, but I would never stay anywhere in Savannah than this hotel. Staff awesome. Location perfect.Suites extremly comfortable. Fitness center great for cardio only.Breakfast typical when it's free.Very reasonably priced.. When traveling south for the winter, this is the best place to stay for a couple of nights.The SpringHill Suites hotel is an awesome place to stay while you're in the beautiful city of Savannah!  It's such a modern hotel within such a vintage city.The standard two queen bedroom was pretty roomy - there's a living/office area with a couch, cute coffee tables, and a desk area that is divided from the bedroom area.  There are two ""bathrooms"" - one toilet room with a sink (which had no counterspace) and one shower room with a sink (which had plenty of counterspace - which is a must have for me!)One weird thing about the room is that the flat screen tv is situated off to the side of the first bed - yes, the tv can swivle so you can watch tv while you're in bed, but it's just in a weird spot.Valet parking is available for $15 per day, the hotel provides breakfast in the lobby, and wifi is available for free.  The best part is that this hotel is walking distance from everything!  Very convenient location, great furnishings, and good customer service.  I would definitely come back to this hotel if I'm ever in Savannah again!This hotel is nice-looking, modern, sleek, and mostly fine. But I'm only giving it three stars, and here's why:(1) the television was in an awkward position askew from both beds;(2) the water closet (toilet) had a sliding door with no lock, a noticeable gap (you can see the person inside), and basically no privacy whatsoever;(3) the lighting was too dim, and the light between the beds made a terribly loud buzzing noise;(4) the microwave and refrigerator were placed in an awkward place and not very easy to use.It's basically a nice hotel, but I felt that the room had a weird layout, and there were just a few irritating things that make me give it three stars.Spinghill Suites Marriott treat customers this poorly???  Buyer beware!$20 per day mandatory valet parking.  Nothing else available.I chose to stay here because the website indicates parking is an amenity next to many free amenities.  This is very misleading because no self-parking is possible, and the only option is $20/day for mandatory valet.When I brought this to the attention of management, Paige rudely refused to ameliorate the website or the misrepresentation. This after she thanked me for my platinum status. I immediately switched to the Marriott Riverfront and recommend you do the same!Additionally, Paige (Springhill Management) said she would charge me 1 night to switch my reservation.  Marriott customer service waived the fee and said there would be no charge.  As someone who stays at Marriotts weekly for business travel, this hotel has the worst management I've seen since in over 10 years.A terrible experience. I booked the hotel after reading the rave yelp reviews, so I'm guess my horrible experience was an isolated one, but here goes...Called about an hour before we arrived to make a reservation. Spelled out my name, gave my credit card, etc.  Then when we arrived, they didn't have it.  The girl at the front desk said they had no more rooms, so there was no way I possibly could have made a reservation. I asked her to call the corporate reservation line and instead she proceeded to help other guests behind me. After about 20 minutes of this, I asked her what the status was and she said she wasn't sure. Flabbergasted, I said forget it and found another place to stay.A week later, I noticed they charged my credit card. I called the hotel, they told me to call reservations, who told me to call the hotel. I flipped my lid and the person at reservations advised me she would ""send an email to see if they would refund me"". I nearly flipped my lid again, but said ok. Fortunately, someone at the hotel who didn't have their head in their arse contacted me immediately and refunded me the money. Looks like they had my reservation and couldn't locate it because my name was spelled incorrectly. But, how they were still able to charge my card, I have no idea.My best friend and I rolled into Savannah without a plan, or a hotel reservation.  After calling around we had booked an affordable room at a hotel about 10 miles from downtown, but as we made our way in that direction we decided that location was more important than cost.  We decided we would much rather stay one night downtown than two far away.  We called the SpringHill Suites and I could not be happier with this decision.We walked in to the hotel 30 seconds after booking the room with reservations and Tatiyana was able to get us in our room right away.  We pulled into the valet and all the adorable boys were friendly and willing to lend a helping hand.  That sounds like reverse order, but it is actually how it worked out...don't dwell.The room was GORGEOUS!  Clean and crisp are the best words to describe it.  The cool tones, and inviting pillows just enticed me to relax.  We got ourselves together and decided to go for a walk around.  A couple of walking drinks later and we made our way back to the hotel.We were having such a great time already that we wanted to extend our stay, if possible, despite the cost.  Well, Tatiyana not only was able to extend our stay, but also gave us a great rate for the second night.  OH THE SAVINGS!!!Joy at the concierge desk was a delicious delight and exactly what you would want from a person in her position at a hotel in a city like Savannah.Complementary Hot breakfast in the ultra-modern lounge each morning was lovely, even considering all the little gymnasts taking over the waffle maker.I give this hotel high praise and plan to use it every time I visit Savannah, and given how much I loved it...that may be quite a bit.Wow. I wrote a very detailed and unfavorable yet accurate review complete with photos yesterday and they took it off the yelp site. Shady !!!! They don't have a bartender and the bar food came out of plastic bags from the local quick mart.  Savages!!!The lobby was the best thing about this place. I wasn't a fan of the room layout and the pocket-door bathrooms.K and I were back in Savannah and the SpringHill Suites was again our base of operations. Right on Oglethorpe and Montgomery, any place you want to go is a pleasant few blocks' walk, and walk we did. Despite being a year older, the hotel still feels fresh, bright, and inviting. The valet service for the truck was prompt and polite, the front desk staff helpful. The room was as lovely as last year. K found the mattress to be especially restful, and the internet service (free to me as a Marriotts Rewards member) was fast and reliable.I honestly don't know how they could improve on their accommodations or service. Five-star all the way.Great modern designed hotel in a perfect Savannah location.Very friendly and accommodating front desk staff who helped us find our way around for the weekend we were here.You can easily walk to many restaurants. If you're a beer drinker head over to The Distillery which is very close to this hotel.The rooms were modern and inviting and the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed the pool (along with 900 girl scouts) a few times and that was a nice feature.I would definitely come back to this hotel whenever I'm back in Savannah.Loved the location and the experience.  Excellent valet parking ($20), beautiful room, plush bedding and towels, great room layout.  A smooth experience for a weary traveller.Location makes it easy to leave your car and walk the downtown and river areas.  Also, easy access back to 95.  Safe, convenient, and accommodating.Great location. The historic district is within walking distance. The valet service is good. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room is awesome, but I echo the concerns about the TV being in an awkward spot (not a big deal for me, though). My family and I swam in the heated pool on New Year's Day. Great experience.We checked in with my family on The hotel is great, clean, new, free wifi, free breakfast, jacuzzi and heated pool.We loved it, the staff was very friendly, Katie at the front desk, Lauren  was helping us with the breakfast and Austin was a great concierge.Why I'm giving 4 starts and not 5 is because I didn't see any single recycling beans, no Recycling Other than that the Hotel is great and the staff is vey friendlyA nice surprise.We stayed here for 4 nights in mid-May for a wedding in town.  Loved the atmosphere of the hotel (fun boutique) and the location (walking distance to pretty much everything).  The rooms were clean and smoke free.  The bed was comfortable to sleep on for 4 nights straight (well except for the night I passed out on the floor).  And being a tall guy, I'm always excited to be able to stand up in the shower.Stacie F., I shared a your terrible experience. Here goes or review! Unfortunately Marriott Reservations screwed up our reservation, when we arrived to the hotel with two infants, their parents and great grandparents (85 and 87) we found out that we only had  two of the three rooms reserved. Mr. Bill ""WT"" Wade, manager, refused to assist us either to locate another room for us or calling their sister facilities for us to accommodate our family. Contrary, he recommended several times that because we bothered his day with our request, we should not stay in this hotel. Well I'm a Marriott Rewards customer and we were using Marriott points, I wonder if Mr. WT, wanted to make more money with somebody. Wow, lousy way to treat loyal customers. F.C.Location is very convenient, staff very friendly and professional.  Room cleanliness leaves something to be desired, stained furniture and carpet, not vacuumed during our 3 day stay,It was clean, period.  Everything else did not work.  The remote did not work-it needed new batteries.  We were promised for over 24 hours that an ""engineer"" would be up to replace those batteries.  After 3 calls and 2 days, nobody showed up.  Our door cards also did not work more than once.  4 times we had to go down to the desk to get them ""fixed."" That is very frustrating.  The girl said that she would have the ""engineer"" look at the door lock.  Hope was it not the same engineer who was supposed to change the batteries in our remote.  The breakfast was really blah and bland and for most of the time I was there was out of several items.  Valet parking was expensive.  Would not go back because service/price did not match.I'm a fan of Marriott even being an Elite Rewards Member.  I had a couple of free nights to use for a category 1-4 hotel.  Our options in the historic district  were this one or Courtyard by Marriott.  We selected this one mainly because of the free breakfast.  The hotel and rooms are modern, even more trendy than the NYC Marriott we stayed at last summer.  The rooms were average size for a hotel but slightly small for a suite.  They had a fridge and microwave which was awesome.  The standup shower was very nice as well, and the toilet room was separate in case someone's taking a shower and you need to go.  There is a nice little work station with a divider from the sleeping area.  It's Marriott, so internet access (hardwire or wireless) is free.  They have an outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi but we didn't have time to go.  The breakfast was standard Marriott.  Eggs, turkey sausage, grits, oatmeal, cereal, juice, coffee, toast, fruit, muffins, and make your own waffles.  I did notice their sanitation grade was 83 which is low, but that's likely because of all of the things like bread left out in the open.The hotel is walking distance to everything in the district this side of Bull St.  The Distillery, a craft beer bar, is around the corner.  This was nice because you can get ""to go"" drinks in Savannah.  The walk down Montgomery into the heart of the district was fine, but when we walked down Bay St it was a little sketchier.  River St, City Market, Telfair Museum, the Civic Center, the Lady and Sons, and more are all nearby.  The parking is valet only for $15 (typical for Savannah) but there also is a city parking garage next door that could be cheaper.I'd say if you get the right price for this hotel to stay at it.  It's a nice hotel with many amenities and is close to almost everything.The modern designs were interesting. Reminded me of south Florida,  intense greens and blues, bright lighting. But the rooms are nice with a sofa area and desk, flat panel TV, and comfortable beds with a lot of pillows. This location is close to the top of Bay Street. With ample places to eat. Just be sure to wear your sun glasses when you enter, otherwise you will be blinded by the neon green.Very modern. I love the design and suite set up. I have stayed in the double bed suite and king bed suite. Both are extremely room and all of the amenities one could ask for. The staff is courteous and attentive to guest needs, plus they have a concierge service. This is my second time back here and I will definitely make it a third.","This is a great location. The staff was very helpful. The beds were extra comfy; I asked for special pillows on the Marriott website and they did not disappoint. The decor is modern and ... interesting. The mirror in the bathroom is not your friend if you have body image issues. It's two mirrors in one - a circular mirror mounted to the wall mirror. (See the picture for a better idea.) The circular mirror doesn't fog, but it does distort your body! LOL, I had fun jumping around in the bathroom and watching myself go from short to tall.The breakfast, as far as free hotel breakfast goes, was awesome! They also have free coffee and tea all day. The only real complaint I had was the vents in our room. The bathroom vent started banging every morning at 6 a.m. The only way to make it stop was to turn on the light and leave the fan running. It stopped around ten. I didn't tell the front desk because it wasn't that big of a deal, but I'll leave a note on the comment card so they can look into the issue.All in all, made for a great ""home base"" in Savannah.Some friends and I were in Savannah for New Year's Eve 2011 and stayed at this new SpringHill Suites for a couple of nights. Thinking ahead and booking in advance saved us a few bucks on the room, and it's a good thing we did -- they had one open room left when we arrived that was going for a pretty high price (eavesdropping at the front desk, sleuth mode). While a relatively new property, the ""modern"" designs were...interesting. Reminded me a bit of South Beach -- super intense greens and blues, bead curtains, bright fluorescent lighting. But the rooms are nice with a sofa/seating area and desk, flat panel TV, modern appointments in the bathroom and toilet, and comfortable beds with ample pillows. Our room was never cleaned by house keeping. After the first night, we were still in the room when they came by to clean, and they never came back. We had to hit up the front desk a couple of times for clean towels. Boo. But it's not like we're slobs, so it wasn't horrible to not have the beds made up for our spoiled asses. This location is not a bad walk to the top of Bay Street and/or River Street. I'd stay here again, if my eyes can get past the neon greens.I just returned from a 3 night stay at the SpringHill Suites in Savannah downtown, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a spacious room near all the sights of Savannah.We were 4 women travelling for Girl's weekend, and we legit got everything we needed from this hotel: spacious room with a separate sitting area, check; walking distance to all the sights without any of the noise of the busier River or Bay streets, check; complimentary continental breakfast with a really good spread PLUS amazing coffee, check; great pool and hot tub area, perfect for relaxing in after a long day of walking and sight seeing, check.We had a few minor hiccups, like no towels at the pool, but these were brought up to us as soon as we called.  All the employees we dealt with were very friendly and helpful, which was a big (albeit not unexpected, as we are in the south) plus for us.  We did have a few rouge charges on our bill prior to checking out, but they were removed right away upon us calling them to the hotel's attention. Other than that, we had an excellent time at the SpringHill Suites, and would definitely recommend it to all types of travelers to Savannah.I wish I could rate this hotel higher. I just wasn't impressed overall. Let me start with the good points. The hotel is newer and gorgeous. The rooms look just like they do in the pictures, which was refreshing. The rooms were spacious too; the beds were SUPER comfy!! We stayed in a room with my husband's parents. The toilet is in its own water closet, which is convenient. Our room rate also included breakfast which was basic and tasty. The location is right off the expressway so the hotel was easy to find. The front desk clerk was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. He recommended a spot for cocktails that overlooked the river and the entire city. The ""eh"" points were that our shower was very slow to drain. I called to have the repairman come but when he did my father in law was in the shower. We asked that he return in a few minutes, but the repairman never showed. Also, there was a large wet spot outside of the bathroom caused by a leak of some sort from the shower tub. I expected better conditions from a new hotel. The water closet was not private at all. Since we were sharing a room it made for an uncomfortable ""potty"" situation. You heard EVERYTHING that went on in the water closet. The door was only a sliding door, so it didn't even offer you much in the way of visual privacy. I'm not sure if I would stay here again. One review states that they paid less than $100 for their room. We paid over $100. I guess we don't need all the fancy decor as we don't spend a lot of time in our room when we travel. If we paid less than $100 I would most likely stay there again. Overall it was a nice, decent, safe place to stay. I just wouldn't recommend sharing a room as it doesn't offer much in the way of bathroom privacy...which I guess is important to me.We spent one night here and would quite gladly stay again. The room was large and clean - we lucked into a corner room giving us windows on two walls - and very quiet. There were a bunch of folks eating the free breakfast with us but the cool design of the dining area makes it seem at least somewhat intimate. This is the third tome we've stayed at a SpringHill Suites in the past six months and we are fans. Recommended!Enjoyed this hotel. It was located within walking distance to a lot of the restaurants, bars and shops in the Savannah area.  The hotel was decorated nicely for the Christmas season and the room was very modern and large.  The toilet was separate from the shower, which was kind of different, but was helpful for a group of 5 girls all trying to get ready at the same time. The staff was helpful and kind.  The price of the hotel was very good.  Free breakfast is included.Great location in historic district.  Rooms were spacious and well equipped.  Staff was very approachable and friendly.  The gym was also surprisingly stocked considering that Springhill is on the lower end of the Marriott brands.  Free breakfast and wifi also a huge plus.  Downside: strange smell in hallway at times and the rooms also have that signature hotel deodorant smell.Super nice hotel located just far enough away from the craziness on the river.  They let me check in at 10am, which really helped me out, as i had to get ready for a wedding.  Parking is expensive, but we parked on the street or there is a parking garage right next door for much less.  They also have a very nice breakfast in the morning, and it's only a 5 minute walk to the river.  I will definitely be staying here next time i come to savannah.Stayed here with the whole family for one night, just stopping over in Savannah on a road trip.  The place was immaculate, rooms very modern but practical, great breakfast buffet. And it was affordable - less than $100 a night. Highly recommended if you are traveling and looking for a clean hotel.So far, so great!!! We checked in yesterday and will be here for a couple more days. The nite staff is super nice! Day staff is a little stiff. The rooms are wonderful and clean. Breakfast was good this morning except too many kids taking too many cream cheese cups and bananas but that has nothing to do with the hotel, it's called lack of supervision by parents. I did inform the desk about the lack and they called the kitchen staff to replenish. The lobby area is gorgeous! Free (good) coffee available 24/7!New hotel suites that are clean, modern, and affordable.  Free Breakfast heated pool/jacuzzi, large gym, and friendly staff.  Hotel is on the corner of Montgomery and Oglethorpe just a few short blocks from City Market (which starts at the Franklin Square) and River Street in the heart of Savannah's Historic District.This hotel was a mess.  It gets a star for its location, which is walking distance to things in the historic part of Savannah. The hotel gets only one star, because of the way it handled my reservation.  I had booked it months prior to my stay, and specified that I needed a crib and a tub.  The hotel put it in my notes, and then told me I needed to call the week of my reservation.  I did this three days before my reservation, and again they put it in my notes - assuring me that I would have the crib.  They asked that I call back the day before check-in, which I did.  I called and the lady said she would block the room and set up the crib.  When we checked in (around 1 am), the room lacked the tub and the crib.  The guy at the front desk had no knowledge of the room with the crib, nor were there any cribs available. We were transferred to a room equipped for disabled folks as it had a tub.  And, even after staying for 4 days -- no crib.  I tried to book at another hotel and the whole area was sold out.   I would have bought a crib, but had a weekend full of wedding events and did not have time to try to find a target in an area I did not know.Great hotel!!! Friendly staff!!! Very helpful! They recommended lots of places to eat and sights to see!! Hot breakfast! Big rooms with a separate sitting area with a built in desk. The only weird thing was the toilet was not in the bathroom with the shower. There were 2 separate rooms a shower and sink in one and toilet and sink in another. But it was very modern!!! Loved if!!! Big wardrobe to store clothes...  With Extra pillows in it!! I am already planning my next stay here!!!!Pretty good location, very walkable to River Front.  Was able to check in early (thanks!), but they do allow you to store your luggage if check in not yet available.  Not too many restaurants/bars around the hotel, so plan on going out.  Breakfast buffet included, but nothing extensive.  Consider avoiding the rooms on 2nd floor that are pool-side; the noise (people and hot tub bubbling) does affect the rooms, and the black out curtains do not black out.   Pool is very empty in the morning, so get up early and enjoy.  It may still be locked, however, so call the Front Desk and remind them.This is, by far and away, the best SpringHill Suites, and probably the best hotel in downtown Savannah.  This place makes me feel as if I am in the midst of the chic, young and sexy crowd.  The hotel oozes of style and substance with a certain sophistication and flair that is only reserved for top notch 5 star places.  The lobby is gorgeous and modern with decor that makes breakfast feel more like a nightclub setting that a hotel area.  (There are also some great beers in the giftshop.)  The rooms are ultra-modern, yet functional and well-designed.  The amenities are laid out intuitively and make for a spacious place to relax.  This hotel also offers concierge services which has all the inside info on the ins and outs of fun touristy activites and hot, Savannah nights.  The best attraction of all is the outdoor pool and spa.  It is not on the ground level, but on the 2nd floor!  It is built above the parking garage (where they have valet parking for $12) and has a privacy wall built around to keep out nosy gazes from next door, but it is in full view of most hotel rooms.  The resulting pool scene is pretty, ahem, lively, to say the least.  All in all, although I only spent one night, it feels like I've been staying here all the time.  It was cozy and made for one awesome trip.",,,"['nights', 'recently', 'family', 'daughter', 'soccer', 'team', 'tournament', 'town', 'lobby', 'breakfast', 'area', 'nice', 'really', 'like', 'layout',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/savannah-marriott-riverfront-savannah-2,Savannah Marriott Riverfront,2.5,$$$,78,"We ended up staying here for the evening since we were planning to do some evening activities in Downtown Savannah.  We booked it with the breakfast buffet included the following morning.Getting here was a bit tricky at first since there is a lot of construction going on with the roads there at the moment.  Parking is self parking at an additional cost of $21 per night.  The location is at the end of River Street.  Once we got to the front of the hotel, a bellman was there to take care of our bags and got them to our room.  We had booked a standard room, but we ended up getting a room where we were able to see the Savannah River and the boat traffic.  The view was actually nice and was able to see a great sunset as well.The room (715) was clean and what one would expect in terms of cleanliness.  However, the hotel is old and some updating is needed.  The bar locking the door to the balcony is broken and that door sticks,when trying to open or close it.  The beds were very comfortable and had a great night's sleep.The following morning, we had breakfast at the on-site dining location called Blue.  The breakfast was very good and the package included the full buffet.Once it was time to leave, we contacted bell services and Zack was up within a few minutes.  I took care of the checkout while he took care of getting the bags in the car for us.  Once that was all settled, we were on our way.Overall, this was a nice, but dated hotel.  I would stay here again.  I gave the three star rating instead of four due to the issues that need to be fixed in the room.  Overall, this hotel gets the job done.Filthy ceiling with dust from AC vent. You have to pay for WiFi....really. No breakfast included. One bar of soap. Obviously management is more focused on the bottom line than a delightful stay for the guests. Friendly staff nice balcony. Room 517 9/6UPDATE 2/14/2016. Got a gift certificate from the last time. Tried again. Roach ran into with us when we opened the door. Electric plug did not work.  They do not pay attention to the details hereWe had great service at check in. The room was clean and not outdated as I recall in other reviews (granted the shower floor squeaked as I moved around in the shower).  The balcony overlooking the river was a plus. The location was fantastic.  We took the river walk from the hotel to a nearby restaurant and enjoyed the stroll to and from. We only stayed one night but want to return to Savannah and stay here again.Stayed for only 2  nights, and even though check in process was easy and staff was friendly,  area outside was under construction, decor is a little out dated and walls are extremely thin. (during my second day, after we woke up i could hear everything that was happening in the room adjacent to mine, everything from the clear conversation and the guests toilet time. (yuck!).   Because we booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotel.com&amp;s=ca0318a6c5ca0df886d87a25575694b5522121f0584300bca238552cf615a0ab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotel.com</a>, we were given a $25 hotel credit, having three rooms -  we combined the credits.  We decided to use the $75 for room service. (Food was expensive and portions was ridiculously small. I do not recommend. )  Hotel was over was clean and has a nice view and easy access to the riverfront. Great views from our room.Booked online. Dated rooms. Vents need to be cleaned/filters changed, my allergies while in the room was kicked up in high gear! Everytime we would leave the room, my breathing would be better.  Room was clean but just a old scent to it. Balcony had a partial river view.We were only here overnight, and it was really close to  restaurants best part of our stay. Construction outside in front of hotel really no issue getting thru. (NO VALET!! Self parking ONLY that will cost you...  $21 a day!This place is great the staff was wonderful . The room was awesome and very clean . I had room service and the food was delicious I had the steak . Room service price was  high but this is riverside. I will defiantly come back the hotel was very safe for a single women alone.  I will say it's a little out of date . And the elevators probably need to be replaced but every thing else was great. And the house keeping need to clean the Windows and dust tables in hall and pics on walls . But I really enjoyed my stay.Hello ... 1998 called ... and it would like its hotel back. If you think Savannah is historic -- wait until you walk into the Savannah Marriott Riverfront. While the staff gets an A for effort -- the entire hotel is in desperate need of an overhaul. Everything from the carpet to the decor seems dated. Once you get passed the old schoolness, it's not a bad hotel. Mind you -- it's not a great hotel as the place seems remiss when it comes to attention to detail. (Overhead lights were out in our room, outlets weren't working, key cards worked intermittently.) I think the thing that griped me the most was that the Concierge area was closed on the weekends. Fortunately, parking and wireless is free for Platinum members. Nevertheless -- the staff is some of the most affable, congenial you'll find at any Marriott. Everyone made me feel like they had my back from the minute I walked in the door. It made a so-so experience less ... uh, so.Great place. So friendly and accommodating; clean and comfortable. The pool was nice and warm and, within a spectacularly huge glass roofed atrium.  The 'Blue' restaurant was great too: food and service. But what really set the restaurant apart was the incredible breakfast buffet. Loved the view of the river. We would definitely stay here again. Only reason not five stars: no fridge or microwave in the room.I had a pretty pleasant experience staying here. Luckily I did not get the joy of the 7am cargo boat wake up call or I would probably be singing another tune. The staff were friendly and the rooms always clean which is more than you can say for a lot of hotels.I left my brand new iPad charger there, which is likely long gone by now, but maybe waiting for me on my next visit up to Savannah.I was extremely reluctant to stay at this hotel, due to the numerous poor reviews. But my brother travels extensively for work, and he was renting our hotel rooms with points from a loyalty program. Due to the ACCG Conference in town, the Savannah Mariott Riverfront was the only hotel that fit our criteria, his loyalty program, and had enough rooms available for my whole family.I was pleasantly surprised. We needed a few accommodations that were minor but very important, and the Mariott came through on each. (Example: my father needed a mini-fridge in his room for diabetes medicine.) The front desk staff were also very friendly.A few things of note:There is construction going on next door. The road is closed, but you can get in and out of the hotel. There's a sign indicating that Marriott guests can proceed through.One of my family members slept on a pull-out sofa during our stay. He reported that it was very uncomfortable. I can't say I've ever slept on a comfortable sofa bed, but it's something to keep in mind.The hotel restaurant is expensive. The food is good, though.I really have nothing bad to say about my personal experience. Nothing blew my mind, but it was a pleasant stay.What a gorgeous hotel with wonderful staff. Whether you pull up or walk in you're immediately greeted by at least 2-3 staff members. The bartender Kirk is very personable and quickly has your order memorized! The hotel offers a bar, indoor pool, restaurant and a beautiful view. The room was comfy and quiet welcoming with a great view. The bathrooms however were a disappointment, the toilet had a ring of mold and the grout in the shower had mold. The paint was also chipping and dusty. The Blue restaurant was delicious but served at room temp which alerted us it was left standing for awhile. We took some food back to our room as a late night snack but the fridge was far from cold and never cooled. It was a lovely hotel just needed a few fix upsThis place while on the riverfront is a bit off the beaten path. The hotel is with its atrium is definitely dated but the rooms are OK, the bathroom is fairly large in particular as compared to most other Marriotts. My biggest issue was with the bed which was much too soft for my liking. The lounge offers breakfast and dessert in the evening but the menu never changes, so it becomes boring after a while. When selecting a room try to get a riverfront view, while its a hike from the elevator its worth it.Originally, I planned to stay at another hotel and when that did not pan out, I easily chose this hotel. Sure there is construction. It's not necessarily convenient but their location in general is so convenient that it works out anyway. We never had problems with the elevators, but there was quite a bit of noise if you were sitting outside at night due to dredging in the river. Of course that is not their fault either. All the perks - we were upgraded at no cost because it was our wedding night and then they also ended up comping us one of our nights to congratulate us. It was such a kind gesture. The view was very pretty. The room was very clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff members were so nice. All of them. We passed by employees outside and they always greeted us genuinely and held doors. The room service was on point. Tasty! We were there during a convention but it didn't seem overly crowded. All the guests were kind too. We had a wonderful experience and I would go again and recommend it.Staff was friendly and attentive. The soda machines were out of water on our floor, both buttons. Water leaking from ice Machine across the hallway carpet.Construction next door bit of hassle not their fault. The barges early in the a.m. We're entertaining. Nice to walk the Riverwalk and all the shops nearby. Yes would stay here again.Savannah MarriottNight 1The elevators did not work, they had to be called, in order to be used. Very bad wind &amp; thunder storm, and the lights went out for over 5 hours. No food, and had to take the stairs. They did not have an adequate back up generator to keep the party going. I was so ready to leave and go back home. Day 2 My hubby called room service 4xs, to order breakfast and he was no one answered, he was always bounced to the front desk. I then called front desk, and gave them the business, and he said he would take my order then and there. I thought about it and decided I did not want a spit sandwich, so I changed my mind about ordering. The wifi is horrible, kept going in and out. Day 3 &amp; 4I don't have the energy to even continue  just stay elsewhere, and make sure to check your bill. We were charged for parking., but we did not have a car.Stayed here for a conference. It is an older hotel but was clean and staff nice. All the meals we had were good.  It can be a long walk down hall after hall to get to your room. On river street but all the way down at the end, but at least you don't have to worry about parking. Probably back in the day this was the ""it"" hotel but now there are a lot of newer ones but would still stay here again. River view rooms are the best.Pros- Staff was friendlyLocation was on the river, close to downtown. Cons-$19 per day to park your carWifi is also not freeNo refrigerator No safeHad a ""do not disturb"" sign on door and at 9am they continued to bang on the door anyways to try and clean the room. Construction / road and sidewalk closed. Mattress was terrible. (Too soft)Our view of the river had a chimney in front of it. Worst Marriott experience ever.The view of the river and the location are great. That's about where the good news ends. The hotel is outdated dirty and we had a real shortage of hot water. Overpriced for what to get. I have stayed at many Marriott's most of them are excellent this one doesn't make a list. Proceed at your own risk!It's pretty and on the waterfront. That's where the list of pros end.  The rooms with a waterfront view also overlook a big courtyard which has a glase dome roof.  The dome basically acts as a big funnel that channels all of the noise from the courtyard up into your room.  You will hear everything going on below.  My particular room adjoined a sweet, so there was a door that could connect to the suite, which allowed me to hear EVERYTHING going on in the suite.  I could have carried on a conversation with neighbors without raising my voice.  There's no mini-fridge, no thermostat on the AC, and the beds were a bit lumpy.So I flew to Alabama from LA and drove all the way and after eight hours of getting to this hotel I was given a room on the fifth floor with a king bed and not our requested double beds. Our room is directly above  the hotels air conditioning system which makes a ton of noise. Upon calling the front desk I was told there was nothing they could do to accommodate us. I requested we at least receive a complimentary  breakfast and that was also denied. I've been in the travel industry for more than 20 years and never have I been to a Marriott location that was so unprofessional and unaccommodating to their guests. We are only staying one night and I'm so grateful for that. I definitely don't recommend staying at this property unless they can boost up their management skills and their reservation abilities. Only plus note I have is that the bell service was very kind and sympathetic.","It's a Marriott, for heaven's sake. It should be better. The staff were friendly and always greeted us with a smile, but they seemed short-staffed. The hotel was functional, but it was run down and unclean. Grime on stall doors in conference section ladies' room. Restrooms not tended to during a heavily attended conference. The pillows in my room smelled like unwashed, oily hair, the duvet was ripped, and the carpet was dirty. Housekeeping changed the pillows after I asked for a deep cleaning of the room, but the carpet stayed dirty. I monitored the space between the back of the toilet and the wall over the course of my 5-night stay; the detritus and hair remained. I don't care if you have a fancy name, nice shower head, and curved shower rod, if it's not clean, it's not worth my money. On Monday, a beer bottle stayed in the elevator area on my floor all day. Later in the week, it was a wine glass that sat for at least 24 hours. It was just kind of sad.The high point was the awesome omelette custom made at Blue, their restaurant. Also, room service was prompt and polite.Hotel is located on the end of a busy strip. It's slightly off the beaten path but it's walkable to everything and is right on the riverfront. The staff were super friendly and the room was nice. The parking garage is creepy, smelly, and does not appear safe but nothing bad happened while the car was parked there full of stuff for a day and a half.  I would stay here again. The stay was priced according to its outdated look.I can only rate my experience... 8th floor with a water view was really nice! Breakfast was great! The convenience to river street was awesome! The free water ride was terrific.I have stayed at this hotel in the past, and I can say it's lost some of its flair!!! They need to make the needed corrections...Had a wonderful experience here ... Well located and the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating ... Michael the PM Lounge Attendant was INCREDIBLE ... Extremely knowledgable about the town, very friendly, great personality and VERY helpful!!! The Marriott is lucky to have him as a member of their team!!!They lack the technology and the staff to deal with emergency situations.  In May 2015 we were stuck on the elevator during a power outage, elevator communication systems did not work, we had no communication with the outside world for over 15 minutes.  Afterwards we talked to front desk, sales manager and hotel manager and they could care less.  They said their phones are computer based so if they loose power they loose phones.  Not a place to be in an emergency.Here for conference as Preferred member. View is really bad unless you get on high floor over River. Feedback from dozens here are Most rooms smell really bad and the walls are Paper thin. At all costs, avoid hotel especially once new Hampton Inn is completeThe hotel could have been awesome... It's in a nice location on the riverfront, and while the rooms were decent, they did not reflect the price. We came for Valentine's weekend getaway. We booked a month in advance. A very friendly bellhop helped us to our room, where I discovered two double beds instead of the king bed we were expecting (hello, a married couple... Valentine's weekend) I called the front desk, where she told me in a polite voice but in rude words that she wouldn't be accommodating us. We had a couples massage at the spa, which was awesome, until we realized they charged us $20 more than the receipt we signed. Automatic ""gratuity"" was already included in the price. Naturally the front desk polite/ rude girl couldn't help us, and the spa was conveniently closed. Our ""complimentary "" wifi never worked, the toiletries in our room were half used and had clearly not been replaced prior to our arrival, and the luxurious balcony and patio chairs were covered in bird poop. And finally, we didn't receive breakfast vouchers that we were promised at check in. When we went to inquire about them the following morning, there were two front desk staff that spent an uncomfortable amount of time asking us what happened to the original vouchers we were given (never received), and a solid five minutes attempting to locate another voucher to give us. I don't really know what the big deal was, but they were making subtle accusations that we had done something with the vouchers. When that many things are wrong, it becomes a job in itself to right them, and I didn't come to this hotel to work. Get it right, Mariott. Your guest deserve better than this, and your rewards members definitely deserve better.Awful start of the day with the most awful breakfast! By the way, Marriotts, atleast this one and the one we stayed at in Montreal have this whole process where the breakfast provided if you are an elite member is just the cold options and cereals. You need to pay additional $$ for the hot selections. Which is fine but the food was the worst I have tasted in a long time. Well I hardly ate any of it after the first couple of bites. Hope this doesn't set the tone for the rest of the day.That part of the review was written while I was attempting to eat a few spoonfuls of the breakfast that day.The good thing about this Marriott was that it has the view of the river so we were able to watch the annual boat parade from our room.The staff - courteous, friendly - especially, I believe it was , Michael, who was super nice and helped us with some glitches in the reservation.The location of this Marriott is more to one end and that means quite a walk to check out this lovely city.I was more amused than disappointed at this next thing I am gonna talk about. We had two rooms and in the one with the two full sized beds (these beds are super small, good for kids I'd think), we noticed that the sheets were torn. We were way too tired to call up the front desk and report it and have it changed.Looking back at my stay there, I don't really hate it, but I wasn't wooed by it either. Next time around, I might opt for staying at the Hyatt that seemed better situated in the historic downtown or elsewhere. Probably my rating is more a 2.5 or a 2+ than a 2.Just so you know, I love staying at the Marriotts , and have been staying in them almost everywhere I travel to.  Some of them, like this one, wasn't a great experience.Avoid this hotel. The hotel is in need of a major overhaul! The room we stayed in was musty and dirty. Furniture was worn out.This place is horrible. We will never stay here again. It's run-down, the staff don't seem to care about maintenance (lazy housekeeping, etc.), and has pretty much no redeeming qualities. Don't eat the food here. Everything is low-quality, bland, and inadequately prepared. The parking situation is ridiculous. You have to pay to park at your own hotel and the spaces are tiny. The view was of some roofs of the building. I've never stayed in a suite with such a distasteful view. The decor is really sad. Everything needs to be updated. Nothing is cohesive. The only perk is that it's moderately close to places of interest.Had to stay in this hotel while attending a conference.  The conference food was terrible.  We ate all other meals outside of the hotel.  The air in the hotel was musty.  All of the drink machines were out of sodas and waters and kept your money.  The worst is the spa, $85 for a very bad pedicure. The elevators were not working one evening.  Many of the people in the hotel went above with their service but unfortunately the total experience was far less than desirable. There are so many beautiful places to stay in Savannah but this isn't one of them.My experience was great staff!  Bell Captain, front desk, concierge, and maid service was very professional and accommodating. My only criticisms are that it would be nice to have a coffee bar open in the morning and parking is definitely overpriced.  Current construction next door but I thought the views were awesome.  I would definitely stay here again.Hotel in bad need of a refurb. Location is not ideal. Staff very friendly and the only reason this hotel gets 2 stars. Next time we will stay in a bed and breakfast. Don't bother. Not worthy of the price.FOUND A USED CRACK PIPE IN THE ROOMI'm going to start from when we were checking out of the hotel: We mainly lived out of our suitcase for the few days we stayed here, so we didn't even open the drawers or closet to put our things in. When we were packing up, I opened the top drawer of the bedside table (the same one containing a bible) and found A USED CRACK PIPE sitting in the drawer right next to the bible. First, the cleaning crew should definitely have cleaned that drawer out (unless they're the ones using the crack pipe), second: are you kidding? This is a family hotel. They're lucky we didn't have little kids in the room playing around in the drawers, finding the crack pipe, and putting it in their mouth. I would've sued for that. Not to mention the crack addict who lost their pipe! Another lucky find was a pair of dirty men's socks next to the bed that belonged to neither of us staying in the room. Other than the obvious problem i have with finding a used crack pipe in my hotel room, the hotel lobby is kind of empty and definitely needs a new decorating scheme, and since the pool is right there it smells like chlorine everywhere. The beds were comfortable, but when we first got there the guy told us we would have a ""city view"" which really was a room overlooking the roof of the hotel and the construction across the street. We did get switched to another room right on the river with a nice view of the water. The restaurant was mediocre. We got the breakfast buffet which came with waffles made to order, and had to wait way too long and send in multiple waitresses to go get the cook. The food was average.Also, there was a vent in the room blowing cold air the entire time we were there. The room was freezing so we called the front desk, and since it was late at night they said they would send somebody to the room the next day to fix it. Nobody ever came, and the room was freezing the whole time.Not a bad hotel... if you like be blasted out of bed at 6am by one of the cargo ships steaming past your hotel room. Yes, that's right. They blast their horns just as they pass by the hotel. OK, well, to be fair maybe it was 6:40am. Still, there is no way you can sleep through that! Oh, and the fire alarm woke us up at 2:20am. That was the first time THAT had happened to me! Thankfully we didn't have to evacuate but we did have to wait for them to resolve the issue then noisily announce that they had. The room was sufficient and the lobby was nice enough. How odd that the indoor pool is literally inside the hotel. The desk staff was nice but our bags took quite a while to get to our room when we checked in. We got a room with a balcony overlooking the river. The view was kind of nice, but the way the balconies are designed you are right on top of your neighbors. We stepped out on the balcony and were surprised to here, ""Hello!"" from our neighbor on their balcony. We could have shook hands! You can also see right in to your neighbors room from your balcony. So much for leaving the shade open to enjoy our view!The walk to the historic district or river front is a bit much too. Its not that it's really FAR, but it up a hill on busy Bay street. It is not a pleasant walk. Or you can walk the dark alley closer to river... Just don't do it alone. For the money there are so many other hotel options in Savannah...Ended up staying here since another hotel in town where we pre-booked was so bad (see other hotels review). This place was great from the staff to the cleanliness of the room. I called from the other hotels parking lot and they told me they had enough space and our last minute request to stay would be no issue.   When we pulled up we were greeted by not one but two bell hops who were very inviting and will to help off-load our car full of luggage while we went to check-in. During this time they kept a great conversation telling us about places around town and how things have changed since our last time in Savannah.   This hotel is a short walk down the river (600-800 yards) to all the food and night life you can ask for. If walking isn't for you the water taxi is just out the backdoor.   This is a place I will be staying at a number of time over the next year as we plan our wedding in Savannah. Also we will mostlikly have our wedding party stay here. If you want a great place to stay with friendly staff stay here.  My only suggestion is if it is possible try and get a room on the river side and watch the boats go by and relax on the balcony. I have also read other post about the Fire Alarm issues. It did have an issue Monday night. Luckly we were jsut coming in. But on check out the took off the charges for parking for both nights ($40) just for the inconvience.What a gip. Nothing was as told or advertised upon checking in, which put a bit of a downer on the trip, especially for the price this room cost.I was guaranteed a room overlooking the river. Every good review mentions the view first. Since that's what was advertised that's what I wanted, but hell, I would've settled for a room that looked out toward the inside of the hotel lobby. Instead what was given was a room overlooking the back employee parking lot. What a view...look at that lavish oil stain over there! They also charge you a parking fee. I never saw mention of that anywhere until checking in so be prepared for that if you're driving.Lastly, the bed in the room was terrible. It was lumpier than Golden Corral's mashed potatoes and the thread count on the sheets must've been 8 because they were one step away from sandpaper. If you're coming to Savannah I urge you to look elsewhere for a hotel room.My husband and I stayed here Presidents Day/Valentine's Day weekend and had a very pleasant experience. - Excellent, friendly service. Every staff member we encountered was extraordinarily pleasant.- Very good, if not ideal, location. You have to walk about 4-5 blocks to get to the action, but it's a pleasant walk if you are in halfway decent shape (assuming the weather isn't awful.) Only took a cab once, and it was because I was wearing 4-inch heels and the restaurant was on the edge of Historic downtown.- Perfectly clean.- Comfortable bed. I liked that it was a little lower than most beds, and it faced the window.- Prompt and efficient room service.- Average food - eat somewhere else. Savannah has the best food!- The balcony was a nice touch, even if the view was of the street :)- We did not use them, but I liked that there was an indoor pool and a bar.We were charged two nights for parking, even though we didn't have a car, but they promptly removed the charges once we brought it to their attention. Parking is $19/night, which is mildly annoying, but what can ya do. We probably would have parked in one of those $10 public garages nearby, if we had brought a car. Savannah is very walkable (and parking downtown isn't easy) so I really don't see the need for one, anyway. Also, Marriott hotels seem to charge for Wi-Fi in the rooms across the board, which I don't love, but it's certainly not a showstopper. I also would have liked a refrigerator in the room (we often left restaurants with delicious leftovers but nowhere to store them!) But overall, this is a great hotel and I would recommend it!This Marriott is not what I have come to expect from Marriott. Some elements and moments of our stay were terrific but too many sad and unpleasant experiences diminish my rating. This makes me feel bad for the hotel employees that provided outstanding service and hospitality, but their peers with bad attitude and ambivalence to customers demolish any opportunity for greater success -- very unfortunate. First I will share some highlights followed by disappointments...The folks at the front door -- bell hops and parking attendants -- were terrific. Very helpful, super friendly and always with a bright and perky presence. The same was true with the ladies that hosted the Sunday brunch (private affair in one of the Marriott ballrooms) as if we were all guests in their dining room at home (their brunch food was also terrific -- very yummy and hit the spot). The front desk crew was pretty good, usually helpful and quick to respond though, sometimes, a bit aloof or reacting with a bit of confusion. Still, even the front desk folks contributed to the positive elements of our experience.One example -- one that also revealed another hard-working but neglected employee -- may help illustrate a bit of disconnect with front desk folks getting things done: it was a Saturday night, just after the lobby bar closed at 10pm, and we had a group of eight that were hoping to grab a nightcap and chat before heading to bed. The only place in the hotel was the bar/lounge at Blue, the upstairs restaurant. We were not the only guests to visit Blue in search for an evening cocktail: once we arrived there were 14 patrons ready to order a drink. The bad news: just a single employee was working at Blue. This includes the restaurant-side of Blue along with the bar/lounge -- just a single employee and 14 patrons. I saw how frazzled this young lady was as she tried to mix cocktails AND tend to the folks sitting in the restaurant side of Blue -- it was just more than a single person could handle. I zipped down to the front desk, explained the situation and asked, ""is there any way we can get her some help?"" The clerk at the front desk had a confused reaction -- seemed like she had no idea how to respond -- so, I made a suggestion. ""Can we get these guys (pointed to the two employees cleaning-up the just-closed bar next to the front desk) to help her out?"" That triggered a response and, eventually, one of the guys at the lobby bar walked up to Blue to help our frazzled server. So, the front desk crew did respond but in a slightly tentative, unsure fashion.Now the bad news: the guy that came to help at Blue was horrible. Had a bad attitude and absolutely no sense of hospitality in his demeanor or actions. He asked me what I would like and I ordered two Manhattans. He asked me what type: dry, sweet or perfect. Kinda caught me off-guard as I really didn't recall the difference. Sadly, he decided to explain by using a severely condescending tone. This didn't help as I do know something about the ingredients and process to make a Manhattan -- so that annoyed me. I asked for an old-school, traditional recipe and he proceeded to assemble the ingredients -- great, we are getting somewhere, now! Then he could not find bitters -- he had the bourbon and sweet vermouth but no bitters. I told him ""don't sweat it -- forget the bitters"" and he covered the mixing container and began to shake it. That surprised me as the traditional technique is to STIR any cocktail that does not include citrus or egg white. But, whatever, we just wanted our drinks. He strained the frothy mixture into glasses when a neighboring patron said, ""whoa, Chief -- the edge of that glass is broken!"" Sure enough, the lip of one glass had a big, jagged chip missing. The bartender said, ""I can take care of that"" and poured the mixture back into the shaker-cup and tossed the glass into the trash. He grabbed another glass and began to strain the liquid into the new glass -- I stopped him there. ""You need to start over -- for all we know there could be glass in that liquid."" He stared at me and said, ""really!?"" I confirmed my request and he was clearly not pleased. Once the process was complete he charged me $30 -- $15 for each Manhattan. And remember, these Manhattans were incomplete since he could not find his bitters -- still, he thought it appropriate to charge me full price... an extremely hefty price for a simple Manhattan.With drinks in-hand I went back downstairs where my group had assembled. In just a few minutes that same bartender with the attitude appeared and hollered over at us, ""just so you know, the police are likely to be here soon to ask you guys to clear-out."" Ok, whatever -- that was a bit of a buzzkill. Too bad, as the poor service overshadowed the good elements of our stay.I didn't stay in a room here, so I cannot rate that part of the hotel, but for any large function, like a Military Ball, these people totally dropped the err... ball.. on this one. Severely understaffed. Incompetent employees. The food was terrible and cold. It was hot in there and no one ever brought water around. It took over an hour to be served, and then half the table was forgotten about. I counted trays of food being dropped on the floor five times. Totally unacceptable. The bar was understaffed. People stood around for 20 to 30 minutes for a SODA. You'd think, for a place that has a banquet hall, they'd be able to staff it.","Though this is months late, I figured it's better late than never. Perk #1: They play great music in the lobby. RHCP was on when I started the draft to this review months ago. Amazing taste. Perk #2: The lobby area is a great place to grab a drink from the bar and lounge in one of their comfy chairs. Many opportunities to people watch. The author in me was one happy camper during these lazy moments. I also discovered the wonders of a mint julep. Thinking of that now... I want one. Gahhhh. Perk #3: Right by the water and the tourist trap street. GO GET CANDY!Perk #4: Right on the water so you can see all the boats as they sail by.Perk #5: Beds are comfy, rooms are clean, lots of FREE shampoo/conditioner/mouth wash/body wash. Boom. Perk #6: Front desk is great about calling you on time and calling a cab if you need one to get to the airport. Not so great #1: A bit of a walk because you're close to the edge of the area. Not so great #2: No mini fridge in your room, so no keeping water bottles chilled. They have one of those little bottle coolers though, so you can run to the ice machine and keep water bottles (or whatever else that's bottled) chilled.Not so great #3: Pool indoors. Awkward because there's balconies overlooking the lounge area, so if you want to go for a swim inside... be prepared to be scrutinized if there's anyone chilling on the balcony. Not so great #4: Restaurant food here is gross. So, my thoughts on Savannah: I wouldn't enjoy it if I came here simply for a vacation. I'd run out of things to do after the first few days, and since there really isn't a beach to lounge at (as far as I know), I'd be going nuts by day 3. Thankfully, I got to experience the area and kept myself occupied enough with this reader/author convention I attended. When I wasn't attending an author panel, I was exploring and terrorizing the streets with my friend. Pretty sweet deal.If I ever decided to come back to Savannah, I'd definitely stay here again.Motel was ok but it's at the very end of river street and far from any attractions. Was here for a conference and the meals were provided. Some of the worst food I have ever had. School food was better than these meals Not on my list to visit againGreat location, but my bed had torn/ripped bedding.  I even left it viewable every day I  was there and they staff just made the bed around it.  The floor was filthy and the tile in the bathroom could not hide the urine stains.  The public bathrooms were disgusting.  I was overcharged on my bill for ""guest"" parking which was absurd to me since I didn't drive.  The desk acted like I didn't even stay there when I asked them to adjust the billing.  As a Marriott reward member I would not stay there agin.I don't know what everyone else experienced but our stay has been great. We booked with two different points accounts and they were accommodating with letting us stay in the same room. Kathy Jo was the lady at the front desk who made it worth writing a review. She's been so helpful and sweet and told us some good places to eat. The only reason I took away a star is because it isn't right in the middle of everything like it makes it sound but it's not that much extra of a walk. And also the parking is pretty high but she was very sweet about it. I think people need to get over the view thing, obviously everyone wants a nice view so clearly not everyone can get one. We're on the 8th floor and overlooking a roof but I'm not complaining. It's not like they all gathered around and decided they would give you the worst view they could.It was a good hotel. When we checked in, our room was frigid. Even with the air of and fan on low it seem to still pump out cold air. Even when we put it on heat, same dilemma. The staff was responsive and helped fix the situation.The hotel was in a decent location from things. It took about 8min walk to begin to run into the restaurants. Our room was facing the inside of the building. It has some ambient natural light but it was a little awkward.We stayed in this hotel for a conference, so fortunately got a much cheaper rate than $260 which is way overpriced for this rundown hotel.  The hotel is in dire need of being updating and the amenities are limited.  When we arrived around midnight, it took 5-10 min to find someone at the front desk (though we had called ahead to say we would have a late arrival about that time).  There was no refrigerator in the room so I asked for one and at first was told they would send one right up, but then was called 30 min later to say they were out of them but would get one tomorrow.  We never received it during our stay.  There is no complimentary breakfast or even coffee beyond what is in the room.  The hotel bar is over priced for a limited selection and closes at 10pm due to the interior facing hotel rooms and balconies.  The outdoor pool was drained. The indoor pool is in the main atrium of the hotel and conference exhibits and activities are also right there, making it an odd set up.  There once was a hot tub, but now there is a large plant in the hot tub.  You have to pay for parking ($7.00 per day) and there is serious problem with people double parking their cars.  Coming in late at night, we struggled to find a parking space but passed more than 10 cars that were double parked.  The walls are very thin and one night around 3am our neighbors decided to have a bluegrass concert complete with loud harmonica.  After calling the front desk, someone did come up but just said ""please try to keep it down"" rather than being more enforcing.  I stay in Marriott's frequently and this hotel fell far below what I expect from the company.Never ever again!  This hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel, and I don't know how.  It is disgusting.  It was filthy, totally outdated, and there are just simply no words to describe how much I hated this place.  Specifically, I killed multiple cockroaches in my hotel room.  The public access bathrooms on the main floor were disgusting.  It appeared they had not been cleaned in weeks.  I've seen cleaner gas station bathrooms.  Wi-Fi is not free at this hotel, but it has always been free at EVERY Marriott I have ever stayed at.  Not only will I not stay at this hotel again, I will not give any Marriott related hotel my business, that's how horrible this experience was.  DO NOT STAY HERE!  The location is horrible, the accommodations are horrible.I am so disappointed with this hotel. It costed nearly $200 a night and did not include anything (breakfast, Internet in the room, parking  are extra, priced at 15/20$ each/a day). The room was nothing special, small with small tv, quite depressing. Many people brag about the view but my room had a view of the air conditioning units of the hotel. In addition to the poor view (or lack of) the windows were so dirty I could barely see through. I can't believe they sell that room at that price. The indoor pool looked cute but not worth the price. The location is not bad but there are better hotels closer to the center.I checked in for two nights and they upgraded me to a suite which had a view overlooking the Savannah River. I watched the large vessels travel up and down the sixty foot deep river which at times is so tranquil and peaceful looking. The Savannah Marriott is located steps from the river walk shops, pubs and restaurants and the trolley tour stop is located in front of the hotel. The fitness center has been remodeled recently and has new treadmills, life steppers and life cycles in addition to free weights and a universal cable machine. There's also an indoor &amp; outdoor swimming pool and a spa located on site. The staff here was very friendly and accommodating from the staff at the front desk, club lounge and restaurant.A gorgeous hotel right near the Riverwalk with beautiful views of the river- even though it rained through half of our stay it was nice to look out on the water. The staff was friendly and courteous and the hotel was very clean and house keeping kept everything clean and well stocked. Our room had a mini fridge, but alas we had to pay for wifi :( The hotel is obviously well suited for convention business and has a big open lounge, a gym, and a pool that is right there out on the open on the main floor so the hotel has a little smell of chlorine. Boo. Tip: AVOID the restaurant. It's expensive, has poor service and the food is merely edible. But I don't hold that against the rest of the hotel.What made this stay a 4 star stay was the staff. I see others have issues with this location but in my case anything that was a problem and I only had one was fixed within seconds of not minutes by the staff. There is wear on the walls of the room in the bathroom but all in all the room with a riverview was awsome. The Concierge service here is unrivaled. They will do anything it takes to make your stay perfect. Honestly the only issue I have is a noise complaint on a Monday morning that made it so my wife had to threaten to call the police because it was 1am it was just not a party day. After a couple of complaints by me and my wife they did end up fixing things. All in all this was a great place to stay especially if you have a special event like a 10 year annaversary as they will go the extra mile for you!In a word - dump.  I should have done more research but I was in a hurry and appreciated the Marriott name and reputation.  I could not have been more wrong.  $400/night got me a pathetic room with a tiny balcony and squeaky doors.  Forgot your shaving cream?  - they'll sell you a little travel sample for $7.50.  Room not cleaned by 2pm?  Call down. I did. Three times and finally got it cleaned by 430pm.  Zero amenities. And I mean zero. Service staff could give a damn.  Sure, the location is good but you're a five minute walk to the hilton. And that's where I'll be on my next visit. UPDATE - just found out they charged me an extra day...plus parking.With spacious common areas, this hotel was obviously built for convention business. We stayed here over a holiday weekend and were very pleased. The staff, from the bellmen, to the front desk, to housekeeping, were all attentive and friendly. Our room was good size and nicely decorated. The mattress, pillows, linens were very comfortable. Not sure when the last time this hotel was renovated but it had a clean and bright appearance. I did think it was odd to place an indoor pool and hot tub in the lobby/atrium of the hotel. The outdoor pool was inconspicuously tucked away on the side of the hotel. Just thought these two placements were unusual. But, that's just me. The location is far enough away from River Street and the historic district to make you feel removed, but yet close enough for a short walk to get in the mix. I would definitely stay here again.I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  I like the decor.  It definitely has southern charm. but the hotel is old and worn out.  paint chipping in the bathroom.  fixtures sagging. The layout is weird, but I love the atrium. The interior balconies open up to a view of the River.  The housekeeping  was great, But the walls are thin.  I could hear the guy on the other side of me coughing.  Request an upper floor room. or stay in one of the many locally owned placesThis hotel was built for the 1996 olympics. Overall a nice hotel, a few blocks from the main action in Savannah. It is on the river and with a great view of the ships entering Savannah. The rooms are a bit dated. The bathrooms have not been updated recently, TV sets are ""OLD"" but functional. The river side rooms have small balconies but great for a drink or chilling at the end of the day. The breakfast buffet is generous and with a great selection of food and a very attentive staff. The front desk is typically not busy and they offer really good service. The lobby bar is ""SLOW"" and the service is really not much to talk about. You have to hail the bar man multiple times to get service, ... There are lots of other bars around, so go elsewhere to get the service you deserve. There is a small pool at the lobby level and there is a little smell of chlorine. For a family weekend in Savannah this is a great option.I travel quite a bit, and this was a stay paid for with reward points.  It may say Marriott on all the linens, but this was run more like a Days Inn.We had trouble with the front desk on four occasions (did they strive for a team of incompetent people?); total lack of towels or of house keeping service on one day; bad directions/recommendations from their concierge service (do they even go try these things themselves?); taxi cab issues at the bell stand; and high prices or supplemental charges for every little thing.  Concierge Lounge sucked, Spa closed before its posted hours (receptionist said they weren't real busy, so decided to close early ... I watched as the staff grabbed their bags and left potential customers standing there); the bartenders were lazy (Glenn); overall, the hotel was grimy and needed sprucing upI'm used to Marriotts like the one in Greenbelt MD just outside of DC.  The Savannah Marriott GM should travel there to see what a Marriott is supposed to be.I would give this hotel a better rating. However, I am here for a convention - 500 of us (FIVE HUNDRED) have been here for 5 days now - and at this moment we are having our final awards banquet. I can't even imagine the money this association has  paid out to this hotel to put on this fabulous convention. This last night at our biggest awards banquet the hotel has booked the adjacent room to a more lively group. We are  honoring men and women who have made great accomplishments in our industry, but are forced to hear top forty songs and inappropriate hip hop songs through the paper thin wall that separates us from the other room. I am disappointed that the hotel did not take these things into consideration, and will not make adjustments - despite the abundant amount of complaints to front desk -  to make everyone comfortable. I would think twice before scheduling a major event at this hotel.The front desk took forever to check us in even though no one else was on line. Bellhops overly ""friendly"" kind of hinting that they expected large gratuities.Our room was nice and clean. The window view? facing the inside of the lobby downstairs. Our room feeeeezing with no thermostat to control the temp. We slept with heavy blankets and layers of sweatshirts. Guess where you can warm up; in the gym! The gym is clean, spacious, &amp;well equipped with modern high quality machines. BUT it is the warmest room in the hotel! No thermostat there either. Maids were knocking on our door on Sunday Morning every hour after 9am even though we'd already received a 1pm late checkout. We were charged for internet and for self parking.On a positive note, this hotel is clean, spacious and the beds are very comfortable. It is in a great location at end of Riverfront walk.Very nice staff here!  I ate at the lounge and had a TON of extra pasta.  I lamented that I wouldn't be able to take the food with me and the bartender IMMEDIATELY called maintenance and asked them to send up a mini refrigerator to my room.  She anticipated my need before I even thought to ask.The rooms were clean and I had enough towels.  The pool is a little confusing to get to, well, the outdoor pool.  There are two pools, an outdoor and an indoor!  Of course, for the price per night, it SHOULD be nice.  You must pay for wifi, but you no longer have to pay for parking as an overnight guest.The bar and restaurant close a bit early and there's really not much going on at the hotel, so it's great for people who like it quiet.  Supposedly there were three weddings going on while I was staying there.  It was so quiet I had no idea!We stayed here for the Fourth of July had had a wonderful stay. Check in was fast and friendly. We were able to check in a couple hours early. All the staff is friendly. We really got the feeling that all the members of the staff were going out of their way to make the Holiday celebration special. We ordered room service right before the Savannah Fireworks show started and the food arrived fast, hot, and delicious. We have a fantastic view of the fireworks from the balcony of our room.   The room was clean, nice size, and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is a bit outdated and frayed and could use a little remodeling and updated, but other than that everything was perfect.","By Marriott standards, the property is cosmetically dated.  But, it's spectacularly managed and spotlessly clean.  The staff is wonderful and you are treated like a star wherever you go.   There is absolutely nothing that compares to the quality of Marriott's training program.This is a waterfront property, so many of the rooms have balconies.  It's a bit of a hike from the historic area and parking is charged in the rather small lot.The fitness center has older equipment, but it's in pretty good shape and I have zero complaints - elliptical, treadmill, pilates, free weights.  The trend in most hotels though is towards small fitness centers.  So, I expect this would be downsized in the next update.   There's an indoor pool and hot tub.  Wonder of wonders - here's a full service spa with steam as well.Restaurant menu is available at the bar.  I'm on a restricted diet, and I was pleased there were options available.  I've put a request into Marriott that they publish  nutritional information so guests can make better choices.This was a coincidental trip for us as we hadn't planned on going to Savannah, but we're glad we stayed a few nights here.  My partner had the opportunity to do a site visit for a conference he is doing at this property this year.  I can be rather biting in my comments, but when I see people are working very hard with what they have at hand, I think they should be commended.  Savannah is well served by this hotel and we'd certainly stay here again.The staff and service at this hotel was definitely a 5-star however the executive level lounge shockingly charged $10.00 per cocktail. I have never experienced that before. The breakfast was just basic. Coffee not even hot on first day. Toilet in room ran and the beds were lumpy and uncomfortable as well as just doubles which was tight for four of us. Pillows were awful. I stay at Marriotts worldwide and this one while being a great location and view of the river, plus fantastic staff, the overall property was sorely lacking.Perfect location for visiting Savannah, can walk to everything!  Clean nice hotel and room.  Great service at the lobby bar and from the house keeping staff.  They charge for parking and internet.  The ice machine on our floor broke during our stay so we had to go to another floor for ice.  When we first arrived we received calls to see how we liked the room, then how did we like our breakfast, we were not interested in hearing from them that much.I stayed here with friends after driving down to Savannah for the weekend. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. It was RIGHT on the waterfront, and the lobby has huge windows looking out onto the river. Our room was on the non-waterfront side of the hotel, but we barely spent any time in there anyway.Savannah is definitely a walkable city, and the hotel was within five minutes' walk of the riverfront area. We decided to take a cab to dinner because of our shoe choices, and the concierge didn't seem to understand. Even after we asked her to call us a cab, she kept saying, ""But you can walk."" Perhaps I should have put my foot up on the counter so she could have seen for herself that I wouldn't be walking in those shoes.Other than her, the staff was very friendly. We didn't utilize many of the hotel's amenities, but the location and views definitely added to our Savannah experience.The hubby and I chose this Marriott based on the location and the price.  The price was right and the room with the river view was the best!!  It was just what we needed for our anniversary!!  The rooms are very nice and clean, the hotel has adequate parking, and the customer service was wonderful!!Customer service was the best part about this hotel!!  Ppl were there to greet you at the entrance, in the parking garage, and while getting on the elevators!!  They were awesome and if we ever visit Savannah again and go during a special occasion, we will be staying at this Marriott!!This review is primarily for the on site restaurant - Blue. I'll review the hotel at end. The restaurant was hands down the worst service I've had in any restaurant. The food took an exceptionally long time to come out and our waitress did no pay us any mind in taking care of it. I asked to speak with the supervisor and did. They comp'd the meal but still I honestly could not understand the depth of ineptitude from the staff. The hotel: The rooms are a little dated and not at the higher end I've come to expect from a Marriott property. Parking: They've got you trapped based on the location of the property compared to everything else in Savannah. I just hate it when they charge you a high price for a room and then throw $18 parking on top of it.My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, 11/25-11/27. The location is on the far end of the river walk, but still fine if you want to walk all over the downtown area. My husband made the reservations online a couple weeks prior to our trip, and received a discounted rate. I called a few days before the trip to confirm the king size bed and ask that we be put in a riverfront room if possible. The woman on the phone was very rude in her mannerisms and tone when she told me that since we were getting a discount, she couldn't guarantee me anything. I guess I could understand that, but wouldn't you want your discounted people to be just as happy as full paying guests? She made it sound as if we were lesser people.My husband made the reservation online, and we specifically requested a king size bed and extra foam pillows. Those feather ones hurt my neck... When we arrived, I asked to be upgraded to a riverfront view. This is an extra $30 per night charge. Also, this is in addition to the $18 a day for parking. We may have a received a discount on the room, but hotels such as this nickle and dime you on every little thing, so it was still turning out to be more expensive than we planned. Our ""riverfront view"" was on the far side of the hotel and partially blocked by a piece of wall. We did get a king size bed, but apparently pillow requests do not transfer if you change rooms. I found this odd... Not to mention that the bed is terrible on the joints of a side-sleeper like me. I was sore in the hips for the whole trip. Many things in this hotel were lacking compared with other places I have stayed, which could be deemed of cheaper variety. For example, there is no safe in the room closet, which is something I have come to expect of any hotel. I expect to be able to lock up my valuables without having to go to the desk each time I want them out. There is a coffee maker, but no small fridge. (Which was a great disappointment when I wanted to bring back leftovers from The Pink House) There is no free breakfast, and you have to ask for something as simple as a shower cap. While walking around, the scarred and pitted baseboards and door bottoms come into sharp focus, as well as the crooked wall lamps. The temperature on the 4th floor where we were seemed to be stuck on heat, but the room was stuck on freeze. The lobby and atrium is decent, but smells horribly of pool chemicals at all times, as the pool is indoors. The atrium is just one huge open space and lacks any sort of decoration. I would expect better from a hotel that charges as much as they do for a normal-paying customer. The one bright spot was the concierge. She was extremely helpful in booking all of our tours and reservations for dinner. She is not employed by the hotel, however, but a private travel agent. Maybe that's why she was so happy... Overall, I give this place a 3 due to it's location. But you must ask for a riverfront view, or even an atrium view. Otherwise, you will be taking in the scenic parking lot and rooftop air conditioners.This is a unique hotel. They made the inside of the hotel look like an outdoor courtyard with skylights covering the entire ceiling and balconies looking down on the lobby, bar and indoor pool. The indoor pool is cute and even has sun umbrellas to give the effect that you are outside. However, the real outdoor pool wasn't as cool. It was tiny and basically in the parking garage so I stuck with the indoor one. One good thing about outside was the river-view patio right off the lobby. The room was pretty much what you'd expect at a Marriott, nothing stellar. Something I must mention is that we were pretty upset to find out about the $20 a night fee to park. So when we were checking in we asked about street parking and just like that they comped our parking. It was a little weird, but definitely awesome.Ok service and somewhat friendly staff. A bit boring on the decorations. The river views are nice. Compared to most Marriott's this place seems a bit out of the norm. In a good way, but just unusual.Nice room with a view of the river which was fun.  The parking places were cramped for my full size truck.  A nice location which allowed us to walk every where.  The staff was helpful, friendly, and professional.During my recent visit to Savannah I stayed here. The hotel is not impressive. The set up is strange in that the area that allows you to pull up in front of the hotel is one floor below the lobby and the bell hops/valet attendants are lazy. Although we wanted our car to be valet parked and luggage unloaded for us, they did not even offer and told us to turn around and go park in the garage. Perhaps I missed the purpose of a valet area. The front desk staff was friendly enough upon check-in and despite it being a busy time of the day for them I did not have a wait. The first thing I noticed is that the exhibit hall for a conference had been set up in the main area of the hotel, which combined with the high ceiling, made for a very noisy environment. The elevator made a loud clanking noise on the way to my room and I had to wonder if it was going to even make it. I later noticed that all of the elevators made this noise.The room itself was very dated and noisy. While the bed was comfortable, that was about the only truly positive thing I had to say about the room. In the bathroom, I found that two out of four towels were dirty - one with brown crusty stuff all over it and one with black smudges all over (like grease). The bathroom was spacious so I had to wonder why one had more area to use the toilet than to take a shower. The TV was tiny. The room provided reasonable desk space with easily accessible outlets. Wired internet connection was available for $13/day. The working space was okay except for the fact that it was located next to the AC/heat unit and the unit made such loud clanking noises that it was a distraction. The room featured a balcony - that overlooked the aforementioned noisy main area of the hotel lobby. Therefore, we had a front row seat to all of the voices, announcements and music filtering up from 7 floors below. In addition to the noise from below, the walls of the room were very thin and you could hear just about anything and everything from surrounding rooms.I could not even bring myself to try out the spa (which required you to pass through the conference exhibitor set up) or the restaurant.Oh, and that riverfront view? It's fantastic - if you don't mind staring out across a dirty industrial area.For $199 I was disappointed. Add to that the $18/day parking fee plus the $13/day internet fee and it equals: can do without staying here again.Not recommended.We moved on to this hotel after the disgusting dealings with the hotel we tried to check into upon our arrival to Savannah.Conveniently located next to the downtown area on the riverfront.  They were very kind in accommodating our last minute request for a room and b/c our other reservation was also at another marriott property, they canceled our other reservation.  My first impression was of the Valet service though.  I can't get over how polite and patient these guys were.  We had a ton of bags and corralling 4 kids with luggage can be quite the herculean feat.  Thanks for treating us with your southern gentlemanly ways.Rooms were clean and nicely appointed.  We had a junior suite (6 of us) but it didn't have a separate bedroom which can be awkward with 4 kids.  The pool was in the lobby area and there was a bar.  The pool was a little small, considering the size of the hotel and this area seems dimly lit.We also have the concierge level service from Marriott and their breakfast was decent enough for us to get filled up and not have to make another stop until lunch.  Fresh fruit and juice, hard boiled eggs, lox and bagels, and so on. There is a nice view of the river that my husband enjoyed while smoking a cigar and I had the kids.Would stay here again.The staff is extremely polite and helpful and you get a nice river front view with your room.  The opitimy of southern hospitality.  However, the hotel itself needs work. Lobby's  and hallways are flooded by fluorescent  light, tdecor inside and outside of the rooms is third rate and the mattresses feel like peanut butter.  I literally had to roll myself 1/2 way to the floor to get out.  You can definitely hear the bratty, whiny kids through the sheet rock, as well hard slamming doors. The final straw is that the hotel bars close at 9pm and 11 pm respectively.  Way too early.You should probably check out some of the beach front motels and hotels in nearby Tybee Island which have cheaper rates and most likely more comfortable rooms with better access to the beach and restaurants.Dated hotel; suite not fully upgraded. 1992 doors on closets, bathroom. No towel racks anywhere in the suite. Stained stucco paint on bathroom wall. Bathtub fixtures not uodated. Clean, other than the stained walls. Nice lobby. Excellent patio along the river.Great service, friendly staff. I am Marriott Platinum so know my Marriots.But....the river view sucks, big wide river with industrlal units on the other side, hotel is a conference center I think and it shows. Rooms are the bare minimum for a full Marriott. Didn't eat there so can't comment on restaurants or room service.If I'd known there was a Hyatt I would have tried that, or a boutique hotel, but also needed the stay for a Platinum renewal.I would like to start by saying that I never leave bad hotel reviews but their is a first time for everything. I'm currently staying at the Marriott Riverfront and can't wait to check out tomorrow. I'm in town for a conference (PDG Bursars Conference) and this is by far the worse Marriott that I have ever stayed. I arrived this past Saturday and had to deal with a ton of high school girls screaming from several balconies all night long followed by the fire alarm which went off a few times that night. I also had two separate charges on my debit card for $500 and $318 now mind you my job paid for my room and my conference. I'm sitting around just about flat broke waiting to hear why my card was charged the $500 fee and when i can expect it returned to my accout which wasn't for residuals and the front desk person couldn't understand why that amount was ever charged to my card. The bottom line for me is even though Savannah is a very beautiful town my stay at the Marriott has made this trip a total nightmare.Let me just say the whole staff is super friendly and always very professional. Unfortunately the hotel is not up to the standards I expect from a Marriott. The room was clean but extremely dated. Looked like a Best Western instead of a Marriott. There was some water stains and mold from a water leak in the past. If a hotel like the Marriott are going to charge you $22 dollars extra for a resort fee, $22 parking, and pay for inter-net you better have a better quality product, Not real bad just not worth the price.....Served its purpose but not convinced it was worth the money. I asked for a room with two beds and got two doubles. I didn't know hotels still had double beds! We got a less than spectacular view of a lower roof and vacant lot and a $18 parking fee. It seemed more like a no frills room and not what I expected for the price, especially from a Marriott.",,"['ended', 'staying', 'evening', 'since', 'planning', 'evening', 'activities', 'downtown',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Staybridge Suites Savannah Historic District,3.5,$$,65,"Excellent stay! The desk attendant, Victoria, was extremely helpful. We purchased our stay through Hot Wire but upon arriving at the hotel discovered our reservation was for the next night! She was able to get everything straightened out for us and was *almost* able to get us the same great deal on the room. My thoughts on the hotel and our stay:*PROS*-Awesome location!!! Really right in the center of all the action and nightlife of Savannah-Above average breakfast buffet-Clean beds and bathroom facilities-Nice complimentary toiletries-Really great kitchenette area complete with all the plates, utensils, cookware and cups you could want (also a dishwasher bc who wants to do dishes during vacation!)-Quiet rooms (very important to me personally!)-""The Pantry"" is a small selection of toiletries/snacks/beverages that is useful (I'd like it better if they were complimentary like some other, nicer hotels but it is what it is)*CONS*-Very dated decor...like 30 years dated-Same problem with the elevator; it's very very slow-The front desk isn't all Victorias! I called to ask about a $35 refundable fee for incidentals and the girl on the phone with me was RUDE!-There are no curtains, just plantation blinds so the room can be very bright of you are wanting to nap-The parking lot is kind of a walk and there is not an elevator so you have to bring all your luggage down this tiny flight of stairsThe only reason I am even giving the hotel 2 stars is because it is in a wonderful location and walking distance to many spots in Savannah. With that said, anywhere you stay in Savannah is walking distance to most, if not all, the spots that are great to see in the area. It is one of the perks of visiting Savannah.My family and I always travel with our 10lb. miniature poodle so we always need to find a hotel that admits pets. Just because we travel with a pet, however, does not mean we like to lower our hotel expectations. We stayed at this hotel on two different nights during New Year's week as we traveled to and from North Carolina. It is in major need of some TLC. The communal areas, as well as rooms, are musty, dirty and in need of updates. There is a $75 pet fee that is charged per stay and I am not sure what it is used for as the rooms definitely do not experience deep cleaning services for the pet. It is unacceptable since they allow various pets per room and of all types of sizes. If the hotel is not going to put restrictions on their pet admittance they need to step it up in the cleaning department. Even if you are not staying with pets, the rooms still do not appear sterile. In addition to the pet fee, the room prices are not cheap. We paid 250-350 per night, plus the pet fee and parking fee.  I would suggest staying in another pet friendly hotel if you are looking for a quality hotel.Stayed for one night. Really very lovely.Walking distance to many local shops/galleries/restaurants.Wonderfully clean rooms with clean irons &amp; a decent hair dryer.The entire building (including the rooms) has a very historic feel. Quite cozy.Had an issue with the shower head &amp; called down to report - within two minutes an attentive maintenance person arrived and quickly worked to rectify. Much appreciated!Excellent buffet breakfast.Friendly &amp; helpful staff throughout.Will definitely be back. Only drawback is the beds/pillows were not so comfortable. I prefer a softer mattress.We had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel.  The check in staff was courteous and friendly.  Our room was clean and nicely appointed as advertised.There is a large dry in the entry for lounging, meals, etc.  It was clean and well maintained.  The hotel computers were easy to find and were easy to print from.  The courtesy bathrooms were also well maintained. They had a nice self serve wine/beer and munchies in the evening.  The continental breakfast was decent too.We had a first level room that had windows right on the front sidewalk.  There were large wood shutters on the interior to afford privacy.  Some sunlight does leak into the shutters at sunrise.  I would have liked to have had another curtain to go over them.The location is fantastic.  Its in the middle of the river front area with a nice park across the way.  Its a quick walk to anywhere you need to go in the historic district.Parking is tight here.  The hotel entrance has three loading spots.  The parking immediately behind the hotel is frequently full.  There is overflow in a parking ramp behind the motel that is relatively convenient though.  All in all I think they've done a good job considering its historic district Savannah.Room was awful! Needs much updated everything. Elevator is very slow! Staff not friendly at all! Parking is too far away and have to go up many stairs to get to the top of the parking deck where you can only park (could not find an elevator in the parking deck and would not want to go up those stairs in the middle of the night)I will not return to this hotel again!Stayed one night. The parking is uncovered and cost $12. Checked in after 9:00 pm and the desk employee was a little short and maybe a little rude with her attitude. We just had some normal questions like, after parking is that the only door to enter? This was apparently a stupid question. The room was clean and the bathroom too. Bed was lumpy like two people had worn out the two sides and left a bump in the middle. The only weird thing was the window facing the parking lot had security lights and plantation blinds. The room wasn't as dark as I liked it, but it was fine.Overall our stay at the Staybridge Suites fell below expectations.  We had our stay in the beginning of June. This is a moderately priced hotel with a fantastic location.  There were a few major issues and quite a few minor issues, but added together, it really detracted from our experience.TeeJay was great and helped us obtain a parking space, as both the parking garage and their lot was completely full.  In fact, the couple behind us didn't have anywhere to park.  Unfortunately, we didn't realize there was a $12 fee to park - one thing we overlooked on the website and was a bit jarring upon arrival.  The lot isn't well lit and is behind the building which there wasn't any security present and it was out of site from the main streets.  There is a lot of foot traffic, even late night/very early morning hours.  Additionally, the parking lot's lanes are smaller than most.  Be wary if you drive a larger vehicle when attempting to park (I was very concerned about getting dings on our car from our neighboring cars were VERY close - I even had to let my girlfriend out so I could have enough room for one of us to open the door to get out).Check-in went well.  We got to our room and the initial impression was favorable, although we booked a king suite and we got two fulls.  Upon further inspection, several bulbs were out, a lamp didn't work and several things weren't plugged in.  This might be a bit nit-picky but there was junk in the microwave and no dishes in the cabinets, most of the dishes/silverware were in the dishwasher.  With the price, I would have expected more attention to detail.  Especially with some hairs in the tub/sink.  (Yuck!)The biggest detractor is the internet.  If this doesn't matter to you, add another star to my review.  It is a password protected network, but there were numerous issues.  Connection at first seemed stable, but fairly soon, pages wouldn't load and the network dropped.  I assume it was rebooted as the network disappeared for a period of time.  It came back up but we weren't able to get pages to load.  Upon calling the front desk, Margaret apologized but offered no solutions.  I asked for the router to be rebooted but she didn't have access to it and no one would be able to assist until the next day.Breakfast was great and we thought it added value.  This is a subpar hotel with a great location.  With more attention to detail, better parking and security (especially if they're going to charge guests for it) and a revamp of their Internet access, we would return.  But until these issues are attended to, we'll look elsewhere and recommend the same to you.Great location....and that's the only nice thing I can say. Room was crap. Bed was crap. Room overlooked the parking lot. Carpet was filthy. But like I said... Great location.Pros: locationCons: serviceLocation is the key as it is in the Savannah historic downtown. The park is right across the street, convenient for walking a dog. Parking is in the rear of the building as well as on the top floor of the parking garage. The hotel adds a parking fee to the bill. However, starting from Friday night and till Monday morning the parking is free on the street, so I think the front desk needs to mention this.Service was lacking. Two consecutive mornings we were there, they were completely out of coffee at some point, so it took time to make a fresh one, while a crowd was waiting in the breakfast area. At some point they also were out of clean plates -- both ceramic and disposable. The personnel did not rush even to bring more disposable plates. The wi-fi connection was patchy. The carpet in our room had some stains and we asked if we can take a look at other available rooms. The front desk lady told us that the pet friendly rooms are on the first floor only so we stayed in the original room. However, we later noticed people with dogs taking elevators, which means that pet-friendly rooms are on other floors too.The room was OK. We found some broken glass in one of the kitchen cabinets. The bedding / bathroom were clean.Hotel was fine until they charged me $200 for a ripped pillow case. Then accused me of trying to hide it when I certainly did not. They charged me without even telling me about it first. When I called the hotel to talk to a manager she was totally rude and unhelpful. $200 for a ripped pillow case is completely absurd!For a 3 star hotel, it has blown my expectations away. Free internet, free breakfast, free happy hour meals/alcohol, friendly staff. I stay in a hotel once a month and for the most part it follows the 1-5 star rule. I am rarely impressed and for the most part agree. Come stay here and be blown away.Nice hotel in a great location. The quieter end of Bay Street, close to restaurants and parks but away from most of the hustle &amp; bustle &amp; noise. Extensive free breakfast selection (DIY waffle station, eggs, bacon, sausage, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, breads, etc - better than others I've seen). Just know that typical of many historic areas - the rooms are small, the beds are small, the bathroom was small. Free internet is nice, although you have to log in over and over - kind of a pain. Parking is $12/day and extremely limited, but fortunately we stayed parked our entire trip - no need to drive anywhere with such a central location and trolley system. Overall, a very nice experience. Would recommend to others.Wow, we just got back from our stay from Dec 4th through Dec 8th we had an excellant experiance.  Everyone the front desk Tesha and Margaret were amazing. The conceigre recommend and set up a cemetery tour for us. (Yes we love old cemeteries), resturants and show tickets.  Everyone was always friendly, the accomidations are immaculate and the location was perfect.  Just about everything we wanted to see was within walking distance so ne need to rent a car.  I hightly recommend!This place is totally awesome. The people are extremely kind and the place was very clean. We found it to be in a perfect spot to visit the rest of savanna. They also had some leisurely snacks wine beer and cheese for us every night. The only thing I will suggest for anyone reading this is you don't have to pay for parking in the hotel parking lot, you can just park in the street overnight. No need to waste that money.We stayed here for 10 days over the 2015 Saint Patty's day celebration.  Perfect location, wonderful staff!TeeJay at the front desk is one of those rare folks who combine experience and expertise with the right amount of professionalism, all while wielding a considerable amount of influence at the hotel.  He went above and beyond for my family and made our experience an excellent one. (six stars for him)I can honestly and genuinely say I hate this hotel. We stayed here for a friends birthday. She had never been to Savannah and my friend and I have been there well over a dozen times. We typically stay at the Holiday Inn Express and have never had a problem. This hotel had a kitchen in the room so she wanted to stay here.. We knew we weren't going to use it, but it's her birthday. Let's try it out...The staff was RUDE!! It started from the second we checked in (it was just an attitude like she hated her job). Then when asking simple questions about there sketchy parking (I'll get into that later) she literally says, ""Don't it say it on the card."" Okay.... I will say the cleaning staff was nice. The concierge seemed nice too! Front desk, rude every time we interacted with them... Oh! Except when someone tried to steal our credit card info and we got our car broken into.. They were nice then. I'll get into that.....We got a call in our room at about 4am from the ""front desk guy"" saying their computers crashed and they needed our credit card number that we payed the room with. Our friend thought this was sketchy, so she went to the front desk and the lady working said ""no one here has called your room it's just me."" Oh, okay.. So what we figured out is some random called the desk, asked for our room at 4am, she transferred the call and then he played his front desk act. This isn't the front desks fault per say.. But I travel regularly for work and have stayed in Savannah many many times. This is a first!To top it off our Jeep was broken into in the parking lot directly behind the hotel (not the parking structure). We do not leave valuables in it because, it's a Jeep! But after the rudeness, the credit card incident and now the Jeep... Never ever will we stay here or recommend it. Absolutely terrible... I wouldn't stay here even if I only based it on how I felt treated by the staff.. :(I didn't even have to stay at this hotel to understand that I would never go there. I called because I have a dog with me. Margaret at the front desk who apparently is a manager is incredibly rude but doesn't listen to you go elsewhere if you have a pet it's not worth itSuper mean lady at the front desk. We didn't even check in. I called five minutes before and they said they had rooms and then we got there and she said there were no rooms.  BSI was trying to check in and was told to come back in an hour. An hour later I was told to come back in an hour.I checked out today after completing my 4 day trip to Savanna. The hotel is in a great location right as it sits between numerous bars and restaurants located on River and Congress. Had the service not have been horrible at night I would have given it 3 stars. It wasn't one bad employee having a bad day, every night  the service desk was occupied by a miserable woman. I asked for a late night dining suggestion and was told no. Funny how a quick Yelp search showed numerous open restaurants in the area. My worst experience was the lobby after going out for Halloween. The same women was obviously annoyed with people returning to the hotel in the late hours. My friends and I were quietly eating in the lobby when we said hi to a group of friends who walked into the lobby. The employee sighed loudly as she slammed her computer mouse down. Besides this employees poor service the hotel had several other flaws. There was mold in the shower, hair in the bathroom floor and stains on the carpet. I really enjoyed my trip to Savanna but when I return I will not consider staying at this hotel.","I'm giving this place 2 stars just for the location right in the historic district, across from River street, and the free breakfast (even though it was below average.. I just like the idea of free food). For starters, the staff wasn't very friendly or helpful. The beds were uncomfortable, the bathroom was very small, + the internet connection was spotty during the day, and at night it was near impossible to get online. The only thing I did enjoy was the little kitchen with a fridge to store my water bottles.It took me a very long time to get comfortable in the bed, but when I finally started to enjoy my sleep.. THE SMOKE ALARM WENT OFF!! AT 4 O'CLOCK IN THE F***ING MORNING! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT! I grabbed as much of my stuff as I could and zombie-walked outside of the hotel with all of the other sleepy, annoyed guests. Finally, firemen showed up and turns out some inconsiderate a-hole was just smoking in his room at 4 am when it clearly states non-smoking on every door. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I do not recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Historic District. The Brice (although much more expensive) looked way nicer.This Staybridge  Suites location could not be better, sitting on Bay Street and offering up good views of the river side of town. I typically stay at the HIE right down the street, and it always been a great value, and I expected this Staybridge Suites location, being a sister property, to at least equal HIE.Stepping inside around 10pm, I was greeted with a smile and all of the info I needed for my stay, so congrats on being customer service oriented. Also, the lobby area is unique and inviting, as it's a restored older building.The room was acceptable, but it had a few issues that needed attention. For $200 per night, I don't want to see unfinished Sheetrock patches, trash behind furniture (nightstand), and unplugged lamps and alarm clocks when I walk in to unwind. The linens and towels were fine, but some detailed cleaning work needed to be done in the suite; dirt in the corners of the tile, dirty faucet handles, and streaked counters.This is not a bad hotel, as a matter of fact it's a good hotel with a great location, but they need to step up their game with the rooms.Oh yes, the breakfast was perfect by the way; I had loaded oatmeal both mornings!Very nice staff. Excellent location. Nice fitness room. But mediocre rooms. Overall not bad, but probably better places.Friendly staff they all are great people will do anything for you. Breakfast very morning and Tuesday's Wednesday and Thursday they have social night food and beer and wine for the guests if u go to Savannah you need to stay here. Cannot wait to go backYou can't beat the location of this hotel. It is nestled in the heart of the old city, a block from River street and walking distance to shops, parks, restaurants and bars. I will definitely consider staying here next time I return to Savannah.We spent 3 nights here and had a great stay. Our room wasn't large, but was clean, quiet, and had the most comfortable bed. I loved the kitchen it included. I expected a kitchenette, but it was much more complete than that. It had a full refrigerator, microwave, a dishwasher and came with plates and utensils. One of my only complaints was that we had an interior room that looked into a tiny courtyard rather than out into the city. I would request one of the exterior rooms if you would like more natural light. (If you prefer to not be able to tell the time of day while in your room an interior room should suit you just fine).The complimentary breakfast every morning is very complete: eggs, cereal, sausage, coffee, tea, waffle maker, fruit, cake.... really no complaints. Parking was $12 a day at a lot half a block away from the hotel.I love this place. The accomodations are very well priced. The rooms are clean. The staff friendly and best of all the location is a street from the River in the heart of the historic district. They also have private parking for $12 a day.The rooms all have a kitchinette. Some rooms do face the interior and have windows with plantation shutters. It is a very nice look but if you do not wish to fave the hall the staff with change your room if there is availability.They serve a continental breakfast every morning and it very decent. In the afternoons they server wine/beer and salads with other snacks. Savannah is always hopping so a midday snack is great for those who wish to dine later in the evening.They do not have a pool or hot tub but you will be so busy out walking the city that this is not a big loss. :)Great experience! The hotel was spotless, our room was comfortable and clean, and the staff could not have been friendlier. Great location too, in a city that is already very walkable. The hot breakfast every morning was delicious as well!We were directed to stay here as part of a room block for a wedding we were attending. Great room rate, with comfortable beds &amp; pillows.  Nice clean bathroom, cool a/c! I am currently 8 months pregnant and found this bed to be surprisingly comfortable given my state!! Kudos! Our room #219, had a great view of Bay St. My husband is a very sensitive sleeper and only woke once due to the street traffic... Perhaps a higher floor would have helped.Our suite had a fridge, microwave, coffee pot &amp; sink. The layout did not feel cramped at all. Mornings provided a complimentary breakfast bar complete with eggs, bacon, pastries &amp; cereal. Dining was in the cutely decorated lobby area. Pet friendly!I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews and location. Horribly disappointed! TeeJay was friendly and helpful but our room wasn't ready until 5:00 when check in was at 3:00. I could have overlooked that except the night staff were incredibly rude! Maragret/Mack treated guests like they were a bother, never greeted anyone when they walked by and acted like we were a huge burden. We visit Savannah about 2 times a year and have never ever had poor hotel service. This hotel has tons of competition and is doing a good job of losing guests. The beds are old, springs squeak every time you move. Walls are super thin and you can hear every conversation in the halls and doors all slam. This place is also dog friendly, which is fine, except when two dogs bark non-stop at 1am and 3am, echoing throughout the entire building. The rooms are also humid and when the AC kicks on it sounds like you are standing next to a Learjet. The room was clean except some left over soap in the shower. I'm giving two stars based on location alone, that I'm glad it wasn't filthy and that TeeJay allowed us to park in the lot before out reservation began. We will spend our money at the Kimpton (pet friendly) from now on, where guests are appreciated and all of the staff go out of their way to say ""hi"" and ask if you need anything. Definitely do not recommend StayBridge.Great location for savannah river street. Clean rooms and very comfortable bed !! Stay Here lolWe have had some great experiences with Staybridge Suites, so chose this hotel when planning a 2 night stay. It is a fairly nice place but doesn't measure up to other Staybridge Suites where we have stayed. The breakfast is excellent and rooms are well appointed, clean and comfortable. Most staff make a decent effort to help. But there are certainly issues at this hotel.First, you need to park in the back lot or adjacent parking garage. The garage is creepy at night and although the hotel clerk assured us there was security, we never saw any. There is no way to secure laptops except to tak them with you. There are no in-room safes, as there are at many other Staybridges, and the safes at the front desk do not accommodate laptops. This was disconcerting since the hotel security doesn't seem to be stellar- the back entrance door does not shut so anyone could come in from the alley and go up the back stairway to rooms. But DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU NEED COMPUTER AND WIRELESS ACCESSProblems occurred although there is supposed to be high speed wireless in the rooms, we had terrible trouble. Our cellphones and computers would access the wireless, but sporadically and then drop the wireless after a few minutes. The front desk said that he was having the wireless router rebooted but that didn't help. There fore, we could not work in our room without using the DSL, which was DREADFULLY slow and only permitted one of the two of us to use the internet at a time.Because we had some important business to conduct via the internet, after breakfast, we went to use the 'business center' which is actually two screens and printers on a counter. Problems abounded-one printer was out of black ink and almost out of colored ink- both screens were set to this one printer and the other printer could not be used as default without effort for every document needing printing and then the printing was not formatted properly on some documents-both printers were almost out of paper and there was no paper available in the area-the software seems to be corrupted or some common features haven't even been downloaded properly - I couldn't open ZIP files, PDF files-One  Desk staff person tried to help but although we were both computer savvy, weird problems kept happening. - the staff person in charge of the computer center came by and tried to help but knew little about computers. When he called the support center, he handed me the cellphone to talk with off-site support! I had already spent an hour trying to get work done. And now I was supposed to stay online while support accessed the computer and walked me through he problems! NOT.I do not think an already inconvenienced hotel guest should be the one sitting on the phone with off site support. This hotel needs to have someone onsite who can manage to keep all computer systems working properly. This is not a guest's responsibility.The noise made by cleaning staff in the hallways in the afternoon is unacceptable. This isn't a bad hotel, but for a Staybridge it was not up to expectationsTime to update review, today is 3-17-2014.  If I stay here again at a later date, will update yet again... tc- - - - - - See below - - - - - -Okay , maybe I could squeak out 1 and 1/2 more stars but the front desk has completely poisoned my attitude.  Only been here for 5 hours and this hotel that wants to be like the other big boy hotels in downtown Savannah can't seem to staff 2 people at the front desk, no matter what time it is.  Judging from what I see much of the staff that should know better seem to be hiding on permanent break somewhere in the bowels of this re-done building in the historic district of old Savannah.  There is NO excuse for not taking care of customers at the front counter in a timely fashion, (unless they all walk in at the same time).  I usually find it hard not to afford 4 stars for a Staybridge anywhere.  This is all about poor management, not the rank and file.  Sorry if your short and your a manager, roll up your sleeves and jump on those customers.  Simple. - - - - - -Other than this major annoyance, yes because it's a rebuild historic building, so the rooms are slightly smaller than most Staybridge hotels, the AC works great, we have all the kitchenette trappings we will ever need, the beds are fine and the internet does actually works though slowly etc.  So if it were not for my rant on a major flaw where the customer meets the business, I probably would have given the full 4 stars.  - - - - - -I have 3 more nights here, great location,  I'll amend this review in a few days.- - - - - -It now seemed that two people can be spotted at the front counter for about 2 days in a row, though off and on.  That was progress.  The chief building support engineer (or Jack of getting all things done, no matter what his job description) seemed to have gone into customer service overdrive by day 3 of our stay.  He was doing everything from meet and greets during all social events along with his usual laundry list of hotel issues.  Kudos to this can-do attitude.   Other issues:  On day 3 in the early afternoon, boom(!), the fire alarms go off in the building, yes they are very loud as they should be, however upon inquiry by several guests other than myself we  simply hear, ' false alarm ' .  Okay, could be dust or heat near a sensor somewhere or some other sequence of events, don't know.  However if nobody knows what the cause of the alarm is then I tend to fall back to that old time honored Help Desk mantra, ""Loose Nuts on the Keyboard"" .  Or the problem could be between the computer and the keyboard etc.  Still we have no way of knowing. Speaking of keyboards.   As we occasionally passed by the front counter where customers meet the business and we frequently noticed that it could take only one customer to cause some kind of kluge at that work station front counter.  It's always the computer system is down or not working correctly e.g. software issues, slow computers, other front counter issues, issues like I have already mentioned, as in get two people monitoring the front counter even from a back room at all times even if by closed circuit surveillance to partner and assist work flow.    So if the computer system is slow, fix it, or as I might suspect, that there could be a dearth pile of training issues that could be addressed with much improved results in this area.  So the front counter and also for customers a faster internet speed are the only two real issues that affected our stay.  True Savannah was approaching the big St. Pat's day celebration the following weekend and that does have an effect on hotel issues, but anyway, speed up the i-net and front counter, both need a boost.  Why another star,? for at least a 3 star rating.  Well I got to experience the gratis customer laundry service, gotta love that and it's the right price! Also gratis social hour beer and genre munchies on Tue, Wed and Thu's.  Also the staff was pleasurably courteous to us and other customers consistently.  Can't fault them here.Room was nice and clean, loved having a fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, and kitchen utensils! It was like I brought my apartment with me! Staff was friendly, prompt and courteous; I appreciate their zeal with which they greeted us (I'm definitely a morning person; perhaps non-morning persons would not enjoy this as much, ha!). Even the food prep staff were enjoyable. Ms. Euris looked at me one night this week and said, ""you /are/ coming to have quesadillas tonight, aren't you?"" I almost felt like I was at home, or at a boarding house, with a momma looking over my shoulder, making sure I was getting my three square meals. Breakfasts and dinner receptions were solid and pretty good for complementary meals. Breakfast spreads included grits, scrambled and hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cereals, baked goods, waffle makers, fresh fruit, oatmeal and sausage or bacon. Dinner (Tues-Thurs) varied from night to night, but I was refreshingly surprised that they had Red Hare (beer local to ATL) on tap in addition to Bud Light. Cool points to Staybridge Suites. Add all this on top of the EXTREMELY convenient location? Yes, yes, yes, yes. I will definitely be returning.Great hotel in a perfect location.  The staff were amazing and made us feel so welcome.  The breakfast was wonderful and the rooms were very clean and had all the amenities we needed.  I have to give a special shout out to William the manager and Margaret who worked at the front desk.  They went above and beyond with their hospitality!I have to preface this review by saying that I used my Priority Club Points for this stay so I can't really comment on prices as I really didn't look. I'm a big fan of Staybridge. I travel fairly extensively and and stay in them whenever the opportunity presents itself, especially when traveling with my wife. We appreciate the space their suites generally provide, especially when we well be somewhere for more than a couple of days. The lack of this space is my only real problem with this property. This property should never have been branded a Staybridge. That branding brings with it a expectation on the part of customers who have stayed at other Staybridge properties that these rooms simply do not meet. In fact, I considered our first room tiny and cramped. It lacked a workspace other than the kitchenette counter. No normal chairs only stools. and barely enough floorspace to maneuver around in. Our second room (there was a leak in the first on day 2) was slightly better. It lacked a counter but had a desk and significantly more floorspace. These issue are due to the restrictions placed on the build by being in the Historic District, so it is not entirely their fault. But they would have been much better served foregoing the ""kitchens,"" freeing up that space and branding the place a Crowne Plaza. OK, with that said, the place has a fabulous location. Easily within walking distance of much of the Historic District. The beds were quite comfortable and rooms clean and fresh. We had none of the housekeeping or bed type issues encountered by some others who have reviewed it here. But perhaps the most appealing aspect of this property is the staff. I have stayed in well over a thousand hotels all over the world over the years, from 5 Star to motels and the staff at this hotel was, by far, the most pleasant, polite, and accommodating that I have ever encountered. And this goes for the maintenance staff, buffet minders, front desk personnel and managers who were constantly wandering around asking if there was anything they could do to make our stay better. Now that I know what to expect, I would most likely return when in the area again.Yeah, I know. There are a ton of fancy hotels and B&amp;Bs all over Savannah, but for the location and overall value, I was very happy with Staybridge Suites (part of Holiday Inn properties). Pretty much everything is within walking distance of the hotel, including plenty of dining and shopping along Bay and River Streets, as well as the numerous sites in the Historic District. The hotel is bigger than it seems and the room with kitchenette was neat and clean. They also host an evening reception in the large lobby, if you're so inclined. Parking, either directly behind the hotel or in the neighboring parking garage, is only $12/day, a great deal considering nearby metered street parking is very limited from 30 min to two hours. A great find at a great price!Ideally, I would like to give this hotel 4.5 stars!This place is really great!  We came here for Labor Day weekend.  This was my first stay in a Staybridge Suite and I'm definitely coming back to this one. The location can't get any better than this (for the price): right on River Street, maybe only a few blocks away from the center of things.  Everything is within walking distance.  I came to Savannah last year and stayed in a cheaper hotel outside of the historic district, but ended up spending the difference in hotel price on parking fees in the various parking decks.  This was perfect!  The parking right behind the hotel was very convenient and I found the $9 a day very reasonable.We had a room on the first floor with view of the street, which I thought was very neat.The room was very clean, the beds are comfortable, and the shower pressure was excellent (one of my biggest pet peeves in hotels!).The free breakfast was great, considering the long lines I witnessed outside of some of the popular brunch spots.The only minor annoyance to me was the staff setting up the breakfast.  We had to be somewhere very early in the morning and were hoping to get breakfast just 5 minutes before the official opening time at 7:30am (on weekends).  However, the ladies setting up the breakfast were guarding that buffet like their jobs depended on it and even though food was already sitting out, they told us we couldn't get any of it yet.  I also got yelled at when I grabbed a bagel with my hands, because I couldn't find the tongs.  Give me a break!!  I also was disappointed that they ran out of waffle batter on Monday morning.... that was the best part!!!So, maybe next time I'll make my own breakfast, if I have to be somewhere in a hurry... I'll definitely be back again!!!The hotel has a pretty decent sundowner reception (Tues-Thurs) from 5:30-7:30 pm.  Totally awesome deal for budget travelers!!  It changes up per week though.  I had a hot dog, burger and side salad for dinner tonight. Check the Yelp photos for a calendar of food being served.Right off Bay St. Walk across the street and you are at River street and the water front. Old TV didn't have HDMI inputs, at these price, time for upgrades!  They were upgrading some rooms, carts for tools and stuff in the way outside the room all day.  The roof ladder was down for 2 days blocking part of the emergency exit stairwell.  The room was clean, a fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, and kitchen utensils! They have a nice complimentary breakfast in the morning, and coffee all day.  Couple of Manager specials 2 evening we were there, food and drinks during Happy Hour. Small parking lot out back, over flow is on top floor of the parking garage a little farther down the block.  Staff was friendly and helpfully.Situated right off River Street, it is hard to beat this location in the historic district. It was our first time in Savannah and the perfect place to stay to be near it all. The room was nice. It had plenty of space for us and included a kitchenette, which I didn't think we'd need but actually came in very handy with leftovers from our delicious Savannah meals. Our view onto the street and park was perfect, complimented by the frequent taps of horse carriages strolling by. The lobby was really nice and huge, with plenty of tables to sit and work or relax with a cup of coffee. The complimentary breakfast was surprisingly good compared to other free hotel breakfasts I've had. The staff wasn't overly enthusiastic, but friendly enough. One of the employees helped select our restaurant the first night and made an excellent choice for us. I'd happily stay here again. It would be a great place for extended stays as there's laundry service, a gym, a business center, and of course the kitchenettes. I heard they have a cocktail hour on some weekdays, but unfortunately we weren't there for that.","Staybridge did an adequate job of re-purposing this historic building. Though smaller than the typical hotel room of the day, our 2 bed suite was clean and comfortable. The beds were quite cozy and the hotel was quiet. The complimentary breakfast was fully stocked and the concierge was very friendly. Access to River St. is just across the street via a good set of stairs. Also, this location is near east end of River st. so you don't have to go far in BOTH directions. Only staying one night we didn't get to take advantage of Straybridges sundowner reception, but I have on extended stays at their other properties and have been impressed. On one two week stay I took advantage of it most nights as an alternative to eating out in a restaurant.Parking sucks - to be expected in a downtown location.Location! Location! Location! Clean, comfortable beds, great service, nice people, free parking, free wifi, free breakfast. In front of river walk, walk distance to many bars, restaurants, shops, etc. What else do you want?My meeting here at this hotel is been handled very unprofessional, would not recommend this facility for any kind of business meeting. My meeting was to start at 8 AM setup is still not complete and it's 930Made a reservation online.  Showed up at the hotel and by 3., they didn't have a place ready for me and my wife.First of all I have to compliment the staff! They were so friendly and nice, and informative about recommending places in the area. I was greeted every time I walked into the lobby, and they remembered me each time-referencing prior conversations. The rooms were nice and clean.They had a nice complimentary breakfast in the morning, and coffee all day.The location is amazing and parking is reasonable compared to other hotels.Nice room and great service.  TIP:  Ask for an outside room, otherwise your window will look into the interior of the building which is both creepy and claustrophobic! Morgan at the front desk was a doll!I found Staybridge Suites, Savannah Historic District, to be mixed. First, the name is inaccurate as what I had was in no way a suite but was one smallish room with a kitchen in the corner, an arrangement I found trashy and reminiscent of a cheap rooming house.  Second, some things are excellent---location is good and breakfast was generous, so this review should not be taken as 100% criticism. STILL, we come to, Third: I was inconvenienced by confusion. One evening my room was accidentally registered to someone else, a man who arrived with a key and opened my door before the desk could realize the mistake and warn me---I had just gotten out of the shower (I am an old lady and was traveling alone). A few hours later I was awakened by a maid entering my room with her key---later she apologized and said ""I just got mixed up---I wanted another room"".  When I then called downstairs about all the confusion, the girl on the desk refused to give me her name. Later, when I finally got back to sleep, she phoned and woke me (again) to tell me I would get a free night as apology for the confusion.  I never heard any more about that and my bill was not reduced. The next day I got a stern and dismissive call from a manager telling me I was not to worry for my security as Staybridge Suites is secure (after my room had already been breached twice).  When I checked out several days later, I asked the concierge to call a taxi for me for the next morning, but next morning no taxi showed up and he turned out to have called a startup company that Yellow Cab later told me ""has only two cars"". So my general impression of this hotel is that it hasn't got its act together, and I doubt I would stay there again.Boutique-style rooms with nice little kitchenettes. We stayed on the Bay Street side with a nice picture window view of the downtown activity and pretty little square. Great beds and very clean. Had a problem with our TV and they quickly fixed it. I'd recommend for a downtown Savannah stay. Close to SCAD. Reasonable. Excited about the complimentary hot breakfast. And, our concierge is knowledgeable and helpful.Clean, free breakfast buffet was nice with occasional free dinner like nachos.Nice kitchen with stove top, microwave, frig with supplied popcorn and dish washer.Small gripes: Free wireless connection keeps on cutting out requires numerous ""forget SIDD and reconnect"".   The TV is a bit blurry (not HD quality) and the TV remote has limited range.The location can't be beat.  The hotel is close to absolutely everything.  We were disappointed to find out that the king suite we reserved was unavailable and we were stuck in a double instead for our trip.  The room itself was nice and clean.  Unfortunately, we were right on Bay Street, so the road and sidewalk noise could be a little annoying at night or in early morning before we were really awake.  The hotel is dog-friendly, which was great for us.  Outside of a crying dog waking us up one morning, you wouldn't have known there were other dogs in the building.  Other than the king/double mixup, our only real complaint were the other guests.  Some people were so horribly rude.  Put breakfast or a sundowner reception in front of some people and they just lose control, I suppose.  The staff was super friendly and the breakfasts were good.  Would definitely consider staying again.This was a very nice hotel and you couldn't ask for a better location. Since we were going to be visiting for a while, we needed a suite-style hotel that provided kitchens. Those types of hotels, at least the affordable ones, are usually way out in the middle of nowhere, but not Staybridge. The rooms were very nice with very adequate kitchens. They have a happy hour in the lobby, which is a beautiful room with huge windows facing Bay St. The breakfast was pretty lame unless you like scrambled eggs and bacon and danishes and all sorts of heart attack inducing foods. The staff was really helpful and parking is included (for a fee) just behind the hotel, which is amazing when you're staying downtown. For the price, it was a really nice place to stay.This is a no frill hotel, however it seems to have more frills then most others. I was able to get wi-fi throughout my stay, there wasn't any trouble with it. It just required me to log in again each time I closed the computer. They also have a business center that you can utilize if you don't have your laptop with you.They also have free breakfast for the guest, and they didn't charge me extra on the 5th person. I particularly liked their guest area with the fireplace. It was very comforting, warm and definitely one of the better ones I have seen in a while.The staff was friendly - particularly the night shift, with the occasional one or two (kitchen) that couldn't bring it to themselves to say excuse me when they were in the way. Fortunately, you don't need to deal with them on a one on one basis. I definitely will consider staying here again on future visits to Savannah.Check in was fast. The front desk staff offered to move her car so a guest could park closer as it was raining. All of the cleaning staff were so cheerful. Good free breakfast. Nice room our view not so good but if you were on the front side of building it would be sweet!  Great hotel for the money in a great location!This was a fantastic choice. We got a great government/military rate and the location was perfect.  It was near everything and safe.  You do have to pay for parking which is to be expected in the downtown area.  The breakfast is great and the evening food and drinks was great also.  I have not met a ore friendly staff in a long time.  Maids greeted us warmly in the hallways, while looking at brochures a couple stopped to give us advice and answer questions, the front desk was courteous and quick, the management was visible and walked around checking on everyone, and the concierge desk was on top of things.  Our room was standard with a little kitchen and desk.  Clean and everything worked well. We did get a handicap accessible room for some reason and the way the shower was set up wasn't great since it got the whole bathroom floor wet, but it wasn't a big deal.  I would definitely recommend this place to others.Very nice hotel and great location. This place is walking distance to all of the major city attractions, is across the street from the waterfront and is also nice and quiet. I highly recommend. Also has more character than the other chain hotel options nearby.I stayed here while in town on a business trip and had a great experience.The staff was helpful and pleasant with everything and the room was perfect. I also enjoyed the location as it was close to the spot where I could catch the ferry to the convention center.Overall a great experience.Loved our corner room two walls of windows facing the street.The rooms were clean and you can`t beat the location.$9 for parking overnight which is the least I have ever paid in a city.I can't speak for other rooms however.This place is all about the location.  Otherwise it is not great.  Very small but telling point, the cleaning staff couldn't be bothered to set the clock in the room.  No tissue.  Interior room with a view of other rooms.  Not again.Nice room, switched me to a window room---there are rooms in the interior that only open to the hallway---yuck!   Nice front room, great fireplace.  Wonderful food setup---breakfast and snacks at night.  Only issue was the free wi-fi.  It would be okay and then cut out.  A real issue.  I see from other posters that this has been an issue before.  I am going to give three stars because of this.This hotel is awesome! You should definitely consider staying here!My parents and I stayed there last fall when I was moving to Savannah to go to SCAD. We went a few days before move in day to get acquainted with the city. We booked the room through the SCAD Travel Department (they can get discounted hotel rates for SCAD students, FYI). It is in a great location, right across the street from River Street, a very fun, semi-touristy place full of eating and shopping. And Downtown Savannah is very small and you can walk anywhere you need to go. There were 4 of us in the room and it was plenty comfortable for us. There were 2 queen (I think) beds and a kitchenette with a full size fridge, microwave, and stove. The staff is as nice as could be and everything is very clean. There is a happy hour for guests with drinks and snacks and breakfast in the morning. All in all, it was just perfect for us and I highly recommend it and would stay here again.","Loved this hotel!!! The staff was unbelievable.  Doesn't get any nicer or friendlier than the people that work there.  We recently stayed there and it was our first time in Savannah.  The location is excellent.  Right across the street is River Street.  But you are within walking distance to everything.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  You've got your own little kitchen, which is good when you've got kids.  The breakfast is pretty good too.  And if your traveling with pets, this is the hotel for you.  They are pet friendly.  I will definitely stay here, if I'm in Savannah again.Checked in to a non smoking room that smelled awful like smoke. Had to leave because they were full.Parking somewhat limited, but cheap. Inner hallway rooms are a bit dark, but spacious. We traveled with two dogs, so I think they reserve some of the lesser locations for pets. The free breakfast was ample and fresh, and the lobby is really comfortable.  And the location cannot be beat. We'd stay there again!Good location but no water view. The only problem was the wireless Internet barely workedWhat a great location for this hotel-right across from River Street.  The staff was always helpful-kindly offering directions, recommendations, and help when they could.  The room was great and we had a nice street view.  The valet parking is really not worth it-$12 per day and they park your car in a garage one block behind the hotel.  It was much more reasonable to park out front on the street and for 50 minute increments (25 cents for 50 minutes).  On days when we left the car parked all day, it cost no more than $3.  Animal friendly-a lot of people had their dogs with them.",,"['excellent', 'desk', 'attendant', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'purchased', 'hot', 'wire', 'upon', 'arriving', 'hotel', 'discovered',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/river-street-inn-savannah,River Street Inn,4.0,$$,73,"What's not to love about this hotel!! Upon arrival on Friday night, we were greeted by a gentleman who assisted us with our luggage and waited at the front desk and showed us to our room. The staff was very friendly. The hotel is perfectly located in the city, very close to pretty much everything we had planned on doing. Parking for the hotel is a city garage located across the street behind the holiday inn, not a far walk at all. I was very pleased with the hotel and staff I will be staying here again. Oh I forgot to mention the free wine at night between 5-6:30. If you've never been here I highly recommend!Entrance &amp; lobby at street level but is actually the 4th floor.  There is the 5th floor above and 3 floors going down facing the river and ending at the cobblestone street which a popular walk with restaurants along the way.  The original 2 floors we were built in 1812 from ship ballast stones and used for a cotton warehouse.  In 1987, the conversion was made to the hotel.  Room - High ceilings, 4 poster bed, comfortable mattress, carpet old &amp; dingy.  Service was friendly and good.  Every day at 5 pm, there is a wine party on the 2nd floor serving all the white &amp; red wine and sparkling wine you want.  This was a popular spot.  Breakfast is not provided, however, many options w/in walking distance.Love this quaint historic hotel!It is situated on Bay street on the River side and it is just so cute and quaint.  When we checked in they even upgraded my finances parents room! The desk lady was so nice and friendly.  Steven (the bellhop) went above and beyond! He not only helped us secure parking spots, but helped give us tips to avoid parking tickets and helped us with our bags to our room.  Our room was nice and roomy, clean and COLD :) The bed was a little firm but nothing too terrible. The happy hour  from 5-6:30 was a steal with free drinks and small snacks.The only downside was my Fiances parents room was so hot. His mom called a few times about the air and it ended up cooling down some at night but was still warm. It could have been that its an older hotel or it froze, I'm not sure.  Either way I would totally come back here the next time we are in town,Historic Savannah charm with ultimate southern hospitality! My favorite stay was the Waldof Astoria in NY until I stayed here!!! Rooms are more luxurious &amp; romantic...at half the cost!!The hotel lost our paid reservation....management (Janice) &amp; staff cleaned us a suite, comped our parking, gave us a bottle of champagne, &amp; allowed us a 4 pm check out....now THAT is customer service.100 Stars!!!! I will ABSOLUTELY be back!!!!!Charged TWICE FOR MY ROOM, I WILL NEVER COME BACK!!!!!! DO NOT PAY WITH YOUR DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD HERE!!!!!! PAY CASH! We booked online paying for our 1 ROOM upfront though expedia $500. When we arrived THEY asked for our card and charged us another $520+! We called the front desk and THEY said ""The charge will drop off"". THEN, before we left they charged us another $50 for our upgrade... we called after we checked out and asked why am I paying $1000+ for 1 room for 2 nights?? She said ""You paid for your room upfront online, I don't know why he charged you again. You will have to call later when the accountant is here"".  Well, apparently these people don't know how to do there job when handling credit/debit cards. I'm so angry. I loved this place too, but I will NEVER come back for that reason.A group of coworkers and I stayed at River Street while visiting Savannah.  Quickly after our arrival - I learned that this one not the usual run of the mill hotel.  It had a very southern (almost New Orleans) feel to it with the balconies, decor, and accommodations.  It is right along the Savannah River, but the side I was on faces E Bay Street (which seemed to be a popular 'touristy' street).  The room appeared to be in working order and was clean.  The bed was a little odd, but I slept fine.WiFi was a little sketchy and unreliable.  Otherwise - no major complaints with the room or amenities.The staff was very friendly.  The location is perfect if visiting Savannah for a weekend or short stint.  Very close to various shops, restaurants, and other sites.  It was a beautiful location, and I would definitely consider booking River Street if ever visiting Savannah for future personal/business trips.Convenient location for this upscale historical hotel near all the major attractions Savannah has to offer! Our room had a nice view on the river. The place was safe, kid-friendly and clean. The valet parking was compulsory.Historic hotel on River St in historic district of Savannah. Great location. We parked the car and left it in the garage during our stay.  We walked every where. The room was very pretty over looking the river.  The hotel has a beautiful 5 story atrium. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Beautiful affordable Inn right on River St! Get a room with a balcony if you can. Wood floors and fireplace in the room. Restaurant attached to building so it can be a little noisy. My room was absolutely beautiful and it was so convenient to stroll out at night and go right upstairs to the room. I wish they were pet friendly. Great customer service and great stay overall.Unfortunately our stay at the River Street Inn was not a good one. My wife and I retired early and set air conditioning to less cooler setting after a few hours a strong musty odor woke me up. I ended up setting the thermostat back to 68 degrees to eliminate the odor. I didn't feel like transferring to another room in the middle of the night. The next morning I noticed the towel rack was pulling loose from the wall, the floor by the commode was dirty and I started looking and noticed the flexible pipe behind the commode had what appeared to have black mold on it, the ceiling vent was filthy. Looking down on the floor in the bath I also happen to see a dead juvenile roach. The staff was very friendly and A complimentary wine and cheese at 5 PM was very nice. But the bad far outweighed the good. Would not recommend to anyone.Historic...beautiful...and wonderful location for walking distance to to many squares, restaurants, city market, bars, and everything else this great city has to offer.Great price...so I thought, but you get what you give. I looked all over the website for where to go and procedures, but nothing prepared me for this stay. I had the hardest time finding the place to checkin. Don't trust your GPS or you'll knock your car out of alignment on the cobblestone road. After two phone calls, I finally found the front door. I had to double park to checkin. Took my bags up to the room and came back down to drive to the parking lot, which required a left turn on Bay Street at 5:15PM. Ugh. Parking garage was full. Not kidding. Finally got in. Walked back to RSI to find my room key doesn't work. Still not kidding. Everything was clean. Bed super uncomfortable. Pillows not supportive. Bed spread was very old but clean. Restaurant was ok. Checkout the next morning: coffee yuck. No more hot water for tea. Had to be at work soon, but there wasn't anyone at the desk. Waited. Finally went around the side to see a man sitting at a computer. He muddles up with his dirty shirt and I checkout. Only to find I have to go get my car and COME BACK TO RETURN THE PARKING PASS. BOO. Just say that up front, please. I'll never stay here again.We had a great stay here!  Beautiful rooms and great service by the staff.  I have been to Savannah several times, and this was my first stay here. I will most definitely be back. We had a great view of river street and all of the craziness. The wine social was a great touch in the late afternoon.  Thank you to everybody for making us feel at home!Wow, was my first impression when I walked into this hotel. Absolutely stunning. The staff has been super friendly and helpful. Not to mention it's like stepping into a time warp.  Reminds me of those Christmas movies from the 60s to the 90s. The wooden staircases and bricked wall room are some of my favorite details from this place. The Riverwalk is charming and has so much to see. I will be back for sure.Hotel was cute, historic. Great location, although note you have to park across the street in the parking garage which is an additional $15 per night. View was great, we had a room with a balcony, so that was a plus. With that being said, however, this historic hotel should let go of their ""historic"" mattresses, because they are terribly hard and uncomfortable! One of the worst nights' sleeps I've ever had in a hotel. There were a lot of things that needed updating. The alarm clock was for the old iPod, and thermostat was outdated. In my opinion, the room needed some updates and also needed some TLC. I liked the place, it was different, but after staying in other historic hotels and bed and breakfasts, to sum it up, save your money, and go somewhere that spends a little extra on the details.Here are the pros:*GREAT location, one of the best in the city.*Respectable service, generally helpful staff but not always a professional staff. I heard staff members cursing &amp; in general would say the staff does not seem happy to work at RSI.*Wonderful, historic building, with charm - even if in need of upkeepHere are the cons:*Mattresses in all the rooms are on their last leg. This is all mattresses in every room. They are all the same. According to management, they are being replaced in 2015*Overall condition of the rooms, whether it be paint, light bulbs, bathroom tile, the condition of the carpets...basically anything that needs general upkeep, is in need of serious TLC if not a complete overhaul. *This is not the fault of the property but caveat emptor: the street noise level is significant &amp; the smells from the restaurant below waft into your room if you are located toward the river side. Neither is pleasant.Generally I would say this is mediocre value for you money. When they complete their renovations, I would venture a guess that the property will be far more alluring. But to be fair to the property, and in the big picture, this property has lots of company in Savannah. Numerous properties are in need of renovations. To avoid this, stay at a newer property, although none of them have the historic charm of RSI. However, I would NOT recommend this property to anyone right now. If you are staying in Savannah for 3 days or more, the best move is vrbo to rent a condo or home. When I read other reviews here, I sometimes wonder how much experience people have with travel &amp; hotels. I believe most experienced, or significantly experienced people, would agree with my assessments. FYI, our room rate was $180 ++ per nightMy husband and I stayed at the river street in for 2 nights.  The location is phenomenal, right in the midst of the happening scene.   Clean rooms and very romantic decor.  The cons are the lack in amenities and slow service.  After 3 phone calls and 1.5 hour wait I finally received an iron and ironing board.  Also no room service or hair dryer.  Certain aspects of rooms need improving for example the closet doors don't fully open due to carpet and some light bulbs didn't work.Unique affordable historic inn close to downtown. Had everything we needed and the staff was very accommodating. We liked being on the street level so we could come in and out without going up and down the stairs. The bed was pretty good but could use an update. Parking is a little out of the way and costs fifteen a day so prepare for an extra charge.Love love love!!!!! Best spot on riverstreet , views wonderful , guy st front desk very nice and knowledgeable but we didn't catch his name , chocolates they give u are delicious :) comfy bed and nice room and almost forgot the best free wine and snacks social hr ! &amp; if your not a wine fan you can get a beer for $2!!I stayed at this hotel on a small one day trip to Savannah with the folks. My husband and I reserved both rooms via Expedia. We were given the option of City view or River view. City view came out to $139 for the night and the river view was $160. Upon arrival we paid for parking $15 until checkout, unlimited in/outs. The parking garage is across the street off Abercrombie St. And really is the city parking garage. We checked in late about 10:30pm. The front desk agent was very nice and accommodating. The halls were nice, wooden floors. You need your room key to use the elevator, this is to keep non guests out because there is an entrance and exit right out to the Bay. This entrance/exit was very convenient, it leads you right to all the cool shops and restaurants/bars. The rooms were neat and clean. Yes the rooms could use a nice update like fresh paint, and wallpaper, but other than that the rooms were fresh. Feel safe ladies there is a hair dryer, nice little coffee machine with flavored brews and half/half, also really nice hair and body soaps! I think they even sell them as gifts if you want a larger version. The bed mattresses were nothing to faun over, and it would have been nice if they were fluffier but I didn't lose sleep over it. All in all it was a great stay without complaints from me and my family and I believe we got what we paid for. I would recommend it to anyone asking.","This was a perfect choice for our quick trip to Savannah! We were close to the action but didn't hear any of the noise once we headed to bed. Our room overlooked the river and was so pretty. One wall was old brick and the furniture was antique. (No worries, the bed was super-comfy!)My only complaints are these:-The woman working the registration desk had ZERO personality and could not have been less welcoming.- No in-room coffee pot is a big miss.Everything was great here! Close to the action of river street and great location to the city squares. Soaps weren't always refreshed and there were no chocolates in our pillows-maid service wasn't the best but nothing terrible. Happy hour was short so we never got to it. The room was nice and big. Pillows are seriously terrible so bring your own.Great location, but has some old building issues. We picked this place since my boyfriend had been here before, so it seemed like a good choice. Original room was great and spacious but I woke up the first morning to a drenched carpet runner because the air conditioning unit has soaked the ceiling above the entry and was slowly dripping onto the carpet.  They moved us, but only after I insisted. The back up room had a broken door (wouldn't close), mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, and was significantly smaller. I don't think I'd come back, other than for some ghosts...I was in town for work and all of the typical chains were sold out due to a conference.  When I looked the River Street Inn up on the interwebs, the pics looked nice, but I was a little anxious about the actual experience.  Those nerves were completely unfounded...I loved this place.  The Inn is right in the middle of all activity and most historic areas of Savannah.  The hotel itself is like walking into the past...but the service is top notch.  I'll definitely be back.The only drawback for some is that several busy bars and restaurants are directly below the hotel.  The hotel takes up the 3 and 4 floors, but bars are on floors 1 and 2.  The noise is noticable but not enough to keep you up at night.River Street Inn provided a fantastic stay.  The service at check-in and check-out were great.  It is a historic hotel next to the river and the common areas were visually interesting.  My stay was in a two room suite on the 4th floor with a city view.  The room was tastefully decorated and paid homage to the history of the building. Everything was first class.Excellent hotel and convenient to restaurants and bars. The building was an old cotton warehouse. Hardwood floors and brick in my room. Staff is very friendly. Definitely stay here again. On a side note, my room was very dry. Too dry. Other than that it was great.Our room was very beautiful and we were able to get the river view. The staff was very nice and the room was very clean and orderly. This place is a great location and put us within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. In the evenings between 5-6:30pm they serve you free wine, beer, and food in the lounge area. Very nice touch.Historic hotel, close to everything downtown, which is why we chose it.  The rooms are authentically designed, however, don't include some of the standard amenities that other hotels have i.e. coffee pots, mini-fridge, etc.  The bathrooms are nice but water pressure is non-existent.The rooms are moist and humid.  The pages from my books are damp and wavy from the humidity.  There is a distinct smell of mold.5th floor is the place to be &amp; river view is more private than city view.Don't expect to check in early as the rooms will most likely not be available.  They will allow you to store your bags and check into parking ($30 a day in a parking garage a block from the hotel) prior to checking you into your room.So, great location, so so rooms, pleasant staff.It's really hard to rate the River Street Inn. It's a historic hotel with winding hallways and no two rooms are the same. Some are gorgeous with great views, some are in need of a facelift and kind of smell like mildew. How you feel about the hotel will surely be determined by how much the check in guy likes you.We didn't know anything about the geography of Savannah when we checked in and were happy to get a ""3rd floor"" city view room. What we walked into was an old basement room facing a cobblestone and brick wall, under an overpass. Not exactly charming and scenic. It looked like it had been renovated in the early 90's, with old drapes and a beige tile bathroom. Not dirty necessarily, just in need of some upgrades. We learned that since there is such a steep incline between River Street and Bay Street, you have to be on the 4th floor of River to be on street level of Bay. Therefore, if you request a city view room, you will only actually get a view of the city from the 5th (top) floor. This is kind of misleading on their website, but whatever.We decided we wanted to stay in the central hotel area... hopefully not facing a wall, and were given a water view room on the 3rd floor which was a huge improvement. Or so we thought. The more we looked around, we realized we hadn't just given up our big bathroom and king size bed, we'd also given up our mini-fridge and coffee maker. Le sigh. When we checked in, we were informed that the elevator was ""temporarily"" out of order, which isn't a big deal for us but could be for other guests. It looked like the paper signs hadn't exactly been put up recently, and showed no signs of being fixed while we were there. So the elderly and lazy might want to stay away.We had mixed experiences with hotel staff, and it seemed that any extra amenities outside the room were conveniently unavailable during our stay (the roof deck was ""under construction""...?).The River Street Inn is a historic hotel that overlooks the water. It's unlikely that you'll see a building like this anywhere else. The room's are clean and comfortable. The only downside is that there's no pool vut it makes up fir modern hotel amenities with the charm of walking over a small bridge to get to. I would not recommend it to anyone with vertigo.Also the free hotel wifi is useless.I am a sucker for historic inns so when I tasked the sig-o with finding us a place to stay in Savannah I was delighted when he found the River Street Inn. It would be a waste to stay in downtown Savannah and not spend the night in one of their historic buildings. The prices were also reasonable and just about everything you could want is within walking distance. Check in was quick and efficient and our room was on the fourth floor which is nice since we didn't have to haul our baggage up or down any stairs.Our room was very clean and quite charming. I love wingback chairs and four poster beds (the sig-o likes more modern themes). We didn't end up getting a room with hardwood floors but this was ok. I love how they have a nice selection of books in the room that not only tell about the history of the inn but about Savannah in general. You can easily spend a few hours reading before you leave your room. Wireless internet is provided in case you want to bring your laptop to plan your days. The bathroom was clean but nothing extravagant (although the jet tub was nice). I was extremely thankful that the air conditioning in this place was superb considering the very hot and sticky Savannah summers.  You can use one of the many city owned parking garages near the inn (parking averages around $8/day).Now for the only knock on my experience here. There was an ice machine located outside our room that was perhaps the loudest ice machine I have ever encountered in my life.  If you can imagine the sound of a bleating goat being unwillingly fed into a wood chipper then you can replicate the misery we heard. The second night of our stay I was woken up three separate times by the monstrosity (who the hell needs ice at 3am anyway?). Management either needs to fix this machine or relocate it away from guest rooms. The machine is so infamous I have included a picture of it in the photos section. This place may have approached a five stars (although I still like the Planter's Inn in Charleston better) had it not been for the ice machine. Still overall a beautiful inn with a charming room and a can't miss if you need a place to stay in Savannah.The only thing lacking here is an in-house food supply. However, there are scads of restaurants from which to choose, all within easy walking distance.  However #2: there is a happy hour at 1700 each day with complimentary wine &amp; snacks.  The hotel has been updated &amp; is clean with extremely friendly staff.  Oh, you also get to watch BIG ships going in &amp; out of the harbor.Overall very nice. Very good location on the river with Huey's right down stairs. We were there for a conference so having the water taxi close was a big plus. Staff was very helpful and generally did all they could to make our stay a good one. Hotel has plenty of character and we loved the antiques in the halls.Two significant negatives (and I hope these are anomalies) were:1. No heat the first two nights. This was January, and it was cold. When we asked for at least another blanket or two, all we could get were extras sheets.2. Not sure how well our bathroom was cleaned after the previous guest. There was human (I presume) hair on the wall.Will stay here again, and recommend if you want a place on the river (just make sure to ask about the heat working ahead of time).Excellent place to stay while in Savannah. Great staff and lovely historic inn. No worries when you stay here. Outstanding packages as well, reward yourself.  Stayed there twice and each time we have had exceptional experiences.Nice cozy hotel. It is conveniently located and the staff is friendly. They have a 5:30 wine and cheese reception. Only complaint is the parking. You are on your own to find a place for your car. No valet service.A National Historic Hotel right in the heart of the historic district of Savannah. The building dates from the early 1800's. The rooms are spacious and clean with comfortable beds. Ours had an enormous fireplace in it. The balcony overlooked River Street with ferries and boats docked along the Savannah River. The night life along River Street was filled with music and folks strolling beside the river. Our room felt like a window onto a constantly changing show.  We couldn't have been more in the heart of things if we'd tried.  Right behind  the hotel is Tubby's Tankhouse, Heuy's and Bernie's Oyster Bar.  We were within  walking distance of seafood restaurants, Irish bars and multiple walking ghost tours in the city.  The rooms were a little pricey, but well worth it for the area. I'm sure we even had our own ghosts sharing our room. How many people have slept in those rooms in the last 200 years?  How many cotton deals were made here?  How many lives were changed?A fan I am, Yay!  Yep, there are several places to stay while in Savannah but in my opinion when you visit you want to be somewhere that has some history and also is located centrally.  You will be hard pressed to find a better suitable hotel than River Street Inn, in that case.  Antique furnishings and moderately large rooms would best describe the accommodations.  The service staff is great and yummy local handmade chocolates will be found bedside every night :)  The front desk staff was very gracious and was quick to upgrade if possible.  Smooth checking in and equally as smooth checking out make me a happy camper.  In terms of location this Inn is located directly over Huey's (see my review) and also in the heart of the very active nightlife on River Street.We checked in around 4:00pm. They encouraged us to attend the wine/snacks at 5:30. So we went in the room, got settled, changed (lookin hot), and had ourselves a loaded glass of champagne. I'm here with my friend and her son. The location is great! Right on River Street, thus the name. The rooms are gorgeously furnished with more antiquish furniture. We have a nice canopy bed. . .  (Better if I were here on a romantic getaway, but even so...) I am definitely coming back with a guy.I gave the place a 4 out of 5 because they could be a little more customer service oriented, two girls and a baby checking into a queen bedroom ... C'mon, at least offer the option of  a double bed room??My husband and I stayed here on our little getaway. I love historic inns because they are so charming. RSI is very quaint and located on River Street with all the local restaurants and bars. It is also facing the Savannah River so def get a room where you can see the river and watch the boats go by. It is located within walking distance to many attractions, restaurants, and shops. Our room was small and the longer we stayed in it, the more I didn't like it. I didn't think it was very clean. There was a ring around the toilet and the sink didn't look clean either. Also, on the sheets there were some stains. I know they were clean, but just to see them grossed me out. We asked for new sheets and they were nice about it. My husband found some lube in the nightstand drawer so we knew what the previous guests before us did. They turn your sheets down for you and give you a special treat from a local candy store. I thought the staff was helpful and answered all our questions about where to go. Overall 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. If we were to come to Savannah again, we wouldn't stay here.Likes- It was clean, had good character and was in a great location. The cleaning staff was friendly whenever we encountered them.Dislikes- Air conditioning was mediocre, had it on full blast the whole time and was barely adequate. The wireless internet only worked sometimes and very very poorly when it did-- I was on the top floor which must have been very far from the router. The bed was super uncomfortable and they only had 3 pillows. The mattress and box spring also had special bedbug covers on them which was a little concerning. The television was supposed to have HBO, but did not. The advertised 8 dollars for parking was a couple blocks away and actually cost twice as much. The ladies at the front desk made it seem as if we were a nuisance while checking in and checking out.So all in all the hotel was okay but had far more wrong with it than good. I spent two nights there then spent a third at the Hampton Inn down the street. My biggest regret during this vacation is not spending the whole time at the Hampton.  Would definitely not visit the River Street Inn again, but others may like that kind of experience.","Came here for a weekend getaway last Spring on my first trip to Savannah and was very pleased!  A very charming, historical hotel right on the water in the heart of the city.At check-in I was told that my queen room wasn't available, but the staff were very nice and upgraded me to a King room on the water side, no complaints here!  Staff was also very helpful in finding places to go in the city and where to eat.  After reading a few of the other reviews, maybe I just lucked out and got the one really helpful front desk person?  ;o)My room was clean and the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a good size as well.  I didn't have a balcony, but a good-sized window to look out over the water.As mentioned before, there is a parking garage fairly close to the hotel, I just wound up leaving the car there and walking to everything I wanted to see since the hotel is in such a great spot.  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Savannah!Catching up on reviews from a trip earlier this year - I've been way behind - and I wanted to share this magical place.  I have a soft spot for historic places, having grown up in an old house, and I wanted to share this.We arrived fairly late and tired from a long day of driving but the check in process was quick and painless.  The building is arranged in a few stories with a grand central staircase with a somewhat precipitous drop from the upper stories to the basement, but that's part of the charm.  Beautiful hardwood floors throughout, and we were lucky enough to get a room looking out on the river.  On our arrival, there was someone singing down by the river (not a song, but literally singing next to the river) and a large shipping barge going by.  You truly get a sense of being in the middle of a historic shipping thoroughfare that has seen centuries of commerce.  It was a magical moment.Don't arrive expecting all the amenities, power outlets, technology, and creature comforts of an upscale hotel in Vegas, for example, and you'll be very pleasantly surprised by the charm of this place.  Not to say that there aren't amenities - nice robes, etc. - but you're staying here for the charm, the ambiance, and the history, and a touch of Old Savannah.Planned kind of a last minute trip to Savannah for St. Patricks Day and unbelievably found this Inn RIGHT on River Street available. This is an old historic hotel that still holds all of the charm of history. You almost feel as if you could go to sleep and find yourself awaking in another time! The rooms are large and clean. The refurbishment to bring the establishment to modern standards is excellent. The bed was very comfortable.The location of this establishment in relationship to River Street is one of it's GREATEST assets. Of course when River Street is loud and hopping, so is the room. Especially during St.Patty's Day, if you are not staying at RSI to BE part of the party, you'd likely be frustrated by the noise. We LOVED it and will be visiting again.Great location, friendly staff, lovely room.  I have read previously reviews, and believe the staff are listening.  Room was clean with great turn down service with local chocolates on your pillow. Staff was friendly and helpful.  They do now have valet service at least at check  in time. Enjoyed my stay.I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but went with three for one reason:  the staff.  They're atrocious.  Rude, short, acting like they have something better to do.  Just nothing but attitude all the way.  I don't understand how these people got a job working in a customer service industry.Aside from that, this is actually a pretty decent place to stay.  The rooms are quiet &amp; clean, furnished with antiques, and quite charming.  The location is hard to beat.  And the prices are pretty fair for what you get.If they fired everyone who worked here and hired an entire new (professional) team to run this place, it would be a solid 4-star establishment.Great location for a first time trip to Savannah, right on the river with River Street and its odd collection of tchotchke shops, candy shops, restaurants, and dive bars. On the city side it's adjacent to Bull and Abercorn Streets, with all their parks and historic action. The hotel itself also has that Savannah charm, being a converted warehouse (as are pretty much all the buildings on River Street). We had a city view room on the 4th floor (due to the big incline between River and Bay Streets, the 4th floor is actually street level on Bay Street, while the 1st floor is street level on River Street - so any rooms below the 4th floor on the city side will be staring at a brick wall...river side rooms don't have that issue, but some of the 3rd floor rooms may be uncomfortably close to the live music of some of the bars/restaurants on River Street). Our room itself was nice, with plantation shutters, four poster king bed, and more than adequate AC (nice since it was 90+ F and 90%+ relative humidity while we were there). The only knock was our room's proximity to what must be the loudest ice machine in the known world. Otherwise, totally worth the money. A tip, the hotel itself has no parking, but a city of Savannah parking garage is a block away. You can buy two or single day visitor parking passes that are good at the city garages. The two day pass is almost as much as one day in the garage without it, so I'd snag one of passes instead. The single day pass is worth it too, if you're just staying for one night. See the city of Savannah website for more details on those bad boys.They turn your sheets down for you and give you a special treat from a local candy store. I thought the staff was helpful and answered all our questions about where to go. The room was clean and we had an awesome view of the river. I love this place. Will come back here if I am in Savannah!A nice hotel right in the heart of Savannah!  It was clean enough and easy walking distance to all of historic Savannah.  The parking is a bit tricky for loading and unloading but if you are a little patient you will be fine.  The rooms are large enough overlooking the water and overall the experience was A-OK!We booked this hotel on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, kind of based on what we read on yelp and kind of just on a whim and based on the sale they were having.  All I can say is, if I go back to Savannah, I am staying at this hotel.  You simply can't beat this location.  The lobby (4th floor) walks right onto Bay Street, and into the historical district, the first floor dumps you right in the middle of River Street and all the night life there.  Amazing location, couldn't beat it.  We even could see the fireworks on the river (it was Oktoberfest) right from our room.  Amazing.The rooms are big but cozy, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and bathroom was clean and had plenty of linens, and the room had bathrobes, both funny and awesome.  I found the staff incredibly helpful, both with directions, watching our luggage, accomodating a late check out, restaurant suggestions, and just getting our loads of luggage down to our room.There is a rooftop porch as well, but frankly, the view is blocked by some other buildings and isn't really anything special.  It is fenced in, too, so you can't even get to the edge and really see anything.  The setting is romantic, but would be great for a friends get away as well.  Oh, and they hooked us up with a free River view...awesome for our weekend.  If you get to Savannah, this is the hotel.I've visited Savannah several times and almost always stay at this hotel. When I haven't, I've felt regret. It is so charming, has a bed and breakfast feel, and is in a fantastic location. On one side is the river, where all of the night action is and the other side leads you to the historical part of Savannah. The hotel holds a nightly wine and cheese happy hour and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. I'd recommend this for a trip with that special someone or even a girfriend's getaway - perfect for either!We went to Savannah for a day trip and decided to stay the night. After looking online we thought we would try this place. I checked availability and it looked like there were several rooms available. My husband called to book a room and was told they were sold out. I sensed this was wrong and made a reservation online. Fifteen minutes later we arrived to the hotel and we had a 5th floor river view. Maybe they save a few rooms for online booking, but it seemed odd. The room was nice. Nothing special no mini fridge or coffee even. We enjoyed the location, and the free wine in the evening.I picked this hotel based on Yelp reviews - thanks guys! I spent a total of 4 nights here (was supposed to be 3 but my flights got cancelled). The hotel itself is perfectly located - its on the Savannah river, backs up to the river walk area. I really liked the style, it wasn't like a major chain rent-a-box. The first three nights I spent in a room on the street side, 4th floor. It was super quiet and very comfortable. I think I paid around $125 a night. The 4th night I had a room on the river side. That was especially cool as the huge container ships sail down the river in the evening and you can watch them go by. Another bonus - you get two chocolate ""gophers"" from the Savannah Candy Co. placed on your bed every day. I had to visit the place just to buy more candy. Yum!I stayed here for a wedding. The downside is that they do not do room blocks so we were all spread all over the hotel which was a little stressful when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and I was in a wing by myself.  The location is great, easy access to River Street and within walking distance from many sites downtown. They don't serve breakfast in the hotel, but there are several places located nearby. The decorations in the room were great and the beds were comfortable although my pillows were very flat. Front desk service was ok, I felt the late night people were more friendly than the daytime people. I'd definitely stay there again though.Stayed here when the boyfriend and I were scoping out places to live before we moved down that summer. Let's just say, this is about as nice as Savannah gets, and we were spoiled. There are fancier hotels (ie: the Mansion) but to be right on River street on the Factor's Walk was amazing. The room was beautiful: gorgeous old wood floors, comfy beds, and the nicest people ever work there!We're back up in Boston 2 years later, but we still plan on visiting... and staying at the River Street Inn. One thing though... make sure you request a room ground floor or above. The folks stayed here during a visit once and the lower level rooms are a little less fabulous. Kind of dark and a little dinghy. Stay on the first floor or above though, and you'll be glad that you didMy husband and I stayed in Savannah 6/17-6/19 for a wedding. After reading several reviews, I made my reservations for the River Street Inn. At first the hotel was difficult to spot from the street, and having never been to Savannah, I was not aware of the parking restrictions (though the hotel staff seemed more than willing to help with that.) The interiors of the hotel were also beautiful and clean. I loved the decor, especially the hard wood floors. Our room on the 5th floor had a lovely view of the city. However, despite the beauty of it, this hotel only gets 3 stars from me. Each time my husband or I had an issue, we had to bring it up three times for it to be addressed. I'll explain. The day before we left Louisville, I called the RSI to inquire about the earliest possible check-in time. I was informed that there was no concrete time, and that I should just call when we were in the vicinity and our room would be ready. On the way to Savannah, around 11:45am, I made another call to the RSI to inform them that we would be arriving within the hour. At this point, I was informed that the earliest time we could check in would be 3:00pm because there was a full house. I ask why that wasn't mentioned yesterday, to which the person on the other end responded, 'I don't know.' We arrive at the RSI just before 1:00, and we speak to a young lady at the desk, who again tells us that they can try to get us in earlier, but guarantees no earlier than 3:00. My husband explains our situation a bit (our situation being that we're headed to a wedding in 5 hours) and suddenly, management finds a room available for us. The 3:00 check in time would've never been a problem if I had been informed of it from the get-go. Secondly, my husband calls down for an ironing board and an iron at 3:30. He asks that it be brought to the room at or before 4:15. At 4:30, still no ironing board. At 5:00, still no ironing board. After his 3rd call, the ironing board was finally brought to the room.Thirdly, after getting caught in an apocalyptic downpour Saturday evening, I called down Sunday morning to see if some of my still-damp garments could be put in a dryer. No one ever came to pick up my clothes, and after the issues with service, I just used the blow-dryer to dry my clothes since I didn't care to have to call someone three times.With that being said, the hotel is very nice and has a great location. Despite the issues with service, I would stay here again. However, the next time I'm in Savannah, I would prefer somewhere that provides parking for their patrons.Really fun hotel to stay at. Perfect location. Smack dab in the middle of everything. The rooms, and hotel look very historic. We really enjoyed to complimentary cocktail hour every day for all guests from 500-630. I think more hotels should do that. We will definetly be back.Can't give this a 3 star because I wouldn't go back to this hotel.  Giving you the good details first:  Very charming and great proximity to everything in the historic part of Savannah.  Once we parked our vehicle we never saw it again until the day we left as this is a walking town and that's what we did.  Being located on the 5th floor felt very safe since in order to take the elevator to the 5th floor, one has to use the room key to get up there.  We were also on the riverside with a great view of the action on the river and down below on River Street, with a balcony which I will comment on below.  Bathroom was very clean, roomy, and decorated to perfection with warm colors and plenty of towels, and a shower head that sprayed as you would want from your own at home.  Beautiful dark hardwood flooring in the room with a fireplace for decoration.  The room was also decorated with antique furniture making it quite homey.  The AC was more than substantial, keeping up with the unseasonably warm temps.Price wise, we got a pretty good deal because we purchased the ""Just the Two of Us"" deal and added a few more nights to it, bringing the price down a bit from the norm for the extra nights.Now for the cons:As said by others previously, employees were nice to a point but yet  quite sarcastic in how they spoke to us and too quick in how parking was explained and taking us to our room.  Felt quite rushed yet there were no other customers waiting when we were being taken up to the room.  With the parking thing, we were told to go left out of the temporary parking, impossible due to the amount of traffic.  The parking garage was a couple of blocks away off of 1 way roads taking it double the time to park then it would have had the explanation bee more clear or even written out for us and other customers.  We were also not given a card or some sort of pass for parking, allowing a deal for the hotel stay, as we learned later when we were leaving, because when asked about the cost, a card or something was quickly shown to us along with another sarcastic comment not understood.  Parking was $11.00 per day, not the $8.00 advertised.  It's also prorated on partial days.  The cost from parking from Tuesday at 4pm to Saturday at 11am was $48.00, twice as much as we thought.My reservation was for a deluxe King.  I don't even think it was a queen but yet a double bed.  Very uncomfortable too!  When I read about the comfort of the bed before going there I thought it would be great.  No better than a cheap hotel.  Next time I stay at any hotel, before I go to the room I will make sure it is a King room.  It was our 10th Anniversary if that says anything.The room smelled......really bad.  It was musty like an old beach house which would have been fine at the beach but not in our location.  Even though the bathroom was clean, the floors under the bed and furniture were not so.  One morning after coming back and after the maid had cleaned, there was a dirty, dusty, nasty men's sock placed on one of the chairs as if it were ours.  The maid didn't know it wasn't but ""yuck!"" anyway.The balcony was plain scary!  Not a problem that it was a French balcony being 3ft by 4ft.  It just didn't seem safe!  If you go, don't let your kids out on it!  You can't see how secure it is from the bottom side but as for the rail connected into the brick by the door, once side was not secure enough to be safe.  Looked like it was coming out of the brick.  And when I did go out on it, I felt a strange feeling to go back into the room and did.With the package we were also to have a Private horse and carriage ride.  The ticket said to take down to the carriage loading at the Hyatt for a ride.  When showing the check in person the ticket she said it was for a general public ride and that this usually wasn't done for the hotels.  We told her we wanted the private ride but was told the ticket was not for that.  Okay, back to the hotel.  When I explained the situation, we were told that someone was supposed to tell us to line up the private ride ahead of time because a reservation was needed for the private coach; sarcastically explained to us again like we were the idiots.  Okay, how am I supposed to know this on my own?  I read the ticket and followed instructions.  Once again this was for our anniversary and I wanted the ride on that day.  We did luck out in that we were able to get a carriage at 10pm for a night ride which was plenty of time away from our dinner reservation time.  So all in all that did work out by why the issues with everything and the sarcastic attitudes?  The people here really need to be more welcoming, which would make for a much more pleasant stay.In that, we have already decided that we will try a competing hotel on River Street next time.  I would love to stay here again if my reservations were correct, King bed included, and not being talked down to with sarcastic attitudes.A terrific historic hotel right on the river in Savannah. Classic southern hospitality and charming rooms.My girlfriend and I planned a trip celebrating 2 years together and decided on Savannah, where she had gone for college (SCAD). She used to pass by this hotel all the time and always wanted to stay here so we did, 3 days total. The place looks great, it's a historic building beside the old Savannah Cotton Exchange (now a Freemasons hall), very cozy, and in tip top shape. We were on the 5th floor and originally booked a room facing the street cause it was a little cheaper. Once we arrived and saw what the river looked like from the 5th level, I went to the lobby alone and spoke to the check in girl (a real sweetheart) about what it would cost to switch to the river view. She told me what the normal room upgrade costs but before i could fetch for my wallet she said she would upgrade us complimentary, money we instead spent on the fantastic restaurants in the area. I read a couple of reviews here where people were afforded the same complimentary room upgrade and it probably happens when there is plenty of vacancy and they want you to have a memorable stay. Good business tactic. We stayed there a week after New Years so maybe the city had cleared out some. Room was excellent, great view of the river and passing boats, very cozy with appropriate historic/woody/rustic feel, plushy comfortable bed, no problems with wi-fi or heating, and the staff was very friendly. Complimentary chocolate pecan candies from a nearby candy store on our pillows and cotton bath robes. We figured we'd have to tack on $10 extra per day for parking as we'd read before booking but we found an hourly parking spot right in front of the entrance and the check-in lady told us it was free on weekends (we stayed fri-sun) so that was a plus.In all, the place was incredible as was it's staff. For charm and location, it can't be beat.The rooms are nice but the bathrooms are a little out dated. They also have free wine and cheese from 5-630. Make sure you add $10 a night for parking to the cost of the room. The staff is friendly especially the house keepers. They were very nice. It's a very old hotel and you can easily get lost if your not careful but if you follow the emergency exit sign you'll be ok. I recommend staying there once just to say you did but there are nicer hotels on river street.","Old, Beautiful inn. Polite Staff. Fantastic restaurants all around.my wife &amp; I go to Savanah several times a year, this is the first time we stayed at the River Street Inn...it was the best stay we ever had. The Staff was VERY NICE.. The hotel was beautiful. the location was awesome. we do not have a single complaint about this place. River Street Inn is now our new place to stay when we visit Savanah. The view from our room was amazing. We got a room with a view of River St and the river..we just loved loved loved everything about our stay..A++++++This place was A-MA-ZING.  The guy checking us in was one of the nicest people ever.  He asked if we were there for any special occasion, and we mentioned we were on our honeymoon- so he upgraded us to a riverview queen suite on the top floor.  The room was AWESOME, it had recently been redone, the colors were gorgeous, the bed was awesome, the bathroom was fancy.  Did I mention the top floor can only be reached with certain room-keys in the fancy gold elevator? Niiiice.  The room also had a balcony overlooking the river. Gorgeous.The turndown service with the chocolates was so cute- and I love free chocolate :D And they wrote a little weather forecast on there too- nice!There is also a ""guest reception"" every afternoon, with free drinks and hors d'oeuvres in the downstairs bar area.  It included cheese, crackers, fruit, veggies, shrimp and chicken when we were there.  In that same area, they have a menu from every single area restaurant laid out so you can look around and plan dinner. Very cool!This is one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had- next time we're in Savannah, I know where we're staying!A fun place to stay while visiting the city.  Rooms are nice and clean with a great view of the river.  You definitely pay for the atmosphere so weigh the experience versus staying at one of the less expensive hotels across the street.Love RSI. It's our second time and staff is just as nice as the hotel.  Get a river view room. Worth the money.Every things was great,location,location,location. The young desk receptionist could had been more helpfull. But I guess this is the new generation. Yes I would go back if I could.Almost a 5 star, but not quite.  We had a river side room with a balcony - it was plenty big with a great view.  The girl behind the desk said to park in the parking garage by the Holiday Inn, but while we unloading one of the bellhops said we could leave it out front.  That saved me some parking money and earned him a bigger tip.  When we first entered the room - tremendous bleach smell.  I guess that's good if you wonder if they clean the bathroom for mold.  Fortunately since it was great weather we could open the outside door and let it air out.  After a couple hours it was fine.  Just in case you're not aware, the river walk on a weekend night is loud and late - things didn't get quite until ~3 am and then the street sweeper comes rumbling through.  We didn't mind, it added to a festive feel.  But if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful evening, stay on the other side or find a hotel further inland.Beautiful historic hotel.  It is located overlooking River Street.  The view is lovely.  The beds here are quite comfortable too.  Rooms are decorated nicely and offer a charming touch.  The staff here is friendly and accommodating.  I will be sure to go back next time I am in Savannah!Just returned from a two night groupon stay at River City Inn.  We were unexpectedly surprised to be given a room with a waterfront view and king bed.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating, although we did not know about the coffee service in the mornings in the lobby until the last day-after we had been making coffee in our room.  We watched huge container ships, colorful tenders, and tugs going through the river right from our window and were impressed.  It is an older building but the original floors and rock walls under the skylight in the atrium added to the charm.  We took advantage of the free wine and snack service in the late afternoon where we talked with other guests.  We did miss a swimming pool though.One of the best hotels I've stayed at.  The location was perfect.   Nice little touches such as free wine every night and chocolates on the pillows.  The building itself looks great.  Highly recommended.This hotel, near the historic Cotton Exchange, a commerce center dating back to 1887.  It certainly holds its fair share of southern charm, along with a hefty dose of gothic southern creepiness. My room was large and comfy, but also held a slight resemblance to the room that holds John Cusak hostage in ""1408."" The portrait of the anonymous plantation owner hanging ominously over the four-poster bed was a nice touch. His eyes followed me all Disneyland Haunted Mansion-style. Spooky...The hotel offers an evening social hour with free wine, which I didn't get a chance to try. It also has a pool table in the lounge, which I also did not try. One night I decided to take a self-guided tour of the building looking for the roof-top patio. I ended up, through a number of twists and turns, on the uninhabited fifth floor. I think these rooms were at one time offices for the gentlemen doing business at the Cotton Exchange. The floor definitely had the feel of yesteryear, and the unnerving silence to go with it. I made the skeedadle to the rooftop patio door, only to find myself outdoors all by my lonesome. I had propped the door open behind me, but have to admit, I lost all nerve when I looked back and saw it slowly closing on its own. Was it a ghost trying to lock me out of the building to freeze to death outside, unbeknownst to the hotel staff? My overactive imagination got the best of me and I high-tailed it back inside, skittering my way to the elevator and back down to the lobby, where I strolled out trying to act all cool and casual. Aside from all the spooky stuff, the staff here was super helpful and gracious, and each night I received free turn-down service and chocolates on my pillow. If you stay here, know that river-view rooms on the 3rd floor can get noisy. My room apparently was right over a bar with nightly karaoke. Folks singing there really seem to love the Doobie Brothers. I got to hear a rendition of  ""Long Train Runnin'"" pretty much every night. That was really the only downside. But now that I think of it, maybe it was that ghost's way of trying to get me the hell outa there again...A friend and I stayed here after visiting some old friends at Southern. It is such an amazing hotel. Right on the river, clean rooms, and its HISTORIC, which is great to add to that down-south charm. Don't be surprised if you see a ghost roaming the halls :) The staff was nice and friendly and the hotel overall was just beautiful. Plus, you can walk to any of the places on riverstreet, and it wasn't too unresonably priced.Awesome stay in this river facing charming inn.  Service was very friendly and rooms were appropriate and clean.  The location can't be beat, and it is nice to stay in an authentic inn vs. the larger chains in the area.  Parking is terrible of course, but the room is highly recommended if staying in this part of Savannah.",,"['love', 'hotel', 'upon', 'arrival', 'night', 'greeted', 'gentleman', 'assisted', 'luggage',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Holiday Inn Express Savannah-Historic District,4.0,$$,62,"I stayed here over Valentines weekend with my boyfriend. We had a very amazing weekend. The hot tub roof was absolutely amazing and we think it's the only hotel in the area that has one (my only complaint would be that I wish the water got hotter but may have just been because of how chilly out it was).Everyone we encountered that worked at this hotel was extremely pleasant, helpful and genuinely seemed like they enjoyed their job.We really liked our room. good size and comfortable bed. This is an amazing location. We got lucky and got a spot to park right in front of the hotel and were able to stay there most of the weekend but generally its $22 a day for valet so keep that in mind. Everything in town is walkable from this hotel.We will defenently be coming back to this location. Can't say enough nice things about it.If I could give this place 3-1/2 stars, I would; unfortunately, they lean more on the 3- than the 4-.For the price vs. the location, it's a fairly good deal. It's right on Bay St, which parallels the Savannah River, adjacent historic river district, and Rousakis Riverfront Plaza. On the other side of the hotel, you are really close to historic downtown - restaurants, lots of mainstream retail chains, and quite a few of the park-like historic squares - all very pedestrian friendly.Rooms were clean and functional. Though it looks like the facility could've had a minor superficial upgrade a few years back, I wouldn't be surprised if it was due for a more major overhaul in a few years. Definitely, the hotel looks better on the web than it did in real life - not bad, though if you look hard enough at the nitty/gritty details, it might be starting to show minimal age/wear/tear.Free continental breakfast with standard pre-packaged items - bagels/toast, hot/cold cereal, yogurt, fruit, pastries. They also had  along with an ""automatic pancake machine"", which, at the press of a button, pre-pours some pre-set amount of batter; then out comes a pancake! Not spectacular, but all OK if you set your expectations accordingly.They have a rooftop pool with a city/river view, which is cool.Quite frankly, the workout room sucked. They squeezed like three treadmills, one elliptical, PT balls, AND one weight machine into a super small space. I am not so sure they had a very good consultant/process when they looked into ""designing"" the workout room. Though it looked like the weight machine was practically new, it's a cheaper quality all-in-one unit with a rope/pulley system that potentially needs more space for your workout than they actually provide. Not only that, if you get something that is not intuitive to use and needs instructions (vs. the normal free weights or weight machines that one is used to), then it really isn't worth the time/money/use. They are better off providing a bunch of smaller size free weights. All-in-all, though, for my stopover of a day and night, it was OK, and worth the money.I give it a 3 stars A plus.Modest looking, same with rooms But I was surprised on how comfortable and quiet it was.The room had a little ""funny smell"" but not to bad.Restaurants are near, Public parking is next to the hotel, you could save money by parking there, I did.Gym is very small,Pool is nice, good views.Very odd room service. I found a gold hair and a brown hair on each beds on the first night, thought it might be from the room service. Next day, we left when the room service doing her work , how ever when we are back. There is a red blood ish dots on top of the bed and a dirt foot print next to it. One of the towels is wore out, like someone tore it. Front desk is really helpful and room service respond quickly. But what is going on during we were away?! Someone has a fight or injured in my room?Can't not say it is a good hotel. Strange and scary. Nice top view and pool, also the gym is functional. And the beds are comfortable, hope the bad feeling will go away later.Could have been on of my few 5 star hotels except for 2 things.1) After our second night, we returned in midafteroon to discover our room had not bin cleaned,  no fresh towels, etc.  I called down to the front desk to let them know and was told ""our policy is to clean only the rooms that the guest has specifically requested "".  HUH????  So why was the room cleaned yesterday?  ""That must have been a mistake sir, I will find out who entered your room to clean it without your permission"".  In my former job I traveled extensively throughout the US, stayed at pretty much every chain, and never heard of this before.  If this truly is their policy it should be changed. But I suspect the real cause was the clerk covering for an error in housekeeping.The other issue I encountered was when I asked about storing luggage after checkout. Check out time was 11 a.m., an hour flight was not until 6 p.m. we wanted to spend some time visiting attractions we have not gotten to. The woman at the front desk did not seem pleased about our request. She said ""I guess we could do that for a couple of hours"".  When we did check luggage, I saw why se was hesitant.  They do not have a storage room, closet, or any space for storing luggage. Instead, you wield your luggage into an area that was used for Office, and put it against any available wall or space. Rather than discouraging visitors to store a suitcase or two, the hotel could take some space and dedicated just for storage.As for location, complimentary breakfast, and the rooms, we could not have asked for more. When they solve the luggage storage issue, and start giving a daily maid service without it being requested, this will be a five star hotelWe stayed for one night in this hotel. Valet parking available and the way to go if you have to drive to other places. It's $20 a day or you have to pay every time you leave which could add up. If you're going to park once and tour on foot during your stay skip valet. The room was clean and this room was on the sixth floor with a view of the river. There were lots of outlets to plug in electronics, a small Keurig, a microwave, and a small refrigerator. Our mattress was was really comfortable. We'll go back!Great hotel in Historic Savannah! They are in a great location that is very close to all the historic attractions and riverfront. The concierge was great about helping us schedule tours and recommending local places to eat. The room was very clean and well kept. The breakfast was also very good. It is worth the money and is a nice place to stay.This  hotel  was clean and well  maintained.  The staff was helpful and courteous and very personable.  Upon arrival,  we were  greeted by smiling valets ready to  help. I will say that parking is not cheap (20.00) but we knew our car was in a safe spot and was accessible anytime.  Be sure ro enjoy the  pool  on the roof . The view is to die for.Great location. Very clean and modern. We have been very happy with our three night stay. Great staff, nice breakfast, close to everything.Inattentive staff rude and abrasive. We moved to Marriott and loved historic Savannah.Even though it's a Holiday Inn Express, don't let the name fool you. This place is so nice!  Lobby, bar, breakfast areas all have an updated look. Rooms are also updated and have a clean feel. Free breakfast in the morning, with lots of 'to go' items is a great way to save $. Coffee, tea, and fruit available all day. Oh and the rooftop pool was a pretty nice plus. Only downfall is the fitness center-2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 weight machine.The location is great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. You would think when you make a reservation 10 months in advance and check in first thing in the morning, you would get a room with a better view than staring straight at the parking garage.The hotel was under construction when I went with a friend. There was not any issues with dust or noise. The hotel has a great location. Everything in the historic district is a walkable distance. The concierge was helpful, and gave me some great recommendations of places to go and when to go. There is not a parking lot, so if you cannot find a spot of the street (difficult on weekends) you have to pay for valet parking.This hotel was a great deal for being right smack in the middle of everything. I couldn't pick a better location. All of the hotels downtown do not offer free parking, so be prepared to pay $15-20/a day to park your car. The rooftop pool was really nice, and the gym was perfect for getting our treadmill time in the morning :) I like how the hotel offered fresh fruit infused water in the lobby. The continental breakfast was pretty good too. Lots of table space. River street was like a block away. The beds were nice and comfy and the rooms nice and modern looking. There was a little hotel work going on but that didn't bother us at all.I stayed for 2 nights while in town for a conference. Booked with rewards points, which was a plus for me.  I was able to check in with out issue, the room was nice and clean, spacious and has a microwave.  Standard breakfast in the morning if you don't want to pay for breakfast elsewhere.  Within walking distance to the historic distance and to Bay St. and the River.Valet Parking is $15 a day if you're a platinum member, $20 if not.  I will say though, that booking with points shouldn't be an excuse to not give you a receipt when you check out though!We stayed here for 3 nights during a recent trip to Savannah. It is a very clean and comfortable hotel. The staff are very courteous and attentive. They were working on the elevators during this trip and kept apologizing for the wait while one elevator was down.The room was clean and comfortable with a few of the river. The kitchenette was very clean and convenient. The bathroom is updated and spotless with plenty of towels. The breakfast is one of the best I've seen for a continental breakfast. I had the biscuits and sausage gravy as that is my favorite food ever...it was really good!The bar , the Port Royal Tavern, has a great happy hour. Our bartenders- Rocky and Ken, were super nice and very friendly with a lot of suggestions for sights and dining. They do close pretty early which is unfortunate as I would probably have ended most nights there.The parking is the only downside really. You can park for $20 a day with the valet (unlimited in/out). The garage is always full for private parking. There is on-street parking availbable (free after 5) but be mindful of the sweeping hours and such. We went cheap this time but next time I would probably just use the valet.This is our new go-to hotel in Savannah.Talk about Southern hospitality!  This hotel was such a perfect location to see all of historic Savannah.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and inviting and the customer service was beyond excellent.  From our first encounter at check-in, to our welcome cocktail served by the lovely ""Rocky"" and our numerous interactions with Mackenzie (who constantly asked us what he could do for us) to the wonderful concierge services offered by Ed and Don, we were just overwhelmed.  We did so much in the 4 and 1/2 days we were there and this hotel makes it all so easy.  The free breakfast was a nice start to our day.  Nothing fancy but what is served tastes good and there is a fair variety.  Coffee was awesome.  Cocktails at the bar were very reasonably priced and just delicious.  Don't miss the pool, hot-tub and cabana area on the top floor because the views are seriously breathtaking.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and well-appointed.  The big plus at this location is just that....""LOCATION!!""  This place affords easy walking to River Street, all 23 squares, historic landmarks, City Market, Paula Deens....anything you want to find.  The other big draw here is the hospitality and customer service.  My friends and I have never been treated so well.  Next girl's trip to Savannah, this will definitely be our home.  If I had to make one suggestion, it would be nice to have a restaurant on premises or at least room service from a nearby restaurant.One of the best parts of Savannah!!  The staff at this hotel are unbelievable!  Cleanest rooms I've ever seen at a hotel!  If you plan to stay here, there is no need to have a rental car while you stay; it is within walking distance from everything.  We had a great balcony room overlooking Bay Street for the remarkable fireworks on the 4th of July.   Even though Bay is a busy street until 3am or 4am, we couldn't hear any of the folks getting smashed below.  Continental breakfast and fruit infused water throughout the day along with a complimentary concierge!  I do need to do a shout out to the ladies working the continental breakfast, ""Our little guy misses your smiles""!They accepted the Gov Rate. Woo Hoo!  The location was good.  The room was clean.  The concierge was nice.  Probably one of the nicest holiday inns I have ever stayed at.  The valet parking is a little pricey, and the breakfast is not free, but otherwise this place was pretty good for the amount we were paying.  If I go back for business again, I will stay again.My wife and I stayed here for four nights while visiting Savannah. The hotel location is great for visiting the historic district, though it is on one edge so about a 20 minute walk to the Savannah Visitor Center or to places like Mrs Wilkes. There is self-parking as well as valet, expect to use the valet as the self-parking lot is often full. The valet staff was excellent, we never waited more than five minutes for our car to be brought around, and we almost never needed the car anyway. Check-in was fast and the lobby and lounge areas are very comfortable. They have free breakfast available which is convenient and can save you a few $$$ compared to the local restaurants.The room was nice, though a bit small and slightly outdated in terms of available outlets. So many hotels now have USB charging connections, but they haven't yet installed them in this hotel. They offered free wi-fi, but the signal was very poor and nearly unusable which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. There were just two elevators and they were a bit slow, so sometimes we had to wait to get up or down, and most of the time we just walked down the stairs (we were on the second floor). The street noise was minimal, though one evening there were some guests that arrived in the early AM on motorcycle and they spent a few minutes idling below our room. There is an outdoor pool on the roof which was small and usually occupied with children.The location was great for us, several area restaurants were within a five minute walk including B Matthews (great for any meal, but make reservations) and Vic's (wonderful). It's only a few minute walk to the riverfront, though we found that area to be too much of a tourist trap as our tastes lean towards historic homes. Highly recommended as a great option if you want to stay economically in the historic district.","Stayed here with my husband in October 2013.  Like many other people have said, the location is AWESOME.  It's a short walk down to the Riverwalk and to multiple restaurant districts.  We had a spacious corner room facing the river.  The furnishings were still nice and the bed was comfy.  The amenities were pretty nice.  The rooftop pool and hot tub are awesome.  They weren't overly crowded and there are plenty of chaise chairs.  The gym was pretty standard for a HIE - two treadmills and an elliptical.  Breakfast was typical for a HIE - eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, breads, cereals, instant oatmeal, and fruit.  It was pretty busy when we arrived but by the time we had our food, a table had opened up.   Coffee, tea, and cocoa are available all day. The only drawback is the cost.  The rooms are expensive plus it's $20 to valet park the car.  Fortunately, in-and-out privileges are included!This hotel is in a great location, close to all and right across the street from the river where there are a lot of shops and restaurants. It is a large hotel with free breakfast, it's clean and has a concierge and a bar. You don't need a car to get around to see the sights. The WIFI was not very dependable and our cell phones didn't always work unless we stood by the window. We had a king corner room which was very large with a nice view. We could hear the traffic below, but got used to it quickly. Keep in mind it's a 3 star hotel, but for the price it's a great value.This is one of my favorite Holiday Inn Express locations. It feels like a much more expensive hotel when you walk into the lobby, but still offers all the great pricing and amenities of the Holiday Inn Express chain. They even validate your parking at the public garage next door.Location is awesome and you are in walking distance of almost anything in the Historic District. For example, River Street (with it's heavenly smelling candy shops) is just across the street and down the cobblestone steps. Many of the Squares are close by and of course you just have to go to Paula Deen's or Mrs. Wilkes!!! The Pink House and Telfair Museum are also nearby.They have a rooftop pool with great views of the harbor, suspension bridge and a nice exercise room just inside from the pool. Breakfast is nothing to get excited about, but it's free and a good variety of hot and cold items. Very attractive building, comfy beds, VERY CLEAN facilities &amp; rooms, and really nice staff make this an ideal central hub to visiting this charming city.Awesome location across from river st. Trolley stop across street.  Free wifi.  Free hot breakfast. Fridge and microwave. Concierge knowledgeable. Front desk staff attentive and friendly. Valet parking $20 per day and slow service. Public parking next door but always full. Bar was not open late and very limited drink offerings.  Slow elevator. Not enough luggage carts.I would recommend.Love this hotel! Friendly, clean and perfect size room for two people. Love the location. We walk just about everywhere. Parking is a breeze with valet and I feel safe leaving my car in their hands. Only once did we encounter a rude staff member, but I think she was having a bad day.. It happens! Oh, the breakfast is pretty good and their concierge is the nicest lady you might ever meet! :) See you soon Holiday Inn Express!We are currently in Savannah for the Rock n Roll Marathon and we've been blown away with the friendly, attentive, and conscientious staff. We just got a phone call regarding a hit and run with our car-- the valet staff (Alfont) noticed a ding, reviewed video, and are working on reporting the incident for us. This situation is out of the hotel staff and our control-- but they are doing their best to reconcile the situation with the utmost courtesy and care. Any hotel can have clean bathrooms and comfortable beds-- but quality and genuine customer care is hard to come by. We are by far impressed and will remain loyal because of our consistent excellent experiences with the Holiday Inn chain. Thank you for taking care of us and keep up the good work!We chose this hotel because it is in the heart of downtown Savannah and within walking distance of all points of interest. If we had paid a *normal* rate per night, we would've been satisfied with the *normal* stay we had.  But, being that we paid an upwards of $300 for one night (including taxes and their $20 a day parking fee) we felt like the stay left much to be desired. Starting with the positives:The room and bathroom are nice to look at. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The front desk staff (when present) were friendly and helpful.Now, with the negatives:We spent a good amount of time looking for ... Just water. To drink. There was a vending machine available that offered snacks and an ice machine. We improvised and filled our bucket with ice and waited for it to melt so we could have drinking water available. The shower head: in need of a change. Water spraying EVERYWHERE. The pillows were soft and squishy, and there are two per person. If you're anything like my husband, though, you like a lot of pillows and there were no extras in the closet.There is a strange smell lurking in all the hallways and rooms that is reminiscent of what a smoker's morning breath would smell like. The smell was so prominent that it woke me up in the middle of the night.  I'm wondering if there is a floor that allows smoking?Housekeeping knocked on our door three times before 10 am.  We overheard the valet complaining about us as we got into our car that he got the ""thank you very much"" tip from us. I understand that these guys look forward to making tips, but when you charge every guest $20 a day just to park the car, isn't it part of the job description of the valet to park and retrieve your car?  Maybe if we'd been happy patrons, we would've given more of an effort to tip.I agree with all of the previous positive feedback on this hotel.  Very convenient to most of the ""must see"" attractions.  Friendly staff and clean, comfortable rooms.  A tad pricey, and the King room was kind of small in regard to other similar plaves I've stayed, buy it's all about location location location.  Despite being street side on the very busy Bay St., the room was very quiet as street noise.  Good windows I guess.Been on the road now for a couple of weeks, good as it gets, only the check in time ? 4.00pm, Walk up town for a look and a beer. Great part of the old town.Happy and friendly staff on checking in, free breakfast and internet no complaints from me.I honestly can't say anything new or different about this hotel. You can't beat the convenience or the free breakfast. I was overjoyed when I saw gluten free bagels! What a nice touch! I loved staying here.One thing that knocked down my rating--I paid $20 for Valet parking only to find out later that their go-to spot is the roof of the parking garage. The rest of the floor was empty. Why not move my car 10 spots so that it's not in the 100 degree sun during the summer? I was horrified and promptly moved it. Beware if you are valet parking!This hotel is a really good deal. Its location is great-- right across the street from the river and in the middle of the historic district. We also got a really good rate compared to the competition, and the room was really nice and clean. I feel like you don't always know what you're going to get with a Holiday Inn, but I have no complaints.Provided toiletries included shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, lotion and bar soap. Also, if you need any other basic toiletries (toothpaste, toothbrush, shaving cream, razor, etc.) they will provide them for free. My boyfriend called the front door to request shaving cream, and the manager showed up at our door with a whole box. The rooms have hair dryers as well.Wifi is free (I hate when hotels charge extra).For parking, you can pay $12 a day to park in the public garage immediately next door or $20 for hotel valet. The valet parks you in the reserved monthly spots in the same garage, so it's only worth it when the public spots are full.The breakfast is standard hot hotel fare, so it's good if you're looking for a quick bite early in the morning but otherwise I'd definitely recommend heading to local restaurants.Downtown Savannah equals FUN. If you want a nicer hotel without the high price, this is the place for you. There's a free breakfast from 6am - 10am. It's nothing fancy, but is fairly decent for free (eggs, bacon, cinnamon rolls, cereal, fruit, etc). There's a rooftop bar with a pool &amp; hot tub, and it's worth going up just for the views. This hotel is within walking distance to many of Savannah's top restaurants (The Olde Pink House), shopping, &amp; city tours. I would stay here again when visiting Savannah.Clean, Super Friendly Staff, quiet for being on Bay Street. Large breakfast area, which is a plus, no waiting on a table, or having to share with a stranger. Rooms are nicely appointed, mine had a queen and a sofa bed. Microwave and a small refrigerator in the room, nice for leftovers, or a snack. Close to everything downtown. Walking distance to River Street, Bay Street and the City Market area. Did I mention the Super Friendly Staff? All of them are pleasant and willing to help. I didn't have any special requests, but if I did you can bet that the staff would accommodate it for you. One of the nicer places I have stayed at in a while.My family and I really enjoyed our stay here. It's in a great location, walkable to anything and everything in the historic district, near the river. The rooms were nice and clean, with ample space, and the staff was very friendly. Our room overlooked the river which was just lovely. There is a $20 overnight parking charge but it seems that all the hotels in the area charge the same rate. Breakfast is included which is a nice bonus.  It's nothing fancy but it offers the basics. If you're looking for a more hearty or gourmet type breakfast, you're better off eating at a restaurant in the area. If we were to come back to Savannah, we would, without a doubt, stay here again!We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our stay. The hotel is pretty old but appeared to be recently renovated. We had a room with a king bed, non-smoking, with a view. The view was amazing! The service in this hotel was pretty great too!We didn't utilize the free continental breakfast during our stay, so can't comment on it. The elevators were having issues while we were there, but worked nonetheless.I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's in a great location, close to everything in the historic district to walk to except maybe a much desired Waffle House.Excellent hotel. Stayed in Savannah one extra night and needed a place to stay so we moved here from a few doors down. Nice staff and very clean room. This will be our primary hotel the next time we're in Savannah. The AC is very quiet too, and we kept the room very cold. Good for light sleepers. The biggest takeaways are (1) very clean, (2) modern fittings, and (3) quiet.Lovely location...you can walk to almost everything.  Staff is welcoming and helpful.  We got a great upgrade because of our Priority Club membership, to a deluxe river view room, which made the stay even better.  The room is spacious and comfortable, scrupulously clean, with plenty of outlets and lights, and convenient switches.  We would definitely stay here again.Wonderful location!  The woman who checked us in was a little rude.  The nearby public parking garage was full, but we quickly realized we could overnight park at a meter right out front, which was a steal (free parking 5pm-8am, $1/hr thereafter).  We stayed on the 7th floor, and the ice machine was broken, which was a small inconvenience.  Clean, quiet room.  Nice hotel overall, especially for the price.  Paid $159 through kayak.The hotel is in a good spot across River St. Its also near a lot of restaurants &amp; bars. The bathroom wasn't totally spotless, but thats ok. We did notice what looked like a blood stain on the mattress under one of the pillows.The staff was nice &amp; helpful. Apparently the bartender's mother passed away so nobody was tending it. One of the front desk clerks quickly hopped over and served us beer.Clean, friendly staff, and great location! Continental breakfast has wide selection. Easy one block walk to River Street. I would definitely stay here again. Nice view from room. No complaints!","Very nice hotel. Didn't expect too much from a holiday inn express. The front desk staff overall was friendly although when I checked in, a guy assuming is the manager on staff was sort of strange in the sense that he didn't speak up. Not unfriendly but not the customer service I was expecting. I had a king sized bed room on the 2nd floor sort of overlooking the river walk. Expect for the street light shining in my window as well as the crosswalk light flashing constantly in the dark, it was fine. I would rec to request a higher level though. I didn't have them clean my room daily but when I did, they didn't bother replenishing the styrofoam cups. The breakfast was ok. Plenty of options but again didn't expect too much for a free meal. Very close proximity to everything!Very nice room. Nice roof top pool and fitness center. Nothing really bad to say.  we decided to stay a second night.  We didn't book ahead so I asked if she would match the online <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> price and they did.One of our favorite HIE on our recent vacation.  Great location, small but clean room, and friendly staff.First of all, the location is the main reason for 3 stars but there are a lot of other hotels with just as good of a location. The valet staff and the breakfast staff are awesome and are another reason for the three stars. If it was left up to the front desk it would be one star. ThSavannah is known as the Hostess city. This hotel lives up to that.   We loved this place.  This hotel is in a perfect location at the corner of Bay Street and Abercorn Street.  It's just down the street from Reynolds Square and across the street from River Street and the River front shops, restaurants and bars. Our room was amazing. It was on the eighth floor (top floor) and it had a sitting area with a pull out couch, a small flat screen TV (that could face the couch or the bed), a ""bar"" area with a sink,  refrigerator and  microwave with a large mirror.  The bed was very comfy with both firm and soft pillows. There was adequate black out curtains in the windows.  Speaking of windows our view was of the river facing east and the Hampton Hotel pool.   There was also a desk with a large mirror on the  wall in front of that.  The bathroom was large and great.  Adequate lighting a large mirror, a magnified shaving mirror, and a large shower (big enough for two).  The towels were soft and plentiful.   There was also a full length mirror in the room and a mirrored large closet for clothing as well as a 4 drawer dresser.  The hotel is lovely. They serve only breakfast. It is continental with eggs, pancakes (they have a cool machine that makes them), cereal, cinnamon buns, bacon, ham, toast, bagels and more.  It is complimentary with your stay.   There is a smallish rooftop pool with a hot tub as well as a fitness room. The staff is also great. They left us a gift bag with a bottle of wine and some snacks for his birthday in our room with a lovely note. I highly recommend this hotel. The prices are comparable with others in the area.Stayed in early March, 2012 for 3 nights Wonderful experience! Great location, clean hotel, nice rooms, very comfortable beds, friendly staff, nice breakfast selection, wonderful roof top pool. I will definitely be back!Nice hotel.  Comfortable beds.  Great location with a short walk to the river and other nearby attractions.  I hate places that charge $20 for you to park your car.  There is a parking garage next door, but I'm unsure how much it cost.  Nice continental breakfast.Very clean for a holiday Inn. Free wifi, breakfast, and walking distance to shops. The staff is very friendly. I would come back again. It's walking distance to moon River breweryTHANKS Yelpers - I wouldn't have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express if not for your recommendations.  This hotel is upscale and should consider a name change as it's better than its brand.  The corner room, bed and breakfast were terrific value.  Located right in the heart of the historic district it's within easy walking district of many parks, restaurants and museums.  Why pay $100 a night more to stay at Marriott and Hyatt brands a block away?  Stay at this excellent hotel and invest the savings in a very good dinner at the Olde Pink House restaurant only a few blocks away.We really loved our stay!!  The room was huge, and really clean and we had a balcony overlooking Bay Street.  We'd had all the walking we could do, so we stayed in, but it was really nice....There was a fantastic bartender in the downstairs bar, who let us take our drinks up to the rooftop patio &amp; pool area.  That was a gorgeous view of the river!!  And the breeze was amazing.  There's a semi-enclosed area that made it seem private, even though it was still pretty wide open. The parking and concierge were fantastic, too.  Such a great value for the location and amenities!!!LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!!!This hotel is a great value for a stay in Historic Savannah.  My husband and I had no idea even where to go our first night there...we set out to explore.  We stumbled upon River Street and had a wonderful time.  THis hotel is beautiful...we had a wonderful view of the historic district and they gave us a free voucher for parking on the street when the lot was full.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and neat and tidy.  I wouldn't ever consider staying anywhere else in Savannah.My wife and I stayed here several years ago and were very impressed with it. I even wrote a very glowing review of it. We stayed here for three days recently and I dont know what happened but the hotel's standards have slipped.  There were three main issues that concerned me.One was that the wifi was spotty at best. We had an ipad and and iphone with us. Half the time the wifi was not working. We checked with another couple who were with us and were staying nearby and they experienced the same issues.Two was that our room was not cleaned the first day that we were there. We left at 10 am and saw a maid in the room next door. We got back at about 4 and a maid said that she forgot to give us towels. She gave us the towels, but when we got into the room, the bed was not made, nor was the room cleaned.Finally was the attitude of one of the valet parking attendants. We dropped off our car yesterday afternoon and when we got to our room, we realized that we had left something in our car. My wife called front desk. They transferred and she explained the problem to them. They said that they would bring the car around again so we could retrieve the item. I went down expecting the car to be there. When I got there it wasnt and the valet had such an attitude that I would up getting the keys from him, and going to where the car was parked in the adjacent garage and then getting the item myself.  If you are going to charge me for valet parking, dont give me an attitude when something like this happens.  We would have brought these issues to the managers attention, however we had a long drive home today and checked out at 5 am. We did not feel like bringing it the issues up then.Overall this stay was a disappointment. There are a lot of other hotels in the same price range as this one in Savannah. We will be staying at one of them the next time that we are in town.Overall a very pleasant stay and hotel. Reasonably priced and the location is perfect. My group was a walk up after another hotel lost our reservation. Room was a little small for 4 people, but we made do just fine. I would totally recommend this place!You won't find a better location than this Holiday Inn Express, which is an easy walk to downtown eateries and attractions, and is just across the cobblestone arteries that lead to River Street.Valet parking is worth the $14 per day, as parking in that area is cumbersome, and everything in downtown Savannah is walkable from the hotel. The rooms were clean minus a few stains on the carpet and another on the wall under the window we couldn't discern what it might have been, but then again, maybe we didn't want to know. Aside from that, we were assigned to an adjoining room, even though I requested one without connecting doors on the web reservation, because my husband abhors them. We forgot to confirm it when we checked in, and by the time we had hauled our kids and our stuff up to the room after an almost four hour drive, he decided to overlook it this time.From our seventh floor windows, we had a lovely view of the Savannah River and Bridge,but we could still hear some noise from the road. It didn't end up being a problem, but I was concerned about it because the only place big enough to set up the Pack N' Play for our 18-month-old was between one of the beds and the window. Since we booked this hotel in part because of the allure of the rooftop pool described on their website the evening before, we were disappointed when we arrived to hear that it was closed for repairs. We were told we could use the pool across the street at the Best Western, which is not a rooftop pool. The idea of dragging our small kids and our pool gear across the street in our bathing suits was less than enticing, so we passed. Breakfast was the typical cereals, bagels, muffins, toast yogurt, coffee and juices; the standouts were the bacon and sausage, which were better than one would expect. There are high chairs, but they don't have barriers that go between the legs of children that will keep smaller babies from falling through the openings. I also left my purse at the breakfast table when we were rounding up the children, and didn't realize it until several minutes after I had returned to my room. When I returned for it, a staff member had rescued it and stored it safely, and all contents were intact.If you are traveling to Savannah for a raucous St. Patrick's Day weekend, this certainly a place to consider.Fantastic stay at this hotel.  The young lady at the front desk was incredibly friendly and the location simply cannot be beat.  We could walk to all of the wonderful restaurants and sites in the historic district from the hotel.  The room itself was in great condition.  Now I like my beds a bit softer, but the hotel has to do what the brand tells them to do!  Free, hot breakfast as well. I'd definitely stay here again.Great for a business trip or St. Patty's Weekend.I have never stayed in the rooms, but I have stayed in the suite/apartments that are behind the Hotel and owned by whoever owns the Holiday Inn/Hampton Inn/Mulberry Inn.  If you call the Holiday Inn they can give you more info.Had I only stayed here once I'd probably give it 3 stars. But I've come to Savannah a billion times for business, and after long term stays at several places, this is my preference. You have a nice sized kitchen, large beds, large televisions, huge bathrooms, and privacy. You also have your own parking space (although random people park in your designated spot and you have to get the staff to take care of it).You are within walking distance of quite a few restaurants, for a variety of tastes.The staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to make you comfortable. Is everything here perfect? No. But you can tell that the front desk associates are really trying to make a difference and raise the bar. Breakfast? Meh. Bar? Meh. Location and Friendliness? TWO THUMBS UP.LOVED this hotel and will never stay anywhere else in Savannah! Clean, nice, updated room. Service was fantastic. One of the valet ladies gave us coupons and great suggestions for places to eat. Breakfast was the BEST continental breakfast I've ever seen at a hotel- pancakes, bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy, cinnamon rolls (my favorite!), bagels, toast, juice, coffee. Yum, yum, yum! Front desk was quick and helpful. Pool was great. Seriously- no complaints. In my opinion, it WAY outranks the Hyatt!!We pricelined this hotel for Columbus Day weekend - and were happy about the rate we received (which was about $50 less a night than the hotel itself and other sites advertised.) Score. The hotel is in a great location - East Bay Street is one up from River Street - and thus, we had a pretty cool view of the barges going down the river. (We didn't select the room on priceline, but did get a water view.) The hotel was clean, had a nice quiet bar downstairs, and also features a hot breakfast until 10am (late, by most standards.) We were happy with how clean it was - and it was a sold-out weekend from what we were told, but the other patrons weren't loud. The staff was reasonably friendly - though not as much as I anticipated for southerners (I'm a northeastern girl.) The first night, my boyfriend and I turned in early. We were both up at unreasonable hours (traveling) - and needed some rest for the rest of the weekend. Housekeeping banged (and opened) the door at 9PM! Have no idea why - thankfully, the bolt was on. I went to the door - and he acknowledged it was the wrong room. Saturday rolled around - we had no replacement bath towels. Called twice to get some so we should shower for dinner. Saturday night, our microwave started beeping at 5am - no idea why. We actually had to unplug it from the wall. We were up on Monday morning (Columbus Day) - and had housekeeping knocking on the door AGAIN at 930am. Why ? No clue. Again, we had the door bolted with the""privacy"" sign on. Check out is at 11am. My lord - I regretted not calling management Friday night.Push came to shove - we were getting our car from the valet (35 minutes to get the car - we thought it broke down, but they just forgot where they put it) - I had a discussion with a lovely manager about our experience. They ended up crediting 2 nights of our stay and our parking fee.Advice: contact management if you find an issue - regardless if it is an isolated event. I truthfully - wanted a happy weekend with someone I hadn't seen in 3 months - not a credit to my card. I am giving the hotel 4 stars based on the cleanliness, location, view, and ease of booking. The attention from management is really what saved this review. I would recommend this hotel to others - but would advice the hotel that the housekeeping staff need some manners and additional training. I am sure that they will work to resolve these issues. (And hopefully - they were isolated to a 'holiday' weekend, with a full roster of guests.)You really can't ask for a better location than this - truly the perfect place to be! You can walk everywhere, but you're enough of a distance from the bars on Bay Street that you don't hear the raucous drunks. We stayed in a suite, and I thought the rooms were a little small for the rate, but everything was impeccably clean and the staff was very polite.This place is GREAT! We found this place without knowing how good it would be, just because we stay at Holiday Inns a lot. It seemed we were staying in an upscale hotel. The room was very nice and clean, bed was very comfortable and everyone was friendly. The location was perfect!","We onyl stayed one night and we were literally only there at night to sleep. However, we were VERY pleased with out room and we had a spectacular view of the River, without requesting it ahead of time. I reserved the room on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> and had researched A LOT of places. Our room was beautiful, well designed and decorated. The mini-fridge buzzed a little but we took care of that with just a little tap on the door. The bed was comfortable and we slept wonderfully. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and knowledgable. I didn't get a chance to talk with the concierge, but he seemed like the old-skool story-telling type, maybe a local who has lived in Savannah for 30+ years. I would recommend this hotel.Stayed here after reading yelp reviews. We were not disappointed! Nice rooms, comfy beds, clean and the employees were friendly and helpful. Loved the rooftop deck, the pool, views, exercise room. Breakfast was decent. Great location. And the price was right!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/east-bay-inn-savannah,East Bay Inn,4.5,$$$,28,"I signed up on yelp to give the east bay inn a review. I returned to my hometown to find the hospitality and comfort I expect. Well done to the staff. A quiet, lovely evening in a perfect location.I got this reservation the night before we spent an overnight in Savannah one our way back home from Holden Beach. I must have got really lucky, because our rickshaw driver told us that the East Bay Inn is usually booked month out and we probably got a canceled room.This has to be one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. When we got back to the room the bed was turned down, that was a great surprise after a night of eating, drinking, and sightseeing.The rooms are gorgeous and the bed is really, really comfortable. Real hardwood floors and the original brick wall, which is really cool. I would gladly stay here again anytime.They also had complementary cheese and wine, and the best pink lemonade.The only down side, was that I didn't get to see Charlie, their resident ghost. Maybe better luck next time.Outstanding location, everyone is overly nice and the rooms are stunning. We were on the 3rd floor and had 18 foot ceilings. Within walking distance to all of the squares, river street and night life. Mrs. Sheila at the front desk was amazing and very knowledgeable on the area. The wine, cheese and snack from 5:30-7:30 every day was low key and great please to gather with others and plan your night. We hope to return and would stay no other place.I stayed here for 3 nights in January. The location is phenomenal. The staff was also very, very friendly and accommodating. However, the bathroom was not the cleanest (hair in the shower floor before we used it and the ceiling over the shower looked a bit damaged), the walls were very thin, and the pillows were lumpy. The room did have character, but if you're in Savannah to check out the history, I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere, such as the Marshall House, Olde Pink House, or 17hundred90. All of those are around the same price, but have historical significance and more amenities (such as wonderful restaurants, 200 year old basement bars with live music, and/or historic happenings and tails of hauntings).Way over priced, you are paying for location.  Breakfast was nothing remarkable, comparable to staying at a motel six.  Staff didn't answer the phone when i called ahead.  There is no mini fridge in your room even thou on their website it says they do. It is pet friendly and they give you a nice doggy bag for your dog.  Overall I was expecting more for what i paidWe came here for my wife's birthday.  We wanted something in walking distance from all Savannah has to offer and had some charm.East Bay is clean, has parking, HUGE rooms, and is in walking distance of everything good.Basically, perfect.  We would never go anywhere else.For our first trip to Savannah we wanted to stay in an old hotel with history. We stumble upon and were immediately taken by this beauty. We were given a tour by Melvin the Bell Man before even considering our stay and our breath was taken away by the stunning rooms. Not only is the location centric but got the cheapest price and an AAA discount in addition. The folks are super nice and the amenities top notch. Complementary breakfast was the best I've had in a hotel since I don't remember when. All in all an excellent choice, next time in Savannah we will be staying there for sure. Plus a repeat visit card guarantees a super discount after a few visits. And its pet friendly!!! Enough said, loved this place.This was mine and my husband's first trip to Savannah.  I researched many online sites before choosing The East Bay Inn. We were so pleased, and would absolutely stay there again. On trips to other cities we've opted for larger chain hotels. Savannah seemed like a place to try something different. EBI was charming and beautiful.   We were given a third floor corner room facing Bay Street. Some reviews mention excessive noise, however coming from a large, urban area we hardly noticed. Everything was just right. Lovely exposed brick, mile high ceilings, pleasant colors, comfortable bed and seating area.   The wine and cheese reception in the afternoon was not crowded and gave us the opportunity to meet other guests and compare notes about restaurants and attractions in the historic district.  Excellent location. Close enough to walk to historic sites and along the river, but just enough steps away from the center of activity so that it felt as though you were leaving the party behind and taking a breather.   Each and every staff member was friendly and courteous and helpful. When we left each morning there were good recommendations and when we returned each evening we were asked about our day.Cindy even recalculated my bill after I remembered that I had a AAA card.   I would definitely encourage friends to choose The East Bay Inn. I hope to return to Savannah soon. It would be fun to go with a group next time.What an amazing inn. If you are looking for the perfect southern experience; look no further. Everyone is so nice and polite (even around town). The rooms are simply stunning and historic. Free breakfast every day and there's a wine and cheese event that happens around 5 PM. A short walk to the river and a perfect location to walk to the historic squares and downtown Savannah. We came for New Years and the parking was insane. They don't have that many spots available as it is. The staff gave is a 2-day parking pass ($12) for the parking garage across the street. Again, what an amazing place. We are definitely coming back to stay here next time we come visit!I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday. I didn't want to stay at a corporate hotel (Hilton or Marriot) because I wanted to experience Savannah's southern charm and make it a special weekend. I had heard great reviews of East Bay Inn from a coworker. I booked the cozy queen. I was worried it would be very small, but it was the perfect size for two people. I did book early so I requested the 2nd or 3rd floor. We got a corner room, with a good view of the surrounding area. The ceilings are SO HIGH, which may have been my favorite feature. We needed to park in a parking garage nearby because the lot was full, but this wasn't a problem because we were not using our car while we were in Savannah. The hotel is decorated perfectly to accentuate the old southern charm, exposed brick, and hardwood floor. It seemed to be kept up very well considering how old it was. Every staff member was extremely friendly and accommodating. My parents surprised us with champagne, which the hotel set up to be waiting for us when we arrived (and we got to keep the champagne glasses!). The location is PERFECT for hanging out in historic Savannah. I recommend visiting in October when the weather is cool and the ghost tours are in full force! While the hotel is pricy, I feel it is worth the money, and I would definitely stay here again.The East Bay Inn has a very good location for seeing the city and has a very friendly and helpful staff.The room was fine but overlooked the small parking lot. The bed was comfortable and the flat screen TV was good sized. One caveat, there aren't many electrical outlets so if you have lots of gadgets that need charging, you'll have to be creative.As you might expect in an old hotel, the bathroom was tiny.The lobby and breakfast area was a bit run-down but the breakfast was substantial although not gourmet.PROS - location &amp; staffCONS - small bathroom; somewhat worn interiorsI am not one to post on yelp but our stay was so enjoyable that I had to.  For one, the rooms are absolutely beautiful with high ceilings, exposed brick and beautiful drapes and bedding.  The complimentary breakfast was excellent, with a wide range of choices and very fresh ingredients.  The most amazing part of it all was when my husband left his phone plugged in in the lobby while we were waiting for our cab.  We made it all the way to the airport and then he noticed.  Sheila from the front desk called me and the manager drove to the airport and dropped it off for us! I was so touched at how they went above and beyond to help us. Amazing.I've stayed here twice now, and this is the cheapest and best hotel that's still close to everything in Savannah. When I go back I will be staying here again. Nice staff, clean beautifully furnished rooms, and great location.You know, some hotels in America are so over consumed with the ""In times"" and all the state of the art crap that they forget the actual art of hospitality. Not this place. The concierge was lovely and the first question they ask you, is if its your first trip to Savannah. If it is, they give you some great tourist pamphlets (not the cheesy kind) and then give you their recommendations. After you check in, they give you actual old keys (not some electronic slide key)...I mean its brass...like made from the 1800s. Fo realz. The rooms are so cute. Four poster bed, with floral comforters. At first glance your like...um ew. However, its actually really sweet and works perfectly with the whole atmosphere of the hotel. The room is very large, complete with sitting area, large TV and a very luxurious shower. It's in a perfect location to the river and great shops and dare I say...fudge shops. Mmmmm. Everything is within walking distance and the places are one of kind....good luck trying to find any shop like this in LA, NYC or Dallas for that matter. Ok, back to the hotel. Obviously I'm not going to stay anywhere but here. There are honestly a ton of hotels in Savannah, but I think this is the best. Not because its the only place Ive stayed there, but because I cant imagine staying anywhere else....it's that perfect. Enjoy!We stayed her because we wanted to be by the river.  It got good recommendations, but it wasn't as nice as we thought it was going to be.  We had a queen room on the first floor. The only room that was available at the time of booking. It had a private patio with french doors. What they don't tell you is they don't clean out there. It was very dark and dirty. Couldn't sit on the chair out there and leaves everywhere.The walls are paper thin and you can hear everyone else in their rooms watching TV and talking.  The place was clean, but not great. They offered a breakfast buffet included in the stay. It is served till 10AM. At 9:50AM I went to get up to have another cup of coffee and noticed that they had already taken away the coffee and most of the food.I had to ask for a cup which they did bring me and my husband had to ask for more cereal, which they did bring him. Honestly, they should wait till a few minutes after 10AM to start cleaning up.I wouldn't go back.It's amazing how some people treat you when you're out with your dog, even at ""dog-friendly"" places; You'd think that I was walking around shirtless and shoeless, spitting on babies or my (extremely sweet and well-behaved) pup was pooping on everything everywhere. Likewise, getting a clean, decent hotel in downtown Savannah that accepts pets without some obnoxious $100+ pet fee is no easy feat, as I have learned.I'm happy to report that pup and I received no such treatment at the East Bay Inn. On the contrary, the staff was very warm and friendly, our room was small but cute and intimate in all its old-fashion-y Southern 'Rococo' splendor, and OMG, BF and I almost died when we were told about ""the complimentary cordials served in the evening."" (Unfortunately, we were only staying one night and didn't make it in time for that, but next time, East Bay Inn!)The staff is SO HELPFUL. They know that you're from out of town and need a little guidance :) The rooms are lovely and clean with gorgeous high ceilings and pretty Southern decor.I didn't get to do two things I would have loved to do: bring my dogs and eat breakfast. Pretty silly, since those two things seem to be at the crux of East Bay Inn's appeal!I slept through check-out by accident and I didn't get ANY flack from the staff. Thank you, and again...sorry!The ONLY thing I would change has nothing to do with my stay, but with the reservation system. It is efficient and easy, but I emailed twice with no response. Everything worked out great, obviously, but that system does not reflect the personal touch that the Inn has.We've been staying here for years and wouldn't change a single thing about it. They're pet-friendly, personable, and the rooms are uh-mazing -- decorated to the nines with a southern Victorian style that wholeheartedly represents Savannah and its southern charm. Customer service has always been pleasant and prompt. The wine and cheese hour is always a treat to indulge in before your evening plans and their breakfasts are sufficient. Is it haunted? That's up for debate. But I will say that I've gotten the chills more than once when I turned out the lights for beddy-bye time. Just ask the front-desk attendant about Charlotte. Oh and I forgot to mention the location. Placed on Bay Street and Market, East Bay Inn is the perfect local between River Street and the historic district. You can walk anywhere and leave your car parked throughout your stay, which is huge for us because we feel like what better way to see gorgeous Savannah than walking it?!My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate our anniversary.  We had always wanted to check out Savannah, and decided to stay here during our visit because of the good reviews and the fact that they are pet friendly!  The inn did not disappoint.  There were a lot of good things about the place:1) Very friendly staff- also very helpful!2) Dog frienfly!  We travel with our dachshund and it can be hard to find decent places that allow dogs for a reasonable price.  I believe there was a $40 fee for this Inn.3) Great location- walking distance to everything. 4) Free wifi! There were some things that could be improved as well...1) Breakfast.  YUCK.  For a ""bed and breakfast"" type place, the breakfast was dissapointing.  No healthy options... all they had were sausage biscuits, bagels, and some fresh fruit soaked in some kind of really sweet syrup or juice.  There is a good breakfast place nearby though (B. Matthews Eatery- go there!) Anyways, it could be improved a ton!2) Tiny rooms- not a huge deal, but we barely had room to walk around! ALSO- FYI- if you are traveling with a dog. Savannah beaches are NOT dog friendly! Even in the evenings!! Ridiculous.  Anyways... we learned the hard way.  All in all- great place to stay.  :)Spent 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. The staff was wonderful. The rooms were roomy and cozy. My only complaint is that there wasn't a refrigerator in the room, but as long as you have a cooler, you will be fine. Parking is limited, but they will provide an all day parking pass to a parking deck a block away. Was unexpectedly quiet, especially being near River/Bay Streets. Highly recommended!","Had a lovely visit w/ a friend for a girls weekend in Savannah.  The rooms were very nicely decorated but one of the lamps in our room didn't work.  We left a note and told the front desk and it was just gone the next day.  The cocktail hour is a nice touch and we had fun getting to know our fellow guests.The cons of the stay were the staff who were either super friendly and nice, or cold and apathetic.  I was locked out for a good 10 minutes one night because the woman on duty at the front desk took a break and didn't respond to the bell or my frantic knocking.  Another guest actually came down from her room to let me in.  When the hotel staffer finally showed up, I asked for her name and she refused to tell me and then replied, ""You'll find out in the morning."" w/ major attitude and went back behind the front desk staff only area.  I was furious.  The other con was the continental breakfast, which was worse than a Holiday Inn Express.We loved the location, the rooms were HUGE and gorgeous, we even had a Ghost Encounter w/ Charlie, their resident spook.  I would normally give only 1 or 2 stars for such horrible service, but most of the rest of the staff were nice.  They had 2 problem children that shouldn't be in the hospitality industry.Stayed here in April and loved it. One of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. We had a great time. The wine and cheese in the afternoon was a great touch. Breakfast was good, the layout was a bit congested, but it worked out. Great location, very close to everything. The staff was helpful. One of the desk staff went above and beyond when we had trouble with our TV. A great choice!The exceptional hospitality was so refreshing! Beautiful rooms, and we loved our stay.We stayed At this charming Inn during the Savannah Music Festival.  The service was great!  From the time we checked in till the time we checked out.  Everybody was very friendly and helpful.  We found the rooms very clean. We will be staying at this Inn next time we are in Savannah!i get to splurge every now and then and this is it for me. decent room prices for a splurge (not 400/night, but i felt like a high roller dropping 200/night here). charming rooms, 4poster bed with 2 seating areas, plasma tv. we had the breakfast there both mornings, evening cocktail reception, and chocolate turn-down service. the staff was exceptionally friendly with the exception of the night concierge whom was a real jerk-off. the place is beautiful and located within a 2 minute walk of the lively riverwalk area, and 5 minutes of any other cool, touristy spot (and local flavor) of savannah. best of all, they allowed dogs for only 35 bucks.Next time I stay in Savannah this is where I will stay.  The staff are amazing, the rooms are plush &amp; decorated in a romantic fashion, and  it's close to shopping &amp; Riverstreet..  My boyfriend &amp; I attended a cocktail hour in the evening with some of the other guests and were treated to a lovely breakfast in the morning.  I loved our bellhop Melvin.  He was an absolute delight!  Very informative too telling us all about the room &amp; cool places to go.  We enjoyed a night out on the town and when we returned chocolates on the pillows and the CD player playing romantic music!  I enjoyed my experience here.  My only problem would have to have been the parking situation...there is not much parking outside the door however, they do have a parking deck near by.  Our stay was definitely amazing and I will go back next time I'm in Savannah.Holy cow.  20 foot ceilings in our lovely, very comfortable 3rd floor room.  We were a bit amazed when we walked in. The personnel were all extremely friendly and capable.  Outstanding location, allowing a lot of entering and exiting, which was mandatory in the hellish heat of July.No pool, but a wine and cheese reception at 5:30 and a breakfast (nothing special, but complementary and appreciated).The Inn was nice and had much character. They did a nice job with the breakfast and cordials in the afternoon. Everything to my surprise tasted quite good. The employees were very nice and helpful. I really wanted to give a four star rating however I felt the rooms were dirty. We had a large group so we had three rooms. One on the first floor which was a pet room and two others on the second floor. All three rooms had bathtubs that not drain so you bath in a pool of water and the tubs had a lot of mildew. The floors appeared as if they had not been washed in some time. The first day we got there we had dropped water on the floor and I cleaned it up with a towel and the towel was black. Gross!  Then we noticed items left from the persons in the rooms before us. One room had a cork under the table the other had a sock on the floor.This was consistent in all three rooms. We had the pet room and was told that you would not get maid service unless you took the dog out of the room. We did this and put the please service sign on the door, we were we gone the morning and most of the afternoon but, no one serviced the room.  The next day we left the dog in the room with the privacy sign and when we returned there was a sign saying they could not service the room but they were leaving clean towels, etc, for us to use. However there was nothing left by the room. I am going to let the Inn know of this maybe it's just a need of meeting or change with their cleaning staff. Location was very good too. It would have almost been perfect if not for the dirtiness.",,,,"['signed', 'yelp', 'give', 'east', 'bay', 'inn', 'review', 'returned', 'hometown', 'find', 'hospitality', 'comfort', 'expect', 'well',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Best Western Plus Savannah Historic District,3.0,$$,46,"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was helpful and polite, with one exception. This is a tour bus stop so the breakfast room is packed and all of the newspapers are taken by this early crowd. The same breakfast is served daily; if you stay for an extended period of time this gets old.It's right in the middle of the city it's a nice small hotel the staff was extremely friendly the rooms are nice size well-kept it's a nice place to spend a night or two right in the middle of all the action parking lot is small and it's a $15 charge for parkingTheir mottos: Best Western Cares. NOT!The minute we entered the hotel, I start counting how much they cared:1. Customer Service, not friendly.2. Parking lot VERY DIRTY. Can't they even sweep the litters found under the cars?  I'm not talking about leaves!3. The towel holder in our bathroom, screws loose. When a maid put in new towels, neatly folded them like baskets, doesn't she know the towel holder MOVES &amp; CREEKS?4. We have shutters in our bedroom windows, and double wooden doors in our bathroom, Savannah style. I like that!  So, they care a little bit!Wi-Fi slow!  I should make it 2 stars, but wait until I update after we've had breakfast.UPDATE:  Breakfast not enough fruits to choose from.  They have fresh apples &amp; oranges.  The bathroom, I keep forgetting there's a small fridge under the bathroom counter, and I keep stabbing my toes there!  Ouch!Having never been to Savannah before I didn't really know what to expect. But I would compare this Best Western location to one we stayed at in   New Orleans. Which, because of the price point (which isn't cheap by any means but lower priced than many other hotels in the area) it attracts those that are in town to party it up. I didn't realize that Savannah had that same New Orleans vibe. That party and drink until you are falling down drunk, releaving yourself in public, barfing at the street corner and yelling at the top of your lungs kind of place.They give you a welcome letter that basically states it gets loud and rowdy late into the night and you just have to live with it. And we did experience just that kind of a night. I think the guys in the hotel room just above us were holding  WWE wrestling match in the room all night. I swear I thought the ceiling was going to give way and they were going to land on top of me any minute. So it is what it is, they tell you right up front what to expect (which is not much) when you stay there. Having said that I felt our room was clean and neat. The bathroom was large and spacious. The attendant in the breakfast area kept up with everyone and the area was super clean, food restocked and tables were cleared very fast.  We did take advantage of keeping our car in the hotel parking lot after we checked out until 4:00pm like the policy states that you can. We booked the white trolley bus tour at the front desk and they picked us up right out front. Spent the day touring Savannah and saw a totally different view of the area unlike our previous night's experience, which was nice.We recently stayed at Best Western Plus and were impressed. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room clean and spacious. My only complaint was being able to hear too much street noise as the pub crawlers walked by all night long. We had an end room, so that probably did not help. The beds were comfortable though and I really liked the nice bathrooms as well. Breakfast was more than just continental, offering hot items such as eggs and sausage and make your own waffles. I would definitely consider staying at Best Western Plus next time I am in Savannah.Upon  check in, this hotel appears clean and appealing.  The desk staff was nice and accommodating  but it spirals downhill after that.1. The room was clean except for small details like a hanger and a nail polish  cap under the bed.2.  Garbage  was all over the stairs leading up to the  room, cigarette  butts and dog droppings all in the  bushes.3. Loud outside all night and thin walls= NO SLEEP.4. Security was inside at 12 midnight when we walked by in the lobby in a chair NOT patrolling 5. 15.00 parking PER CARThe hotel is a nice, normal hotel. It's not super fancy, but the rooms are nice and very clean. The location is perfect. You can walk to everywhere you want to be.The highlight of our stay was the concierge, Mary. She told us everything we should see, where it was and the best game plan for seeing it all. We took a trolley tour and she had them pick us up right in front of the hotel. Without her recommendations, our trip probably wouldn't have been as nice.Don't go to the gas station across the street, just don't haha we went and the chocolate milk was expired and it was definitely an interesting environment.Don't let the ""plus"" tacked on at the end of the name fool you here...this place is a motel. While it wasn't all bad, there were a few things that really bugged me (not literally) about my stay here. So here we go.The Good: The staff I interacted with was very friendly and helpful. I called housekeeping twice, and both times they responded quickly and were very courteous about it. The guy at the front desk also seemed nice. The room was also very clean, so no complaints there. It's also in a great location, within walking distance of most things in the historic district of Savannah. This was awesome, as it saved a lot of hassle trying to track down parking spaces in a city setting, which is one of my least favorite things.The Bad: Speaking of parking, if you book here, be aware that they are going to charge you $15 A DAY to park in the private lot that Best Western owns and is exclusively marked for guests' use only. I could understand if it was a public parking deck or metered or something like that, but it wasn't. Never in my life have I heard of something so ridiculous. And the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. So let's move on. Also, if you book here, be prepared that it is going to be noisy. In fact, at check in, they pass out a little letter from the general manager, talking about how due to the hotel being on a ""party street"", they can't offer refunds if you are displeased with the noise level. Which, again, is pretty ridiculous. Welcome to Savannah...they'll give you a refund if your room is ""haunted"", but not if you don't like a bunch of noisy drunks creating a ruckus outside your room at 3 AM. I almost would have preferred loud drunks to what I ended up with...which was a room on the end beside the pool. As I mentioned before, this is a motel, as in it has no interior walkways and the doors open directly out onto the parking lot. This meant that from about lunchtime until dinner, I was treated to the constant, melodic screaming of children in the pool right outside my room. I don't know if the walls are just made out of paper, or if those particular children were just specially gifted in the lung department, but it was constant, and it was loud. Also, there is a gate that leads into the pool area which apparently has no sort of spring mechanism to keep it from slamming. So it was slammed, repeatedly, throughout the day. And when I say slammed, I mean like it's a good thing I don't suffer from some kind of PTSD, because every time it sounded like a rifle shot.So, in other words, forget being able to nap or relax in any way in your room on your vacation.The Ugly: That's really it. The rooms were actually decorated very nicely, so that's something at least. But you may have to specially request a shower curtain, for some baffling reason.Anyway, for the price point and the location, this is probably a good deal, as long as you are aware of the few caveats beforehand (which I wasn't, but now you are). I doubt I'll be returning.I spent several days at the Best Western Plus during my trip to Savannah. Overall I thought it was great. The location is awesome - it's right on Bay St on the western edge of the Historic District and a block from River St. It's a quick walk to City Market, River St, Lulu's Chocolate Bar, and City Hall. There are several trolley stops within a couple of blocks of the hotel as well. The staff is really nice and accommodating - some more than others but that's anywhere. They have a really nice breakfast with fresh waffles, eggs, sausage, pastries, breads, cereals, oatmeal, grits, fruit, and yogurt. Parking was tight but I never had trouble finding a spot. The hotel is older and the amenities aren't exactly top of the line - but it was fine for me. The pool is small and so is the deck around it. If 6-7 people are there it starts to feel cramped.  I know others have commented on the noise level - but I didn't notice anything overt. Our room was facing the river. The air conditioner struggled to keep the room cool - and at night we usually slept with just sheets because of that. None of these things had a significant impact on my stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Savannah.Stayed here on a quick trip to Savannah with my sister. The location of the hotel is decent. Pretty much walking distance to everything we wanted to see in town. But that's about all there is to this hotel. The complimentary breakfast is worth skipping unless you like cold eggs and hockey puck sausage. The shower water takes forever to get warm. Careful while exiting the shower, there's probably a pool of water on the floor. The room is ok. However I requested to have my sheets changed and they were replaced with sheets with three small yellow stains on them (gross!) The view from your room (if facing the water) is some weird industrial plant, so don't plan on a nice river view. I definitely don't recommend staying here if you're coming with children or looking for a peaceful trip. The other people staying here are noisy and not so friendly. One ""gentleman"" even urinated in the parking lot right in front of us. Pay the extra money and stay in one of the historic inns. We cancelled our last night here and are staying at the 17hundred90.Meh in between on Best Western.  I find it hard to believe there's no early check in at noon for the place.  I purchased my room on priceline for 2 nights because it was cheaper and because it was on Bay St in the historic district.  It was a room and all I really needed was a bed.  The bathrooms were more up to date than the bedrooms I felt like.  There was a fridge which was appreciated, although in the bathroom, a fitness center and a pool.  Staff was pleasant Cons: $15 for parking a night when you're parking by yourself, they only put one night one my parking pass when I was there for 2, doesn't fit in with the rest of Historic District and looks run down from the outside.  $15 for over priced for parking.Great location.  This was our first time in Savannah we were just driving through and had our dalmatian with us.  This was one of the only hotels we found.  The room was clean and breakfast had a good selection of food.  The downside is that it is a little loud since the street it is on is somewhat busy.  But that was only around the 1am time.  The staff was very friendly.  If you have a dog with you this is a great place.I stayed here recently while visiting Savannah and while the city is fantastic, this hotel could use some work. The location is good, although there are plenty of other hotels in the historic district that are a little bit closer to most of the action. That is, however, a minor gripe that doesn't really affect the 2* rating. The main issue is that the hotel itself feels somewhat run down: the decor in the rooms is pretty awful, the lighting is poor, and worst of all, there is virtually no soundproofing. I stayed on the third floor and could hear almost everything that happened on the street, in the parking lot, and obviously right outside the room. Every time housekeeping came by with a cart, it was like somebody was bowling right outside the room. Also, I was woken up after 1am each night by drunk people stumbling home to their rooms. It was so loud that it sounded like they were standing outside the room with the door open. This was incredibly annoying. I've never stayed anywhere with such poor insulation between the room and the outside world. On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and accommodating with regard to early check in and late check out. Overall, I wouldn't even consider staying here again, as there seem to be plenty of other hotels in the area. They may be a little more expensive (or maybe not), but it's definitely worth spending the little bit of extra money to stay somewhere else if you can afford to do so.The beds are awful. Like sleeping on a bag of lumpy bricks. The beds were not comfortable at all so we could not really sleep. If they put some money into updating their old lumpy mattresses this place could be better. Spent money and was disappointed!Everything was great about the place...UNTIL I left! And noticed that I was covered head to toe in BED BUG BITES!! Not cool. Now I have to make sure I didn't bring any home with me..after I go to the doctor. Can't believe I paid them to leave with a huge problem on my hands and red bites all over my body. And their response when I called to inform them of it, ""we'll look into it."" Thanks a lot, Best Western. :-(ALSO..my friend stayed in the room next door and suffered the same thing! These were not outdoor bugs, and the doctor confirmed that they were indeed bed bug bites.Terrible experience !  The staff was rude and put false charges on my account.  No manager available to speak to nor did he/she ever return my phone calls.  Lots of homeless people walking the street near this hotel asking for me and/or making noise late into the evening. Pool was dirty.  Will NEVER return.Had a horrible experience here.  The room was dirty and  there were  mosquitos and insect carcasses in the bathroom.  It was quite the necropolis.  The staff was unpleasant.   The area is also sketchy at night.  No security guards in the parking lot and I actually had to tell an unsavory character to buzz off after looking inside my car.We got this deal through groupon.  When we first arrived it took forever to check in.  Parking sucks!  We parked the car and some homeless lady came up to us saying she was hungry so we offered her our leftovers which she denied and asked for cash.We finally got to our room where we had no toilet paper and when we called the front desk they told us to go get it from them.  I'll give them a star because the room was tidy but the horrible customer service!!Stayed here for four nights over Christmas. We arrived at 1pm on Christmas and a room was ready. I requested a room on a high floor on the back side of the hotel, and we only got the high floor part. Luckily we had ear plugs as we knew in advance that noise could be an issue. Our room had 2 double beds, both were springy and small and not that comfy. The bathroom was large, clean, and well lighted. The entire room was clean and kept clean by housekeeping the entire stay. Our room was decorated in a style that matched the area and ours had exposed brick walls and ceiling beams, so that added to the feel. The breakfast in the morning isn't great (coffee, juice, sausage, ""eggs,"" toast, bagels, pastries) and ends at 9:30a, you're better off going to a nearby restaurant. Parking isn't a problem, we always found a spot day or night. It is in the historic district, but it's on the edge close to City Market. Overall the hotel is a great value.Not bad for a holiday weekend. It's not the nicest of the ones available, but it was also not haunted (good or bad, depending what you are looking for). It is still quite walkable to the downtown life, even to the riverfront. It was clean though a little older. I wasn't a fan of the closet like double doors for the bathroom, which offered very little privacy. The bathtub drain was very slow and even after maintenance was called, there wasn't a large improvement. The parking was tight, but there were adequate spaces. Saw the tow truck come and remove at least one vehicle so they're serious about displaying your hotel parking permit. The rooms in the back are still quite noisy when horse drawn carriage routes through the back alley. You can hear pretty much any voice walking by, and the walls are thin (bring ear plugs, or just make sure you have a fun night out so you're so exhausted you can sleep through it all). Never made it to the breakfast- seemed like the hours were quite limited 7-10am and the coffee in the room was fairly terrible (sorry wolfgang puck coffee pods aren't that great)","This hotel is in a great location so you can really walk to everywhere. The rooms are not large but are clean and pleasant. They charge an additional $15 a day for parking. Breakfast was fine and all the staff were helpful and friendly - good value for the price.During my stay at this hotel I saw with my own eyes a bed bug! Please do not stay at this hotel, it has bed bugs, despite what the hotel manager will tell you! Also, our room was extremely dirty when we got there. Thankfully, we were only staying one night, and as soon as I saw the bed bug we left. I had to throw away my suitcases and get my clothes professionally cleaned.Way better than I expected. AMAZING location, super easy for walking. A good amount of parking. The room was pretty large, had a wonderful bathroom, and was still a bit cute and fit with the historic Savannah area. Also there was a fridge, breakfast, and the pet fees weren't too hefty. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean and updated a bit. Great hotel for the price, especially around a busy July 4th.Positives-Friendly, helpful front desk-Mini fridge in room-Complimentary breakfast (although I never woke up in time - ends at 10am)-Location (we were able to walk everywhere)-Free wi-fi-Best price we could find for location ($130/night for Friday/Saturday)Negatives-NOISY (my room was on the back side/facing River St, so maybe the front is better)-Entire fitness center was out of order-Could have been cleaner (there was still an empty Bud Light bottle in the room when we arrived)-$10/day parking (although, I'll take that charge for the location since we never had to move the car)Overall, my experience was fine here. We didn't spend a great deal of time in the room, nor did we want to break the bank, so I felt this place served its purpose.This place was great! Stayed here this past weekend as part of my 24-hour trip to Savannah, GA. The location was great, near city market, and right smack in between congress and river street - everything was in walking distance so we didn't have to use our car once! The room was clean, the beds comfortable and there was free coffee, wifi and a continental breakfast! Definitely worth the $115 we paid - also the parking was cheaper than anywhere else we could find in the area. I have to say that the best part of this hotel is the STAFF. Everyone was so wonderful and friendly, going out of their way to help make sure we had a blast. Kyle M. was such a great, funny host - we had never been to Savannah before so he made sure we had all the information we needed, helped us schedule the trolley tour (and you get a discount!) and gave us information on where the best nightlife/pub crawls are along with the best coffee shop/candy shops in the area. Kudos to Kyle, you made our weekend awesome! Thanks!!!The only downside was how noisy it was at night but then again, it was the weekend before halloween and there were a TON of people out - I was up until about 4am with how loud the street noise. That's the only reason this review gets 4 stars instead of 5.We stayed in a first floor room facing Bay Street for 3 nights. The free internet, continental breakfast and location are all great - but it was SO noisy. I see this (ie: noisiness) is a frequent complaint in reviews for this hotel. Let me extrapolate... every morning around 2-3 AM - it was as if we were on the set of Fast and the Furious - engines being gunned, tires squealing... all that was missing was Vin Diesel and Paul Walker (and then maybe it would've been worth it!).Where to begin.....well, the $12 a day parking fee (soon to be $15) that we weren't made aware of until we got home and checked our bank account. Paper thin walls, lots of noise from the people on either side of us. Room wasn't properly cleaned, there were used tissues under the bathroom countertop visible as soon as we walked into the room. Morning breakfast was dominated by a bus load of students on a tour, no room to sit. We won't be back. It is true...you get what you pay for. We were on a romantic weekend getaway, this experience didn't help.Great place, great location near city market, good price, friendly helpful staff, cleanI stayed here for four nights while in Savannah over Christmas of 2011. FIrst, I'll talk about the bright points. The hotel included a complimentary continental breakfast. The bathroom was awesome and the location could not be beat. However, despite an the excellent bathroom, the room was very dated (circa 1987). It just looked cheap (as the bathroom looked expensive).The staff was friendly but inflexible. We requested a standard room unaware that it would include 2 beds. Myself and my partner do not need two beds, but they told us that a change was non-negotiable. The hotel has not interior stairs which leaves your room vulnerable to a bugs (even at Christmas!). They charged $10 per day for parking which seems odd given that the hotel is designed like a traditional motel (no interior walls, low rise, surrounded by a parking lot). Motels always have free parking (motel = ""motor hotel""). I am of the opinion that you shouldn't charge for parking if you don't have interior hallways. I don't like the moniker Best Western ""Plus"" as there were more minuses than pluses. It wasn't a bad experience, but I didn't feel like I got a premium quality stay.I was expecting a cheap beat up motel. That was not the case at all with this place. The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom was great as well. All in all the price was right and the place was nice. We also got our Shih Tzu with us, he was able to stay in the room for only $20 (per stay) unlike the Marriott which charges $70 for my little tiny pooch to come along!Free wi-fi and coffee in the room. Oh and they also have breakfast (I didn't wake up for it)NOTE: If you're looking for a place with a big ""Promenade"" on the front, you may be confused at first. This is actually a Best Western, so look for that and you're golden. The word ""Promenade"" is on a mini wall at the Southwest corner of the parking lot.That said, this is a very nice, clean, and friendly place to stay if you're in Savannah's Historic District. I can't say I'm a fan of the price range, but then again it's in the middle of everything and right near the City Market area.Be warned though - the walls between rooms are VERY thin and not at all soundproof. You can hear low-key conversations, let alone yelling (and if you're unfortunate as I was, loud, bad sex). I had to call the front desk numerous times to get the people next door to quiet the hell down at 2 in the morning. At least the receptionist was sweet and prompt about it. So keep that in mind if you don't want people to overhear your conversations (or sex).It's a bit of a walk if you want to visit the South and Eastern parts of the city like Forsyth Park, but there's a nice walk along River Street just a hop North from the hotel where you can find a bunch of neat (though tourist-focused) shops. I wouldn't walk around the city at night though...many of the streets are dark and kinda creepy, and very few people are out. I'd be extra careful, just in case.Back on topic: Overall I'd say the staff certainly made a good impression. I'd recommend the place to someone who doesn't mind the price. And thin walls. :pOh, and they get extra points because you can keep your car in the parking lot until 5pm on the day you check out, in case you want to do any last minute sightseeing.Service: 9Condition: 9 (best under $100.00 in Savannah)Atmosphere: 8 (easy walk to river st. and ellis sq.)Value: 9I wish there was a way to place 0 stars for this hotel. Rooms smell like wet dog and moved to another room, same smell and not very clean. Beds are old and disgusting. This is not worthy for the plus hotel they advertise. I've never paid for parking at a BW. The price was the same as the Westin that is a 5 star resort hotel I had to cancel the rest of my stay and move to the Westin. Staff acted like they didn't care but, at least the manager comped the room and followed up by email. Just don't stay here....Yelp find!!!Erica R. and I were in Florida and at the last minute we decided we wanted to stay the night in Savannah instead of driving all day to North Carolina. I went on yelp and found this little beauty. Booked it on the spot. The Good:-great price-great location, right in the historic district near the river front. -easy to find-newly remodeled rooms with flat screen tv and comfortable beds-nice big bathroom- friendly staff... got to love that southern hospitality!-very good contiental breakfastThe Bad:-noisy -small hotel rooms (not really a bad nor a good thing)-big spider on my pillow (not a fan of spiders!)Overall, I would stay here again if ever in Savannah, Georgia!Excellent customer  service ! Good price most of all Pet Friendly!This is a very nice hotel!! I am impressed with the service and the hospitality of this place. It also is just minutes walking to River Street!! I definitely recommend this hotel!!We picked this place from a billboard on I-75. We lucked out. The price was right, the bed was king-sized, the tv a flat-panel 30"". The renovations must be finished because we saw no trace of that. The room was typical size, but the bathroom was nice and roomy, with a huge mirror, marble on the floor and tub wall, and fancy maroon wallpaper; the overall effect looked '5-star', even if it is structurally a motel. Nice fluffy white towels and lots of 'em. I agree about the ugly beige fake brick walls in the bedroom, but the lamps were way cool, with on-off rocker switches and a grounded outlet on the base. I didn't have to search for an outlet to plug in my laptop or phone charger, usually the case in other motels.The Promenade is in the northwest corner of town, a short walk from the River Street / Bay Avenue attractions. The wi-fi was a little slow but it worked better than my DSL at home, go figure. Very friendly, helpful staff. Unlike a previous reviewer, we were not charged to park our car, but given a notice that a fee would be charged for more than one car per room. I would stay at The Promenade again. Savannah itself is a bit seedier in general that I would have thought. Granted, it is a very old city, so most of the buildings in town are not new. Some are renovated, some not. In the River Street area there were several men who appeared to be homeless, just sitting around quietly. You could tell they had not bathed, had a haircut, changed clothes nor had regular meals in a while. That kind of thing is unfortunate for those people, and never makes a city 'inviting', but then what city doesn't have that nowadays, sadly.The bottom of the bunch... they try their best but it's an old 'open balcony' style motel with updated furnishings. Someone drops something in one room and it's felt and heard in EVERY adjoining room. And the doors to the room leak air allowing small 'flat-winged' flying insect to get in... and annoyingly  fly around all the lamps. But the price is slightly lower than all of the much newer hotels nearby. and guaranteed they will be fill- up, so if you thought you'd want to stay here call beforehand.They're currently renovating, which means rates are cheaper, the outside is uglier, and between about 10am and 5pm there's some construction noise. For the actual room, it was not an issue.One thing that really impressed me was how damn soft the towels were. Maybe i stayed in Motel 6 too much in my road tripping days, but Promenade's towels were lovely and very white and soft.My room was clean, the beds were soft but not saggy, the pillows were fluffy, and housekeeping respected my 'Do Not Disturb' tag. The only weird thing was the plastic fake brick on one of the walls in the room, i'm not sure why they wasted money on it because it looked pretty bad. There's free wi-fi, but it's slow.Supposedly there's also a free hot breakfast buffet, but due to construction they were offering a cold brown-bag breakfast that contained a muffin, a little tub of yogurt, and an apple. This was especially unappetizing, as the bags were not refrigerated, so by 9am the yogurt was probably pretty nasty.The yogurt knocks a quarter star off, the fake brick is another quarter star deduction, and the remaining half star deduction is for the fact that when i woke up at 7:something each morning, i had to leave the faucet in the tub running for 10 minutes before the water got remotely hot. It was especially uncool the morning i overslept.I was surprised by the quality of this hotel. From the outside it has the look of the old motor inns that dot the highways but the room was as well appointed as the higher quality brands that surround it. The rate was a remarkable bargain compared to surrounding hotels (well under $100 even with the additional $10 fee for parking) and the location in Savannah's historic district was stellar with easy access to a welth of great places to eat.A NOTE TO BEST WESTERN: It's time to create a premium brand. This is twice that I have been surprised by the quality of one of your properties. I was hesitant to drive into the parking lot because I expected the old Best Western but found instead a new product. Holiday Inn Express? W by Westin? You are a new brand. Time to reflect it.","Awful, we could not sleep because of several drunk guests.  Not the friendly kind of drinking, but the angry aggressive kind.  The hotel says it has security but they must have called in sick that night because there were several arguments in the parking lot, and in the rooms. It was the most disturbing experience.  In the morning I did see that the room came with a white noise machine, so apparently this happens often, but we should have been told to use it.  Don't waste your money there are much better places to stay. Also, the room smelled like mold.Somewhat bleak but very well located, clean and cheapwell I think I got a good price....maybe i didn't....who knows....i thought i did...that's what matters!!!lovely place, bland exterior but cozy inside with fake plants and typical hotel furnishing.  nicely organized nonetheless and really quite pleasant lobby.the rooms too are very pleasant and clean and amenities great. shit did I forget to leave a tip. I just remember now.....i am so ashamed!!! but that's what happen when you had a sleepless night before getting up at 5am to catch bus to airport....i couldn't even remember my mom's name....at that time...anyway, very nice people. lovely place. you should go there!!I enjoyed my experience at the Promenade, except I thought it was weird that they charged us extra to park our car there while we were paying to stay in a room. I THINK THAT IS LAME! Otherwise, its reasonablly priced, especially for the location. Its just around the corner from W. River St, and near City Market. One of our nightly walks consisted of crusing down to Wet Willies, getting a Call a Cab to go and then sitting on a bench on the waterfront, drinking and listening to bluegrass street performers.   Back to the hotel. The rooms are very clean and well decorated, it was recently renovated.  We had a giant king size bed with lots of pillows and a big flat screen tv. Also the bathrooms are very nice, with alot of counter space and big mirrors.  I appreciated the refrigerator in the room so we could have cold water.  We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the pool was fun to jump in after a morning walk around downtown Savannah. We walked to all the different squares, and admired the trees and beautiful houses. Savannah is so pretty. There is alot to explore.yes there is still construction going on, and when we checked in and went up to our room they were ripping the molding off the windows, so we went back down and they sent us up to another room so we get there and someone was working in there! tired, after our trip down we kind of kicked the guy out. The hotel is nice and their renovations are coming along well. this hotel is located right by the other 4-5 star hotels in town and is about a 2-3 minute walk to the river front which really comes in handy if you've been hitting up all the bars there. you can pretty much walk all of the historic district from this hotel and we didn't use our car the whole time besides to go over to Tybee Island the concierge was more than helpful and such a sweet sweet southern lady! ( YAY Mrs. Mary!!!), and they have a computer in the lobby as well for people without computer access who need to look up directions. This hotel is great for it location to river street as well as the historic district.Horrible motel.  Housekeeping was the worst!  ""making the bed"" consisted of throwing the bedspred up.. not straightening it or really making the bed.  Towels were not replenished. One day they picked up the towels off the floor and rolled them back up and put them in the bathroom like they were new but they were damp and wrinkled from our morning showers.  Another day there were no towels at all in the room!.. When we called down to the desk to find out why they just said ""oh, we're doing laundry.. we'll get some to you later"".  Front desk also thought it was a riduculous request that we wanted an ice bucket liner when they threw the old one out.  Customer service was very lacking and the worst housekeeping I've ever seen.  The only nice thing about the place is the location.. and they new-er furniture.  I don't even mind the exterior doors (although they don't really point that out on their site).  The place has potential but it is run so poorly it's ridiculous.  There are plenty of other hotels (and motels) in the same area (same block even) that are much better from the looks of them.  I have also stayed at the Courtyard in that same area.. it was a million times better!",,,"['enjoyed', 'staff', 'helpful', 'polite', 'exception', 'tour', 'bus', 'stop', 'breakfast', 'room', 'packed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-savannah-historic-district-savannah,Embassy Suites Savannah Historic District,4.5,$$$,41,"All I can say is WOW!  This is one of the nicest hotels I have had the pleasure of staying with.  So many plus points here.  The hotel is beautiful and seems very new.  The staff is super nice, everyone welcomes you and works hard to make sure you are happy.  Value - our stay was $189 a night and well worth every penny.  As many have reviewed there are two great extras for the value - breakfast buffet is awesome with the eggs made to order a huge win and the daily happy hour from 5:30-7:30 includes free beer, wine and well drinks.  The sangria was excellent.  Also included in the happy hour was snacks which included cheese &amp; crackers, multiple chips and dips and fresh veggies.  Amenities at the hotel were also top notch from the outdoor heated pool, excellent gym equipment and a nice outdoor gas powered fire pit.  Free on-site parking garage is also a huge plus and then there's the location, on the western side of the historic district you are now more than a 20 minute walk from all the restaurants, clubs and shops.  The visitor center is a couple blocks away as well as all the trolley tours which you can get picked up right at the hotel and dropped off at the end.  Concierge was very helpful, booked trolley tour right at the front desk and answered all my questions.  The front desk staff knew our names and greeted me, my wife and son every time we walked past.  So friendly and professional.  I feel we got a tremendous value for our 3 night stay and we will be back again, hopefully soon!!Embassy suites Savannah historical districtThis Embassy suites was a friendly place to stay in this friendly city. The people at the front desk were so nice. We started out in room 544, but left the next morning because of the noisy air compressor on the roof above our room. Adeina was so helpful in getting us moved to a fabulous room, 337, very quiet and the biggest living room I've ever seen in a hotel suite.In the course of moving from one room to another, we left behind a cushion we had brought from home. It took four calls to the front desk to try to locate it, but Ginny was the one who finally solve the problem.When it came time to check out, I chatted with Ro, who is so nice, and Adeina again. I told I told them my favorite traveling pants had also gone missing in the move. (Adeina called me a few hours later to tell me that my pants had been found and that the hotel would mail them to my house. She made my day!)As we packed up the car in front of the hotel, Blue, the valet, came out to chat with us. What a nice guy!The hotel suite was lovely. In addition to the large living room, there was also a very large bathroom, with the toilet in the separate alcove. The shower has fabulous water pressure.Shower safety tip: once you soap up, the tub gets super slippery, so put a hand towel on the floor of the tub after you get wet but before you pick up the soap. The towel remains in place and provides traction.Happy Hour in the lobby included veggies, homemade-tasting potato chips and an open bar. After a big day of sightseeing, it was nice to go downstairs for a drink and a snack and not have to go out to dinner. For those tired travelers who want dinner, there's a French restaurant off the lobby.It's also worth mentioning that this hotel is well located. We were able to walk everywhere from the hotels -- Oglethorpe square to start our architectural walking tour with Jonathan Stalcup, the Owens-Thomas house, the Jepson Center, Leopold's Ice Cream on Braughten Street, the riverfront, Telfair academy, and the Collins Quarter Restaurant on Bull Street and Bella Napoli Italian Bistro across from Oglethorpe Square.The location of the hotel is right on the edge of the historic district, but still conveniently located. The service was very friendly, both at check-in and at the bar/restaurant. The room was clean and roomy enough. The WiFi also worked well.LOVED this ES. Seriously gorgeous and has a parking garage as well. Close to Riverwalk, downtown and the freeway. While we were just passing through, I could picture staying here for a girls weekend or little family getaway. It's a great value - lots of space for everyone, breakfast (pretty good - omelets to order, etc) and service was wonderful.If you're looking for a suite with a little more room to spread out then you can definitely do worse than this place. First, the location. While it says 'Historic District', please note that this place is at the very outer edge of the historic district. You can still walk to most destinations and the extra distance and additional calories burned may be a good thing when in Savannah. The room was clean and quiet and had everything you'd expect for a hotel chain. The free breakfast was better than average, but the free drinks/snacks in the evening were a bit disappointing. Oh and the floor in the food area was ALWAYS STICKY.Great hotel in an even better location. The staff was friendly and the property was nice.We arrived at the hotel around midday, where we were efficiently checked in by Wendy, who also proved to be most helpful and courteous throughout our stay. The room itself is as advertised, with a small but adequate fridge and microwave oven.  Our room was freshly decorated, clean and tidy. My only slight gripe was the somewhat noisy a/c fan. Fortunately the bathroom fan could be switched on/off independently from the light.  The weekday manager's nightly special is a nice touch and safety deposit boxes are available at reception. The hotel itself is situated on the edge of town but within easy walking distance of all the main touristy areas and restaurants (The Grey is just round the corner). The Old Savannah tour bus also stops at the hotel which makes it much easier to get around if you are feeling lazy or its raining cats and dogs. I would most definitely stay here again.I am Embassy Suites loyal and whenever I get the chance to visit one of their hotels, I jump at it.  I knew that this location would be nice, based on how new it was.  I can honestly say that this was the nicest Embassy Suites that I have ever been to.The sprawling lobby is very welcoming.  The valet and check in staff were extremely friendly and they allowed me to check in hours before the normal check in time.  Our room was pretty standard for an ES room.The happy hour was fabulous (5:30 - 7:30).  Free beer, wine, liquor, and snacks.  Normally the snacks consist of gold fish or chips and salsa.  This location had nachos with chili cheese and even some cole slaw to feast on.  There was a roaring fire in the lobby, which was nice to relax near.The breakfast was great, as well, with all of the normal breakfast offerings.  This hotel was a bit more expensive than some of the other local chain hotels, but it was worth every penny!This Embassy is one of the newest and by far a superior choice when staying in Savannah. Here is a breakdown of the overall quality of this stunning property.Service: Staff is superb! Becki in the bar is one of the most friendly and attentive bartenders I have ever experienced. The front desk staff is super efficient and all pitch in to help out.Housekeeping/Cleanliness- fresh, clean, spotless. Staff is friendly and attentive the upmost detail.Internet: Great speedBreakfast: made to order/chef prepared omelette, sliced fruits, fresh Danish.Thank you for the amazing time!Managers reception had some decent selections on snacks. Beer on tap was Dos Equis Amber or Miller Lite. They had some sangria but it was a little weak. The breakfast was great, good omelet, and plenty of options. Coffee was slightly weak. Kids running around unsupervised is my biggest pet peeve but that's something the hotel can't handle. Room was spacious and clean. Comfortable bed. Directv in the room. Soap was super moisturizing. Not the biggest fan of the decor but it's standard for all Savannah hotels. Parking was $15 but super easy and convenient. Location in relation to downtown wasn't bad. Our longest walk was 15mins to Rocks off the Bohemian. Tl;dr: would recommend.I had an unfortunate experience at an Embassy Suites in Nashville Tennessee 1 year ago (January 2015).   I was traveling for 30 days on business.  The bottom line is the room was very dirty, and moldy, it was bad.  They tried 2 more rooms, more of the same, so I left after 5 days of my 30 day stay and found a clean hotel.  For the inconvenience, I was sent a Be My Guest certificate for one complimentary stay at an Embassy Suites.  Fast forward to today, January 2016 (1 year later) I wanted to use the Be My Guest Certificate, not for myself but for my close friends, who are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary.  We all live in Tampa, but they wanted to go to Savannah Georgia (the Oglethorpe location).  I offered them the Be My Guest certificate for one night, and they were going to PAY for the second night.  Unfortunately, after I called the hotel in Savannah, I called the central reservation number, I called the corporate office, I was transferred over 4 times, told several times that the person I was speaking to was unfamiliar with a Be My Guest certificate and was finally told the ONLY person that can use the certificate is me.  I found this ridiculous. I called customer service, I was told the same thing.  I made as many calls as I possibly could, and I was told by Necholle Brown in corporate ""You accepted the certificate!""  I am just confused as to why I could not give this to my friends, who were going to also pay for an additional night.  I talked to Jennifer Reeves at the Savannah Embassy Suites, she was so kind, trying everything to make this work for us, but she was also told no by her manager Wendy.   Unfortunately, this has created a second negative experience.  I have only had 2 experiences with Embassy Suites, but they will be my last.  I do not want any more free night certificates or tokens of any kind, since my situation clearly shows that customer service in not a priority.  I am writing this so that maybe it will inspire Embassy Suites to put the customer back on top.    It seems penny wise, and pound foolish from a business perspective.A terrific, albeit pricey 4 night stay in a comfortable suite that's walking distance to everything in the historic district.  I was a little surprised to have to pay extra for parking considering I had already paid a very hefty price for the room.  The pillows leave a lot to be desired - too soft and just flatten to a pancake, otherwise, the bed is fairly comfortable, even for someone who is used to an adjustable sleep number bed.The manager's reception is a refreshing welcome to the hotel each late afternoon/early evening, drinks on the house and light snacks to munch on while chatting with the staff, management, family or simply watching some football at the bar.  The staff is friendly but may sometimes be a little overzealous when it comes time to clear half empty glasses from a table.  More than once I looked up to watch the game to later look down and find my beverage had been cleared from the table without my knowing it.The ""made to order"" breakfast is simply a buffet with an option to ask the cooks to make specific omelettes or eggs done a specific way.  Get there either very early or sometime after 9:30 AM because from 8ish to 9:30ish it's almost impossible to find a place to sit down and eat.Overall, a nice stay.We had a great experience here. Pros: nice large suitesComplimentary breakfast barComplimentary happy hour! And light snacksNice and quietCons: hotel hallway and musty smellTrash cans in parking deck had huge trail of ants Breakfast was kinda cold Can't walk to historic downtown.This hotel was amazing!  The breakfast was great, the evening reception included all drinks and yummy hoes-d'ouerves.  The room service was awesome, the staff was friendly, and the concierge was very information for our first trip to Georgia.  I will stay here again for sure.  And shout out to the amazing wait staff and bartender.By far 5 stars! I've stayed in a lot of hotels and this was by far the best. Registration was seamless, the room was excellent. First hotel stay where I wasn't awakened at 2am by slamming doors or people giggling in the hall. Complementary breakfast was great and had a wide variety, happy hour with complementary beer, wine and light snacks. Parking was a bit much $15 per day, but in a downtown location you can almost expect it. A+This hotel deserves 4.5 stars. The only things missing are safes in the room, along with being one block away from MLK Blvd. In spite of those two items, this is unlike any Embassy Suites I've ever seen--it's a first-class hotel barely in a less-than-desirable neighborhood. Having said that, we didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable walking to/from our hotel, even after dark.The suites are large, newly appointed, and clean. There are two large-screen (48""?) HDTV's in each suite. The bedding is very comfortable.Free breakfast is included in the price of the room, and it includes just about anything you could want. Free self-parking is about 25' from the hotel, with limited access by room card. In short, you get a lot for your money at this hotel.We picked this hotel due to its location relative to the Savannah historic district and due to the fact that it was an Embassy Suites. When I used to travel on business - I frequently stayed at Embassy Suites and always found them to be exceptionally nice hotels.  This hotel is relatively new, very clean, very quiet and very well maintained.  The complimentary breakfast at an Embassy Suites is not only hot but includes eggs and omelets cooked to order, bacon, sausage, pastries, oatmeal and cereal and selection of juices.  And there's an evening reception (5:30 - 7:30) that includes complimentary beer and wine with a selection of light appetizers.The hotel is about  1/2 mile from the historic River Street district and you can easily walk from River St to the hotel in 15-20 minutes.  The City of Savannah also runs a free shuttle (there is a boarding stop in the transit center across from the hotel and another at the visitor's center which is only a block away). The only downside to the shuttle is that it only runs until 9:00 - so if you want to have dinner down by the River District - you may need to walk back.This was the worse experience at a hotel one could ever have. It has taken me over a week since we've left to type this review because I was so upset. Upon checking in, Jessie was superb! Thereafter, just awful. We're not familiar with the area so you depend on the staff for directions to venues and restaurants. When asked where a restaurant was, the response was, over there down the street. Wait a minute, what? Then we asked how to get to Savannah Riverboat? The reply, across the street at the Dot. What is a Dot?? At this point, my expectations of this hotel hit rock bottom. We decided to drive. Savannah Riverboat made me feel a whole lot better. I was extremely satisfied with them!! We get back to the hotel to rest a bit, but then became hungry so we called room service. It was 10:50pm. The reply, room service is close. On their menu, it says close at 11pm. It was 10:50pm. So they close before 11pm. So now, I can't wait to check out!! They tried to apologize, but the damage was already done!! Never again Embassy!!Clean, close to City Market (about a 5-10 minute walk). Pricey but we had points to cover the entire price. The managers reception was awesome, the breakfast was amazing, they let us do a late check out since it was our anniversary.  I have no regrets staying here....and would stay again for a special occasion!Very friendly staff and clean rooms.  It was my husband's  birthday and they went out of their way make sure that his stay was special!","Overall, this was a good place for us, tucked away from the hustle of the city, which is great with a toddler.  The walls were probably nice and thick, too, as there were other kids staying on our floor and we only saw (and heard) them in the hallways and not from our room.  That said, you really gotta work hard to earn those stars, people...3 stars for: good for kids and family, quiet area, friendly and helpful front desk staff.Not 5 stars because: not a ""short walk"" from the main Savannah Historic District.  You really are on the outskirts.  I'm sure in a few years this neighborhood will provide more for the traveler, as there was a lot of construction going on nearby.Really NOT 5 stars because: the restaurant ""opened"" for the evening at 5pm.  Meaning, you could order from the menu at that time.  Expect, however, to wait up to 45 minutes for the cook to actually cook your food.  It was difficult to find wait staff in their restaurant.  One day we inquired about the lunch hours for the restaurant and were told ""the gas ovens are being worked on right now so there's no lunch today.""  Um... okay.  No sign, no letting guests know, nothing?  We didn't mind heading out for our meals and greatly appreciated daily breakfast, but they shouldn't have the only restaurant in the hotel closed (nevermind cooking later than published dinner hours) without notice.  This was the biggest thing for us.Super nice rooms and common areas.  Close to everything.  Parking is very close, so self-park is not a problem.  The room is beautiful.  Had a few problems with tv and shower rod on checkin, but fixed immediately.  Sometimes slow to answer the phone at the desk, but no matter.  Concierge is very informative.  Totally recommend this place.Breakfast as advertised all week long for us.  No issues.Firstly, the breakfast sucked. They were out of ham for omelets, sugar, ketchup, and orange juice. The breakfast is free, but there is a reason. They said they were waiting on the truck to arrive. The chef personally told us he didn't know how to make oatmeal (thick as a brick). My omelet was so greasy that after one bite, I couldn't eat it. I swear it must have been made with margarine or something because I have never had that taste. Rooms were very clean. There is an extensive room service menu. There is a downstairs bar and restaurant (get a free drink from 4-5pm for happy hour). Location was right on the border of ghetto and Savannah. It is a hard hotel to find for sure (had to use a GPS every time). Be wary of walking around outside at night. Bed is not a foam mattress, so not awesome. It is very clean just not the best bed. Because of the location, we would not come back.This review sums up 3 or more stays at this hotel.  First, the hotel just opened in early 2014 I believe, so the common areas are a modern design with open large entrances, a spacious bar and nice leather seating areas.  Second, the pool area, while I did not use it, I did make a close examination and it is well executed in courtyard mode on the ground floor.  Also stationed around the corner from the pool is a cozy open raised fire-pit which takes the chill off those cozy days and nights when perhaps you want to be outside and read a book or just relax and absorb the warmth on your feet.  Third, the rooms are a well designed suite configuration with a small bar area, built in college-style fridge, sink and storage.   The small fridge seems to be one of the newer frost-free models which means no caked ice from the prior occupant but the downside is these did not seem to chill as well as I'm accustom to.  I like my beverages COLD and I'd say these were chilled.  The rooms I've hit also have a large desk and comfortable couch separated from the bedroom areas with doors that block the noise and light if the kids perhaps want to stay up while you crash.  Your configuration may vary.  The bathroom is also separated from the bedroom and seating areas by SOLID doors, so no issues there.  The bathrooms have twin sinks, and a walk-in roomie glass-walled shower.  The tidiness level is spotless. As for the included accommodations, the wi-fi worked well, no issues were noted on any trip with pickup or speeds.  The included HOT breakfast has been awesome almost every time.  Full service omelets if you like or self-serve eggs, bacon, ham, oatmeal, flaky biscuits, fresh melon or seasonal fruits, bagels, cereals, gravy, milk, OJ, beverages and fresh hot brewed coffee. Easily, THIS is one of the BEST hot breakfast meals I've ever had included with the room fee.  My guess, if you buy this locally, a breakfast of this caliber will easily set you back $15 per person so that helps when traveling with families!  The only breakfast issue I've ever had, which was in September, and is summed up as a matter of bacon preference - wiggly or crispy?   One morning ALL the bacon was ""uber limpy"" and there was not a crispy piece to be found anywhere.  But to the staff's credit, they realized that no one was actually taking the bacon and replaced the entire tray promptly with another pan with much better selections!  The wait staff has always been prompt to clear the used plates and deliver the special order omelets.  My suggestion would be to place the staff tip jar in a more visible location rather than way over in the bar area because there it is missed more often than it should based on the great services. There is also a multi-level parking deck adjacent to the hotel so you do not have to fight the street parking.  The charge is $15 / day which is not out of line compared to comparable and larger metro areas.  Overall, this is my favorite hotel to stay at in Savannah if you want a bit quieter location and do want to be caught up in the more touristy riverfront crowds.   However, it is a quick cab ride or not an impossible walk (plot it beforehand) to reach the riverfront area or the main downdown.  This is also an ideal hotel to stay in when delivering studens to SCAD as it is close to campus with several of the major lower-classmen dorms only a couple of blocks away.  The room pricing is high-moderate depending on how much you value and use the included amenities, especially that awesome breakfast!  Overall 4.5 with the benefit of the doubt for the excellent staffing. Cheers.950 bucks for 5 days.  With that you get free breakfast.  This is not some lame breakfast.  You have your choice of 30 items, coffee, fruit, soda and juice.  ALL FRESHLY COOKED.  If that is not enough for you , they will make you an omelet...Whatever you want.  All you have to do is ask.  Every night from 5 to 7    FREE drinks at the bar.  On top of all this it is clean, fancy, the people that work there are OVER THE TOP NICE AND PROFESSIONAL.  Who ever manages this place needs a raise and bonus.  I am still here right now, leaving Tuesday.  I wish I was staying for 2 weeks.  What a great place.My Family and I enjoyed 3 wonderful nights at the Embassy Suites,Our home away from home!!!I'm glad we stayed here.It was quiet; being a few blocks away from Bay Street was well worth being able to sleep past 6AM, which is when the big trucks start rumbling to and from the docks. We were still close enough to everything that we walked exclusively, though our legs did get a little sore from the exercise.The room was comfortable. The bed was fantastic and the second room useful as my husband likes to wake earlier, whereas I'd prefer to sleep in a little.It was clean. No odors, nothing old or dated. The little details, including the upscale furniture and granite counter-tops, made me feel like I was truly on vacation.  Even the shampoo and conditioner were great, and I bring my own because I'm picky.The breakfast was nice, but slightly limiting as a vegetarian. My only source of protein was eggs, and while cooked-to-order eggs and omelettes is really nice, I got sick of eggs after a few days. Other than eggs, it was fried potatoes, biscuits, and a plethora of other starches. I'd have been over-the-moon if they had anything veggie-specific. Even just a frozen veggie-sausage pattie that they threw on the griddle for me instead of an egg.The evening reception was nice, even though we only hit it up once. All-you-can-drink well drinks, plus pretzels, vegetables, tortilla chips and dips. Not a bad way to spend a few hours. My husband and I sat on the couches and read, and the manager (Justin, I believe), was unbelievably attentive. He swung past asking if we wanted more drinks, and after that he automatically brought us new drinks as we finished ours.The pool was clean, but small. No swimming laps, or even really swimming at all. It was a nice place to sit outside and read, though. A hot-tub would have been dynamite, especially after our sore legs from hours of walking, but you can't get everything you want.After walking around and seeing countless other hotels and inns, I'm very happy with the Embassy Suites and would stay here again in a heartbeat if ever I find myself back in Savannah.Great suits for families. Clean and plenty of room.  Bfest was hit and offered more than most.  Good access to downtown. About a mile to middle if historic area.  But here is why they get five stars.  When we had the do not disturb sign hung on the door they put clean towels on the door.  Whoever thought of that needs a raise.I gave this place only two stars for a variety of reasons.  First, the location is deceiving.   It's on the fringe of downtown.  It borders the projects which might not be comfortable for everyone.   Second, they seemed more interested in keeping riff-raff out than keeping customers in.  We have 3 kids and we needed a roll away bed for one of our kids.  They apparently don't have those.  REALLY!!!  Every other hotel we've been to has had rollaway beds.  Its my opinion they're afraid of people packing mass amounts of people in their rooms.  Third, they only had one valet who also did room deliveries,  so you never could get your car when you needed it.The positives include a really nice gym and an overall clean facility.This is a beaituful hotel. Good location. Quiet and comfortable. Very good complimentary breakfast. We requested no perfume or air freshener in our room and it was pretty whiffy. They swore up and down it hadn't been sprayed so perhaps this was leftover from the day before, but it bothered my allergies a lot, I coughed and wheezed all night. Windows didn't open, no way to air it out.We got in late after a long day driving so ordered room service. Not very good, really pricey for what it was and there was a service charge on top of that. Ventilation blew right onto the bed. Couldn't get out of the draft. Noisy too. The next day when we got up I had 15 flea bites on my feet and ankles. I had taken off my socks and shoes because my feet were puffy from sitting in the car for many hours and spent about an hour on the couch, that's when it happened. I complained and they said they'd call their bug man. No offer of any kind of compensation. Not going back here!We stayed here for a 3 day getaway in savannah and we were delighted with this hotel! The ambiance is lush. The style is beach chic. Everything from the plush towels to the granite counters in the bathroom really make you feel like you're staying in luxury. You are within walking distance to everything! But the trolley tours start right next to the hotel if you'd rather ride. The complimentary reception was fun! An array of house drinks was offered and the house red was tasty.We had dinner in the restaurant. Fried green tomatoes were very well seasoned and crispy. The tomato bisque, however,  was bitter. The Baja fish tacos were very good. Spicy with fresh cilantro. My husbands mahi mahi was cooked perfectly. The cook to order breakfast is spot on and the staff are very friendly.We couldn't recommend this hotel more!This place was wonderful! It is beautiful and clean! Loved the location and the southern hospitality. They go above and beyond to help you get anywhere you need to go. The food and snacks for the manager's reception were exceptional and better than  any embassy suites that I have been to nationwide. You can't beat a free breakfast with southern delicacies. Thank youThis Embassy Suites was awesome! The staff are so kind and helpful and the rooms are spacious, clean, and beautiful. We were there for a wedding weekend. The whole experience was made even better by this wonderful hotel. Keep up the great work!!Good hotel to stay at. The staff were great. The room was nice. Our fridge didn't work, and we called but to no avail they didn't come fix it. They were having problems with the ac unit as well. Maybe just a bad day. They offer free appetizers and drinks for a couple hours each day in the evening. Their breakfast is killer as well. Besides maintenance, our stay was delightful.The Embassy Suites in Savannah was amazing. We stayed here one night as part of a 3 day road trip. It was perfect location to walk to dinner and shopping. The parking was in a garage, and easy to access. The room was HUGE! So comfortable and beyond clean. The staff at the Embassy Suites deserves 5 stars too! Everyone was incredibly polite, helpful, and extremely assertive. It's a bit pricey, but worth it! The breakfast was fresh and had lots of variety. The evening reception was great, very spacious environment, so you could enjoy the company of those you sat with, verse other hotels where its very crowded.Fantastic new hotel. Seems they are really bending over backwards to be top notch. Facilities very pretty and brand new. Large suites. Walk in showers. Delicious huge breakfast. I usually never eat free breakfast in these hotels but this was exceptional. Made to order omelets that we're better than I've had in expensive restaurants. Fantastic place worth the money.The nicest and most well kept hotel that I've ever stayed at. Everything about it was top notch. But, it was the hotel staff that made all the difference. Mindy was the one who took my reservation for the group of people who were going to come there for our reunion. She worked with me on everything from March until the end of September when we had the reunion. I was very pleased with the way that Mindy took care of me. There were several people who I want to mention who really made me and the other people who came to the reunion, feel very welcome and very well taken care of. Justin would be the one who I would say did the most to make sure that I was very well taken care of. Jason, Chris the bartender, Patrice, LaVonda, Ashley, Jeff, Karen, Blue, Maurice, Jasmine the cleaning lady, and John at night were very nice. There were others , but I didn't know their names. I was so impressed that I have told everyone I met and know how wonderful my stay was there.Rob H is my pen name. My name is Greg.I booked a king suite with a sofa bed for the kids. After arriving in Savannah we drove around for a while looking for parking without success. Check in wasn't until 4 pm, but we decided to try anyway. Well we lucked out! They didn't have a room ready, but let us park in the hotel lot (for a daily fee), and took our bags, so we didn't have to worry about leaving them in the rental. They told us the room would be ready in an hour or two, and recommended a good nearby restaurant for lunch, The Distillery. Just as we were finishing lunch we got a call from the hotel that the room was ready. Perfect! When we got there we found that we had been upgraded to the two bedroom suite, with a king bed for me and my wife, and two queen beds for the kids. The room was HUGE, with a living room/kitchenette area, and TWO bathrooms. The beds were comfy with feather pillows. Everything was immaculately clean. The breakfast in the morning was made to order and yummy. We also went to the evening happy hour for free drinks. OK it wasn't top shelf liquor, but they had Dos Equis on tap so I was happy. It was one of our BEST hotel experiences. No one wanted to check out, so they gave us a late checkout. Bonus!All I have to say is this hotel has far exceeded our expectations in every manner. As my husband and I pulled up to the hotel we were a bit worried since it is across the street from a greyhound station but this embassy suites is just jaw dropping. I love the fact that there is a nice parking garage right next to the hotel for us to park into and we could do valet but there seemed to be no point. The hotel front desk let us check in early and we were able to go out immediately and start enjoying Savannah. I was excited to find out that in addition to the free awesome breakfast that embassy suites has, this location also has free drinks and lite food from 530-730pm. This made our day since our dinner reservations are not until 930pm so we will not be starved by the time we go to eat. The rooms are gorgeous and very spacious. We will plan on staying here again I the near future and will be bringing family :)Be careful of what you leave in the room.  I had an iPad stolen out of the room.  When I reported it missing, the housekeeping staff admitted to finding it and said they would mail it to me.  I haven't seen a sign of the iPad nor anyone who will respond to requests of when it would be mailed - multiple calls to the Head Housekeeper, Wendy, and the manager have resulted in no call back.  They even asked me for my password so they could ""verify it was mine"", after I gave them several pieces of identifying info including the cover color and the room it was left in (how many iPads could they have found in that room).  Of course, they wanted the password so they could keep the use it.","The hotel was beautiful!  The staff was friendly, everything seemed very nice and clean.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-brice-savannah,The Brice,4.5,$$$,93,"Stayed here for a work event &amp; man, it has high reviews for a reason.  Dog friendly.  Great staff.  Loved the ambiance of the hotel--yes it is a boutique hotel and I enjoyed that.  Wine &amp; snack happy hour.  Great (great!) catered food for our work event.  I enjoyed the room.  The only question that I wasn't sure about was whether the robes in the room were complimentary use or if there was a charge.  I didn't want to use it &amp; find that there was a charge.  The best part of the whole stay was the bed &amp; pillows.  I slept SO WELL both nights and really couldn't be happier.Was unsure what to expect to be honest. I did a little research and ended up getting this one because of the glowing reviews. Cons: Not many....You can tell that it's an older building that has been remodeled, and they did a good job - there are some original features that you just can't upgrade, but that's understandable. The location of our room made the street traffic pretty loud, but not till the morning when the daily hustle and bustle started. Pros: GREAT STAFF, I was blown away with the professionalism and sincere southern hospitality that this place offered! That alone will make me come back and recommend this place to friends. From the moment we pulled up to have the car parked to the moment we got in the car to leave, they were absolutely great! Here are a few things that made our stay so great!-They gave my daughter some sunglasses because she forgot hers and made her day-They  comped our parking-We missed happy hour so they gave us 2 drink vouchers for the restaurant. -We were there to celebrate my brothers 45th birthday (he lives in Savannah) and when we walked out for the evening they offered more drinks for us. -When we first got there, I didn't see the ""how to connect to the internet"" flyer in the room - and they painstakingly sat with me on the phone while I connected (and were super nice the entire time!) - WiFi is free btw-They had complimentary (good) coffee in the morning (the world around me in the morning thanks you for that!) -And the location was perfect - walking distance to everywhere! -Also the beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in! -Every person said hello and seemed genuinely happy. When I mentioned this at checkout, one of the concierges said that their work environment was happy and that their bosses made it that way, so it was easy for them to be happy to be at work - I loved that statement! So true!   So thank you Brice (a Kimpton Hotel) for making a work atmosphere so pleasant for your staff that it portrays in their interactions with the guests! They were absolutely wonderful!!! Our stay was fabulous and I look forward to staying again on our next trip down which happens 3-4 times a year! Thank you!Small, boutique hotel, main flyer/desk could use some redesigning(my husband and I both felt that it wasn't well layed out), cute,clean, good location, and friendly staff!!      We arrived and the valet immediately brought over a bag of dog treats!! He was friendly and offered his help. Walking into the hotel lobby is a little overwhelming and confusing; it's really loud, compact, and the main desk is actually around the corner. The front desk staff were friendly, but didn't tell us any information about the hotel (cocktail hour, pool, fitness room, anything about the area, etc). We took the 1 elevator up and went into our room which was well decorated and spacious, but laid out oddly. When you enter you have this large hallway and then the bathroom, the bed is directly in front of the large desk that is also the tv stand, so there is limited room at the door of the bed to get around the bed..but then a ton of space on either side of the bed. The only closet space was the armoire. The only drawers were the night stand ones. Cute furniture but definitely only meant for the one or two night stay kind of thing...      The bathroom was your basic hotel bathroom. The bed, pillows, and sheets were comfy.              Cons   1)The street noise    2) The walls were paper thin- was woken up several times through out the night by the toddler next store who kept waking up crying...my husband and I whispered after 8 pm because we didn't want to Wake the kid, that's how thin the walls/door were!! I would ask for a non adjoining room and maybe not on bay st.     I would give this hotel another chance...but wasn't thrilled with our room this time due to the inability to really relax.I love this hotel. First impression: holy shit that's cute. Very modernized hipster feel. Very Abbot Kinney (LA) like. Also dog friendly, so an extra star for that!Second impression: southern hospitality. To the tee. They gave me an early check in, comped my valet (which wasn't even nearly as much as other places), and even upgraded us to a freaking suite! And, the staff greeted us by name any time they saw us. They also had complimentary happy hour between 5-6pm, with Bailey's hot chocolate, red and white wine, and also complimentary coffee and tea in the morning. I gotta say it, this place is the ""bee's knees"". Had an amazing experience, no one was ever snooty, very friendly and warm. I've already recommended this place to my friends, and will continue to do so for anyone in needing a place to stay in beautiful Savannah!This hotel was a great pick. Right near the river but not river front. They offer valet parking ($25 per night). Happy hour wine and cheese from 6-?. The hotel is dressed with modern decor throughout. My favorite part was the ""Grinch Chair"" in the guest rooms. Rooms run $150-200ish a night. Beds are very comfortable which is the most important part for me. Unfortunately, the Gym was not available. It's under construction so we would have had to walk to another property. They lose a star for that. We had a minor problem with our room. The front desk quickly fixed it. They offer great customer service . I'd say they definitely go out if the way to make you happy!My husband and I stayed at The Brice during a three night trip to Savannah a few weeks ago.  We really liked this hotel.  The outside is nothing special, kind of warehouse-y, but inside it's very modern and chic.  Cool lobby sitting area with a neat winding bookshelf that separates the couches from the front desk.  Free fruit-infused water.  Even bikes available to take out for a spin.Location was excellent if you want to be close to the water.  Hotel was a quick dash across the street and down the steps to River Street.  If you want to be near the squares, you will have to walk a bit although all the square locations are less than a mile away and walking to them is a breeze.Valet parking is the norm as there is no actual parking lot.  However, you can park along the street for free on the weekends - just pay attention to when the street sweepers will be by; signs are posted about the schedule.Rooms are nicely appointed.  Not too large, but comfy.  Beds were awesome.  We had three great nights of sleeping!  Staff was friendly, on-site restaurant was tasty.  Outdoor courtyard to relax in.  If you are coming to Savannah, definitely give this place a try.This place is amazing! The hotel itself is beautiful; a perfect mix of modern comfort and historic charm. What makes this place truly special, however, is the staff. Everyone went out of their way to make my boyfriend and me feel at home.   The only downside to this hotel is checking out, you really won't want to leave. Between the super comfy bed and the extremely indulgent restaurant on site, you will have no desire to go back to your daily routine.  Beautiful building, badass food and drinks ( do not skip this restaurant), great hospitality ( special thank you to Angela, Kaia, Trent, Rodney, and Mo [in no particular order] for making our trip to Savannah so special and memorable), the Brice is an extraordinary place to stay.I am still thinking about the amazing bachelorette party I enjoyed last weekend at the Brice. Bottom line:1) location is great.  River is two blocks away and there are plenty of less touristy areas and parks within walking distance. 2) staff is amazing, professional, young, and accommodating.  We especially appreciated Rodney, Aaron, and Kaia (spelling?).3) pool was a must in Savannah's heat and we thoroughly enjoyed ourself with the comfy sun beds and cool pool that was never crowded.4) the happy hour is a great bonus and in combination with the ""secret garden"" we had great cocktail hours catching up!5) We had 7 girls in the adjoining suite room.  Rooms were stylish, beds comfy, and loved the giant modern bath in the shower!One thing that would have made my stay just a bit better would be if the amazing coffee bar was open later and it should include cubes and cups to easily make an iced coffee since it's so dang hot in savannah.I think this hotel is so dang cute!  It has this fun etsy-style, eclectic, hipster, bohemian, trendy decor vibe.  Free bikes, free wifi, free coffee.  Awesome location.  Super cute and nice staff.  We loved it.  It is dog friendly but we didn't find any fur or problems with that, not having a dog.  Plus I am typing this in the lobby on a metal wheeled desk thing next to a vintage typewriter, drinking my free coffee!Great smallish hotel right across from the river, with most of the amenities of a big hotel with a boutique hotel feel. The staff was really fantastic, and the restaurant was great. It's a bit out from the center of town, which helps keep it a bit quieter on that end. The courtyard happy hour and music was a nice touch, I could easily see it being a place that locals would enjoy as well as out of town guest. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room, but I asked for and got one with haste. I'd come back.""I love your hair!""... Says the lady at check in. Oh ma'am..  Flattery will get you everywhere. Not only is the staff extremely friendly but the hotel is also a jewel! I mean the rooms are spacious, clean and updated. The bed was fluffy. Loved the extras. I normally Lysol everything down and wear shower shoes, but I questioned this here as everything was clean and neat. My only teeny gripes:1. They are dog friendly but at 8 this morning someone left their dog in the room barking for at least 10-15 min. Maybe you shouldn't allow this as everyone's dogs aren't trained.2. The the showers are nice with a bench inside, roomy... But there's a crack at the bottom which means water is going to be on the floor by the time you're done... Not good. 3. The 5 PM appetizers... Maybe provide enough for all the guests. Definitely enough alcohol but when my dude and I got there at 5:15 there was no food left. I wasnt looking for a meal, but at least the chance to put one thing in my hand to try. Other than that BRAVO Kimpton. Location is excellent along with all the little touches.Ahhhhh...Kimpton has done it again.  Another winner and I was so excited to see a hotel in Savannah.  Right in the Historic District and of course another top notch restaurant / bar attached.  More on Pacci in another review.The arrive offers everything you would expect from a Kimpton Property - Uber friendly staff who know their craft and truly take care of their guests and hip and clean with every detail taken care of.  I was here for my birthday and of course they didn't miss that detail.The rooms and bathrooms are large and very comfortable.  The Courtyard is absolutely spectacular and relaxed.  The service - again everything you would expect from a Kimpton.  Valet, check-In, housekeeping and on and on...they just always get it right.  This is a place where you know people here love working here.This location will soon be a 5 in my book.  They are still a bit new and still working on their setup - no dedicated gym yet, a bit of painting etc...they are well on their way and this is the place to stay in Savannah!!Awesome dog-friendly hotel. The staff was superb and friendly. Hotel was clean and comfy. Decor is adorable and location is perfect in downtown Savannah right by the river. Our dog was in doggy heaven and we only wish we could have stayed longer.Had a fantastic stay at The Brice during my recent trip to Savannah! Located right at the end of Bay St, The Brice is walking distance from many great restaurants and shops in historic downtown Savannah. The decor is super cool, with a mix of old Southern charm (the concierges all wore grey suits and bowties, there are vintage bikes available to borrow right in the lobby!) and modern touches (like a color-coordinated book display and pop art pieces in the hallways.)If you get a room with a balcony, it'll either overlook the pool area or the courtyard in the middle, which is a great place to kick back with a glass of wine during their daily free happy hour from 5 - 6! As with all Kimpton Hotels, The Brice is super pet-friendly (and baby-friendly, as we found out since my 2-year-old niece joined me for part of my trip) and if you're a Kimpton Karma Rewards member (which everyone should be, it's FREE!) you get a free $10 to spend at the bar or at the minibar. I would absolutely stay at The Brice again the next time I'm called to Savannah!Stay here. Umm... I guess I should make this more detailed. 1. Super friendly, non uppity staff. 2. Amazing space at the edge of the downtown tourist area. 3. Guest happy hour with wine and flatbreads. 4. Great restaurant. 5. Dog friendly with NO restrictions!!6. Our room was amazing. 7. Since my first visit at a Klimton hotel I got a welcome cheese plate and beer!8. Robes!I really have gotten to an age where I like a bathrobe in the room. I think I wore their comfy robe the whole time I was there. I hadn't been to Savannah in over 10 years but will be back for the Brice!My (now) husband and I got married in Savannah, and had our 'homebase"" for ourselves and our family and friends at the Brice. The whole experience was great, the staff was very accommodating (even for a frazzled bride), warm and friendly, and the location was perfect.Highly recommended!This hotel is a fabulous property!  The amenities are great! The staff are stellar.  Dog friendly!  The rooms are gorgeous.  The beds are sooooo comfortable.  It is a must stay if you are in Savannah!  Well done and see you again on our way back and forth from Florida to BrooklynMy husband and I just stayed at The Brice while we were in Savannah for a mini vacation, and it's now one of my top favorite hotels in the U.S! Here are the reasons why:1) The location. It's close to the bustling waterfront, but not close enough to hear all the noise of the crowds and bars at night. It's also walkable to all the best restaurants and sights.2) The restaurant/bar. Pacci is a 5-star establishment (in my opinion), and to have it on site is just amazing. The cocktails are divine, and taking one out to the pool is even more divine.3) The pool. Savannah is hot, hot, hot, so having this clean, well-kept pool at our disposal really made our vacation feel tropical and relaxing.4) The bikes! The Brice has two red bikes that you can ""check out"" for free. It was a superb way to explore all the squares on a Sunday morning.5) Ice water with lemon and cucumbers is always waiting for you in the lobby and by the pool.6) Tea/coffee in the lobby every morning (and it's the good tea, too. No Lipton for Brice guests!).7) The ""secret garden"" courtyard. This place is adorable and romantic, and the perfect area to read with your tea every morning. 8) Complimentary wine hour at 5:00 every night.9) The overall design of the hotel. It's modern and sophisticated, yet fun and trendy.10) Our room felt like home. There were fluffy white sheets and towels, a giant tub, and a wonderful balcony overlooking the pool.I'm so glad that we discovered The Brice. I'm now a Kimpton fan for life!I recently visited this Kimpton hotel on a day trip to Savannah, and loved the hotel. The hotel staff was nice and all the bartender Sydney at the in hotel restaurant (Pacci) was the best. I had a great time loved the hotel but finding your way to your room could be a little confusing... i got lost every time lolAwesome pet friendly hotel near the heart of Savannah! No fee for pets too! About a 10 minute walk to Ellis square and the heart of Savannah. The Brice was perfect. Very welcoming and accommodating staff that extrudes southern hospitality. The design and decor of the hotel and rooms are trendy. Everything from the furniture to the wallpaper makes a statement. The outdoor courtyard in the center of the hotel is beautiful; perfect spot for the free wine hour and relaxing with friends. Staff was quick to ask us how our day was going and made recommendations on restaurants/bars along with local attractions. Parking is steep at $25 per night, but that was on par with nearby hotels.","This is by far the coolest family-friendly, pet-friendly hotel we've ever stayed in. The courtyard and pool areas are great, the rooms are simple, but clean, comfortable, and fun. We also had a great experience with the front desk. We arrived late, after a long day of travel, and everyone was so nice and helpful. They gave us a bottle of wine (it was clear we needed it), filled up water bottles, and arranged for me to retrieve my son's bottle from the car after they already parked it, without charging anything or making a fuss - they actually seemed happy to help. The valet desk was busy in the morning, so if you can, call down before you go, and allow plenty of time. They don't charge a pet fee, and actually welcome dogs. There are water bowls in the lobby, and they seem happy to see them. We will definitely be going back!Cute boutique hotel!  The staff is super friendly especially the doormen!  Super dog friendly which was really nice, lots of dogs were staying there, including ours!!  Will definitely stay here again if we go back to Savannah!!We loved our stay at the Brice. It has the quaint charm of Savannah with a modern vibe. Our stay was nice and quiet, but we were there on a Tuesday night in an off season so that may be different than the weekends. My only complaint was the feather pillows, they're not comfortable enough for me. We will definitely come back, but I'll bring my own pillow.Traveling with 5 people is sometimes difficult, but The Brice made it pleasant, a separate living room allowed some to sleep while some watched tv. Lovely patio, pool and community spaces.The staff and management were very accommodating in a storm induced power outage. The wine ""hour"" was extended so guest stayed in the lobby swapping stories and playing cards, they helped us find a restaurant that had electricity and comped the valet parking for the inconvenience.Absolutely the best. Feels like home, with an incredibly friendly and efficient staff. The hotel goes above and beyond to make this a memorable stay with great personalities throughout;  the wine hour at the beautifully decorated living room lobby is fun and a great way to start the evening before going off to dinner. True feeling of an independent boutique hotel. I typically have a preference for Airbnb over most hotels when traveling but this property really made me reconsider future trips. I will, with out any doubt stay here each and every time I come up to Savannah. Location wise the hotel is on the further side of the historic district, which encourages you to walk around the streets freely and explore beautiful Savannah.  I stayed in room 201, and will make sure to request it every time. Don't think about it anymore-- Just book itLoved this place! From the second we pulled up, the hospitality was just amazing! We brought our pup along and everyone was so welcoming to him as well. This place has such a cool feel to it! The lobby is stylish but comfy and the outdoor patio was perfect to relax. The wine and cheese hour was a nice surprise and a really nice feature. The rooms were well situated and the beds were extremely comfortable. We also checked out the restaurant that was part of the hotel and it was delicious. It was awesome that we could leave our dog in the room and enjoy a night to ourselves. There was not one negative aspect to our stay at this hotel, highly HIGHLY recommend this place!I've stayed at a kimpton before, and loved it. They are a unique brand and I choose to stay there because of the service, free cocktail hours, free bikes, and pet policy.This hotel had all of those things, although the physical structure of the place was very disappointing. When I pulled up to the hotel I said ""what is this, a renovated dorm room""? It has that feel. Boxy, with small windows, a fresh coat of paint and new awnings. The lobby was beautiful and welcoming though.As we walked through the hall to our room, it very much feels like your walking through a very old apartment complex that was cheaply renovated. The vinyl butterfly stickers all over the walls didn't help. It looked cheap.The room was a little bit better. Beautifully decorated with a modern style. Although the room was simply a box, with a small window and a wall where they put in a bathroom. There wasn't even a closet.  My dorm room fear was coming true.The kicker was the yappy dog in the room next to us that barked for 18 hour a day.  It was so loud we felt the dog was in our room. I'm all for allowing dogs in your hotel, but if your going to do that, you need to insulate the rooms correctly.The pool was also a disappointment. Take away all the chic outdoor furniture and decorations, and your left with a small rectangle pool no bigger than what would be in the backyard of a small home.We paid $300+ a night to sleep in a small noisy overly decorated cheaply built room.  The location downtown was perfect though, and I guess that's what we were paying for.I stayed at The Brice this week while attending a conference.  The hotel itself is charming and the staff is super-friendly (and gets customer service... I got up too late for breakfast the first day and was looking for just a little something to eat so that I could then go for a run.  Even though technically breakfast was over, they found a leftover scone for me which I greatly appreciated).  The ""personality"" of the hotel was displayed in many ways from wet paint signs that said ""careful, y'all"" to witty social media responses.  The Secret Garden is a great little area where you can sit outside and enjoy a cup of coffee, etc.  I definitely enjoyed my stay and would recommend The Brice to those looking for a place to stay in Savannah.  If you join the Karma Rewards program, Wi-Fi is free.One of the most poorly managed hotels I have ever stayed at. If it improves I will revise my review.I wouldn't have expected to stay here, but we were in town for a wedding, and this is where half the bridal party lodged. Location: right across from the river! You're not in the heart of the city, but you are really, because walking across the main, touristy parts of Savannah isn't that long of a walk (comparatively). Close to a lot of restaurants, nightlife, and shops. Parking: Valet. Just suck it up...welcome to Savannah :) On a side note...the valet's were the best customer service we had all weekend! Not that the other staff wasn't great, but these guys (and the one lady who helped) were super helpful, friendly, and overall not what you usually expect from valets. This crew should teach other valets how to do their job. Top notch service! Atmosphere: I got a little lost in the decor. Modern luxe? Funky chic? It's like IKEA developed a luxury line. Definitely had some quirks- strange wallpaper in the hallways (butterfly and horse stall like decals) and mock rock climbing holds on one wall in the rooms. I liked the balance of bold colors on white/gray/natural. They do allow dogs...which is cool, but one of our neighbors had a dog that barked all the time, night or day. The courtyard in the center is very lovely! A nice euro style mix of strung lights, cafe furniture, umbrellas, and some plants. On site food was alright- it's a better place to stop in for a drink (nice bar!)- there are so many really good restaurants in Savannah. Definitely take note of their complimentary wine hour(s?) in the evening! Rooms: Maybe a little bigger than standard size! Comfy setup and the most amazing mattress. Seriously...it was cloud-like sleeping, and I usually prefer a hard mattress. The bathroom was standard- alright shower pressure, although the tub floor was super slick. The complimentary bathing supplies were quality (C.O Bigelow). There is a well stocked mini bar &amp; fridge, but no fridge or microwave for leftovers. I loved the fuchsia armoire! Not only was it design wise a nice fit, but full length mirrors in hotel rooms are a big plus in my book. Would have liked to see a luggage rack since there weren't any dressers. Unique addition to Savannah- definitely a spot for anyone who likes to try boutique hotels! I'd never heard of the Kimpton line, but definitely will be much more likely to check them out in the future for travel!Stars looked to be aligned for me to absolutely love this hotel. The exterior colors (gray, yellow, white) match my home living room.  The interior rooms (gray, lime green) matched my sneakers.  I love hotels, but I was surprised I didn't like this cute one more, until I started writing it all down in a review when it started to make sense.  You know the feeling you sometimes get at fancy joints when you are underdressed or when you're at the airport gate trying to get a first class seat but the gate attendant would rather leave the seat empty than give it to you?  Yeah, I felt a little of that at this hotel...not from everyone, but from some. (BTW, Valets and cleaning crew were great...greeting me each time we passed by and upon entrance/exit of the hotel.)Cranky and hangry from my travels and dressed in yoga wear (since I was on my way to the spa), I arrived to check in.  The upgrade certificate I received was not honored, with the front desk staff saying there were no upgrades available, and there were no king bed rooms clean at my check-in time (which was early), so I got a room with 2 queen beds. Wish they didn't even offer the upgrades...that and the great reviews made my expectations way too high. I had also received an email the day before my arrival, saying that upgrades were still available for purchase as well, so while it is entirely possible that other people with reservations bought all the upgrades the day before, I'm highly skeptical.  Kimpton is very responsive via social media but the flip side is that it gives the illusion of customer service, without actually receiving any benefits or fixes.  While its decor and colors are totally my taste, the Brice remains a regular hotel, with regular rooms and tiny bathrooms. There was a $10 voucher for mini bar items that came with my room rate, but I would have much preferred faster wifi or a quieter room with a king bed over getting $10 of minibar stuff (hoping that the voucher is correctly applied to my bill later...we'll see, otherwise, I would be stuck with an extra $10 of mini bar items). The room was very clean with a big window (mine overlooked the pool and Bay St), with white sun shades and room darkening curtains.  Bathroom with the shower tub and toilet is very small and a bit claustrophobic.  Small sink and vanity is outside the bathroom door in the hallway, which is a good feature especially if you are sharing the room (but didn't matter much if not sharing).  I turned off the room air, since the heat made a lot of noise, but I could still hear the loud vent in the hallway, along with lots of noise from the cleaning staff since there was also a utility room across the hall from my room.  The toilet also kept running for a long period of time each time it was flushed.  Really slow wifi in the rooms.  I got to see one of the suites that friends of mine are staying in...definitely more spacious bath vanity and sitting area, but also in higher traffic locations from some of the rooms that are accessed from outdoor hallways.Yes, there is a happy hour with wine and small snacks in the cute lobby, but it is very crowded. It is probably better in warmer weather when people can move out side to the courtyard.  There are 4 elevators in the square layout hotel, which is good so you don't have to walk far to get to your room, but bad with the incessant dinging sound that is way too close to the rooms.  Lots of positive reviews from dog owners who can bring their pets, but if you're not a pet person like me, it makes me a bit nervous having dogs around food and barking at each other.  Each time the pets passed each other and I was between them, I felt like I was in the middle of a pending duel.  Some owners also left their dogs unattended in their rooms...I could hear some dogs barking in a nearby room for quite some time.Great location on Washington Square at the edge of historic district, and probably one of the reasons I would definitely stay here again.  I valet parked my car (at $25/night) when I arrived and walked around Savannah my entire stay, with easy walks to the riverfront area, through all the squares, and to Forsyth Park.  Great restaurant and bar at the hotel (Pacci), and of course, many options in the surrounding area.  3.5 stars.A typically-excellent Kimpton hotel. Impeccable facilities and warm, welcoming staff. Perfect location at the east end of Bay street. The lack of a self-parking option ($26 a night for valet, although there are unlimited in-out privileges) is annoying but fine.Nice hotel but subpar service.  We got stuck in the pool area in the middle of the day and couldn't get back in as the doors were locked behind us.for the 2nd part of our anniversary I had been dying to come to Savannah and after finding out they had a new Kimpton hotel we had to stay here. of course I was getting over a bad cold which isn't what anyone wants before going on vacation. anyway when we got there really early, they held our bags while we went to have breakfast. it was great after we came back and found we had been upgraded to a suite! also great for my husband to be able to watch tv in the other room while I napped and tried to get over my cold asap lol. they also gave us a nice bottle of prosecco we brought home with us :) we just loved this hotel so much. I'm so happy we came here for our anniversary instead of my birthday because I don't think this was even open when we first planned on coming. just such a great hotel and we love the kimpton brand. the hot chocolate in the morning was delicious and I had no idea they'd have that. I'm a chocolate lover and went nuts lol. I only wish we had brought one of our dogs but that's jetblues fault for being so overpriced, not the hotel! which btw this hotel is beyond dog friendly, they just love dogs and even have treats for those with dogs :) oh and there is a wine happy hour we enjoyed nightly and omg that tub. I want that tub in our house..... also the whole design of the hotel was just so well done. I only wish our last day I wasn't feeling sick and we could have enjoyed Pacci... I see this as just a reason to come back one day lol :)Such a beautiful hotel! The best customer service I've ever experienced by far. The staff is so attentive and helpful and pleasant and competent.  Everyone is so friendly and accomodating. Pets stay free!!! The room and bed and shower pressure are excellent! Room comes fully equipped. Hotel has free bike rentals which is another plus. This great place even has free wine hour daily from 5-6pm. White and red wine with cheese n crackers. You really can't get any better than this place in Savannah. Special shout out to Terell - you deserve recognition for your great customer service and amazing personality. It was an absolute pleasure staying here. Can't wait to come back. Will never stay anywhere else.Awsome experience.   Got a room w/ 2 queen beds.  Huge room, dog bed, dog food bowl w/ treats and water bowl provided.  Clean.  Very happy.  No dogs allowed in the pool area.  Nice courtyard for the pool &amp; the comp wine &amp; appitizers area (dogs allowed here).  Can eat in courtyard w/ dog at the attached restaurant.  W Everyone was super nice and NOT pretentious.   Allowed me to keep my car parked in their parking &amp; hang around in the court yard (with my dog) after check out, no problem.Excellent customer service.  The staff are happy  to help. I was satisfied with the room. I liked that electrical outlet are incorporated into the desk and bed stands.We booked here through A blind Hotwire deal. The lobby and restaurant were nicely decorated. While we were walking to the room we were a little apprehensive however our suite was gorgeous. I would definitely book here againExcellent facility located in the historic district with all the southern hospitality and charm one could ever find. The staff was excellent and the rooms were clean and quaint. Location was superb. The facility is pet friendly and is excited to offer pets treats, bedding and makes the pets feel right at home... Stay here and you will not be disappointed.I love Kimpton hotels. The Brice did not disappoint. It's steps from river street and centrally located to see everything Savannah has to offer. The staff is wonderfully friendly and helpful. Kiah helped us out with reservations and suggestions on where to go and was on point! Parking was one time charge and not pay per day which is awesome. If you're not familiar with Kimpton hotels, they host tea and coffee in the morning, and wine o'clock at 5pm usually with a festival cocktail as well. They are also incredibly dog friendly which makes me elated to see little puppies everywhere.","A fine experience. Good location within the historic district. However, expected more relative to the cost associated with the stay.We have stayed here a few times and last year I would have given it 5 stars but this year it can only be 4 stars but it is on the way to 3.  Why?  First, let me say the the service is excellent and the complimentary wine and cheese hour is very nice.  Location is great too so, what is wrong?  The rooms already seem in need of upkeep.  Our bathroom had paint peeling on the ceiling, wall and the inside of the bathroom door was missing paint along the bottom not to mention the heavily rusted hinges.  This tells me that they are not paying attention to the upkeep and that is inexcusable.  Hopefully  they start to keep up with the place or our next visit might be our last...but I hope not.Everything was as advertised. Very attentive service from front desk to the house keepers. Loved the courtyard. Spent some nice quiet time out there. The wine and conversation and comfy seats and couches stepped this place up. Room was very clean, nicely decorated, great bed. Definitely will come here again.I was so so SO excited to stay here! Savannah is one of my most favorite cities ever and I was so excited when I found this hotel. The pictures online are gorgeous and it looked unlike any hotel I have stayed at before. Also I was traveling with a group of five so it was great that they offered ""suites"" that could a accommodate five people with their pull out couch. The location was a little bit of a further walk from all the good shopping and what not then I wanted but I figured it'd be worth it. We arrived at The Brice a few hours earlier than check in and the valet was so nice and friendly and walked us inside to check in and introduced us to the front desk. The lobby and connecting restaurant pacci are simply gorgeous and definitely like the pictures. We were luckily able to check in early which was great. Our room was right off the courtyard which is gorgeous and somewhere where I wish I could have spent more time but it was raining. The room however left much to be desired. It just felt like an old motel room they painted and threw a bunch of ikea furniture in. It was set up incredibly weird, and for being a suite style room it wasn't much bigger than a normal hotel room. I was really looking forward to the giant bathtub I kept seeing in pictures but instead we had an incredibly small bathroom that was so close to one of the beds it was hard to get to. The bathroom reminded me of one from a comfort inn I stayed in....they had the same cheap looking shower curtain. When I'm spending 300-400 a night on a hotel room to me it's the little things like that that make a huge difference. Later when we were all getting ready for bed we pulled out the couch and realized there wasn't any sheets for the bed. I called down to the front desk and asked if we could please have some sheets and a blanket for the pull out couch in our room. They arrived with 4 sheets and said they didn't have any blankets. You're a hotel....and you don't have any blankets? Upon check out the computer was down and I had to stand there for 20 minutes until someone else was able to check me out. Overall I wouldn't stay here again. I love the style and look of the hotel but I think there are much nicer hotels in Savannah with a better location and price.Have stayed before and had a great experience. On my most recent trip, my experience was awful. Upon checking in, the receptionist at the front desk was incredibly rude. No bell hop was offered for luggage. The room wasn't clean. You could never get someone on phone for room service, wifi did not work, and the front desk wasn't able to provide assistance with wifi trouble. Overall BAD experience. Won't stay again.Savannah, being a small town with local nuances, offered my wife and I an abundance of boutique hotels to choose from, and The Brice suited us well--a wine happy hour, (albeit a small selection), clean-cut rooms, and a good view of the town.The staff here know how to treat clientele well, and as well, they continue to afford out of town guests some Southern hospitality.In terms of the layout, I found the design to be a little cramped (one elevator, to boot), but with 3 stories in the heart of Savannah, you can't expect it to be the J.W. Marriott, with 10 elevators and hallways the size of a 8-lane highway. At the least, the bellmen and attendants were extremely hospitable and willing to meet needs at the drop of a hat.The Brice offers visitors to this boutique hotel, ready to give a little bonus to your time in Savannah.Well beyond our expectations. From the valet to manager, 1st class all the way. Close to everything Savannah. Don't miss afternoon wine reception or Wednesday night Supper Club at Pacci restaurant. We will return.Stay here! The most enjoyable hotel I have ever stayed at. Great staff! The most amazing lobby and courtyard you could dream up!!Savannah Downtown is small! You can walk end to end in 25 minutes. This hotel is in one corner of the district but it is still PERFECTION. Amazing in house restaurant but it's just the rooms and the staff that will blow you away. Modern, chic, smart.No complaints. Would never stay anywhere else in Savannah. Oh. And easily the greatest shower I've ever had in a hotel room.If I were a Savannah ghost, I'd want to haunt The Brice. Why? Well, I'd never want to leave! Kimpton hotels set the bar pretty high, but The Brice gleams with southern hospitality. I tweeted the Kimpton two weeks earlier telling them that I hoped the staff had great ghosts stories for me. Upon check-in, I found a book of Savannah ghost stories and the ingredients to make a Green Ghost cocktail. Talk about attention to detail! The rooms are nice and the service is excellent. The pool was small, but it is an older hotel. The Kimpton wine hour is a highlight as always, and The Brice brought out complimentary pizza too! All in all, I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I go to Savannah. Splurge a little and stay at The Brice.We paid over $300 for this room and when we asked for a blanket for the pull out couch we got ""Unfortunately we don't have extra blankets. Here's three sheets."" The room didn't look as pictured. It's cute and modern but not worth the money.Currently staying at the hotel. The staff is very polite and pleasant which always gains points with me. However the rooms and halls are so humid it smells a little moldy which I can also put aside. The room however lacks in cleanliness. When your paying good money for a ""4 star"" hotel you expect a little more. We checked in and proceeded to our rooms, the floors and hall floors were dirty and there were some hairs on the floor which were not ours since we had not used it yet . I did inform someone at the front desk he told me he would take care of it and walked away before I gave him my room number . I informed someone else and said they would take care of it as well. Unfortunately when we came back to our room hours later , the hall and bathroom floors were still dirty and the hairs were still on the floor. Hopefully that's as bad as it gets and I can give a better update upon check out.Clean and close to a lot of restaurants , shops, river, and bars.  There is a nice courtyard with ample seating for several small groups to sit. It is right on a main road where large 18 wheelers and concrete trucks are CONSTANTLY racing by ( this is very loud the moment you walk out of the door), we didn't hear any of this when in our room. Don't stay near the exit door on the first floor, it has a labelled alarm but people still go out of this door and the Alarm goes off ALL hours due to people exiting. The alarm is VERY loud and could  be heard in our room about five doors down. Oh, also pet friendly which is a plus!I don't think you can find a better or more welcoming place to stay and explore Savannah with your dog. The rooms are lovely and service very friendly and accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay.Little peeved right now. After having had our daughters wedding and reception at the Brice, which was good as indicated in an  earlier review, today we got a $1300.00 charge on our credit card. Here it is three weeks after the event which we thought was done and paid in full. Their explanation was ""Oh it is a 22% service charge plus taxes, read your contract.""Very disappointing as we had checked prior to leaving/checkout and were told setting everything was closed out.Loved the Brice!!! They are so nice and friendly. They accommodated our last minute extension. They have a lovely happy hour. The Tilley tour picks up right in front, we hopped off and got in the pool and then got back on. The pool is lovely also. I highly recommend staying here!Stayed here 11/5-11/8 for the Rock n Roll Savannah Marathon.  Beautiful hotel, great service, friendly staff and a lovely complimentary happy hour daily from 5-6.  They set up coffee early for the marathon participants and had water and granola bars out.  Not one complaint, looking forward to coming back next year.We stayed here in August on a road trip across the country, and I was obsessed with this hotel! The decor is amazing - steampunk in the lobby and mid-century modern in the rooms. We had booked a standard room but it was huge, with a four-poster king bed (that was so comfortable, I actually pulled up the sheets to try to figure out what kind of mattress it was) and a high-backed armchair in the corner. The hotel surrounds a beautiful courtyard, where you can sit with your (free) morning coffee that they provide in the lobby or your (free) wine that they provide in the early evening. The hotel is also very dog-friendly - they don't charge an extra fee, and they allow you to leave your dog alone in the hotel room. There's also a great park across the street that is perfect for dog walking. We didn't have a chance to eat in the Italian restaurant that's attached to the hotel, but we got a couple appetizers one night that were excellent, and the cocktails were fabulous too. We only had two nights in Savannah, but I'm dying to go back and to stay at this hotel again!The staff are incredible. It is like being home around friends. Five star service at its best.I have never had a more amazing hotel experience than at The Brice. I informed the hotel that my boyfriend and I booked our stay for our anniversary. Not only were we upgraded to a premium room, there was champagne and cake waiting for us when when arrived. This made the start of our evening so romantic, especially since since he popped ""the question"" after dinner! The room itself was gorgeous; the huge canopy bed, the gigantic tub, and the beautiful balcony were to die for. There were plenty of plugs for all our devices and a wall-sized mirror perfect for checking my outfit before strolling the squares. The rest of the hotel was so pretty and modern, I felt the need to Instagram everything from the swing in the lobby to the ""secret garden"" where I drank my morning coffee (available in the lobby each morning). Valet parking was convenient and $26 a day, which I found pretty standard. The staff itself was so friendly that we felt like old friends. Rodney showed us all the features of our room and took great care of us from arrival to departure. The wine happy hour each evening was a lovely touch. The hotel was located right across from River St. and had a few DOT shuttle stops conveniently nearby. I would absolutely recommend The Brice to any and all.Overall great experience. The courtyard was great during wine hour to mingle and make new friends. Pet friendly also.","Love Love Love this hotel. I just stayed here for a work conference and was so pleased. From the food to the meeting room to my room to great customer service, all were top notch. The manager at the hotel was beyond friendly and remembered guests names as they walked through the lobby. The secret garden was beautiful and calming, great place to just chill at night. I highly recommend this hotel to any one whether single, with a loved one or a family.  Elizabeth ZarateGreat trendy vibe, fantastic service, and good rooms.  It's an old building so expect a few less outlets overall and small bathroom space.  Great location.The Brice has smoothed out the opening bumps and my most recent visit was truly dreamy. The pool still isn't completed and the rooms haven't gotten any bigger, but those are the only quibbles. Every staff member I encountered greeted me so affectionately, I wanted to claim them as relatives. I ate 3 meals at Pacci. Could have gone elsewhere. Didn't want to.This hotel is marketed as a boutique hotel and has boutique-hotel prices, but is actually an old Holiday Inn or HoJos or other downmarket hotel, given a surface renovation. The bathrooms are not redone, the layout is not redone, the pool is not redone. The bathrooms in the suite are especially bad, as they are tiny and the door is stuck right next to the bed, in a corner. Also the rooms were damp and frigid with the arctic AC effect. The rest is standard boutique-hotel, and nice enough. I would have been happy at a lower price.Great hotel and nice service!The suite is well worth the cost and the place is sooo clean.I would give it 5 stars but there was a weird pipe noise all day and night.Since we are heavy sleepers, I did not ask for a room change.Also they should add another towel bar.  We had to hang our wet towels in the closet.We love Kimpton and thanks for the wonderful stay!!!Beautiful rooms, truly friendly staff and great service. Love this place! Would definitely recommend it to others visiting Savannah!Such an enjoyable stay. The rooms were clean and had a modern feel. If you are looking for a southern vibe this wouldn't be your place to stay. Great pool area. The valet men are all so wonderful and truly care about their guests. My only complaint would be: there is no breakfast that comes with booking..only hot coffee and tea in the AM..and you have to pay for wifi unless you sign up for their rewards program. Otherwise this place is great and the location is amazing! Right in downtown Savannah within walking distance to River Street.Great hotel as expected from Kimpton lines.  Well appointed room and luxury amenities.  The valet staff are friendly and helpful.  The front desk staff are not friendly and has a bit of an attitude. I get it, you work at a very nice hotel but, should not treat your guests with a condescending attitude when asked a simple question.  Maybe it's a new hotel excitement thing but that needs to improve.  It takes away the other positive aspects of this beautiful property.We throughly enjoyed our stay at The Brice, we were in town for our daughter's wedding, which was actually in the courtyard of the hotel. Service was excellent with a friendly and helpful staff. The newlyweds had a complimentary suite for their wedding night which they loved. Would recommend this hotel for anyone.Best hotel chain ever. 5 stars for service, they always try to accommodate their guest. I always stop at the Brice on my way down to Florida. Love everything about the hotel.Disregard any negative reviews you read about this hotel, my recent stay exceeded my expectations! This hotel is modern in its decor without being pretentious. The hotel staff is professional and exude southern hospitality.  I contacted the staff via email while in route from Ohio with some questions about my stay and was promptly contacted by phone by a hotel administrator with answers. Our room, which was lovely and very clean, was ready early.  The staff had already been informed we were possibly arriving early and I was impressed that the gentleman at the front desk said they were awaiting us.The happy hour with complimentary wine and appetizers was an unexpected treat!  The gym and pool are not completed yet, but arrive knowing you will be working out at another local gym, for free, if working out is of importance to you.Thank you to the entire staff at The Brice, I look forward to returning to your hotel &amp; staying at other Kipton Hotels in the future.Amazing place, just opened in June after joining the Kimpton network, they did a fantastic job on a beautiful and historic property. Like the rest of the Kimpton network, they really put a priority on great staff.There is an evening reception with wine and flatbread which is always pleasant. In the morning there is decent coffee and a nice assortment of teas.  Free wifi. Expensive parking (but par for the course). Friendly valets who get to know guests during their stay. Delicious attached restaurant.The rooms are very comfortable, I highly recommend it and plan to always return to this hotel when visiting Savannah! Also, wonderful hotel if you're traveling with pets. They don't upcharge for pets, and are very welcoming to your pets.A brand-new renovation of a previously run down Savannah property at the east edge of downtown, this is an excellent place to stay in town.I have stayed at a lot of Kimptons and other nice hotels, and in terms of quality of the inside, this is as good as any.  it's in a quit part of downtown at its east edge, but since Savannah is so compact, you can still get around pretty easily. It is very close to Water street. There's a very nice inner courtyard which is quiet and relaxing.The thing that set this place apart was the service. I usually get good service at Kimptons but mixing in the Savannah niceness really took it to the next level. Will definitely plan on staying here again when in town.This was our first stay at a Kimpton hotel. Kudos! First impressions are key, and the valet staff were friendly and helpful. Our check in process was smooth, even though I'd just booked our room through Orbitz less than 24 hours ago. Our room was a King with separate living room area, divided by a hallway, closet and bath (with TVs in both rooms). We'd previously stayed at the Marriott riverfront, but found the open atrium with pool design too noisy. Our room at the Brice, though right on Bay St., was super quiet. The bartenders at Pacci were great, but this is probably biased because they had my favorite Sav Blanc. The best part is the location, a brief walk to the best restaurants in town. My one complaint is that there should be a fan in the bathroom - it gets pretty humid in there, and shower floor/towels weren't really drying between use.The Skinny: check in at 4, free wine happy hour in the lobby at 5 PM plus coffee &amp; (mighty leaf) tea in the AM, snacks and a minibar fridge (very mini) in room. Best Tip: if you sign up online for the Kimpton rewards program you get decent free Internet access.This hotel is absolutely amazing!! The decor is beautiful, the location is perfect, and the staff... outstanding!!! Everyone that I came into contact with was so friendly and helpful! The room service was delicious! I came here for a special event and the staff made it even more special! Upon checking in they upgraded my room to a suite and they helped me bring my luggage up... everyone was more than willing to help in any way they could! This restaurant is sure to be gem in the heart of historic savannah!!! I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone I can and I will be back!!We decided to take a last minute trip to Savannah and found The Brice online while looking for a pet friendly hotel that would allow our 2 large dogs. Having the dogs stay free was amazing! I'm so glad we chose this hotel! Every single member of their staff was so friendly! Everyone stopped to see our pups, say hi and ask how we were doing and wish us a nice day. They let us check in a few hours early which was fantastic. Everything was so clean and the whole place has a very cool,funky vibe. The bed was comfortable and the hotel was very quiet. We will definitely be looking into other Kimpton hotels for future trips.Love this property...they really did a nice job with the remodel.  From the rooms, courtyard (amazing to sit and relax), and 'family room', the decor is stylish, sophisticated, and right up my alley.  Service was fantastic too.  Front desk team, valets, housekeeping...everyone was friendly and very helpful.  Complimentary coffee in the AMs, wine hour in the evening is an added bonus.  We didn't bring our pooch along, but the hotel is pet friendly and saw several dogs...and a bird.Note, the pool doesn't open until July...I guess that just means we will have to make a return trip soon.Stay here. It's a lovely boutique hotel.I booked The Brice on a whim and was so happy. The concierge to the restaurant, everyone was so nice and friendly. Mostly everyone seemed happy to be there and that's such a great sign. Dinner was amazing. I would recommend having a bite in house. The whole hotel was really clean and super nice. I would definitely stay here again.If you like dogs this is the place to be. We love Kimptons, they are always fun and unique. We especially liked the handwritten note by the maid with chocolate. So many fun colors and patterns... The happy hour was fun, lots of dogs and good conversation. The only issue we had with the happy hour was that they quickly ran out of snacks and these were not frequently replenished. The parking is expensive. We found other alternatives. The best part was that it was easy to get to the main areas within 10 minutes on foot.Excellent property! Wonderful and attentive service from the front desk to the valet and bell service. A special shout out to the 3 Ts at the door. You guys were great. The beds were well appointed and the rooms comfortable. The courtyard was beautiful as well. Complimentary wine social was very nice. Though not particularly a kid hotel, my 7 year old loved it and the staff.A request to change our reservation from a king to 2 queens was met without any hesitation, and though we were held up by traffic and weather until 10pm, the front desk staff checked us in with a smile and steered us to the on site restaurant for a good late night meal. Highly recommended.","Updating this to 4 stars, the GM followed up with the problem we experienced and I have to say- he is extremely professional and genuinely cares about customer service. I work at a 4 diamond resort in the spa at a tourist beach similar to Savannah and I was thoroughly impressed at how he handled the situation. Thank you.Great place to stop! The people were so nice and kind to us. The rooms were nice and spacious, great for the dog. The hotel is right in town, making it easy to walk anywhere. Glass of wine during complimentary happy hour was just what we needed after the long trip.While moving across the country with my husband with his Military orders I contacted the Brice Hotel to make reservations as we would be passing through savannah for the night. When I asked the rude reservation girl why the website was telling the the rooms were sold out when I tried to enter the military code but there were clearly still rooms available,  her nasty response was that it was first come first serve and once the block was gone that's it. We travel the country with Kimpton hotel brand regularly and have never found this to be the policy nor been treated so rudely! Stay somewhere else!Another chic new Kimpton hotel. Cozy clean rooms, friendly staff and amazing pool.""Don't be fooled by the outside""...This hotel is Fabulous! It looked ok from the outside. My wife and I stay at Kimptons quite a bit because of our 4 legged son who is just pampered at this awesome boutique hotel. We knew it was going to be gorgeous inside. The outstanding service and presentation begins from the time you book your reservation all the way from the checkout with the valet guys! The rooms and decor throughout were artistically well done. It was the little things like when the complimentary coffee was out; a staff member would run back and grab a cup for you from the kitchen while the main pot was being prepared...EVERY STAFF member was THE BEST!!!Just checked out of the hotel, as this was a pit stop on our Miami-DC road trip with my boyfriend and our 5 month puppy. What a great choice we made. Located right in historic savannah, we were able to walk everywhere. Even to dinner, although we took a street peddler for the ride home. The facilities (with exception to the pool) and rooms are newly renovated which was a huge plus. Everything felt very clean (and I'm a germ freak). The service was EXCEPTIONAL. Our valet/bell boy Rodney was a character and so helpful. His welcome upon arrival and check out really made us feel welcome at the Brice. Their pet friendly policy is something to make note of. If you travel with your pet (or would like to) you know how inconvenient non-pet friendly places can be. The staff loved our puppy and never complained despite his playful barking in the courtyard occasionally. They have a beautiful courtyard in the center of the hotel. Having a view into the court yard would have been the only thing I would have changed about our stay. We looked at the un-renovated pool which didn't impact our short stay- but if that's a deciding factor for you, that's something to consider. They have complimentary wine hour from 5-6 pm with flatbreads to pick at, and a red or white wine to enjoy in their courtyard patio. We also came here at night after dinner to wind down with our puppy, and it was even more beautiful in the evening with all the string lights lit up. The Brice is decorated beautifully too- contemporary modern while still retaining that authentic southern feel. We ate at pacci on our last night and the hostess was kind enough to let us sit in the courtyard area (although their tables were right next to the courtyard but not lit as nicely) and the servers were very kind too. We were the only ones outside, so we brought our puppy and iPod speakers as there isn't any music outside, and had a great dinner. Would also note that the Brice is right in between Washington Square and another park. That was a big plus for someone who needs to make frequent walks with their four legged friend. We joined the Kimpton ""karma rewards"" to start accumulating stays and got free wifi! Definitely coming back to the beautiful Brice next time in Savannah, and very impressed with my first Kimpton experience. Will definitely look into their other properties whenever traveling.The hotel, location and amenities (aside from the pool which is still under construction) were amazing, but what really made our stay was the friendly, attentive and helpful staff. We've stayed at a lot of boutique hotels across the US, and I would put this one at the top of our list. When we arrived they immediately had a luggage cart which was whisked off to our room, and glasses of wine for us while we checked in.  We also had our Great Dane puppy with us, who the entire staff adored and had plenty of treats for; they even had a huge dog bed waiting for him in our room.  We didn't arrange it in time, but they also offer doggy daycare and other pet services. Just an awesome experience all around, I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to savannah.My husband and I stopped in here for one night at the tail end of our southern US road trip. Of the 4 4-star hotels we stayed in, this was the nicest. We were happy to find affordable street parking close to the hotel when we arrived. There is also valet parking available.  The lobby of this place is very well designed and interesting to look at. It's an interesting combination of traditional antique southern decor and chic modern design.  When we arrived they were serving the nightly complimentary wine and chips. We did not partake, but it looked very nice. We checked in with the helpful fellows at the front desk and made our way to our room, past the friendly wall paper designs, and got settled in for the night. The beds were extremely comfortable with down pillows and matress.  The modern lighting was a nice change from dimly lit rooms I've had in the past. The room also featured nice fluffy robes and better-than-average soaps/toiletries.  My only complaints about this hotel were the bed frames and the smallness off the bathroom. The bed frame stuck out several inches from the actual bed, and I tripped over it several times and stubbed some toes. My husband also tripped and bruised his ankle.  The downside of the bathroom was that I had no place to set my belongings. A small shelf (besides the one IN the shower) would have made all the difference.  All in all, this is a lovely hotel and I'd love to stay there again on future trips to Savannah! I just recommend watching your feet around those bed frames!We loved this hotel! First and foremost, the staff (clad in seersucker) was warm and helpful at all times. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and cool on a very hot weekend in Savannah. The wine hour in the afternoon, with flatbread from the adjacent restaurant, was a welcome bonus. Coffee in the morning was great, too. The lobby and common areas are very inviting and comfortable for visiting. The patio outside is a great place to enjoy your morning coffee or afternoon wine. The only improvement I would have made would be to make the bathrooms bigger. We had a delicious brunch in the restaurant on Sunday mornings. I recommend the buckwheat crepes!Absolutely beautiful and the service was immaculateSimilar to another review below, I think the stars simply weren't aligned. I sound silly but it was just a small number of things that left a slightly meh vibe. (Let me say I love the Kimpton properties and think they train staff really well. They also have great aesthetic, this is no exception. The property is beautiful and people were polite and courteous. However, when we arrived at check in time we were unable to check in. We have a dog so this is problematic as we had a planned bike ride. However, our room wasn't ready for another two hours.  This meant we couldn't do much since we can't abandon the pup. When we asked for a late check out the next day, it wasn't honored--making our planned bike trip from the day before-undoable. We got ""two free"" drink tickets to compensate for the late check in, but actually only one.  The person next to us complained excessively and got a free upgrade and bottle of champagne, which is great for him, but makes you feel a little cranky when you are checking in simultaneously.  They also accidentally called our room a few times trying to deal with a host of problems. Which didn't matter, because we were up, but it all felt a bit chaotic.  Wouldn't normally care. 50 room, great--but when you're paying between 300 and 400$ you just want more.Haven't written a Yelp review in ages but I feel compelled to post a glowing review for The Brice! We didn't know anything about this place, but we saw they welcome dogs and offered a AAA discount, so we took a risk. Wow -- it so paid off! One of our best hotel stays in a while. The staff was EXCEPTIONAL, friendly and welcoming. The hotel itself was lovely, elegant but not too stuffy. We ended up getting upgrade to a suite and were welcomed with a wonderful selection of crostini, hummus and tapenade. Every detail of the room was perfect, from the  luxurious bed, to the beautiful decor to the brilliantly located electrical and USB plugs. Wi-fi was included and easy to access. Will definitely be back again soon!We just came back from Savannah staying at The Brice, a member of the Kimpton family. The hotel just opened is is not ready for prime time. First of all, the pool did not open with the hotel and they neglected to let us know. The notification  was buried on the website. Since they could not get the big thing right they should have focussed more on the small things, not so much unfortunately. Here is a brief list, the morning coffee did not go smoothly, no one to mind the coffee. They ran out and were just not attentive. They did not clean up the dishes and glasses from the wine social hour outside, and we're late setting up one night. Also, no dishes, etc. for the nosh. It is a dog friendly hotel so be aware that dogs sometimes don't get along and that might pose a problem. You can only park your car using their valet service, sometimes had to hunt for them.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-marshall-house-savannah-2,The Marshall House,4.5,$$$,94,"Great hotel that is located perfectly in the historic area.  Across the street from Leopold's.  I was in room 402 and had a haunted experience!!  I was asleep next to my husband.  Had one hand under my face and the other up over my head.   Around 4am my covers got pulled DOWN about 6 inches.  I opened my eyes in fright and my husband didn't move and was snoring.  I woke him up to hold me.  The room was clean and the staff was excellent.  Parking is $12 in the garage behind the hotel.Beautiful place! Inside out pure historical luxury.  Our room was just absolutely stunning.  I loved the historical feel to it.  Cozy and quaint.  I was very satisfied with the customer service and it was worth the stay.  I would definitely come stay the next time I visit.  My kids very much enjoyed its uniqueness.  It's walking distance from River St. And right along the path to all the shops, bars and restaurants.  Love it!Today is my last day staying at this beautiful hotel and I wish I didn't have to go! This hotel is not only gorgeous but also welcoming and historical and perfectly located we didn't have to use our car once, we could easily walk anywhere we wanted to go. Upon checking is the clerk was very helpful and friendly, we got up to our room and though it's a little small it is just beautiful! Within about 5 minutes of being upstairs our hotel phone rang and it was the sweet concierge Charlotte checking to make sure the room was fine and asking if they could bring us anything :)The little touches like this are what made the Marshall house really exceed our expectations. Things like having a paper at our door every morning and the wine and cheese reception at night make this place feel truly special. I think the only thing about this place that wasn't completely perfect was the complimentary breakfast it was just so so bagels, yogurt, biscuits nothing super exciting, so if you love breakfast as much as I do, I'd probably just go out and get it, but for something more grab and go theirs will do. I will definitely be staying here again, I was very impressed with this hotel and all of the staff we had the pleasure of meeting!Check the room before you take it.  Second floor inside is the room I was given and it looked fine, oh wait they should clean the toilet before a new guest checks in! Now the other problem is that the Windows face a dining courtyard.  You hear the kitchen banging pots &amp; pans, and the night I was there was a private party, loud, in the courtyard.  Needed to change rooms.Nice hotel, but I'll never stay here again.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marshall House this weekend to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. The location is great!  We were in walking distance of everything we came to see in Savannah. We didn't get back in the car until we were leaving Savannah. The room: It was charming, the balcony outside of the window was delightful and the GORGEOUS claw-foot bath-tub was exactly what I wanted/needed for this weekend getaway. The staff was so friendly, as well! While we were checking in, we mentioned that it was our anniversary and when we came back to the room from walking around the city, there was a bottle of champagne and a card signed by the staff! So perfect! The hotel itself was clean, and neat, no signs of filth. At 5:30 they offered the guests complimentary cheese and wine in the lobby which was a sweet touch. I absolutely loved our stay here and would definitely come back again!We've stayed in Savannah before, but for my birthday I wanted to travel back and stay at the Marshall house. It was a good call! From the moment we arrived every staff member was friendly and courteous!! If they walked past you, they said hello! I mentioned to the nice girl checking us in that it was my birthday so I was hoping the room was fabo. The asst hotel manager Jerry stepped in and upgraded us to a king room with a fireplace on the forth floor! Love it! The second day (which was my b-day) we arrived back at the hotel after being out all day and the staff sang me happy birthday and we had champagne and a card (signed by all of the staff) waiting for us in our room!We enjoy the history of Savannah and the Marshall house is a must! We will be back! Great job Marshall house staff!Beautiful!  It was like stepping back in time.  Totally enjoyable for a weekend in Savannah. Location was perfect for sightseeing &amp; local restaurants.It's a cool &amp; somewhat creepy hotel It reminds you of hotels that you would see in an Alfred Hitchcock movie.... Very creepy But it's cute at the same time. There are things in the room or hall ways, that absolutely make no architectural sense! Like the fire place that's not a a fireplace and stair case that leads to nowhere It's just an old building that want to look fancy but it's not! For what it is, it's way tooooooooo expensive! 259$ for a lousy room ! What a rip off but hey! They deserve it! Bc I'm a touristOverall great experience! Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun and romantic place to stay.I came here with my girlfriend to visit and explore Savannah for Labor Day weekend. The location is very central and within walking distance to anywhere  you'd like to visit in the historic district. We parked in the garage behind the hotel ourselves.  It ended up being $6 for about 24 hours, with a 3 minute walk with our bags to the hotel.The rooms are comfortably large and charming. The 100+ year old hotel has the old timey feel with creaky hardwood floors, large furniture, and high ceilings. We stayed in it because we heard it was haunted. Besides a couple of incidents which I attributed to my forgetfulness (Door was apparently left open all day, lights were turned off sometime in the night) we had no creepy ghostly encounters.Service, as far as we used it, was great. The staff followed up with a phone all an hour into our stay to make sure everything was ok. They held our bags while we ate breakfast, and there was a doorman.Continental breakfast was filling! The breakfast room has a glass ceiling over what seems to have been a courtyard and and plenty of tables. Breakfast consisted of bacon, eggs,  toast, juices, muffins, coffee, and everything we wanted. The food was warm even as we got there with 30 minutes before it ended.Stayed here for our annual weekend getaway. Excellent service!  We received a warm welcome the second we stepped in the door. Valet was prompt and friendly. Our room was quaint and cozy. The fridge did have food in it from the previous guestsm, which was gross but not intentional. The roof in the hallway leaked so we woke up to a constant dripping sound; again, not intentional. As a previous guest mentioned, the money under the baskets in the breakfast area is tacky and I would recommend stopping that. Our room faced the dining area which woke us up every morning with the moving of chairs and music. I would stay again, just request street view. We did not see any ghosts, but still had a pleasant experience. Centrally located.Review 100% based on bar/dining experience, did not stay at hotel. If you are a foodie, you will never forgive yourself if you don't come see James and Alfredo. James (bar) is world class and has so much knowledge it will make your head spin. Alfredo's dishes are the best in Savannah, even the ""hand foods/apps""!! Trust me, we ate 3 apps and ""custom ordered"" the 4th, but only because we're lucky...James had our back! Crab Cake, Beef Carpaccio, Escargot, and pan seared Foie Gras - apps! Had the duck and three way pork for dinner....insanely good!Beautiful hotel. Great location. Room was small but still comfortable. The room was well decorated. The biggest con of the room was the way the floor creaked.The continental breakfast was the best we've ever had. The bacon was out of this worlds The staff was friendly to us during check in and check out. They even do a courtesy call which was really nice.We didn't valet park, instead we used the garage behind the hotel and it worked out! It was cheaper and the hotel was located well so we could walk everywhere we wanted to.The closest to a ghostly experience we got was a turned off tv in the morning and a turned off lamp. Will definitely stay at again!This hotel rocks! Awesome location, right in downtown. The staff were all so sweet and so helpful. We stayed in one of the suites with access to the balcony and it was beautiful!Stayed here for 5 nights for my sisters wedding. I travel to Savannah regularly and have stayed at many different hotels in the historic district, my first stay at The Marshall House.  First the good:Beautiful hotel, I like the historic look and feel.  Valet/door men, awesome!  Front desk staff, very nice.  (one female 'manager' was a little pissy) Now why 3 stars.  We booked a balcony suite and paid a premium.  The balcony looks like it was last cleaned after St Patty's day.  There is a layer of black soot from car/diesel exhaust on everything.  I went out there with my daughter and she was covered in soot. After the first night, I put a generous tip in the provided ""tip"" envelope for the maid with a note for extra towels and an extra blanket.  NO extra blanket &amp; no extra towels. But tip was gone of course.By day three we ran out of soap and shampoo, never was restocked.  Also, ran out of TP.  I called down to the front desk for at least the TP, didn't get it until I asked again several hours later. Breakfast: so-so, quiche on most days that was probably previously frozen and heated up.  Plus the standard American continental fare. blah. Okay for one day, booooring for more than one.  (NEVER HAD ANY BACON, it is un-American to not offer a salty pig product in the morning)Whatever, this is not what peeved me the most.  On every table, there was a basket with fake peaches and a crisp ""dollar bill"" tucked neatly underneath it.  FRIGGIN TACKY!  Seriously?!?!?  This tactic to get 'tips' is offensive and appalling.We all had a very nice time in Savannah for my sisters wedding.  Overall the stay was not that bad.  However, I will not stay at The Marshall House again, would rather just stay at a Hilton property, at least they are clean and I can get some damn TP.I am currently seated in the library portion of this ""esteemed"" Savannah hotel, and I can honestly say that I am overall disappointed with my stay. If you want the hospitality the south is known for, you won't find it here! The staff come off as very standoff-ish and when they do approach you, it is evident it's painful for them to interact with guests. One bartender in particular was extremely rude to me by ignoring me and my friend and making sarcastic comments when he finally did decide to grace us with his presence. I gave this place two stars because the overall hotel is beautiful! I was very satisfied with my room and found it quaint and charming. I knew the hotel was advertised as being haunted, I totally believe it! It was hard to sleep the two nights I was there, I suggest ear plugs . There is definitely a creepy vibe to it which I feel adds to its charm. When you come here, you're paying for the hotel building itself, that's it. Do not expect out of this world hospitality, but mediocre at best. I doubt I will stay here if I decide to journey back to this beautiful historic city...My boyfriend and I recently stayed at The Marshall House for two nights.  We were very happy with this hotel.  It's old, boutiquey, and we even had some weird experiences occur during our stay in Room 217.  A few times, items were knocked off shelves or the back of the toilet, even with no one around.  This was nothing compared to the colorless and odorless wet spot that appeared on the bed out of nowhere at 1 am.  Yes, the boyfriend had been out drinking, but this was not because he wet the bed.  Google ""ectoplasm"" and be prepared to be freaked out as well as grossed out.  Weird, ghostly bodily fluids aside, we had a great time.  The location is perfect as we literally walked everywhere the entire weekend and didn't complain.  The hotel is gorgeous, the staff friendly, and overall, we enjoyed it here.The hotel was nice and had a colonial style to it. It was in a good location and walking distance to everything. The only thing I didn't understand was the price for the room. Seemed very expensive for a basic room.We had such a wonderful time at The Marshall House. The front desk staff and bell boys were amazing. We didn't see any ghosts, probably because we were so exhausted from a full day of flying so we fell asleep quickly and didn't wake up until the morning. The breakfast in the morning was top notch. Great eggs, biscuits, fresh fruit, oatmeal etc. However, one of the cooks left a sour taste in our mouth. He came over once we sat down and told us he and the other cooks were working hard in the back and asked us to leave a tip under the ""bucket"" which was a basket of fake peaches on our table. We didn't mind at all and smiled and nodded. He was nice enough and the food was great. A few minutes later he came back by and was a little pushier than before. He mentioned the tip again. Then he came by a THIRD time and said you better be leaving me a tip under that bucket. It just felt very awkward. We were planning to all along but he made us feel like children being scolded and warned. There's nothing worse than someone constantly reminding you that they're working hard while you're on vacation living it up. You start to feel guilty for enjoying a vacation you worked hard for. We ended up leaving a tip but felt like he could back off a bit about it. Not sure if everyone else has had the same experience.  Other than that, we loved the place. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat. Can't beat the location and architecture of the hotel!My husband and I stayed for our two year belated honeymoon. We were treated with five star service the moment we pulled up to the curb for valet parking. The room was beautiful (and haunted! We had our own paranormal experience while staying) and the staff are amazing. Anything we needed or asked about was promptly delivered. The hotel is within walking distance of anywhere you'd like to go in Savannah. I can't wait to stay again!Centrally located, very clean rooms, nice old charm. Staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Highly recommend getting a balcony room. We will return!","Very nice hotel with great amenities, central location, and all the ghosts you could ever want. We stayed in the Joseph Gordon Levitt (?) suite on the second floor. We checked in during a particularly ominous thunderstorm, which definitely added to creepiness. The lights would dim every time the thunder struck and the falling rain was rattling the window panes. As far as ghostly activity goes, we had a few weird experiences. The first was an odd smell in the hallway that seemed to disappear as quickly as it arrived. We were standing in the hallway talking to other members of our party who were staying in a different room when a disgusting smell overwhelmed us. It smelled like rotting ass. But then it was gone, just like that. I'm sure we just got a whiff of the two hundred year old building's plumbing issues, but it had an unsettling effect. The other ""ghost"" experience I had was a bit creepier. We had a party of ten, staying in four different rooms (2 suites and 2 norms). The entire party was hanging out in one of the suites when nature called and I excused myself back to my room to politely answer. I was minding my own business dropping a deuce when someone (something?) banged on the hotel door very loudly twice in quick succession. It's a good thing I was already on a toilet because I'm not ashamed to say that scared the crap out of me . I paused and waited for something else to happen. Nothing. I figured it was my brother-in-law or wife messing with me, but seeing as how I had been quite literally caught with my pants down I couldn't really investigate. So I set to finishing what I started, when it happened again. Two loud bangs, very quick. My heart was starting to beat faster and I decided that should today be the day I'm finally murdered by a vengeful ghost, it's not going to happen in the bathroom. So I finished up, went out into the room, and looked through the peephole...nothing. I opened the door and walked out into the hall...nothing. I went back in the room and called my wife and asked who was messing with me. She said they've all been in the suite since I left and no one has parted from the group except me. So, figuring I was going crazy, I sat on the couch in the room and started looking for local restaurants to eat at for dinner. One last time, two loud bangs from the front door. This time I could see the door move with each bang, like it was being hit from the outside. I ran to the door and--because I'm super brave--sheepishly looked through the peephole. Nothing was there. I opened the door and looked down the hall. Nothing was there. My wife still claims no one was messing with me. Either she's lying or there's a ghost in the Marshall House that gets his jollies from scaring people when they're at their most vulnerable. Also, free continental breakfast.I stayed at the Marshall House about a year ago after taking a last second long weekend trip to Savannah.  My girlfriend and I could not have been happier with the hotel.  We loved its historic charm, the location in the heart of Savannah, and the friendly/helpful staff.  The free wine &amp; cheese in the afternoon was a nice, unexpected bonus as well. We heard the haunted stories about the hotel prior to staying here but no ghosts accompanied us during our stay. :)Overall this is a great hotel and we will stay here again next time we visit Savannah.Charming location!!This place exudes southern charm! The staff is very friendly and makes you feel very welcome! The breakfast is nothing special, but it definitely has something for everyone to feel full. Our room was small, but again, checked all the boxes. The location cannot be beat, it's wonderful and always something to do!! Can't go wrong!Excellent place to stay while in Savannah. The staff is great! They are very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was not bad at all. Now from 5-7pm. They have wine and cheese complimentary to all hotel guest. You can have as many glasses of wine as you like. Now that was awesome. Hotel and rooms are super clean. Beds where very comfortable and room was cosy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was not as historic as the pictures show on there website. But the rooms do look like they are from the 1920'sWhat a lovely hotel! We were traveling with a toddler and know she awakens easily with sudden noises. We requested a room away from ice machines and elevators and they were happy to oblige. The Sunday breakfast was delicious with eggs and bacon and the Monday breakfast had hot quiche. The breakfast workers were very busy, they probably could use another person in there helping to refill small stuff (like the strawberry jelly and ketchup for instance) but overall our stay was amazing, the staff was soooo pleasant! We were greeted by everyone, doors were held open for us, staff took a real interest in us. There was a real southern charm to the place. And you can't beat it's central location! Unless you want to be on River Street, but that night scene isn't for us. We much preferred City Market and the historical sites which are VERY close to the Marshall House. Thanks for a great stay!Everyone is so nice here, the staff has gone out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our weekend.  Great location.and decor.  Next time I won't be so close to the elevator and ice machine though.Stayed here on business for three days. Staff were very welcoming and helpful.  The house is in the middle of town and convenient to everything. The locals love the restaurant adjacent to the hotel. You can sit in the lobby and listen to the accents to your hearts delight.  I stayed in a room on the 4th floor named after a journalist and writer, Joel Chandler Harris.  Honestly, didn't sleep too good. Heavy footsteps and children up and down the hall made it a little too eerie for me. Beautiful room and hotel if that unexplained stuff doesn't bug you.The Marshall House is a historic hotel on Broughton Street. Extremely well located for tourists who want to experience downtown. The rooms are quaint and some overlook Broughton Street. There is valet parking and bell hops who open the door for you all day long with a smile. There's wine and cheese hour around 3, if you're getting the munchies before dinner. Service is friendly. The attached restaurant (45) is very very good. They even make gourmet small pizzas which are an explosion of flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the noise. Our room was next to the elevator and you can hear people come in and out. Choose a room further down if they're available.Stayed their for one night last week, and it was outstanding!! The Marshall House location is perfectly suited to walk anywhere you want to go in downtown Savannah. But, the MH has some of the most courteous and professional staff. They go out of there way to make sure you are enjoying yourself and have everything you need. They even kept our bags until later in the afternoon (as our flight did not leave until later in the evening). We had the pleasure of having a room on the 2nd floor, where you can open your window to step out onto a massive, beautiful, wrought iron porch, with rocking chairs. They encourage touring the floors of it's artwork. They offered complimentary evening wine, hors d'oeuvres, desserts inside the main parlor, along with a huge variety breakfast served in a cheerful, sun lit, courtyard. Definitely put the Marshall House on your to do list!!!Wonderful place to stay in Savannah. Staff is extremely helpful. We definitely plan on staying here on future trips. They have wine and cheese during the week and are central to everything in historic areaMy wife and I lodged at The Marshall House because of its location and history.  It is the oldest hotel in Savannah, having been opened in 1851, and has undergone several renovations.  It is in Savannah's famous historic district and about one quarter mile to the riverfront.  This hotel has retained many of its original nineteen-century architectural features but has been updated with modern amenities, including wireless Internet and HD TVs.Our street-side room was very small, and the furniture, which was eclectic, had a bit of a worn-out look rather than being antique. Although it was clean and fairly comfortable, noise occasionally intruded from the street and from inside the hotel.  The inclusive continental breakfast that included quiches along with the usual collection of cereals, pastries, fruit, and drinks was fine.The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.  Charles who acted as a receptionist/concierge was especially obliging.  He provided us with an assortment of dinner recommendations, called to make reservations for us, and helped us navigate around town. Because The Marshall Hotel is well situated, fairly comfortable, and reasonably priced, I would definitely consider lodging there again.The Marshall house is definitely a historic building,  the rooms are Nice, and clean.  I was a little freaked out after reading about the Haunting but thank God i did not hear or see anything.  I love the customer service,  it's definitely a friendly crew.  I would visit againEnjoyed our weekend at the Marshall House. The location was central and super convenient for sightseeing (and just a block for Leopold's famous ice creamery!) and the room's were clean and nicely decorated. Our king room on the 2nd floor had a shared terrace with rocking chairs that was accessible by climbing out our window. I loved that feature and thought it was super charming.Fun fact: Evidently, there used to be a tax based on the number of doors that hotels had, so this was a workaround back in the day. Also loved the complementary wine and cheese in the evenings. Only thing I didn't love was the old (antique-ish) tub with the wrap around curtain. Seemed a bit odd but didn't leak water. Just not my cup of tea, I suppose. All in all a great stay!This really is an ideal spot to explore Savannah from - right in the heart of the historic district and steps away from the river. We spent a long weekend here and were super impressed with the quality of service. Every employee we encountered was friendly and professional and really seemed invested in making sure we enjoyed our stay. We had a king room on the third floor. I asked for a quiet room and that is exactly what we got - all the way on the end, we heard minimal noise at night. It was blissful. Room is well-appointed (including a safe and fridge) and charming (they've kept the fireplaces even though they no longer work). Bed was very comfortable and the bedding was of good quality. The continental breakfast wasn't terribly hardy (it would have been nice to see some protein besides just eggs), but it was sufficient (and really, you should be checking out Savannah's breakfast joints instead). We took full advantage of the valet service. At $15 a day, it was well worth it not to deal with the hassle of trying to find some place to park the car (streets and lots fill up fast - especially during high season and on weekends). If you're there in the off-season though, there is a parking lot right behind the hotel and you can purchase super cheap parking passes for 1 or 2 days.I've been wanting to stay here for years now due to the fact it's an old, historic property and it comes with it's share of ghost stories.  On a whim we were able to get a room for our one night in town and we chose a superior queen room.  It was small but perfect for me and my husband.  The furniture was cute, the tv was nice, bathroom was small and only had a shower but it was fine.  We were on the second floor and tucked away in a corner so we didn't have anyone walking by our room which cut down on any noise.  Some street noise came in but not too much to be annoying.  The hotel itself was beautiful.  The hardwood floors were definitely old and creaky but it added character.  The free breakfast was good and was a served in a nice room.  Hotel staff all seemed friendly and helpful, and the valet guys were very nice as well.  I would stay again when I'm in Savannah, and hopefully next time I will encounter a ghost or two! :)A beautiful historic hotel in Savannah.  Staff are very attentive and kind.  Our room is lovely--old fireplace that was used to burn coal at one time, hard wood floors, gorgeous dining area that serves complementary breakfast.  Don't go to the chain hotels.  Stay here!I just returned from a 3 night stay at Marshall House and it was AMAZING! The decor is spectacular and it's the perfect setting for a trip to explore the history of Savannah. Comfy beds, nice rooms, free wi-fi, yummy breakfast, free wine and cheese, and excellent location.The only slightly negative thing I would say about this hotel is that it's on a busy, somewhat loud street. I had trouble sleeping one night because people were outside screaming and revving their engines (it was a Saturday night and I stayed in a balcony room). But, that's not the hotel's fault. All in all, a wonderful place to stay!An hour into our stay and the toilet clogs, when I call down the front desk they said they would send someone right up.  20 minutes later I find the plunger sitting outside of our room.  I had to unclog my own toilet!  That just shows me they skimp on customer service, I am not impressed!!Day 2 we tried the breakfast and the quality was terrible, the eggs were left under a heat lamp and had dried out and biscuits were dry and stale.  The room we had was an inside room that was stuffy and had no airflow. No matter where we set the temperature we could not get comfortable!As far as atmosphere it was great, but you are just paying for the name, not the service.  I would recommend looking at other hotels in the area first!Southern Ghosts are great hosts.I have been coming here for years and about 5 years ago on a cross-country trip after Mardi Gras, my buddy and I were able to get them to open up during spring cleaning and let us have the Mary Marshall suite. I took the bed and slept like the dead, he took the sofa and was kept up all night by the sound of kids shoes on the hardwood floors outside the door.The next morning after complaining to the front desk, the girl politely pointed out there was only one elderly couple staying on the opposite side of the building and that they locked the doors behind us when we came in the night before. Oh and that the hallway was carpeted, not bare hardwood. Spooky that the ghosts are so nice to a Yankee like me.Great stay.. Clean rooms, also excellent service.. Breakfast runs til 10am. Fresh eggs, bagels, fruit and juices. All included in your stay.. Walking distance to everything, all round great experience. Bewar of 20$ valet, and taxes.","A beautiful historic house in the heart of old Savannah. Not exactly a luxury property, but very comfortable and well maintained with welcoming staff. We stayed in ""Miss Marshall's"" suite. The floors creaked with history and the modern amenities were appreciated. I would definitely recommend this old dame for those who want to stay in the heart of the old city...Charming, historic hotel with attentive friendly staff.  But housekeeping/cleanliness standards need improvement.  Our room 219 had many hairs and stains on bathroom wall, dust/hairs on door frames and other surfaces, thick dust on blinds, dirty windows and mold growing on lampshade.  The floor behind the claw tub was filthy, and the balcony table had crumbs and melted chocolate on it when we got to the room.  Breakfast was free but cold.  Note to management: you can't put an ordinary light bulb in a heat lamp and expect it to keep the eggs warm.  If this hotel could address the cleanliness issue, it would be an outstanding property.The rooms are good, and the location is great.But what makes this exceptional for a small hotel is the service. They were incredibly kind, always willing to help, and were knowledgable on anything a traveler could want to know. Even one of the cleaning guys went on and on about how much he liked working there. The only cons were that some of the towels had stains on them, and the wifi was dismal on the top floors. I'd certainly stay here again. Service can't be beat for the price.Great history and beautiful room. Loved the location and balcony space overlooking downtown.Charming hotel, conveniently located in the heart of Savannah.  It is reasonably priced.  Rooms are clean, furnished in vintage style.  Doors and walls are thin. So you will hear your neighbours and people walking in the corridor.  WiFi reception is sketchy and internet is slow.  Hotel provides two free bottles of water per day.  The best part is 5:30pm-7pm wine&amp;cheese reception. They keep pouring wine non-stop. It is accompanied by tasty lemonade for those who prefer non-alcoholic reception.  3 types of cheese were available (supermarket pre-cut cubes).  Assorted crackers and fresh grapes rounded up the choices.Hotel serves free breakfast from 7am to 10am. It consists of cereal, eggs, pastries, fruit salad, bagels, butter, cream cheese, 3 kinds of juice (apple, orange grapefruit), coffee and tea.Parking is valet only, $15 per day (plus tips). At times we had to wait for more than 20mins to get the car. I recommend to call the front desk in advance.  There is a concierge desk. However in all 3 days of our stay concierge was MIA.Haunted - try the 4th floor. Clean &amp; great customer service.As a girl who admittedly usually finds the cheapest hotel possible in a city, I ended up with with a bunch of girlfriends for a wedding this past weekend.  I see why people upgrade from the cheapest apartment in town!  The hotel decor was super cute with floorboards and a closet cabinet for us.  Great location to River St, very walkable.  (Important when coming from NYC!)  We had an upgraded breakfast due to the wedding, but it was delicious and the ""normal"" breakfast looked like it would have held me over quite well.Most important...literally two minutes before leaving for a flight, I took out a necklace and then dropped it on the floor, and it slid through a hole between one of the floorboards.  Not the nicest necklace, but huge sentimental value.  I tried to fish it out, but asked one of the managers for help.  She couldn't get it out either, but promised me that they'd try the next day.  I got a phone call the next afternoon saying they'd been able to get it out and am mailing it to me.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!Several stays later... and still a fan.  Wish they had their own parking lot, but aside from that very accommodating.  Concierge service was excellent in helping our party of 9 find accommodations at restaurants and venues for entertainment.Will stay again and again.We stayed here the past two nights. Great location between the river and all the parksWe were just in town for a night while on a road trip and had never been in Savannah before. We checked online reviews the night prior and this hotel seemed like the sort of thing we usually go for (we like historical and quaint), so we booked a reservation there. Had no idea it was haunted when we booked it. We were given a room on the fourth floor (cozy, a little small, but charming) with a view of a parking garage (not outstanding, but what can you do when they build a parking garage next to a hotel that's been there for like 150 years). It was nice, but the ceiling fan started spinning veeeeery slooowly by itself, there was a bizarre freezing cold spot at the foot of the bed (my side of the bed, of course), and a loud slow rapping sound coming from the inside of the wardrobe woke up my husband at 1:00 in the morning. I mean, I'm okay with ghosts as long as they don't mess around with stuff too much, but it kind of freaked me out a little. The bed was comfy, though, and the location was great. I'd stay there again, but I would probably ask next time for one of the less haunted floors. They told us when we checked out that floors 2 &amp; 4 have the most activity reported. Just be aware of that if you stay there.I conveniently delayed booking at my conference's hotel until it was all full.  Darn.   So instead of a small, generic room, my wife and I stayed in the James Johnston suite for the same price as the conference's rate.  Ten-foot ceilings, a sitting room, letterpress dies on the wall...  And the walk to the conference?  Five minutes, including a stroll through one of Savannah's wonderful squares.  The evening wine and cheese time is a delightful break from the sheer overload of a SIAM conference.  And the location is great for wandering old-town Savannah.  And for eating yummy ice cream down the block.This is not what I would call a bed and breakfast, but I'm not complaining.  They have a 24 hour staff.  Their doorman rushes to open the entrance.  The breakfast is an upper-end continental buffet.  The bed is quiet and comfy.  We were over the courtyard, but we were up early enough that we never heard any breakfast noise.Oh, and unlike the major hotels, the wireless network functions perfectly, and the ironing board is full-sized.  I'd call this a *better* choice for business travelers than the big brands along the river.  Prices might be scaled differently during busier seasons.Never did encounter any ghost-like activity.Being haunted and historic is what makes this place awesome! Every weeknight they have complimentary wine/cheese. I loved waking to the beautiful garden room where breakfast was served. The conditioner was also pretty sweet, it made my hair really soft.This is a super sweet place to stay in Savannah!-Super comfy bed with nice cotton sheets and a light cotton robe to use while you stay.-Super yummy expanded continental breakfast buffet each day included in your room rate. Quiche (pork and veg options), bagels, muffins, danishes, biscuits, cereal, yogurts, fruit salad, 3 juice selections, tea, coffee...really nice!!-Sunday - Thursday FREE wine, cheese, crackers and grapes in the front parlor from 5:30-7pm. Great way to start the evening!!-Excellent location in the middle of historic downtown area with lots of entertainment options within walking distance. We didn't see or need our car for the duration of our 2 night stay. Plus there is a free bus system (DOT) that gets you out a little further.Our room was small with only one window, but it allowed me to sleep a little later than usual which was a bonus. We didn't see any ghostly activity which was disappointing. There was a small fridge in our room which was a nice bonus. FREE wi-fi!!!Our stay here was perfect. We were worried about how the valet would work at check in, as the valet was right on Broughton street, but the valet was very efficient and went very smoothly. The valet took all of our luggage to our room. The room was just big enough (we had the regular king room), the mattress and pillows were very comfortable, and I loved the claw foot tub and the large armoire and antique chairs in the bedroom. The atmosphere in the room was modern and comfortable while still retaining the history of the house. The wine and cheese in the evening was a nice detail. I even noticed that when we came into the hotel after it had been raining, they had towels by the door.Overall, I loved the attention to detail and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The history of the house made it feel cozy. The prices were also very reasonable and I would have definitely expected to pay more considering the location of the hotel and the quality of the rooms and staff.  I will definitely be staying here the next time I am in Savannah.We stayed in a veranda king room for two nights at the beginning of October. The veranda is on the second floor, directly above the front door. You get to it through the windows and it is roomy with rocking chairs and bistro tables. I only saw one other person out there all weekend, even though it is a nice place to have a cup of coffee.The location is pretty central for seeing the rest of the historic district. Easy walking distance to the Olde Pink House and the river, and really the whole historic district is walkable, only a mile from top to bottom.The room was a good size with two chairs, an armoire, a desk and a flatscreen. No minifridge in that room - its sounds like another reviewer had one, though. Bathroom was fairly tight, particularly the old-fashioned tub/shower - you know, with the feet. Pretty spooky too, with the curtain all the way around it, from inside or out. Between that and a modest amount of road/nightlife noise that was heightened by our constant watch for paranormal activity (which we did not see), we had a hard time sleeping.Everyone was very helpful, particularly the concierge, who was a tour guide with Oglethorpe Tours before. Be sure to ask them if you are looking for something to do.It was our great pleasure to choose this place to stay in Savannah, and we are really happy we did. The hotel combines awesome charm of the past with all the conveniences we expect today. From the free wine and cheese available when we arrived t the helpful staff, who told us the best places to visit around us. Breakfast was also great, and just sitting around the lobby was charming. I wish we had the good luck to find hotels like Marshall House every time we travel.If you love historic hotels, you will love this place.  Walking through the doors is almost like walking back in time.  I loved all the old woods, the oil paintings, and the abundance of Southern Charm.  It is a history buff's dream. If, however, history is not your cup of tea, you might find some problem with this place.  For one thing, it is located in the heart of a central business district.  That means no place to park.  There is public parking next door for $1.00 an hour, ($12.00 max per day), or you can use the valet, (I do not know what that costs).  Another thing is that, since it is a historic hotel, the rooms are not very big.  People were just smaller when the building was erected.  That also means that the baths and showers are pretty tiny, too - they had to be designed from something else since there wasn't indoor plumbing when in the beginning.  Also, at least from our room, the view was pretty weak.  All we could see was the parking garage where our car was.On the good side, the location is great for a stroll downtown, or to many ""city specific"" attractions in the area.  It's a nice starting point.  They also have a very courteous and helpful staff, and the breakfast buffet was nicely done - plenty of room to sit, and nothing ever went empty.  Personally, I would come back, (but during the week when rates are cheaper), because I just loved the way I felt so comfortable and relaxed.  This hotel really does give one a favorable impression of Savannah.I would not want to stay anywhere else. The Marshall House itself is charming and their staff is wonderful. I can't speak for the breakfast as we ate out every morning. We also never tried the wine and cheese in the evenings because we were so busy. I hope to return sometime in the near future to experience that and this wonderful hotel again. The beds are very comfortable and everything is very clean. We loved staying on the 2nd floor with the balcony access as well. If you want to have a pleasant and charming experience this is THE place to stay.When we first arrived at the Marshall house, we were greeted in the fashion of a four-star hotel. A bellman came and got our bags and brought them all upstairs for us. This is not something we were expecting as we thought we are staying at a bed-and-breakfast. Turns out that although it is a bed-and-breakfast, it's also a hotel. It is sort of a blend between the two. We had booked a petite queen room, and didn't really know what to expect. Upon entering the room, we discovered that it was rather small and cramped. However it was comfortable, and we had no major complaints.You simply cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is within walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see downtown. The Wi-Fi, while free, was extremely slow - like dial-up slow.It cost us $15 per day for valet parking. That included as many in an out's as we wanted, however we never took the car out one time because of the prime location.  Be aware that there really is no other parking option available, so if you are going to stay for more than a couple days it will be pricey to park there. They charge you $15 per day whether you take the car out each day or not. The breakfast was quite a disappointment. Offering only a couple quiches, And the usual assortment of bagels and toast, fruit and fruit juices, along with cereal and milk. However, when my wife went for the cereal she discovered that the milk tasted sort of sour. We noticed that the milk was sitting out without ice around it, for who knows how long. I let one of the attendants know as we left, and frankly she seemed annoyed. Since this place is billed as a bed-and-breakfast, you would think that the breakfast part would be better than it was. We skipped it completely on the second day-that's how bad it was.Overall, our stay was not that bad. However, it was not what we expected since we had booked a ""bed-and-breakfast"". Other reviewers on here have commented on thin walls, and I can confirm this. Thankfully there were not a lot of noisy guests near our room, Although we did hear people passing by in the hall several times.My significant other and I stayed 2 (weekday) nights in a Superior King room.  Overall, there was something to be desired about our stay.  Our room seemed so small, even for just 2 people.  The air conditioning was so loud that when it kicked on at night it would wake us up, as well as whenever someone talked on the other side of the very thin walls.  Parking is $15 per night and there really isn't another choice.  The turndown service they advertise on their website (soft lighting, soothing music, and sweets) apparently never made it to our room.  Their wireless internet didn't work so we had to request an ethernet cord.  Although the customer service was very good during our stay, I called prior to our visit and I was basically hung up on by the front desk staff.The one thing we did like about the Marshall House is the location.  It is right in the middle of everything and you can walk everywhere!","Really great location, upon check in we were told if we were caught without a smile on our faces we would be thrown out of the hotel! Everything was very charming, our room was small but cozy, I loved the high ceilings and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was very helpful in pointing us in the right direction with sigh seeing and even called tour companies to pick us up at the hotel. We sipped southern tea and played checkers in the drawing room while we waited for our tour to pick us up. There are some cool pieces of history all throughout the hotel if you care to explore and don't miss the morning breakfast.Great location and top notch staff. My only complaint would be the stiff bed and thin walls (heard every alcohol-fueled word, cry, and scream from the loud drunken guys next door).On another note, skip the wine and cheese tastings. Maybe we're a little spoiled living close to Napa Valley but the wine is just average and the cheese is mostly a party platter selection (cheddar and swiss). Otherwise, great place!Our recent stay at the Marshall House far exceeded my expectations.  Everyone we encountered there was super nice - from the valets who schlepped our bags upstairs, to the lovely woman who oversees their daily breakfast buffet.  With every turn we were greeted with a smile and a hello, and all seemed eager to make our stay as pleasant as possible.The service we received really was exceptional.  The staff were very accommodating when we made special requests for extra towels and such, and wake-up calls were actually made by human beings - cheerful ones, at that!  The optional valet parking couldn't have been more convenient, and we never waited over ten minutes when the car was requested.Not that we needed the car all that much - the historic district isn't all that big, and the inn is walking distance from a plethora of restaurants, bars, shops, and various other points of interest.Our ""superior double"" room was large enough for four people to occupy comfortably, and had a spacious bathroom with a roomy corner-installed shower stall.  The room was very clean, and while my travel companions complained that the beds were too soft, I personally found them to be rather comfy!  The room also sported a small refrigerator, which was nice.  (They sneakily installed it inside one of the bedside tables; be sure to explore the furniture!)In addition to the standard fare (cereals, yogurt, muffins, bagels, danish, fresh fruit salad), the continental buffet also boasted freshly baked biscuits and quiche.  (Word of warning to my fellow vegetarians - the quiche crust contains lard!  This is the South, after all.  Not sure about the biscuits.)  Coffee was decent, and tea, milk and fruit juices were all offered as well.The complimentary wine &amp; cheese, served evenings Sunday through Thursday, were fantastic and well enjoyed, as were the chocolates and weather forecast which were left for us each evening.  Complimentary bottled water was provided as well, and was replenished daily.  It's the little things...I've never enjoyed a hotel so much.  Our stay here was downright luxurious, and well worth the expense - especially considering that I've spent nearly the same amount on crappy chain hotels with questionable cleaning practices, crappy service, and zero charm.  I would totally stay here again, and highly recommend!Since we LOVE Savannah we decided to take a little layover on our way to Amelia Island.We took Amtrak from CT, and arrived around 8:00AM.  Unfortunately, there was not a room for us to go right into, but we were able to find a great breakfast a few blocks away at Hueys, and then do a little window shopping till our room was ready.  Of course, the hotel stored our luggage and had everything in our room when we arrive back ready for a nap.The building is lovely.  The bed was great, and we are bed snobs so that's saying a lot. We did have a room with a balcony, from which I am writing this post!  I highly recommend, if you can get one.  There are only six.  Our room is a very nice size, and has a lovely claw foot tub in the bathroom. There is also free wifi in the building. There is a nice wine and cheese reception in the beautifully appointed parlor.  We have not enjoyed breakfast, but will tomorrow, and I understand from others that it is very nice.  The hotel is very centrally located and on a street that is being restored to it's original glory days as a shopping area.  The buildings are all historically preserved and most are now occupied.  It is only a block or two from the river area, and really walking distance to anything you would want to see in downtown Savannah.  As the oldest hotel in Savannah, it has well stood the test of time and is a lovely reminder of days of yore.  I highly recommend this hotel. PS: If you are wondering WHY I didn't give Marshall House a 5 star rating, it's because I was not a fan of the woman working at the reception area this morning when we came in.  She did not greet us, was not helpful in directing us with our wait time till the room was ready, and kinda acted like she was working at a Motel 6 not a hotel of  this standing.  However, the bellmen was very nice and accommodating in her stead.I spent Labor Day weekend here with my mom and sisters.  The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  The folks at the front desk greeted us by name making us feel right at home.  The property is very clean and well kept.  All things considered, the rooms are well priced and Breakfast is included.  The hotel is centrally located and a short walk to almost anywhere in the historic district.  All the restaurants recommended by the concierge were delicious.  The hotel bar could have stayed open until midnight and on Sunday evening before Labor Day.  I recommend the Marshall House for anyone looking for some old charm with moder conveniences.4.5 stars Accommodations - 4 stars - Centrally located, rooms are adequate but some of the details are missing. For example, they offer cheese &amp; grapes during the evenings but their grapes weren't well-washed. Morning breakfast is offered but the menu never changes so if you stay there for 3 days like us, it gets monotonous. Towels were thin and not very soft.Service - 5 stars. The front desk is just unbelievably accommodating &amp; gracious &amp; will make reservations for you at hard to access places without hesitation. If you're lucky enough to have Brandt the concierge working during your stay, listen to everything he suggests. The man is spot-on. When we told him we would be checking out to drive to Charleston, he recommended we stop by The Old Sheldon Church on the way which we never would've found on Trip Advisor or Yelp. That place was AMAZING. Brant made our trip easy and memorable and we wish we could bottle him up and take him on all of our tripsIt's also worth mentioning, we had a small mishap during our stay here. But Russ - The Marshall House's manager - stood up and took care of it. He was a man of his word and we appreciated that. Will be recommending this place to everyone who comes to Savannah.My wife and I stayed at The Marshall House for our anniversary and we both really enjoyed the hotel.  They say it's the most haunted hotel in the most haunted city in America, but no paranormal experience here.  The hotel is in a great location on E. Broughton St., just a few blocks from River St. and a few blocks the other direction from all the shopping and touristy things you want.  The Marshall house was the first hotel built in Savannah but it hides its age well.The hotel was recently renovated and what a great job they did.  The rooms were decent sized with high ceilings, the original dark wood floors, tan walls and ceiling and a sitting area, the room was very comfortable.  The best part about the room was it had a ceiling fan...a home away from home!  They offer turn down service which consisted of two chocolates.  The bathrooms are small, but the space is used well.  We can't complain about that because there's only so much someone can do with a 100 year old hotel.  We were given a room on the second floor balcony and with the great weather it was perfect.  Too access the balcony you have to go through the window.  The walls are thin so we could hear pretty much everything, but it really didn't bother too much.  The only thing that was not so great was the housekeeping.  You really can not call them housekeeping, because all they do is step over the things around the room to make your bed and give us folded towels.  The bedmakers never organized one thing in the room or the bathroom, left the cloths as they lay, never reorganized the chairs, never replenished the toiletries.  It's not like we destroyed the room in the slightest, but the Holiday Inn does a better job at housekeeping. The staff was very friendly, welcomed us back every time, and they were very helpful in giving us suggestions for dinner or lunch and helping us out with tickets.  The week we were there was the beginning of the Savannah Music Festival which everything was already sold out for the days we wanted.  Reid, at the front desk, gave us some advice to score some tickets and it worked.  That night was awesome.  We never took advantage of the free breakfast because we wanted to see the city.  We didn't take advantage of the free wine and cheese on Thursday because they were out of wine.  The Marshall House a great experience and we both truly enjoyed our stay.  If the paranormal talk doesn't bother you then I would recommend this to anyone, only to stay in a balcony room.  They charge a few more for it but it's worth it.  The valet parking is $15.It's so wonderfully, perfectly Southern to climb through a floor-to-ceiling window on to a wrought iron balcony and sit in a rocking chair.And that lovely balcony overlooking Broughton, the main shopping street, is what makes the Marshall House probably the best hotel in Savannah.I was lucky enough to live in Savannah for 5 years. And when I went back for a visit with my best friend, we both knew the Marshall House was the only place we wanted to stayIt's historic and beautiful with a tasteful, genteel lobby and small, but lovely rooms. It's also in a fantastic location for visitors, right on the main shopping street and very walkable to City Market and River Street.And here's a tip for those that like to people watch. Buy a bottle of champagne at Parkers (open 24hrs) and go sit out on your rocking chair at 2:30am. The bars close at 3am, and people will be singing and stumbling their way home from Congress Street, which is just 2 blocks away.Why not 5 stars? I would totally give MH 5 stars except my best friend and I were treated a bit like second rate guests. My BFF had stayed there by herself a couple of times and once with her boyfriend, and she had experienced amazing service.But when we arrived they did not offer to take our bags up. (They always take your bags up for you in the elevator while you take the stairs.) No one ever got the front door for us. And when we asked the front desk to make a dinner reservation for us at the Olde Pink House, the lady at the desk seemed irritated at the request.Service was top notch! Beds were very comfortable, rooms clean and the little extras (like bottled water and happy hour wine) topped things off. This hotel has so much character and southern charm! The staff was extemely helpful, welcoming, full of smiles and seemed happy to be there (something you rarely find).This makes my rating 4.5:The only thing try could improve on just a bit would be the breakfast. It was good but could see where it could get really boring after a few days. It was fresh and they never ran out of anything just a bit boring.I will definitely be staying here again!We loved our recent visit to the Marshall House. We stayed here three nights and we actually stayed in the petite Queen which gives you just enough room to stand on each side of the bed and a good three feet at the foot till the wardrobe but you know, we LOVED it! We wanted this room specifically because we knew we would only be sleeping in the room and out exploring during the day. So we got all the wonderful details and charm of an expensive B&amp;B without the hit to our bank account! Our room overlooked the breakfast area and got a view of lovely flowers on top of the pergola. We never had any problems with noise at night (except from the air conditioner kicking on) or feeling cramped. The room was clean and comfortable and had lots of charm, as well as the rest of the hotel. The staff is really what made such great memories on our trip. It was just so easy. They were so helpful and always there to point us in the right direction, give us ideas for dinner or outings and to offer a smile and sweet hello in the morning.There were so many little touches that we loved like the turn down service with chocolates and robes set out. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the wine and cheese tastings in the afternoon. It wasn't top shelf stuff but it was free and you can't beat free!My husband and I just have so many wonderful and glowing things to say about wonderful and welcoming bed and breakfast. We are so excited to return someday and we will definitely be staying at the Marshall House again!Do you believe in ghosts?  No?  Well you will after you stay here!  My girlfriend and I had a beautiful room to compliment a weekend away in Savannah (spacious with 1800s charm I might add).  After we went to sleep on our first night, I woke in the middle of the night because it appeared as though a light flipped on in the room (I caught the flash out of the corner of my eye).  I groggily stumbled out of bed, opened the bathroom door and discovered the bathroom light to be on.  Hmmmm, maybe we forgot to shut it before we went to sleep?  When we woke in the morning, I asked my girlfriend if she left the light on in the bathroom.  She swore it was off when we went to bed.  Oh well, an oversight......... right?The next night, we decided to take a haunted walking tour of Savannah.  After an hour or so, our tour stopped in front of the Marshall House and our guide began telling the ghost stories associated with the hotel.  Strangely enough, one such story involves a mischievous ghost that likes to flick bathroom lights on and off on the guests.  As our guide spun his tail of the unexplained, my girlfriend looked at me with a worried look on her face.  It was then I knew I would be on ghost watch for the night because she wasn't getting any sleep!Great location.  Friendly Staff.  Nice room but a bit small.   My only negative was the surprisingly expensive valet parking charge.Great, great place to stay! Beautful hotel, gorgeous room, great ambience and history, great bellmen (they even retrieved my phone from our valeted car and brought it up to our room). Stayed in a Broughton balcony king room - great to have balcony access through your window...even if you don't spend a lot of time out there because it's so hot! Only complaint (and not worthy of a star deduction) is that breakfast gets a bit redundant by the third round of the exact same thing. But the quiche is tasty even on the third morning of it :)Oh how I loved staying at the Marshall House! My husband and I had stayed at the East Bay Inn previously (which we LOVED, huge room, private courtyard patio on ground floor). While walking around the historic district we saw the Marshall House with it's beautiful balconies and right in the shopping district! We decided then to make plans to come back to Savannah and stay at the Marshall House.We had great service from the staff right off the bat. Our room was very clean and comfortable. We got a room with a balcony view. We spent every night in the rocking chairs watching the activities of Savannah below us. It was so much fun.The room was tiny, but the bathtub HUGE, perfect for soaking after a long day of walking around in the heat. The bed was fluffy and very comfortable. We were out - either on the town or taking a nap - during the wine and cheese receptions. We ate breakfast down the street and not at the Marshall House.I just loved it there. I really hated to go!I absolutely loved the Marshall House! I've stayed in other hotels in the historical district and liked them, but they weren't available the last time I went to Savannah, so I took a chance on the Marshall House and am so glad I did!Let's start with the decor.  This is the oldest hotel in Savannah, and it has been lovingly restored. They artfully combine the charm and decor of an earlier time with the modern conveniences of today. The decor is absolutely beautiful in both the public areas and the guest rooms. The rooms feel very true to the period, with very high ceilings, crown molding, and antique furniture (desk armoire, etc.), but the bath accommodations are very modern, as is the flat screen HDTV.We had a double queen room, and I was amazed by how spacious it was. There was plenty of room for all of our stuff and there was even room for a sitting area with two chairs and a small table!In my spare time, I just walked around the hotel, looking at the pictures that are hanging on the walls in the hallways and public areas.  There are even displays of artifacts discovered on the site of the hotel during previous restorations.  It's like having a mini-museum right in the hotel.The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, from the desk staff to the housekeeping folks to the doormen, who are always there to open the front door for you with a friendly greeting, whether you're coming or going. The only bad thing I can say about the place was that they failed to clear our room one day.  I went down to the front desk to inquire about having our room done while we were out for dinner, and was told that there were no housekeepers working in the afternoon/evening. Nevertheless, the lady at the desk apologized and offered to get us extra towels or whatever we needed.  The next day, we were going to our room, and the housekeeper stopped us and apologized personally for not servicing the room. I was impressed by her ownership of the problem, and it made it  a non-issue for us.Also, I want to mention that I traveled with my elderly mother, who has health issues and uses a wheelchair. We found that, while the hotel hallways were narrow (as they are in most hotels that age), the elevator and the room were both wheelchair accessible, and we experienced no issues in that regard.As others have noted, it is supposed to be a haunted hotel, but I didn't experience anything paranormal. The decor is such that it looks like a place where you could see/experience spirits, though!Finally, don't miss the continental breakfast! Served every morning, this is not your run-of-the-mill buffet with stale pastries and watery juice.  Everything is fresh and delicious!  It includes:  large bagels in several flavors, along with jams, peanut butter and cream cheese for toppings; several different quiches (really!); fresh citrus fruit cocktail; delish biscuits and preserves; three fresh juice options; an assortment of pastries; several different cereals and milk; coffee/tea; and fresh muffins the size of your head in chocolate, blueberry and banana.  Tip: go early to get the freshest, best selection.Trust me -  you'll love this place!  Would be nice for a romantic getaway, too!THE.BEST. I love this hotel so much and I will be back for sure. This has to be the most unique and beautiful hotel I have ever seen. There are so many tiny details in this place that made it great. The hardwood floors, the high ceilings, the furniture, the cute bathroom, the huge windows. I loved it all. My favorite thing was probably climbing through the window to sit on the porch with my husband while we ate our ice cream from across the street. It was such a cool experience. The best thing about this hotel though is hands down, the amazing staff. They went above and beyond helping me make this a special trip for my husband's birthday. I am so incredibly grateful to them. Thank you so much! We had the best time!This hotel was beautiful, clean, and the service was wonderful. The breakfasts in the morning were delicious and filling. The only con, and it's a big one, is that there is a lounge and bar across the street and it is sooo loud at night that I have a hard to sleeping. The bass and music and obnoxious shouting is incredibly annoying. If I stayed here again, I'd ask for a room on the opposite side. I advise you to do the same! -1 star, Marshall House.After discovering that pretty much every Savannah B&amp;B was booked (darn music fest) on our anniversary weekend, my desperate phone call was finally transferred to The Marshall House from another hotel, in a last ditch effort.  Let's just say, at this point I was ready to book our stay anywhere!  But, because The Marshall House was our last resort, I didn't have high expectations for it.Wow, were we pleasantly surprised!  The Marshall House was:-Adorable!  Nicely renovated but with it's original Southern decor and charm.  Our room was tiny, but for just the two of us, it was plenty, and we spent most time walking around town anyway.-Hospitable.  The entire staff called us by name every time we walked through the lobby...as they were opening the door for us.-Yummy.  All we needed was a continental breakfast, and their expanded continental fit the bill.  Try the Quiche Lorraine!-Helpful.  The front desk staff was eager to help us suggest and book any activities or meals.-Perfectly Located (see below)My hubby and I were Savannavirgins, so we had no concept of best location, close to great restaurants, shopping, tours, etc.  The Marshall House is prime.  It's right on Broughton, the main shopping thoroughfare, walkable to the City Market and other delicious local restaurants and the river, and they provide complimentary shuttle service to the HQ for all trolley tours.  The only negative was the moderate noise.  Because our room was located over the atrium (where dinner/drinks and breakfast are served), we heard lots of noise from people and clanking dishes.  However, we just ran the AC/fan in the room and that drowned it out.We definitely recommend the Marshall House.  What was a last resort for us this time, will be our first choice on our next trip!Wow wow wow loved this place it is a must stay. From the time you step out of the taxi and meet Armando to your good bye hug to will love this place.  All the rooms still have old southern feel but are clean and comfortable.  Wine and cheese in the living room before dinner and walking distance from everything it was well worth it :-)My husband, baby and I have just enjoyed a 2 night stay at The Marshall House. The location is great, the rooms are beautiful and full of character. The breakfast and wine happy hour are nice bonuses. The staff so far has been wonderful, nice valet guys, the concierge welcomes you upon check-in, but..... This morning I left my bag in the dining room. Through a random and rare occurrence, I had tons of cash stuffed in every pocket and my wallet was so full of cash it didn't even close. You know how this story ends right? I totally deserved it. Oh, but wait, a guest turned in the bag and the front desk returned it with not a $20 bill out of place. A fairy tale ending!","Great experience here. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Check-in was a snap! The rooms were clean and cozy. We felt very comfortable the whole time. The wifi was very weak and often inaccessible -- at least in our 4th floor room.  No ghostly experiences either. :) probably 5 stars if we had one.Overall, we loved The Marshall House, but we only stayed there one night.  The individual at the front desk who greeted us upon arrival was fantastic and incredibly helpful.  We arrived around 10 PM on a Sunday and he helped us track down a restaurant that was actually open since we hadn't had dinner yet.  We loved the lobby and room decor.  We also thought the hotel personnel was terrific throughout - great customer service.  Access to the historic downtown and River Street areas were about as good as one could get.There were really only two drawbacks: 1) the shower was hard to figured out and ultimately had very poor water pressure, and 2) the thin walls made our stay fairly noisy.  We were lucky that the other hotel patrons were relatively respectful when it came to noise, but we could still here conversations and loud television programs nearby.We had such a wonderful experience at Savannah's Marshall House, even down to the bed linens. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We were treated like gold and we cannot think of anything that could have been made this experience any better. The hotel even had a complimentary wine and cheese reception Thursday night. The location is ideal because it is so close to everything we wanted to do during our stay. We will definitely be staying here again.It's HAUNTED.  I kid you not. I do not believe in spirits or ghosts, but believe me, I experienced some very unpleasant things. It is very overpriced for the room you get. They do include breakfast, and it was nice enough, but very little variety.  We actually left early. The staff is amazing, but the hotel is so loud. It is obviously very old, but it is nearly impossible to sleep with all of the noises. Every step you take creaks.  I was jut not a restful place to be at all. The location is very good. Fr those who are able to sleep through a lot of noise and are not bothered by ghosts, go for it. I was not for us. The bell staff was terrific!Marshall House was the first hotel built in Savannah, GA and is also considered one of the best accommodations for those who are seeking a haunted experience.  During the end of the Civil War, the Union Army took over the hotel and converted the place into a hospital to care for injured Union soldiers.  So you can imagine the number of deaths and unrested souls that probably took place on this property.  Since then, it has been renovated in the last 10 years and has been voted the Best of Savannah hotels as well as featured on the Travel Channels' Best Hotels and Haunted Hotels show.The rooms were small but really cute with nice comfortable beds.  They even have turndown service though we never utilized it.  The only downside is that it is freaky to think about how many people who died there, so if you are sensitive to the paranormal this may not be the place for you.  But if you relish in that sorta stuff like my friend does, then this place is perfect.The hotel is situated right on East Broughton street which runs in the middle of downtown so was walking distance to all the restaurants and sites.  It was nice not having to spend cab fare for once.  It's also a block from the SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design) library and theater, which is cool because you can see the influence that this school has on the city.Amenities includes access to a gym a block over, and free breakfast in the morning as well as free wine and cheese in the afternoon.  Parking was less than $15 a day.  We found the best deal booking directly from the website.  It was surprising how affordable this place was considering all these extras but then we are sharing the place with ghosts and it does get spooky at night.Originally, we booked a hotel on the outskirts of Savannah.  Just a week before our trip, we decided we wanted to be in the heart of things.  The Marshall House was just about our only option... as most other places were already booked full.  So, we read the reviews &amp; decided to just go for it.  Hands down one of the best decisions we made re: this trip!  Loved the historic feel of the hotel.  The bed was so comfortable... slept better than at home!  Noise? Sure, but not excessive.  Ghosts? Maybe. ;-)  The addition of quiche to the continental breakfast was a nice touch, as were the fresh roses on the tables.  The staff was most gracious.  Yes, you do have to pay for parking, but it's well worth it.  Let the valet park your car, put on your most comfy shoes or sandals and start walking.  You couldn't be in a more centrally located spot.  Bonus!  Leopold's Ice Cream is half a block away.  Indulge yourself all the way around.Savannah, Georgia is one of my favorite places and the Marshall house is the gem of that city (in my humble opinion). Not only is it a hot spot for history buffs (I'm a sucker for a claw-foot tub) and paranormal enthusiasts (like myself), but it also stands above and beyond any other modern hotel in customer service and cleanliness. The Marshall House staff is southern hospitality at it's best. Now, for you paranormal nerds out there (like myself), the 4th floor is known to be a host to many unexplained occurrences, but I would say the entire building is packed with energy from it's use as both a hospital and hotel for so many years. We opted for a second floor balcony room, which I recommend. It just doesn't get any better than this place!Stayed at the Marshall House in June 2011.  I didn't write a review at the time, so my details may be sparse.  But, I remember it was a nice hotel.  It was very quiet and the room was nice (although the bathroom was a bit small).  The staff was very professional &amp; nice.  Parking was valet only.  Location was great - a short walk to Lady &amp; Son's &amp; River Street.  Good value for the money.I used the Marshall House for my wedding room block...all of my guests experienced exceptional customer service, and high room quality. This is a terrific lodging choice in Savannah, you wont be disappointed!Great location, clean rooms, nice continental breakfast and awesome service from Shannon, Carlton and Kyle. Evening wine and cheese was a bonus.Lovely place to stay!I stayed at the Marshall House for three nights in August. The service was excellent. Very quick check-in. Great valet service. Though it would have been cheaper to park the car myself and the parking garage is only just behind the hotel. The people who worked there were very friendly! I told them I wanted to take a tour and they called up and made me a reservation. They were also helping another family get reservations for other activities. The room was nice and bright. I loved the hard wood floors. The bathroom was fine. It could have been a little cleaner, but maybe I'm just picky. The living room/library area is beautiful. They have a complimentary breakfast with tons of fresh food that was constantly being freshed up. Numerous juices, bagels, muffins, cereals, and even some type of hot egg dish. Souffl maybe? I don't know I'm from the mid-west and I'd never seen it before.A great stay in a great area. I would highly recommend staying at Marshall House.The best of the best.  They accommodated our special dietary requirements.  The concierge was exceptionally helpful. Brandt was not only helpful but was very knowledgeable about the best restaurants, tours and places to visit.  If we go back this is the place we will to to stay at.Awesome place to stay in downtown savannah, within walking distance of almost everything! The staff was also very friendly. There was wine and cheese served every evening which was very nice. Also, the continental breakfast was good providing quiche in lieu of the ordinary scrambled eggs. Just be aware that the hotel is haunted! We experience strange on goings each night...which we thought added to the downtown historic ambiance.","['great', 'hotel', 'located', 'perfectly', 'historic', 'area', 'across', 'street', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-historic-district-savannah,Hampton Inn Historic District,4.0,$$,43,"This hotel- five stars, for sure!I arrived super early and wasn't sure if they would let me park my car there or leave my bags, but they had no problem with either! The front desk staff was great! They allowed me to enjoy the breakfast/coffee that was going on while I waited for my friend to arrive. I enjoyed some fresh coffee and a cinnamon roll while I worked on some homework. (Free WiFi!)The room was large and very clean. I am all about some Hampton Inn's for this exact reason. Their bellhops were also so nice and helpful! Upon leaving, we were double checking the closets and found two pairs of boots in there that did not belong to us! We advised the front desk staff and even though it didn't bother us at all that they were there, they credited us back our valet parking charges- stating the room ""wasn't fully clean"". That was incredibly nice of them to do! I would certainly stay at this location again- the staff, room, location is all perfect.We stayed here for our honeymoon.  The location is great. You can walk to just about anything in the historic district and you are the perfect distance off river street so that you can get there in a couple of minutes of walking but don't have to put up with the noise of actually being on river street. The room was fine, nothing special but well above acceptable. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. The pool was small but was cool to look off the roof at the city below. The price was actually pretty reasonable given the great location. The one quibble I had was the required valet parking which was an additional charge. But once you put your car in the garage you probably won't need it again until check. Again given the location it's understandable.My husband and I stayed at the Hampton from 4/7/15 - 4/10/15. I was unfamiliar with the Hampton. I was very impressed with their hot breakfast. I really appreciate any hotel that is willing to provide me eggs (or some source of protein) for breakfast. My husband had to explain to me that their hot breakfast is standard for most all Hamptons.  I think. Going forward when picking a hotel at the mid level price range Hampton may be my first choice for their hot breakfast. The other nice features of the hotel include a roof top deck with outstanding views and a pool. Each floor has vending machines. The hotel also provides you with coffee, fruit and cookies (although I always somehow seemed to miss the cookies when they were put out at and/or around 4:30, only saw the crumbs) each day. The location is also ideal if you planning on spending most of your time in Savannah, GA walking.I didn't love the fact that they charge you $20 a day to park your car (seems high). However at least we knew our car was safe. My only complaint is the rooms are clean to what I would consider a fair standard (e.g. our head board had streak marks on it). I also think the maid went through one of the snacks that I had left out. I would stay here again even with these complaints. I have a feeling if I had made more of stink about the maid, the Hampton would have taken care of it.Perfect location (say goodbye to your car until you are ready to drive back home - it's very central). The staff was very friendly (front desk even had a welcome gift for being newlyweds). The room was clean spacious and seems like the hotel was recently renovated. Breakfast was good, and I would recommend getting a room with ""historic view"" - we had a nice view to the river. Would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Savannah.Great location.  Be careful though as there is this one and then a Hampton Inn (&amp; SUITES) Historic District also.  That one is further out, but how do you have 2 hotels with the same name???Anyhow, clean &amp; great walking distance to things.We often stay in upscale Hotels but have often also stayed at Hampton's. This visit was June 14-18 2015. We didn't encounter any of the issues some folks have reported. Maybe the place is under new management. The helpful front desk, housekeeping, concierge desk, breakfast service and food and room were all excellent. All the staff really shone in their gracious hospitality. Naomi and Barbara at breakfast were the most helpful we've had at any Hampton, making sure that the guests were all taken care of. Just a tip for folks on rates. If you don't like the online room rates through the various travel websites, try booking directly with the Hotel. Often you'll do better and your wishes will be communicated. You'll need the savings because food in this area can be pricey. PS the location is tops, better than the other Historic District Hampton.Positives:very good location - really. a lot of places boast this, but they really aren't. this is just on the other side of the river street shops, right on Bay street, at the top of the historic district, top of the park system, and next door to ""Olde Pink House"" and ""b. Matthews eatery."" What does that mean? I can walk a nice little circle from my hotel to all the hot spots - yes I am OCD. The hotel is however, at the complete opposite of Forsyth park, but you have something like 20 other parks to visit along that walk to Forsyth park. Only you are much closer to the ""other"" things to do in the district: museums, river street, city market, food, and right on the trolley stop. For young people, the walking distance is easy, maybe 15 to 20 min walk from hotel to Forsyth park. For 50+ people, it's harder depending on your knees and back. The bike cabs cost about $10-15 one way, trolley costs around $20-30/day, carriages aren't taxis, and the taxi's aren't around the historic district too much. Bike rental in the area is pathetic - I think there is one decent company, but it's 1/3 of the way to Forsyth and they charge something like $30 for a day rental. Really, if you're not walking, what are you going to do in Savannah? A house museum can only take up so much of your day!Food - they offer a daily breakfast included in your hotel room cost. Pretty good layout and options. I had to bring some of my own food b/c I can't do milk/cheese/yogurt. But that's where their microwaves come in handy (in room and at breakfast area). Each day has different egg and meat options. The weekend has the ""good stuff"" like bacon AND sausage, choice bread like donuts, and better fruit like strawberries and blueberries. There is always waffle, yogurt, oatmeal, bagels, muffins, hard boiled egg, 2 egg options (scramble plain, scramble with cheese, cheese omelet, western omelet) and 1 meat option (sausage patty, sausage link, bacon). Another reviewer mentioned something about cookies in the afternoon, I was there 5 nights and never saw cookies. However, I did see constant coffee, tea, and 2 fruits laid out in the lobby. No grocery store IN the area. A few convenience stores for some basics. (We had a rental car one day and used it to go to a Kroger about 4 miles away.)service - very friendly and helpful. From the front desk to the cleaning crew to the valet to the breakfast ladies to some worker coming in to work for the day, noticed me running in the exercise room and brought me water from the front desk!Appliances - each room has a mini fridge and a microwave. ours worked. Mini fridge fit in: waffles, fake cheese, one box of leftovers, 2 water bottles, 2 cokes, and 2 'ziplock' small round containers. Kept everything cool enough to not go bad, but not enough to make ice. A/c worked but loud. Mini fridge was also loud.Cleanliness - room and serving areas were clean. Nothing felt gross. No problems with shower, sink, nor toiletNegatives: Pillows - The pillows are the softest things ever! Three piled high = maybe 2 inches under my little head (I wear children's sunglasses)! It was so bad, I actually had to go to Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy a pillow to relieve my neck and back pains. (I'm 30ish years old, but a ""tricky"" back, undiagnosed.)Bed - The bed is standard - I think it may have played a part in my back issues, but once I bought the extra firm pillow, it wasn't as bad (still hurt though) - I could knock it out with Aleve. Noises - We wanted a river view, so we got a little 34 x 24 sized window, which allowed in more sounds than views. While the river is cool, Bay street is more of a river for semi's driving to the highway. Due to the shipping docks nearby, there is CONSTANT semi truck activity along E. Bay Street. The people noise isn't really there, but there is no way to get away from the truck noise.Also, our mini fridge made some loud ""rain"" leaky noise when it kicked on, which was all throughout the night. B/c it would turn off then on, it could never become ""white noise"" - I used ear plugs until I figured out the fan from the air conditioner was SO LOUD it could drown out the mini fridge AND semi trucks and be left on all night to become the ""white noise"" I needed. (Once asleep, I am not usually a light sleeper, but I do require complete quiet to fall asleep.) Basically, light sleepers beware. I thought about changing to the city view, but once at the elevator, you know it's pointless there too - all that early morning activity of the city trucks can be heard. If you can handle white noise, just turn on the a/c or heating unit and put the fan to ""low"" for it to drown out the other stuff - it worked for me.Parking - they have a garage and charge $20 a day. There is another garage across the street - it always says ""full"" but we saw other cars still getting tickets to get in? I think most ppl would give this a 4 stars, but my back wants to give only 2 stars (+ 1 star b/c of my bought pillow.)Really adorable hotel in a great location. Walking distance to lots of places in the historic district. As usual, hampton has their free morning breakfast. They do offer great military rates! They do have a parking fee which is annoying. I believe the rooms have been recently renovated.If it's all about location, it's difficult to beat this Hampton Inn which is located right smack in the midst of the Historical District of Old Savannah and within easy walking distance to most of Savannah's historical sites and the best of Savannah's restaurants, such as my favorite, Olde Pink.Parking is by valet but one of the better, more helpful valet services to be found.My husband wanted to stay at the Hampton Inn because when he had come to Savannah before, he thought it had a great location in relation to the places we wanted to check out.  I've always been a fan of Hampton's and this one was great.  I opted for a ""Historic"" room which ended up on the higher floors and had a great view of Bay St. and the river too. It did have a great location!  It was super close to all the popular restaurants we wanted to visit and was right next to the river.  Even Forsyth Park and some of the other locations further into town were still within easy walking distance.Our room was clean and up to date.  The staff was very nice, everytime we passed someone whether they were in the middle of working or not, they greeted us.  We only went to the pool one day but it was a pretty good size for a roof pool with lots of lounge chairs.  My only complaints were that it was a little on the expensive side in my opinion for a Hampton and my husband wished there had been an exercise room. Overall I definitely recommend this place.Yes, it's a Hampton Inn, but the location is pretty amazing. Unless you need to park, in which case it's fairly horrific. Luckily, they have valet parking, which helps, but unfortunately they can only hold about two cars at a time, which stinks. Feel like a yo-yo yet?The good news is that you're close to the waterfront shops, so you can easily walk to about anywhere - even throughout the historic district. You aren't close enough to be annoyed by loud bars, however (they are at the other end). If you'd like to check them out, you are just a couple blocks away, so it works well for those, too.Staff is also very friendly, for the most part, and if you happen to be in town for a First Friday event, the rooftop pool is perhaps the best place to watch the fireworks. I just wish that they would turn off (or at least turn down) that annoying light, because the rooftop next door seems to enjoy watching whatever you are doing more than the fireworks, and with the bright light, they have no problem doing so.Had my car towed during a meeting in Savannah which is common given the city's need for revenue and the more police force then residents in the city. Taxis could not get me to the tow yard in time. Hampton inn had a shuttle for the airport but refused to take me 1mile to get my car. Had to go the next morning by taxi and miss an important business meeting. This is an example of trying hard not to go the extra mile for a long time traveler and dedicated hilton property stayer. I will remember this one Hampton inn and savannah. This would never happen in the better city I reside in - charleston sc.I'm a Hampton regular. I rate most of their properties 4 stars. That's your standard, clean, comfortable, cozy pleasant property. Occasionally, there is one that goes beyond that, and I give 5 stars. One that falls below average would get 3. This property is all about being centrally located in the historic district. There is a trolley stop just outside (great way to get around) and probably the best restaurant in the city, one block away (Olde Pink House). You can read my review for both. The hotel staff is welcoming and friendly. We arrived on a really cold afternoon, and really appreciated the fireplace in the lobby. And of course, the cookies are the best welcome of all : )Fantastic stay the staff are top notch! I love Ms. Pat in the breakfast area she is as sweet as can be. The staff make the hotel they are all very nice and courteous. Most of the front desk staff called us by name as we walked in. The rooms are comfortable, great tv selections but no in room movies to speak of but who needs that with Netflix on your I pad and whatnot. Pool is on the roof which is interesting tip only one elevator goes to the pool, if you can only get to the 7th floor there is a stairwell towards the back that takes you to the pool. The only bummer is $20 a day to park to me just add it to the cost of the room don't nickel and dime me.It has been a long time since I have been in a hotel and thought I was at a friend's house.  The manager Michelle was super friendly and always eager to help.  The hotel itself is located just across the street from River Street and minutes from many of the attractions downtown.  You are literally within walking distance from everything to see and do which is good since parking can be a bear around town.  Probably my only gripe would be the only parking is valet for $20 a day, unless you wish to park in a the city lot.  Which happen to be full and it was considerably cold so a protest would have been futile.  The complementary breakfast was decent, the warm foods you probably shouldn't expect a great deal, but they have cereal and waffles from 6-10am.  They also provide fruit and coffee 24/7.  The rooms were nice and the staff were all super friendly.  I even hung out at the desk for a bit talking to them.  Overall, I had a wonderful stay in a beautiful city.I really liked this hotel.  The hotel was decorated nicely for Christmas and the lobby is warm and inviting.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  Our king room with a city view was comfortable and had a lot us storage space.  It had a small refrigerator and microwave.  The location couldn't be much better.  Breakfast was good and there was a nice variety of proteins and carbs.  My only complaint is that the hotel only offers valet parking for $20.00 and the parking ticket notes that valets should be tipped.  We spent an average of $15.00 a day in valet tips.  I would rather self park for $20.00 a day.The positives:1. Very friendly valet staff !! They were even kind enough to offer to take our bags for storage while we waited for the room so we could leave the car.2. Close to river street and walking locals in the city.3. Nice welcoming entry with fireplace and seating area.The Negatives:1. Lack of general cleaning. The elevator doors looked as it they had not been cleaned in weeks. ( thank goodness the room was ok)2. All the doors on our floor were in need of paint. This isn't a motel 6 or econo lodge.3. Maid service cleaned - but they did not replace the empty tissue box that I left out to indicate it was out.4. While checking in - and it must have been the end of their shift- they forgot to give us the coupons for the tram and boat that were clearly part of the package room deal that we booked.5. This wasn't New York and yet they felt the need to way overcharge for a room - so not worth the $$.6. For two days they were missing half and half creamer- they really should have purchased some form a store and not used the excuse that the order hadn't come in.except for this place I usually find the chain a great place to stay - and I will skip this place if I visit Savannah again.Drew and I were down in Savannah last weekend.  The Hampton Inn on E. Bay  street is conveniently located in the historic district as the name suggest which is so convenient.  I've stayed other areas of Savannah and nothing beats convenience.The only snag with this hotel was, Drew had requested a riverfront view.  The front desk person advised that that bit of information was omitted from the reservation.  She further advised that Drew should have called that morning to assure a riverfront view.  WHAT???????? We ended up with a room on the 6th floor with smaller windows. The rest of the stay was good.  Free breakfast was surprisingly good. I would return and recommend.Stayed here for 3 nights over Memorial weekend.It was a very good experience right from the check-in.I was there for a wedding and had quite a lot of luggage plus golf clubs.The $15 valet is worth it and the bell capt brought our bags up to the room PDQ.The only complaint I had was the noise of housekeeping in the morning.They also ran out of robust coffee two different mornings  during breakfast.The room was nice, everything worked.The check-out was smooth and valet got my car up quickly and the bell capt collected my bags pronoto as well.The real attraction here is the location. You are right on East Bay with easy access to the waterfront. Many nice restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.You can't beat the location, and while it's not super fancy, the rooms are clean and comfortable.The mandatory $15/day valet parking charge bothers me, whether here or at any other hotel that charges the same fee.  Luckily there's a parking garage nearby that's cheaper.One interesting thing to note is that the Doubletree (also on Bay Street, just a couple of minutes walk away) is often less expensive and offers slightly nicer rooms and has a bar downstairs, as well as offering a nicer breakfast (a buffet as well as cooked to order items).  Of course, the Hampton Inn's continental breakfast is free, while the Doubletree breakfast is $15 per person unless it's comped as your HHonors benefit. So let's put it this way: if you're HHonors Gold tier or higher, the Doubletree breakfast is free, and better.  If you're not, the Hampton Inn breakfast is better because the Doubletree breakfast is NOT worth the money.","Like the three rules of real estate (Location, location, location), this is the main reason to stay here when you are visiting the historic city.  Within walking distance to the waterfront area and a number of good restaurants, this is a good place to stay.  The staff is friendly, the rooms are nice and although you pay a premium to park; at least it is valet. Would gladly stay here again.Well for starters, Savannah is a lovely little town and definitely entertaining for a solid 4 day extended weekend.  And, if you are going to be in Savannah, you might as well be right in the heart of it.  Hampton Inn in the Historic District is perfectly situated.  You really can walk to anything you might want to see and you will have a variety of restaurants, bars and historic sites right around the corner.  In the mornings, they offer a hearty and varied hot and cold breakfast buffet.  But best of all, the staff were super friendly and helpful, even taking the time to research a number of restaurant options for our vegetarian friend.  I had a blast in Savannah, and the hotel was the icing on the cake.  Stay here if you can!We stayed here for two nights following a wedding in Charleston, SC.Pros: great location, nice sized room, good number of cable channels, good water pressure in shower, valet parking or city garage nearby, the great Hampton Inn breakfasts, helpful front desk staff, lobby computers, free wifi, really helpful valet parking staff.Nothing went wrong for us during the stay, and we got along fine with the staff, so I'm giving the hotel 5 stars for our stay.Great location! Room was nice, clean, and comfy. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We passed on the breakfast and the valet parking. There's a public garage almost right across the street that was less than half the price. We'll stay there again next visit.Great place to stay if you want to stay near River Street. The hotel is one of the better Hampton Inns that we have stayed at. The lobby was clean and appealing, The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. The views from the roof located on the roof were very nice. The breakfasts were good, but not great. My only real complaint about this property is that if you opt not to use the valet parking, your choices are very limited, therefore it is almost a necessity that you use the $20 a day valet parking. I am not sure of the negative reviews posted, as we found this place very nice for our 4 day stay over the Thanksgiving holidays.If I could give 10 stars I would! GREAT location for a tourist, everywhere I went in the hotel extremely hospitable and friendly staff, nice atmosphere, good continental breakfast (included), helpful and courteous front desk staff, room staff, concierge and valet. The bed is terrific.  My only complaint, the shower head is too high--it needs to be lower for us short folks--but this property still gets a 10 in my book and a 5 in yelp's book!Great location right by the River/Walk. Service was nice all around. Free breakfast in the morning and they provide coffee and tea. Clean rooms and no issues. Pool on the rooftop had a great view. Can use valet parking for $20 or the parking garage across the street. Really enjoyed my experience here.If you want to be rudely awaken by obnoxious loud maids at 9 AM every morning of your vacation stay here. The towels were hard as a rock, I'd recommend bringing your own to avoid scratches.Back to the maids...not only were they loud but they clearly have never taken housekeeping lessons. I am pretty sure all they did was poorly remake our bed and restock the stiff scratchy towels in the bathroom.  They cleaned NOTHING.The valet was $20 a day....you can park across the street for $5 a day and your car will not come back with scratches on it. The continental breakfast was absolutely disgusting. They say nothing in life is free...save yourself a stomach ache and eat out. Positives..the room itself was decent, the bed was comfy, and the front desk staff was very nice.For the pricey $300/night room with no view I expected better and will seek out better in my next visit to Savannah. We will NOT stay here again!We stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to Savannah.When we arrived, the driveway near the entrance was in a state of chaos.  There was nowhere to park while checking in, so we risked illegal street parking while we got our bags inside.  Then we declined the $20/day valet parking for the City garage parking, which is directly across the street and is much cheaper.Our room, and the whole hotel, for that matter, was cloaked in a thick perfume, like a powerful ""air freshener"" had just been sprayed all over the place.The Room was small and unremarkable.  One small, unopenable window.  Minifridge, mini-microwave, flat screen TV, etc.  It was perfectly serviceable, but not a great room.On the positive side, there was always fresh, hot coffee available for free in the lobby, the complimentary breakfast buffet was actually pretty good.Final positive note: they have a really nice roof deck with a swimming pool.  Great views up there.Bottom line: if you can get a really low price on a room, it's worth staying at this centrally located hotel, even if the facilities leave a lot to be desired.Great location!!! Nice rooms!!! Friendly staff!Hi, we just stayed 4 nights at the Hampton Inn. It was fabulous, great service, wonderful staff, great views and free breakfast!!  It was the best. We will return next year!  Savannah is a wonderful vacation spot and walking city!   Thanks, K Great food, great prices.The Hampton was clean, friendly, and remodeled. I will stay here again, however I will not use the valet parking services again. It's $15 extra a day and they lost my car. lol. . . really. So I parked the car on my own for $7 a day across the street in the parking garage. If that one is full, then there is another one a block away. But really, the hotel is very nice and I'll stay there again.Just returned from a 3 night weekday stay at this property.  Location within the historic district is great which allowed us to walk everywhere.  River walk was conveniently located across the street and there were lots of good restaurants nearby.  Our room was what you would expect at a Hampton Inn (clean, decent size, small fridge and microwave).  Only problem I had was when we returned at night after a day trip to Hilton Head, the door wasn't complete closed after the housekeeper cleaned our room.  Thankfully nothing was taken from our room but it this was still unacceptable since we had our laptops in our luggage bags.  That being said I would stay at this property again.I am a Diamond member and noticed that I was charged only $10/night for parking.  I also got upgraded to a better view (of river) on a high floor.Great location, friendly staff, reasonable rooms, interesting lobby.  (not enough towels, but easily rectified by the friendly staff).This is a decent hotel in a beautiful location (a block from River Street in the heart of historic Savannah).  It's definitely not the place to go if you don't like noise, though, as the traffic on Bay Street can sometimes be pretty loud at night.  If you keep the fan on in your room all night, it will drown out some of the noise.  Also, they do have underground parking at the hotel but it's often full so you may have to park across the street.The staff was very friendly and helpful though, and the room was clean.  Overall it was a pleasant stay and I would stay here again.Nice hotel-great location.  Met our needs perfectly.I'm a fan of the Hilton chain hotels so when I found a Hampton right on East Bay it was an easy choice!  You're right across from the waterfront and all the fun restaurants, shops and bars on River Street.  This Hampton has a charming feel-- just like Savannah--but part of that means it's an older building.  The rooms aren't very updated and we could hear the traffic outside of our room way too easily.  There is no bar at night, but the front desk told us to walk right across the street to their sister property at the Holiday Inn Express to get our wine.  Walking across the street with my plastic cup of wine only reinforced how much fun Savannah is (no open containers) as I waved to the two officers hanging outside the hotel!  The only parking option is valet which was $15 a day, but it was nice to have them park the car and bring it up for us whenever we needed it (which was rare since the location is so great for walking).  But if you don't have a lot of luggage and want a cheaper parking option there is a garage right across the street.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  While I would stay here again, I'd be inclined to pay a little more to stay at the Doubletree for an updated hotel.My wife and I arrived at this hotel late one afternoon after travelling all day.  The Hilton reservation system was down and there was no way for us to verify that we had enough points to stay there using my reward points.  We spoke with night manager, Ron Hughey, who told us not to worry.  He checked us in and made sure that we had everything we needed.  Throughout our two day stay the staff could not have been more helpful.  The hotel was perfectly clean and the room was very comfortable.  It is located on the water front historic district, so it is close to everything.I was able to book a room that usually goes for $150 per night for the great price of $90 on Expedia!  The hotel was amazing and right across from River Street!  Everyone was so nice and very helpful on where to go eat (Hueys-for breakfast) and suggested a great Pub as well!  I will totally go back there on my ventures through Savannah, GA in the future.Great location, very clean, very nice staff, Good and cold air in room in hot weather!  Pool on roof nice bonus for kids.  Would stay again.  Take a noise maker if you're on a low floor facing Bay St. as traffic gets a little noisy on Friday/Saturday nights.  We were on 2.  Walk down the street a couple of blocks and eat at B. Mathews Eatery...awesome.","I rolled into Savannah early by about 5 hours prior to check in. The front desk clerk told me to check in around 2pm. No problem I toured the sultry city and found it lovely and I got to sweat off about 5 pounds from the humidity. I went back at 1:30 dead tired and she again said to check back at 2...still ok. She was very friendly. Two pm and they were checking in tons of people. So I went back at 2:30 and she informed me that my room was still not ready. I had not ordered anything special so I asked what was available. She said a much smaller room at a lower price. I SAID SOLD!! Give me the key lol. It was a very cute room...not that small at all and very clean. All in all a good stay and less expensive. Parking underground is free too! Continental breakfast complete with biscuits and gravy. Lord love the South!!We got into Savannah pretty late, around midnight arriving at the hotel. Parking was a pain, because the underground parking was full. We had to go across the street to the city parking deck. They were more than happy to charge this to our room... for $10 a night... the same cost as their parking... except the city parking deck only charges $8 a night. So we got hosed on the parking.When we made the reservation the only non smoking room was a handicap accessible room, which is OK, The shower is basically a curtain, with the shower. There is no stall, tub, or even a rubber grip to keep the water in. There are two drains on the floor, one by the toilet, and one in the shower area. After showering, the entire floor was wet and slippery. A bit dangerous, if you ask me. We were on the second floor, and we were street side, so it was a bit noisy at night. We're by no means early-to-bedders, but the motorcycles/noisy cars racing up the street at night kept me awake and flipping. The fan only moderately helped to mute this noise. The location was great, close to River street. The staff was very good as well, polite and friendly - the housekeepers were very respectful of the do-not-disturb sign. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this Hampton Inn.The valet parking is great and the lobby is impressive, but that's where the luxury stops. The rooms are TINY. The bathroom was so small that we kept bumping our hips on the stupid curved counter as we walked in and out. The A/C unit blocks more than half of the window, not that it mattered since our view was of a rundown school or office building of some kind. The TV was unusable because it was about a foot and a half too high for comfortable viewing and the remote had to be pointed STRAIGHT at it to work, which required lifting your arm into the air. The lighting in the rooms was the Worst! There is a 2-light swing arm sconce between the beds that is mounted so high up that you feel like its a spotlight. All the lamps in the room were awful, partly due to the fact that the hotel uses CFL's and partly because they are all pointed down like desk lamps! Also the parking is a ripoff at $15 and they lost my car.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/thunderbird-inn-savannah,Thunderbird Inn,3.5,$$,133,"When planning our honeymoon road trip a few months ago, it was the Thunderbird that brought Savannah to my attention. They were offering a Groupon &amp; I thought it was adorable. I will say that when purchasing the Groupon I ran into a few issues. I called first to see if I could use it on weekends. I was told yes, but all the rooms that were available on Groupon were already booked. I was bummed, but when I saw it was still listed on Groupon a month later I decided to try &amp; book it. I'm so glad it went through and that I didn't listen to the person who answered the phone that evening. When purchasing some souvenirs in the gift shop the employee I dealt with wasn't aware of the Yelp 10% check in offer either. No biggie, but if you're going to offer online deals like that I would make all staff aware.  It's so cute &amp; walking distance to everything. We had no problem with our room. It was clean &amp; what you would expect from a little retro motel. I immediately started snapping photographs. I also loved how they play oldies music throughout the parking lot. My husband &amp; I fell in love with Savannah &amp; will definitely stay at the Thunderbird Inn again.Spent two nights here, and couldn't wait to leave. First off, you have to pay $7.50 per night for parking. The pressure in the shower and sink was terrible! The room we stayed in (214) smelled like moth balls and there were fruit flies (or something of the sort) in the room. The bed comforters were stained and old.There were stains in the tub and on one of the chairs. This place needs some serious upgrading! No breakfast (only coffee and donuts) BUT, It is near the historic district...Inexpensive (40$ a night on groupon)... And pet friendly, Which are pros, but that's about it.  I would have rather paid more to stay at a nicer hotel. We almost left after checking in, but since there were no bed bugs, we decided to tough it out for the 2 nights.I really wanted this motel to be better but sadly it was not. I stayed there Friday through Sunday. First off, the staff was fantastic and that is the biggest saving grace of the place.  The front desk staff were always very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The cleaning crew did a great job as well.  The location is really good for historic Savannah and in walking distance to just about everything.  We loved the coffee and Krispy Kreme donuts too.  The biggest issue was the wear and tear of the rooms.  Our curtains had giant holes in them, the carpet was fraying and the room desperately needed to be freshly painted.  The rooms could also use a deep clean to get the edges and nooks that get overlooked during routine room cleaning.  The motel was right between being really cool and retro and being a complete dive.  You can't beat the Thunderbird in price but I wouldn't stay again.  They need to renovate or restore ASAP.How fun! Oh I'm a sucker for themed anything: Parties, restaurants, hotels....if there is a theme I'm loving it hahaThe room was just what we needed: Comfort and cleanliness. This isn't a fancy place at all, but it met our expectations in terms of the room and location, while exceeding our expectations in how friendly and professional customer service was. We arrived and Krystal at the front desk was EXCELLENT. She explained everything, suggested local spots, offered us to use one of their bikes for the day-----she was just fantastic. If you're a traveller who spends a lot of time in a room, spend the extra money for a fancy place. If you literally need an affordable room to sleep in, located near downtown Savannah, biking/walking distance from all the restaurants, shops and bars, then this is your place.Great place for the price is what I would most like to emphasize!  The staff was very friendly and the complimentary breakfast, popcorn, moon pies, and cola to name a few, were greatly appreciated.  This kitschy motel definitely is a great option if you're going through Savannah! :)For what it is, the Thunderbird Inn met my expectations. Check-in was a breeze and the staff was kind and helpful when we asked for recommendations for lunch.  I booked my room through Groupon with no issues.  Our room was clean but definitely on the smaller side.  Loved the retro feel of everything.  The bed was super comfy and that was nice. A couple of minor annoyances, our room (105) was in the very bottom corner of the L-shaped building shoved tight in front of the stairwell and the ice machine and immediately next to housekeeping.  So, in a nutshell, it was noisy.  People rudely filling ice chests at 7 am and housekeepers making a racket not long after sun-up made for an early morning.  Ask for another room if you can.  Breakfast is a selection of Krispy Kreme donuts, coffee and juice which, for my purposes, was fine but don't plan on having a heathy meal ;) with so many great places to eat in Savannah it didn't matter to me.Yeah I'd stay again, walking distance to everything, but I'd ask for a different room.I gave them five because: the accommodated us with a first floor room so we can get my mom's wheelchair in, clean comfy king size bed, the retro shampoo,  conditioner and lotion bottles, distance to city and access to highway system, neon 1960s sign, their effort to be an environmentally sustainable business and the 24 hour check in because we arrived at midnight.  No breakfast but they do have Krispy Creme donuts and breakfast drinks. Greyhound/train transit is right in front of hotel (no noise overnight). Be aware that you have to pay a 7.50 parking fee.Great idea and concept. Dirty rooms that have not been maintained well. Rooms need a fresh coat of paint. There were gnats in my room. The bathroom could use a good cleaning with bleach. The bathtub was moldy. Wifi did not work. Convenient location.Upon arrival the parking lot is made for compact cars so be prepared. Check in was simple and the staff was peppy and friendly. Lobby is retro and cool. We then went to our room, as we were approaching I noticed that a couple had their dogs. I have nothing against animals as I own them myself but I don't think they should be allowed in hotels period. Entering the room there is a musty odor like old room smell (you get used to it) I then inspected the bed, turning down the bed sheets looking under the fitted sheet you know looking for any creepy crawly things or stains. Found no bugs, but there was a stain on the box spring on the side of the bed. Had to inspect the bathroom, it's small but not bad for the price there are plenty of towels and soaps galore. This place needs a few renovations such as new carpeting, unstained boxsprings, cleaner floor tile in bathroom, oh and a new door that doesn't stick when shut for the bathroom (thought for a min I was stuck in the bathroom because I couldn't open the door lol). Other than that great for a one night stay and for the price. Will try and post pictures later.Great place to stay that is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. Check in was smooth the rooms were clean and beds perfect. I loved the touch of Moon Pies and RC waiting for you in the room. The dispenser of soap, shampoo and conditioner were a great touch and shows the hotels passion for being more green. I didn't expect the Four Seasons, the price and cleanliness were on point. If I could give one suggestion would be, replace the carpeted floors with tile. Nice ceramic ""hard wood"" looking tile would be much easier to clean in a party city and a hotel that is pet friendly. Other than that I cannot think of any other things to comment on. Loved everything this piece of nostalgia had to offer.Was a great place to stay at while visiting Savannah. Until They changed the ac units to blow hot until adjusted by the guest. If you adjust the ac to your comfort level it goes back to its default within the hour. 74 degree. Hence, you always wake up hot or return to a hot room after walking the squares. Been here two nights for a scheduled five night stay and can't take the hot rooms any more. Moved to the Brice.This motel which was built in September 1964 has been faithfully re-created to its former glory. The appointments are extremely authentic as they are comfortable. Bathrooms have all been updated but the tile floors are just as they were back in the 60s. You must try the soaps and the gels that come with your room because they not only smell terrific they are top-quality. Moon pies and RC come with the room. A southern treasure!Rooms are filthy. You can't sleep, rooms are EXTREMELY noisy! You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on outside. You feel like you are on the street. Hotel is not in the prettiest area. This hotel is close to main streets but is not located in a pretty area, there is a bad neighborhood right behind it .If you want to rest and have a pleasant trip, do yourself a favor and do not stay in this hotel!Had a fun, friendly stay at the Thunderbird Inn. Chose it based on excellent pricing &amp; reviews. It is definitely a motel, but has lots of charm. Colorful &amp; kitschy decor makes it more vintage than run-down. Staff was super friendly &amp; suggested local restaurants, which were perfect.Besides RC Colas &amp; mini moon pies by your bed, they offered coffee, tea, juice &amp; Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast--all free of charge.Also, great location for access to convention center (across the bridge) and River St. Pet-friendly too. Motel was sold out when we were there.Would absolutely stay here again.Really cute themed hotel! Rooms are large and clean! Upon arriving in our room, we noticed we had been given complimentary RC Colas and Moonpies which was adorable. I always become excited by cute little extras like that. The bed was very comfortable. Overall I had a great stay here. I will for sure keep them in mind for the next time I stay in Savannah.I was really looking forward to staying here because the concept is so unique. Now what I tell people is to remember that it's still motel. We just had a few instances that we still giggle about so they make for great stories for us. When we arrived we were behind another couple checking in. As soon as it was our turn to get checked in one of the two ladies behind the desk didn't acknowledge us got on the phone and started complaining about how she had ordered two hot dogs from down the street 30 minutes ago and they still weren't delivered. While this hot dog conversation is happening the other lady is kindly trying to help us but can't because she's also trying to get help from the hot dog lady. We got all checked in but couldn't get over how funny it was to be dismissed because of a hot dog delivery. First, how good are these hot dogs? Second, who gets hot dogs delivered?Once we got into the room and got situated I went to get on Yelp to see what places we should check out. Couldn't log on to the internet so my husband said he wanted to go get some free popcorn from the lobby and he'd ask them for the password. When he got back up there, mind you 10 minutes probably had passed they didn't remember who we were. He asked for the password to the internet and they didn't want to give it to him unless they knew he was staying there. HAHA Good thing I didn't go in there. Once they knew he was a guest there they told him that there was no internet for the room. Oh goodness, it literally says in the room ""Free Wifi""The room is still a motel room so motel is your key word. The idea is cool and holds a ton of potential. We took a chance but I won't be going back here. But reading some of the other reviews some people really love it so as long as you know it's still a motel and you want to try it out just remember to bring a hot dog with you.The Thunderbird Inn is a decent place to stay in Savannah. It's an old motel that is proud of it's retro concept. In theory, I thought staying here would be cool because I like all things retro and vintage. By the end of our stay, I was neither impressed nor unsatisfied. The Thunderbird Inn served its purpose- a place to rest our heads and shower.There is a small parking lot with enough spots for paying guests but no more than that. There's a small lobby area for check-in and a small adjoining ""breakfast area"". Check-in was a breeze. The staff were friendly and offered us plenty of suggestions for things to do- Savannah maps included! Breakfast options were minimal. I'm not much of a doughnut fan, which is what they had, so we opted for breakfast joints around town instead.Our room was clean and spacious enough for two people. Anymore than that would have been a bit too cozy. We reserved a king sized bed though so that might have had something to do with it. I found that the walls were very thin. I could hear every movement that our neighbors made. At night, it didn't help that they were super noisy (young men on the prowl for saucy ladies). I suppose you can't help who you're neighbored up with at a hotel. However, feeling like you're taking part in every conversation next door does affect your quality of sleep. FYI, I am a light sleeper but they were seriously loud and obnoxious.On the upside, the Thunderbird Inn has RC colas and moon pies waiting for you in the room when you check in. A nice touch, especially if you like moon pies (we do!). The A/C worked very well when we were there, which is important when visiting any place in the South. The location was great. We were in walking distance from most of the venues we were interested in visiting during our stay. This is one of the main reasons why we chose the Thunderbird Inn. Overall, the Thunderbird Inn was alright. I wasn't blown away. It was just alright. Would I stay here again? Sure, I guess. But most likely not, only because I'd like to venture out into other options that Savannah has to offer.Fun and adorable place we decided to stay on a trip home from Gainesville, FL (fest). Fun vintage motel along the highway, easy walking access to downtown!Retro, for sure.We picked this small inn in Savannah mostly because they're very pet friendly. 50$ non-refundable pet deposit, and your dog most be up to date on all vaccines (although no one checked our papers when we checked in). There were quite a few other dogs staying at the hotel while we were there, although I didn't see any cats.The nightly prices are very reasonable, and the hotel is clean and well kept. The hotel definitely has a very retro feel, down to the old school vibrating beds and primary colored tiny tile print in the bathroom. The beds and couches are basic but comfortable, and there is heating and a wall ac unit in each room. My only complaint really is the very spotty wifi, but I guess that's either true for retro form or due to the fact that we had a corner unit. The wifi was slow but consistent the first night, and then stopped working altogether on day 2 (as in phones and computers said they were connected to the wifi but no connectivity).All in all a good option for savannah if you are looking for a basic, clean, pet friendly hotel near the downtown area.The moon pies and RC Cola in the room are definitely a nice touch. However, the mugs in our room still had lipstick and other smudges on them both days we were here. In the morning we also had to wait for clean mugs at the coffee station. The free popcorn stops at 9 which was a bummer and the wifi was very slow. They charged 7.50 for parking but we were comped that both days we stayed here because upon arrival there were dirty towels accidentally left in our room.The price was very cheap and location was very convenient. It's a very short walk to River St. and the other sights in the historic distric.","We stayed at this place on our first trip to Savannah about 5 years ago.  We found it on Hotwire, and it was ok for the price.I recently booked it again on Hotwire and even though they don't display the name of the room until after you buy, I knew it was the T-bird.  A few improvements have been made, but the only reason we really stay here is for the price (the location is good and bad).This is an old-school streetside motel conveniently located on the edge of the historic district.  There is a free shuttle stop across the street and the visitor center is right behind the place. It is a very easy walk to the historic district or river.  The bad part of the location is that you hear Greyhound buses, traffic, and other street noise. If you sleep lightly, this is not the place for you unless you have a fan or other white noise to drown everything out. They claim to have blackout curtains but they do not absorb sound.  Our curtains were also a little worse for wear (dirty and stained) and should be replaced.The room itself was ok.  We didn't get any infamous moonpies but did get RC Cola.  It was nice that they replaced the old in-room AC units with super-efficient heatpumps. I really like the bottles of toiletries locked in because of it being eco-friendly but I also know that saves them some money. Shower was very low-pressure but it's old. There was a washrag on top of the shower curtain left behind by someone who stayed in the room before us which was disgusting. The room smelled very dusty even though we travel with an air filter.  I think in addition to the curtains being replaced, the carpets also need a good steam cleaning or replacing.  An in-room fridge is also always nice when travelling.  One woman working at the front desk was very nice; another seemed like she couldn't be bothered.  They have free Krispy Kreme douhgnuts, coffee and juice for breakfast. The lobby is nice but small.  They also have free popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon.The ultimate question is: Would we stay here again?  For $44 a night on Hotwire and only $5 to park (used to be free) when most Savannah hotels charge $20, yes.  However, if I was paying $80- per night, this would not be the place.  There are too many nicer, quieter hotels and even private rentals for the same price and more in the heart of the district.I'd been wanting to stay at the T-bird Inn for a minute. I was in town for a conference hosted at SCAD, and this was the recommended lodging. I booked accommodations too late to grab a spot for that trip, but bookmarked it in my mind for a future visit.Future trip came around, and I happily booked a room.First impression: when you pull up it looks like any old motel. I mean, it is a motel. But after spending a hot sticky day in the car driving and sightseeing in the balmy 90-plus degree weather, I was delighted to settle in somewhere cool and quiet.The room was larger than expected for the price--I think we got an upgrade! I booked a king size bed and lucked out with a large corner unit with a sofa. There were two groups of young men holding MTV Spring Break-esque activities outside in the hallway. Once the door was shut, though, I couldn't hear a thing. The bed was very cozy, felt pretty new. My boyfriend and I piled in immediately for a nap.The room felt extra clean, and didn't have any of that weird sticky beachy feeling that some spots in coastal towns do. The vibe was very laidback, and you could catch glimpses of the rock and roll retro theme in the lobby, snacks, and toiletries. But as other reviewers have noted--this is not a fully immersive experience. Old skool typewriter, Moon Pies, RC Colas? Yes. Velvet Elvises, luau shower curtain, shag carpet? No.One random thing to note--if you are driving, parking can be an issue. I stayed during a busy holiday weekend, and the lot was packed in the evening. Like double-parked packed. If you can leave your ride and walk to dinner/drinks/laser tag/what have you, do it.If you're looking for an inexpensive, clean, conveniently-located place to stay in Savannah, I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Thunderbird Inn.First off you have to pay $7.50 to park your car in their own parking lot and the parking spots are only for compact cars, so after we parked I could barely even get out of my car. The room was nothing spectacular but I expected that, however it was NOT clean. The bathroom had hair all over the floor and in the tub and there was smudged make up or something on the pillows and blankets. Someone had suggested this place to me and I've realized she has very poor taste, so never again will I stay in the Thunderbird Inn.Horrible front desk service. Made a reservation months ago. Showed up after traveling all day and was told there was no room left.I love this place. Walkable to everywhere I want to go except Tybee!Having read previous positive reviews, we decided to stay here. On our trip across America we have stayed at many affordable hotels and been pleasantly surprised.The Thunderbird Inn, although somewhat retro nifty, was a disappointment. Bathrooms are tiny, grout isn't clean, cosmetic dispensers were broken, shower pressure was minimal and the bed was a cavernous divot in which we sunk. We could every word from our neighbours regarding their personal life through the walls too. Our room wasn't made up and the service from reception staff lacked good customer service. In short, I recommend this hotel to my enemies.Great retro place to stay right across from the bus station and in walking distance of everything. The rooms were great for a trip to Savannah for sightseeing. The staff is really great and were so helpful when I needed another room for the night. They had it cleaned for me first thing in the morning instead of waiting for check in time. Total Rockstars!!!  Can't wait to go back!!Love the place, the retro look, and the cleanliness of the room.  The housekeeping staff found my wallet and turned it in with everything intact! I loved that it was close to everything! Beds were comfy!Just stayed here for 2 nights on our first trip to Savannah. We were warmly greeted at the front desk when we arrived. Having two dogs with us, they allowed us to check in about 45 min early so we could drop them off and continue sight seeing. The room was exactly what I expected for the price we payed and the pictures we saw from other reviews. Meaning, it was not filthy but no the most updated. However, they were renovating about half of the rooms at the time we were here. Those booking in the next couple weeks will likely have a better experience. Unfortunately for us, we got placed in room 106, right by the stairs and the cleaning storage room. The second morning we decided to hang out in the room a little longer to wait out the rain. But being next to the cleaning room, we could hear nothing but talking amongst the staff and banging around of their carts and other equipment. That night was also a little difficult with the other guests going up and down the stairs all night. Overall I cannot say the experience was the worst, but I don't feel that I would stay there again.The location of this motel was GREAT for our price range. we easily could have left the car there and walked everywhere, which we probably should have done because parking was a little stressful when we came back at night.  That being said, it's still a little walk to the city market/Broughton St. area, but that was fine with us.I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the room was compared to how it looked on the outside. It was also cute that they left out Colas and moonpies in the room for you. Overall it was an adequate motel for our weekend and it suited our needs just fine.This hotel scores very low on all levels. So I give it two stars. 1- for having a low nightly rate &amp; locks on the doors.2- for having a parking lot (Which you pay for in the end). The employees did not meet standard,The room was dirty,Even the free coffee was not good.All in all, save this for a last resort and here is my experience: We stayed at this hotel last minute and booked through Expedia. We did visit during the holidays so the following is based on possibly unhappy workers working during a holiday which has nothing to do with me. First off, upon check in and delivery of my name provided with my ID, I was told I didn't have a reservation. I instantly had a mini heart attack. Remember, it's the holidays and everything is closed. I asked her to check again and before I ended my request she again said no I wasn't in the system.I offered my check in reference number and asked her to check it while I called Expedia, and magically, my reservation appeared. Why didn't she offer to search for the reservation by the ref # first before concluding I had no reservation? Okay well maybe she was just having a not so great shift. She printed out the paperwork and gave us our key. We walked over to the room and noticed we were right across the street from the greyhound bus station. Yikes, not a good sign in any city. Okay well we get in the room and it smelled like someone just got out of the shower. Everything looked clean so we didn't worry too much. We quickly put down our stuff so as not to miss the last trolley tour of the day. We arrived back 2 hours later to fully gain a better view of the room. With all the light off, the room looks nice, Cozy and a bit small for the large chairs and king bed, but nice. With lights on.... I could see all the dust accumulating on the velvet red backboard of the bed. The fridge had food and drink items from the last guest and it turns out, the furniture is not retro cool at all. I was a bit disappointed since their website shows a different image than what I was getting. I had noticed while we were out that I was missing my ID. The only time I pulled it out was upon check in.My husband called the front desk and they said they didn't have it. So naturally I tore up my bags clothing and vehicle looking for it. I ended up calling the front desk myself and without hesitation I was told my ID was not there. As any traveler would know, this is a nightmare situation. I walked over to the front desk and asked politely for them to please check the safe, or previous front desk agent because the only time I took out my ID was for check in. The woman stared into her register screen and opened her drawer and said no she did not have it. She asked me my name several times. At this point I got nosy and looked over the counter. Right on her keyboard, was my ID!!! When she saw me do this, she handed it over. WTH? Was she asleep? Or not really looking? Or worse, trying to hold onto my ID? I didn't want this to ruin my night so I gave her a not so nice glare and went back to my room with ID in hand. The bed was comfy up until the neighbors decided to have a porch party in the middle of the night. I didn't bother calling the front desk because chances were, they would not see what I was talking about.One of the cheapest hotels you'll find in downtown Savannah. It's a short walk to the bars and restaurants. Rooms are clean. I don't mind dogs, but the hotel is pet-friendly so if the occasional barking outburst upsets you then you might wanna take that into consideration.Great location and felt safe in the area as others have said. I was disappointed though in the cleanliness of the room. I'll give some leeway as it's definitely an old motel. But there are some things a good swipe of a Magic Eraser could really help - scuff marks on the walls and furniture. There was also a bit of a gap between the old AC unit and the wall giving us a nice peek to the outside. And the bus station across the street can be a bit noisy in the morning. Linens could use a good freshening up. Other than that if you're wanting to stay in Savannah at a low rate and don't plan on staying in your room much then I'd give it a shot.Please let me start this by saying that I have stayed at the thunderbird inn multiple times. It is close to everything we like to do when visiting and provides a clean room. However, after this last conversation I'm a little ticked. Because we have stayed many times before we are on their mailing list and get emails regarding any promos etc. often. I was looking for a room last minute and remembered a promo that I received via email. I attempted to book multiple times online but with no success. I called and confirmed there were in fact rooms available. After a few more attempts(on a different browser) I still had no luck. I sent an email requesting help and to see if I could use the last minute promo over the phone when booking. A week later and stillNo response. I proceeded to call and had the unfortunate pleasure of speaking with Tony. He was rude from the start. I explained my situation and that I had called and emailed for assistance but to no avail. Instead of offering me an explaination, answering any questions, or even apologizing, his only response was ""for what night? Oh yeah I have nothing available anyways."" And said bye and hung up. I'm not sure what his idea of customer service is but as a guest who uses their hotel as a first choice I am VERY disappointed. So. The issue has still not been resolved and I will certainly be finding another hotel to stay at for the time being. Hopefully someone catches tony on a more pleasant day.Meh is the best way to describe my experience. The hotel was kitschy as can be, but the budget part brings a lot of people not interested in the aesthetic. So to begin with, we arrived around 1:15 to the hotel, and I asked if i could check in early. i was told, very flatly, ""no, 3pm"". I asked if there was a bathroom i could use since i had been traveling all morning and i was just pointed to the lobby bathroom but it was in use by a maintenance guy. After ten minuets, we just left and went to find lunch where we could also use a bathroom and recharge our cell phones. When we returned to check in, the front desk person was different and very friendly. However, we weren't offered any popcorn, (like the many emails i received said i would get), and we weren't offered any information. We got our room keys and went to our room. The room was nice. Small but clean. Our desk was broken, our tub had a large rust stain, the walls were dented, and the tub had hairs on the walls and in the drains. I'm not a picky woman, but hey man, i don't want a hairy shower.  The hotel is definitely walking distance to everything, which is great. However, the staff, on every occasion that i dealt with them, looked like they were annoyed i existed. I went to ask about where to go for dinner, but no one was around. I rang the bell, but still nothing. I went in later that night to get a drink, but the girl on the phone didn't even look up at me. The next day was more of the same. At least three times i walked into the office and someone was at the desk, but on the phone, and would not even look up. Friday night (well really Saturday morning) we were woken up by a lot of noise. It was about 3:30am, and the people in the next two rooms were all out front partying. After about a half hour, we called the front desk. The guy from the front desk came out, said, ""hey, we got another call, you guys need to keep it down"" and went back into the office. This was around 4am. Finally, around 5am, whoever was visiting with them left and they went to bed. The parking is an adventure to say the least. When we went to leave after our weekend, we had to drive over the curb and onto the street because we were parked in. if you want a bargain more than a good experience, go here. I like to try to stay in smaller hotels to support local business, wherever I go. But i won't go here again. I can be ignored just fine at home, thankyouverymuch. And at home, i can just call the cops when people are too loud at 4am.I wish it were possible to leave no stars at all. I made reservations and never received my confirmation email. A couple days before the trip, I called to confirm for the weekend and also requested another confirmation email. When we arrived, we were told our reservations were for two weekends later, which surprised me because I called to confirm just days before. The lady at the front desk and the assistant manager were anything but helpful. They were argumentative, insisted that they made no mistake and were totally unhelpful - making the situation worse. We had friends that also booked a room there so I was able to see the inside of the room. There were stains all over the carpet, the tiniest, dingiest bathroom. It's the kind of place you would leave and worry about getting bed bugs.  Oh, and my friends - they never received their confirmation email either. They also requested a second one. The best part - Leslie, the assistant manager insisted on charging me $2.50 to cancel my wrongly booked reservations.  HA!  Do yourself a favor. Pay a bit more for a view of the river, better customer service and peace of mind.We only stayed here for our one night in Savannah, but real glad we did! You do have to pay for parking (only 7.50/night-not bad!) but the room was clean and the employees were very hospitable. The main reason I would recommend to stay here is the location!! We were about 4 blocks from everything and didn't once have to move our car since we could walk everywhere! (Even better when happy hour turns into late nights!) Don't stay here and expect a 5-star hotel..this is a very unique, vintage-style motel but it serves it's purpose without you feeling like you need 5 showers after!I thought this was going to be a neat retro place to take my Mother and boyfriend to stay while we were in Savannah. Aparently they are using the term ""retro"" to describe old, gross furniture and rusted, moldy features these days? The bathroom needed bleach and I could barely fit into it. The large pump bottles of toiletries looked moldy and old (just please get regular travel size products!). The metal fixtures in the room looked like they had never been replaced since the 70's and were rusty. The lighting was horrible. The beds weren't even queen size! Aparently that's retro too, having small beds? And they were hard as a rock. I can deal with the older TV since it had cable, no big deal there. It was nice there was a fridge as well. The overcompensation of the staff to be nice definitely rose some red flags before we even got into the room. The breakfast is a joke, donuts and coffee? Let me get up for something I can get at the gas station across the way...pfft. I know alot of these complaints seem to just be aesthetic but overall, I am just disappointed that they would try and describe this place as a blast from the past, making it seems like a nicely renovated gem and almost boutique feel to an old, crusty, small, room.I was woken at 8 by two maintenance people with hammers and electric saws working on the railing about 4 feet from my head. Leslie at the front desk was nice when I called and asked for ""just another hour of sleep please."" We could hear her come out to the parking lot and tell the crew to shut it down.Promptly at 9 they returned. Who schedules maintenance like that? I love a good retro kitschy hotel as much as the next person. I'm ok without elevators, central AC, fancy beds or fluffy robes but one thing has to be available at any hotel and that is SLEEP!  I visit Savannah often for the food and nightlife and I will be back but me and my hangover won't be staying here again.I'm giving it a solid OK!  Location and price were the reasons we stayed here; it was a safe walk to downtown without the outrageous price tag.  They seem to tout a coupon book in much of their advertising, but we never received one, and there was nothing in the room.  So, don't pin your hopes to such lofty promises!It's got a cute, rockabilly vibe in the front lobby and on the exterior, but that's about it.  It is a standard hotel room, lacking a design theme, art, etc.  Aesthetics aside, it was clean and comfortable, which was what a weary traveler needs (I was really prepared from the worst, from having read some earlier Yelp reviews after booking my reservation).  The breakfast is skim pickings: coffee, juice, and Krispy Kreme donuts.  Yes, I get that there is a theme to be upheld, but it just came off as cheap.  Of course, we'd been traveling around the state all week, staying in less expensive hotels with much better breakfast spreads.     Just as an aside, 50's rock music is set up to blare onto the parking lot.  That was charming for about a minute, as we pulled up to check in.  My husband's first words: ""Oh, this looks cool!""  And about three hours later, in our hotel room:  ""When are they going to turn off that annoying music?""  And at 7:30 pm: ""Seriously, are they not going to turn off that f'ing music?""That reminds me: BRING EARPLUGS.  The rooms all face along a street which is quite busy and noisy in the morning.  Or, you could have the misfortune of being in room 106, which is next to the housekeeper's office.  Those ladies like to chat it up at 7:30 am.  And boy, do their voices carry.  I'm assuming they did not realize that we were trying to sleep.I'm giving them 3 stars for trying, but this is just an ordinary hotel in a great location, featuring good marketing.","Our room was not the cleanest - some stains on the blanket/sheets. Also there was a nice long black hair in the sink. About a 15-20 minute walk to river st where there are a bunch of restaurants/bars. I never felt unsafe walking around the neighborhood. Nice touch that they leave two cans of rc cola and two moon pies in the room for you and popcorn in the lobby until 9 p.m. I guess krispy kreme donuts and juice constitutes as breakfast in the south. Parking is $7.50 a night. From the room you can hear the cars driving on ogoltree. The price wasn't bad $59 including taxes and fees from hotwire.any time I dealt with the staff they were all pleasant. I would debate staying there again given the cleanliness of the room and car noise from ogoltree.I will stay here again! Fantastic location and so much character :D I love the little makeup remover wipe they provided and of course, the moonpies!To begin with it's laughable they charge 7.50 for parking. The moment we walked into our room it was like descending into a horrible dank humid forest - the room was humid and the smell of mildew was stifling not to mention the carpet was wet in spots and it had not been raining.... Luckily we were only in the room for about half an hour. When we came back late that night we discovered that the provided channel guide was very inaccurate- they had tons of channels listed but our TV only had maybe a fifth of them. The next morning starting at 10am we were berated with multiple phone calls with no one ever speaking on the other end- it was the staff making sure we we were up even though we never asked for a wake up call and check out was not until 11. It was ridiculous. The visit ended with the intrusive &amp; bellowing maids (who kept trying to talk to my friend &amp;i the previous day about our shoes) wanting us out of our room before the clock struck 11. Really a disgusting place and staff.Enjoyed my visit very much.  I liked the room, I liked the Hospitality Room, I liked the Office Staff, I like the Thunderbird Umbrella that I bought, I liked the price of the room, I liked the location, I liked the ""curb appeal"" as it is cool retro!  When I go back for another visit, I will hope to get a room there again.Yes, this is definitely a budget hotel. The location is great but you definitely get what you pay for. The rooms need major updating and were not the cleanest. If I could do it over again, I would pay the $30 more to stay in another hotel in the same area.We stayed there on a Fri and Sat night and it was awful. People were talking loud, laughing loud, smoking, and arguing within 10-20 feet of our door until 4:00am. We called the front desk twice, and both times I think someone came up and told them to shut up, but then within an hour it just started up again, so we gave up. We got to sleep about 5am, and then about 7:30 am the housekeeping crew showed up and began smoking, yelling back and forth to each other and lauging loudly right outside our room. The noise from the traffic was also unbearable. The Greyhound buses depart and arrive regularly from the bus depot across the street. Apparantly some of the locals think that 2:00 to 4:00 on a Sunday morning is the ideal time to run drag races up and down Oglethorpe street in front of the hotel. Here are some other negatives about the place: They try to be retro-cute with little touches like providing a warm can of RC Cola and a chocolate-covered marshmallow cookie on your nightstand upon check-in, as well as freshly made popcorn in the lobby...... just what I wanted upon arriving on a sweltering 95 degree afternoon. A complimentary ice-cold bottle of Coke or Dasani would have been so much better. The ""retro"" rooms, at least ours, could better be described as 'dilapidated'. Just because you have a cinder block hotel that hasn't been painted in a while doesn't mean you are ""retro"". The only REAL retro item here was the great work-of-art neon signage out front. But even that is in disrepair with burned-out neon that they haven't replaced. One side says ""underbird Inn"". The other says ""Thu rbird Inn"". And speaking of Thunderbird, if you drive anything larger than a 1957 T-bird roadster you won't be able to fit your car into their tiny little parking spaces, which they charge the guests $7.50 per day. The in-room WiFi only worked for about 10 minutes the whole time we were there. They don't take American Express. On a positive note, the a/c units are Mitsubishi Slim-lines, which are efficient and quiet. However, I wish they hadn't removed 1 of the 2 sconces above the sink to fit the unit into the wall. When I tried to shave, only the left side of my face was lit, with the right side being totally dark. I generally like to shave both sides of my face. I think they need to decide whether they are going to raise their rates a bit and clean the place up and hope for a little less ""Hip"" crowd, or continue the way they are going and remain a glorified flop-house.I am not normally a complainer but this was one of the most disgusting hotels I have ever stayed at.  No ventilation, musty, dirty and the customer service has been horrible!  I was told about two months ago that one of the nights I booked would be refunded because of having to leave for a family issue.  I have sent numerous emails as well as  comments on Facebook and no actual response and no refund.  Also please take a look at the photos I posted, they explain everything.  I have never doing more stray hair in a hotel room before.The T-bird is part of a small national chain of retro motels. It's got a cool thing going for it, and I enjoyed my stay - for the most part.My biggest complaint is that they play music on outdoor speakers, which makes it hard to take an afternoon nap (hey, I'm getting old and Savannah has an extra hour of drinking than Raleigh). The only other thing was that my room fridge did not work, but I didn't really need it.The moon pies and RC Cola are nice treats. Make sure to grab some Krispy Kremes and coffee in the morning by the front desk.It is on the edge of the city and I could understand complaints about not feeling safe. But, I didn't encounter any trouble and it is a short walk downtown.There are lots of discounts here, including AAA and a Foursquare check-in deal. The prices are some of the cheapest in the area, even before discounts.So cool to stay at the Thunderbird Inn. The staff was overly friendly (unlike our experience with most other people in Savannah). There were moon pies and RC colas in our room. The beds were so comfortable and they even had a zippered mattress cover, which for a person that is TERRIFIED of bed bugs was a great relief. The complementary breakfast was Krispy Kreme doughnuts and fresh coffee. So good. I would book a room directly from their website. I booked from Priceline, which sold me the room for $60 more than anywhere else, and the conveniently enough the rooms all sold out after I called Priceline to complain.I would absolutely recommend the Thunderbird Inn and would stay there again.When we first saw the low price and the location, we were concerned we were setting ourselves up to be murdered. However, I honestly can't say enough good things about this stay. First of all, for a 50-year-old budget motel, this one is in great condition and I could tell they're doing the absolute most with what they have. All the rooms are brilliantly, plushly decorated and the beds are amaaaazingly comfortable. Little touches like the pump-bottle soaps/shampoo affixed on the shower wall to the hi-efficiency light timers and hair dryers showed the company was doing what it could to stay green. I was also concerned when we saw that pets were welcome, but the hotel did a great job marking the doors of rooms with dogs and the walls were thick enough that we slept peacefully next door to a St.Bernard. The RC Cola and Moon Pies waiting for us in our room were a fantastic Southern welcome, so bravo to the mastermind behind that effort - same goes for the fresh Krispie Kreme breakfast. Between the price, location, and fantastically cheerful staff, we WILL be stopping here again!Overall-don't stay here.  See a full detailed review on trip advisor.  The website leads you to believe this is a cool retro motel with high quality customer service.  This is furthest from the truth.  Management does not respond to concerns or issues and the desk is understaffed creating longer wait times and inability to keep up with the demand of 45 ish rooms.  Location was the best thing, but shop around and you'll get a good deal on better hotels in the area.I've stayed here for about 6 nights total over the last 3 yrs. Rates are very fair and it's only 7 min walk to all the bars on Riverfront. Crystal was super helpful to get me checked in early (11am vs 3pm) so that I could put my bags in the room and park my car for the day to be at my appointment. Tamika cleaned the room for me super quick to get me in as well! I've brought my dog before, and this has to be the most dog friendly business in Savannah. Overall, Top notch service. I'll stay here on my next trip!Aside from the cute aesthetics, the hotel really lacks modern amenities. Well lit and well staffed, which was comforting. Generally safe atmosphere. Not for families, perfect for a night passing through town. Wifi was spotty. Room had lots of stains, a loud bathroom fan, and tears in the curtains. Love the whole retro theme but was surprised that the walls were blank. Thought they would really have fun with wall decor and retro theme. We wish we could stay longer to rent some bikes to ride around town. If you want to reach over at night to grab a moon pie and RC cola, this is the spot for you!I stayed here for one night with a friend when visiting Savannah on holiday. The staff was very friendly upon check-in and throughout our stay - they even brought us Moonpie Cookies to the room and asked if they could do anything for us. In the morning they are serving Krispy Kreme Donuts and good coffee (surprisingly good for US coffee!). The rooms are spacious and nicely designed, the whole property was built as a motel in the 1960s and remodeled to keep its charm, which it does!It is well located, with gas stations just around the corner (if you're travelling by car) and just a 5 minute walk away from Savannah's wonderful historic district. Perfect if you want to do a little sight seeing!We booked via Hotwire, which gave us an insanely low rate of around $65 per night.We were very happy with our stay. Customer service is fantastic and our room was delightful.  We will certainly stay here anytime I'm in the area. Awesome value too.LOVE this place.  I was staying with my husband &amp; sister &amp; we loved it so much we decided to stay 2 nights instead of one.  Wish it could have been more.  Price is right.  The funky retro look &amp; vibe is great (oldies music in the lobby; a bag of popcorn upon arrival plus a welcome gift of RC Cola &amp; Moon Pies.  Not to mention the Krispy Kremes in the morning.  And it is close to everything.  But best of all was Crystal.  Her attitude, upbeat personality &amp; willingness to go the extra mile were a real plus. She is a gem. We hope to get back there again.For starters, I have to say this is my favorite hotel in Savannah. I've stayed here maybe three or four times now. In fact, I'd rather stay here than the Hilton Double Tree any day.However, I can't give it five stars for two reasons:1.) While the location isn't necessarily bad, if you're not familiar with Savannah and are walking around, it's pretty to end up in a sketchy place. Also, I've heard locals say to be wary of the Greyhound Station across the road.2.) My first stay here had an issue: we were put in an uncleaned room. After a long night of roaming the historic district, I flung the comforter to reveal BLOOD all over the sheets. We immediately alerted the staff who seemed even more alarmed than we were and who sought to do anything to make it right. We were moved to a nice, obviously clean room. We were then given a free night. The manner in which our problem was handled made me a fan. It was gross, but things happen.There are a couple of little things I really like about this place:-The atmosphere. From the retro decor to the unique way the staff dresses, this place is just plain cool.-While it may not be smack dab on River Street, the price is pretty good for a historic district hotel.-There are a bunch of nice little touches, like the moon pies on the pillow, or the quality of the shampoo and other toiletries.Overall: I would definitely recommend this to anyone.Very friendly and clean. EASY and safe walk to city walk, river street and many more shopping and dining. Very nice and helpful staff. The complimentary breakfast only served donuts, so if you want something else, looks like you'll be going elsewhere for food.I was looking forward to staying at a small funky, retro motel, but was terribly disappointed by the poor treatment received by management when I attempted to change my reservations according to their own policies and guarantees as posted on their website. Additionally the room they put is in #214 had broken TV cabinet, shower knob that was almost unusable because it was so loose and sheets that were so threadbare they had holes.Location is advertised as being in historic downtown, but is really on the fringe of the city across from a bus terminal, practical if you want to take the bus but not charming.Additionally this motel charges you for parking - this info is not posted upfront either."" lessThis the best small hotel that I've stayed at bar none. Usually you get places like this that usually have a few things wrong with it or are just plain disgusting. While we stayed there the rooms were well taken care, amenities were restocked and they always had a nice pot of coffee going throughout the day. Ii will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to our friendsYes at first we were worried about the area, aka Greyhound bus station right next door. But after one night there we new we fine, I even went for morning runs in the area. This place is also perfect for the price and location. If the riverfront is where you want to be you can easily walk there in 10-15 minutes. Very convenient as that was our particular way of getting around.  Wifi worked greatDonuts and Coffee in the morningClean Rooms Great personnel.","Don't get me wrong- the idea behind this place is brilliant, and I'm all for the concept. In practice, this is a major fail.Let's start with the good things. The lobby is clean and adorable. The front desk staff was super friendly and helpful. But the positive experience ended there.We walked up to our room on the second floor, and should have taken the dirty plunger sitting right outside the door as a sign... Immediately upon entering the room it was obvious that it had been ""well-loved."" It was filthy. Stains ALL OVER the carpet, the walls, the chairs. There was mold in the bathroom shower and on the floor. These were all things that I was willing to overlook though.I decided to pull back the covers on the bed because the rest of the room was so obviously filthy. Good thing I did. The sheets were wrinkled, STAINED, and looked like they had been slept on numerous times without being changed. The fitted sheet that is supposed to cover the mattress wasn't even covering the mattress!! I wanted to love this place, but it was totally unloveable. I'm not a picky traveler, but this was unacceptable. We checked out, got our refund, and scooted on down the road to the Comfort Suites where we got a CLEAN room for only a couple dollars more.My suggestion: ask to see your room before you get settled in. Maybe we got a particularly dirty one...Like some other reviewers, I really wanted to love this place and I was so excited to stay here. However, when we arrived our check-in time was at 2pm but we got there at 3pm. Our room wasn't ready until almost 4:30pm. We only had 2 towels in our room. When they finally gave is more they were damp. The room was pretty filthy. I found hair in the bathroom before we even had a chance to shower. The sheets were wrinkly and had stains and hair on them. The positives of the place include a nice staff. The free coffee and donuts were yummy as well. It's also in a great location and you can easily walk around downtown from there. I think if there were some upgrades and did a better job on cleaning it would be a fantastic place to stay.This is not a negative review. There are a couple of unexpected pluses. The old exterior wall A/C units are not working, having been replace by super-quite Mitsubishi coolers. This machine will put out some serious cold in a short time without hum and thrum. Second is the the hot water to the bath tub. Almost instant. Either we were situated next to a water heater or the owner installed  in-line water heaters. The motel is generally clean. Rooms are spartan. Mattress was a ""Valley"" bed. Slept okay. Suppose YMMV. Some reviewers are rating higher and even fewer, lower based on what they see as their personal bang-to-buck ratio. I'd say this place is over all quite sparse and spare in accouterments and accommodations having in its favor, location to city attraction. I believe a moderate rating is justified.If you want to have a nice place to stay and not spend a whole lot of money, I highly suggest Thunderbird Inn.  The entire place has this fun retro vibe, which I find pretty cool.  I mean, how often do you lust after a lamp in a hotel room?  Anyways, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, I could literally walk anywhere from our hotel and when I wasn't out exploring the city, I could find myself very relaxed in the hotel room.  The TV is not flat screen (I didn't know regular box tvs were still a thing, and it is a retro themed hotel) but it did work okay.  The cleaning staff I think were confused about how many people were in our hotel room.  We had a double room for 4 people and the cleaning staff would leave 4 towels one day and 4 cups and other stuff, then the next day they would refresh the room with 1 or 2 towels, 2 cups, and then would replace the used coffee with Decaf.  That's a cardinal sin in my book, but I let it slide since the lobby staff was more than willing to grab more stuff from the laundry room for me.  All in all, I loved it here.  Waking up each morning to donuts and a coffee bar in the lobby was a treat before I started my days exploring the city.  I would definitely stay here again and I would suggests other people to head to this hotel too.Four stars because: walkable distance to downtown/historic district, affordable, extremely friendly and accommodating staff, clean rooms, common area to eat in (with doughnuts and coffee every morning), and free parking.Keep in mind, you're not getting a fancy schmancy four star hotel- that is not what I mean by 4 stars. The rooms are small and outdated, bathrooms are SMALL with the sink area outside of bathroom. Also, there were a couple minor defects in the room, nothing that was a big deal, though.For me the pluses outweighed the minuses because I wasn't spending time in the hotel, except to sleep. It's a fun, retro-style inn, that has some cute features like music playing outside in the parking lot. A great option if you want a unique stay, don't need all the bells and whistles, and like staying at places that have a personality.We loved the retro appeal of this place, so that was our main reason for booking. The close location to free trolley was a plus although we just ended up walking the short distance to City Market/Broughton St/River St. Staff was friendly at the desk. The coupons available that they mention on the web are just your standard visitor center promo literature, nothing special. I didn't think about it til just now but we weren't offered any popcorn or lemonade upon arrival (that's ok, I didn't get my warm cookie at Doubletree either). Slight hiccup with getting the room key to work but we finally made it into room 205. Overall it was alright, smelled bleachy which made me feel like at least it was definitely cleaned. My biggest complaint is that the website boasts very comfortable &amp; quality mattresses, but both ours were visibly sagging &amp; needed to be replaced very badly. I have back problems so wasn't too excited to see such terrible mattresses. Carpet needs replacing too since it was stained &amp; ripped near the threshold to the room. The cover to the sink plumbing had been removed at some point I think and it wasn't firmly attached back- made it look ghetto. Furniture needs a good swipe of dark stain to cover scuffs &amp; it would've looked new again. Sheets appeared to be clean, towels were fluffy &amp; soft (we weren't sure if the one hanging on the back of the door was purposefully put there or if the maid just forgot to look there when cleaning so that one went in the dirty pike). Good things were the RC colas &amp; moon pies on the nightstand. Breakfast of coffee, tea, juice, and Krispy Kreme was a nice Southern touch. They are environmentally conscious &amp; recycle. The soap/shampoo/conditioner/lotion pumps were nice. If you are a dog owner, this place allows animals and even has a tiny fenced outdoor area outside the lobby for your pup to chill out. Parking was a bit scary as they have 3 ""spaces"" in the center of the lot that makes one fear their car might get backed into &amp; is cramped for everyone. Seems like a bad idea.I was hoping for a bit more from this place. Great concept, outside looks well kept, but they need to re-invest in the quality/condition of the interior. Kitsch will only get you half way there. We won't stay again, several other options in the area that probably will be a little closer to my comfort level even if I had to fork out slightly more (especially if I'm paying $140/night to sleep somewhere). But it suited our needs for the night, was a good location, and all in all wasn't terrible. Just needs a little work.We found Thunderbird while looking for reasonably priced accommodations in downtown Savannah, and it seemed to fit the bill. We also were in love with the idea of the retro styling. The moon pies, the cool color schemes of the room and the cute furniture, and the design of the lobby all really seemed awesome. When we checked in, I was mentally preparing a list of the souvenirs I wanted to buy. The reason that I emphasize this is that I want to make it clear that we were excited to be here, we knew what to expect for theme, and we knew that it was not going to be a 4 star hotel experience based on pricing alone.HOWEVER.When we checked into our room, which was in a sad dark corner by the stairs and a maintenance closet, we were not at all prepared for what we found. Everything in the room that could be dirty was. From scuffs on the walls to stains on the sheets to an ironing board referred to from now on as the ""ironing board of shame."" I have stayed in some very sketchy places before in my traveling, but I have honestly never experienced anything on par with this. The whole room stunk of disinfectant that I can only assume is used as an air freshener and not to clean anything. Aside from the cleaning issues, the room was much smaller than it looks like online (the bathroom is incredibly tiny... and those spa quality soaps do not look so appealing in a dirty tub).We saw all of these amazing reviews online , but it was nothing at all like most people had described. True, I read the few and far between negative reviews that describe similar experiences to this. Yet I tossed those aside proclaiming that those people just ""didn't get it."" Let me tell you. We got it. We loved the idea, didn't expect lavish amenities or an amazing tv. Yet within 1 hour we were out of there.  We were not offered any kind of refund from management. Thankfully we did our booking through a third party that graciously decided to ""take the hit on this one"" and reconsider doing business with Thunderbird in the future. Oh, and.. no moon pies or RC colas in sight in the room: the ultimate insult to injury.The room and experience was just okay.  We chose to stay here because we got a good rate and they allow pets.  I would not go back and pay full price (even thought their normal rates are low) for a room.  They make all of these claims about how they are incredibly pet friendly.  I would say that they are more pet tolerant than pet friendly.  On their website it states that visiting dogs will receive gourmet dog treats, a supply of bags, a bed and food/water bowls to use, a bottle of water, a pet friendly map of Savannah.  NONE of these things were offered to us to use and we let them know we were traveling with our dog, paid the pet fee, etc.  I was most disappointed that they didn't have the pet friendly places map as we were looking to enjoy some outdoor meals with our pup.  The check in girl had no idea what I was talking about when I asked for this map.Additionally, they state that they always have popcorn in the lobby and moon pies and RC colas in each room.  There was no popcorn in the lobby or moon pies and cola in our room.  I don't care that those things weren't available for me.  I just feel like they made a lot of ""fun"" claims to get people to book rooms and then didn't deliver on these promises.  The room was as expected: decent size, older amenities, moldy spots, the tv remote was missing buttons.  There was very little lighting in the room.  There was a vanity area right outside of the bathroom and had a magnified mirror but no lights in the vanity area at all.  I had to go put my makeup on in the car.  All in all the room was pretty clean and worth the price that we paid, I was just not pleased with the way they presented the pet ""amenities"".Came across the Thunderbird Inn while googling Savannah hotels, since I was spending time there for a conference-- and all the conference-suggested hotels were ridiculously expensive. NOT THE THUNDERBIRD! :) They were not only very reasonably priced, but also less than a two-minute walk to the Coastal Georgia Center, where my event was located.SUPER friendly staff, always accommodating and on-hand 24 hours a day. Spencer at the front desk even let me email him my boarding pass so he could print it off. Their in-shower shampoo, conditioner and bath gel smell awesome! The moon pies on the pillows were a cute (and delicious!) touch-- when I was there, they were chocolate-mint ones. NOM. I got a sweet surprise on Saturday when RC colas accompanied the treats. And fresh Krispy Kremes available in the mornings are always welcome. ;)There was a bit of construction going on while I had my stay, but even though it was loud, that's to be expected with construction-- and it was never too early in the AM or late in the PM. I honestly think it's too bad that such big structures seem to be going up all around this lovely little gem.Beds are comfy, bathrooms (albeit small) are clean. Easy walk to all downtown Savannah amenities. While this isn't the ""5-star"" luxury spot some look for while on vacation, the hospitable staff, affordable rates and central location make the Thunderbird Inn a cute and kitschy spot that I would recommend to anyone heading to Savannah. Thank you for the great experience.Great prices, but unfortunately our stay (mid-February) was marred by obtrusive construction noise that began at 8am sharp.  Earth movers rumbled close to the back walls of the Inn, resonating the entire room and forcing us out well before we wanted.  Other guests were standing outside their rooms on the balcony with unhappy expressions, as well.  The mornings were really unbearable.The Thunderbird management knows the construction is quite noisy - they posted a nicely worded notification outside the office.  But, perhaps, they should have shut down during the worst of the construction activities.  At the least, I think they should have warned guests during the reservation discussions of the situation.   The rooms themselves are adequate.  Clean but very tired.  The bathroom is tiny and dingy.We traveled with our dog which limits our choices and this was the cheapest place we could find in Savannah.  But, it wasn't a good value because of the noise.I had a great time at the Thunderbird Inn.  I wanted something convenient, comfortable and close to the action, without paying $200+ per night.  I found the Thunderbird Inn and was very curious to check it out.Firstly, as many other reviews have stated, the service is fantastic.  Leo checked us in on arrival, and was personable, friendly and real.  It was nice not to get an insincere spiel and speak with someone that cared about their job.  I was equally impressed with the young lady working on the AM of the 26th was equally as impressive- printed us direction and was nice to talk to.The rooms were very clean, and much nicer than I anticipated (even seeing the photos before.)  The bathroom was itsy bitsy- but the shower had great pressure and was equally clean.  I thought it was a tremendous value- and apart from the exterior entrances and small lobby - it was hotel caliber.I'd defiantly come back- and hey- it's a fun ""retro"" experience!Love the retro feel &amp; budget price of the Thunderbird Inn! Our king size bed room was comfy &amp; within easy walking distance of River Street &amp; the City Market (&amp; we have a 11 month old so it really is walking distance). Only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that our room wasn't spotless clean. There was a bit of mold/mildew in the shower on the grout, our folded towels were damp &amp; there was hair on one of the pillows on the bed.The Thunderbird is a fantastic find. Stayed here two nights on my last visit to Savannah. Their prices are the best around, and you are still within walking distance to all that downtown Savannah has to offer. The staff were extremely friendly, and the hotel was very clean and had a fun vibe to it. Plus, when the staff clean your room, you get a moonpie on your pillow! What service! They also have their own little shampoo and soap bottles that are so cute that you'll want to collect them. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back on my next visit to Savannah!What a sight for tired eyes, driving south from Virginia this is literally the first thing you see entering Georgia/Savannah. The rooms are very clean and the Moonpie on your pillow is an unexpected treat. When I called to make reservations they said it would be $99 but when I explained I was a little tight on cash they lowered it to $69. My favorite number.Thunderbirds, GOWe came to Savannah for friends bachelorette party and needed two rooms for all of us girls. The rooms were very simple and  exactly what we needed. The room came with two RCs and two moon pies. Breakfast was great coffee and donuts. The staff was very accommodating and super nice the whole time. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash where super awesome as well. The hotel was overall was just great :)For a motel the Thunderbird is 5 star. I usually do not stay in motels, preferring hotels. This is not your typical motel. Very clean and staff friendly and helpful. I found the area safe and well within walking distance to all sites downtown. Only downside was the nearby construction which starts promptly at 8 each morning. Did not bother me for I'm up and about before then. Also might want to bring your own soap and shampoo for theirs are in dispensers mounted in the tub / shower. Next time I'm in Savannah I'll be staying here! Can't beat the price and location and it is a cool motel.We recently stayed at The Thunderbird Inn for the weekend.  This was my third stay at this particular Savannah motel (2005, 2006, 2009).  The 2005 and 2006 stays were terrific.  Everything was brand-new, clean, fresh, modern, and exciting.  This most recent visit (in 2009) was a bit disappointing.  Thus, my lower rating.  When the old motel was converted and revamped, it was fantastic.  This time around, it felt a bit...dirty.  The sheets and towels were scratchy.  The silky bedspread was gone.  The sink towel bar was missing.  The tub needed a good scrubbing (it had visible stains).  The bathroom floor was dirty and covered in hairs (I won't say what kind).  We made the best of it, though, because I got a better rate at The Thunderbird Inn than I would have staying right downtown in the Historic District (about 1/3 the price).  We didn't say anything to the manager or housekeepers about the state of the room because, well, you shouldn't have to.  Cleanliness should be a given.  It was obvious the bathtub and bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned in weeks.  Or months for that matter, depending on how many guests had stayed in it.  On the day of our checkout, we decided to grab a drink of orange juice from the continental breakfast bar that the motel offers guests every morning.  We drank the glasses of OJ on our walk to Sunday brunch elsewhere.  The OJ was warm, but we wanted to get some vitamin C in us.  BIG mistake.  HUGE.   Why?  The OJ obviously had not been recently filled and was on its way toward being chilled.  It had been sitting out for quite some time...spoiling.  Yes, both my partner and I were very ill for the rest of the day and the drive home.  And, yes, we're quite sure it was the OJ (I won't go into details).  At any rate, The Thunderbird Inn isn't what it was just a few years ago.  They need to get their act together again before I'd consider another stay.  The cheaper rates are becoming more and more aligned with what you get.Bang for your buck! The Thunderbird Inn is retro and quirky, but all-in-all a clean and comfortable stay. You can't beat the price for the location (albeit next to a housing project, but perfectly safe), the staff is friendly and accommodating and the beds are comfy.Highlights:  The A/C unit kicked ass! We traveled to Charleston after Savannah and stayed in a much higher end hotel and the room was not nearly as cool! Moon Pie on our bed at check-in (I am pregnant and loved this) and donuts and coffee in the morning. Pet friendly!Not so highlights: Wifi absolutely blows when in your room, no connectionHonestly if you are not high maintenance about your accommodations and like to pinch a penny, I recommend giving Thunderbird a try!This little motel is well located near the historic district. Everyone who works there is polite and friendly. The customer service is excellent. The room was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again.One of the best values in Savannah. Great location and is within walking distance to everything. But just because I say walking distance doesn't mean it's extremely close. We definitely had to walk a little ways to get the downtown area but it was worth it. Rooms were clean, bathroom was small, overall everything was good. Probably won't stay here again because we want something a little bit closer, But if you don't mind walking a lot than this place is totally worth it.","Like other have said, the staff has excellent customer service. Every staff member was friendly and polite. The price was very reasonable for being so conveniently located to downtown Savannah. It's a 5-10 minute, almost straight shot to downtown and River St. It's one block away from the Old Town Trolley service, so if you plan on sightseeing through that trolley line, you can walk to the shuttle. The details are cute-the moon pie and RC Cola on your bed, and they have recycling containers around so they're environmentally conscious (a plus in my book).The reason I can't leave more than 3 stars is because when we went to climb into bed, the sheets on one of the beds looked dirty-like someone had eaten a granola bar in bed and slept in it. We asked for new sheets for both beds, which they brought immediately. They were very apologetic, but after that we couldn't shake that dirty Motel 6 feeling. Also, they do not provide soap for the sink. They have 3 pumps attached to the shower wall-shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. The sink is located outside the toilet/shower room, so if you want to wash your hands with the shower gel (your only option unless you brought soap with you) you have to go into the bathroom to get it. That doesn't work if someone besides your significant other is in the bathroom. Depending on price and necessity, I MIGHT stay here again. But if I could find another hotel in the area around the same price, I probably would not choose this place.I had a great stay here.  I loved the retro-60's feel.  Our room was clean and spacious, the beds were VERY comfortable and we were walking distance from Historic Savannah.  The Thunderbird has a great staff; everyone was very friendly and helpful.  A great place to get your money's worth!My wife and i stayed during the Christmas holiday. I give 5 stars because the hotel is close to everything, the staff were very friendly and knowlegable about the city. The hotel is old but well kept and has a fun feeling to it.Wow. They canceled our reservation without notification, and when we called (less than an hour after we received the email), they had already re-booked the room. So we had to cancel our Memorial Day vacation. I wouldn't recommend this place, they are unreliable and I'd hate for someone else's vacation to be ruined!Well-priced for Savannah, but even as an experienced solo traveler arriving from a big city I didn't feel safe in the area at night. I wasn't told of the construction noise prior to making my reservation and it was horrible. It isn't just loud--it SHAKES the entire building. Even when the construction wasn't going, the hotel was blaring loud music in the common areas, and the walls were so thin you could hear everything. The people next door to me had dogs with them who yipped and yapped all night. While it was a generally decent hotel, it wasn't THAT clean (messy dispensers in the bath, linens felt less than fresh), and the housekeeping staff did a piss-poor job on my room while I was out. I'm not a messy person. Would it kill you to empty the trash when you clean someone's guest room?The next time I come to Savannah I'm going to be coughing up the cash to stay elsewhere. The Thunderbird's decision not to tell guests about the construction noise in advance is unconscionable.This was my first trip to Savannah and first real vacation in years! The staff at the Thunderbird Inn were fantastic. Everyone was so pleasant and helpful. The whole property was clean. The doors are painted in really fun colors and they have music playing. The room was great. Super comfy beds ...moon pies on the pillows! I walked everywhere the whole week and it was just fine! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone travelling to Savannah, especially if you are on a budget!Four of us stayed here, in two different rooms, during the Rock N Roll Savannah Marathon weekend. The rooms were a great rate online and were honestly one of the last available places we could even find a room! I would say we lucked out here. Yes, it's an older place but the remodeling has added a bit of the 21st century to it. The best was pretty comfy but the pillows (although they were huge and my wife loved them) the rest of us didn't like them at all. The breakfast consists of Krispy Kreme donuts and coffee/tea. For the morning of the race, they added some more breakfast items that morning. That was a pretty cool thing to do. Upon checkout, they were offering great rates for next years race as well. All four of us booked rooms here again saving quite a bit of money by pre-booking. Everyone here was beyond courteous and had some nice advice on where to eat!The only downside was the gentleman that checked us in charged our card (after we had already paid prior) so we had to deal with that after we returned home and checked our bank statement. He was very new so I guess it was a learning experience. Or something.Anyway, clean rooms and super nice staff! Oh yeah and free WiFi!If you don't mind no frills and want a comfortable and clean space to relax after enjoying downtown Savannah, the Thunderbird Inn is for you. It is a motel and not a 4 star resort so keep that in mind depending on where you like to stay. We loved the retro feel and the ease of parking the car and walking everywhere we wanted to go downtown.This place was awesome! We were treated so kindly by hotel staff and were even upgraded to a king suite room. All of the staff were so friendly and engaging and they really made an effort to make us confortable at the hotel. As mentioned, the place is quirky and has its own flavor. They took an old looking motel and hipsterized it with fun artwork, 50's retro look and great coffee and snacks! We were greeted with free popcorn and lemonade!The hotel is a short walk from town, but we were up for the extra blocks since the price was right and the atmosphere was fresh. It was our first trip to Savannah and this place really made our experience worth while. A very minor complaint - the shampoo and shower gel smell like Axe for men, so ladies should bring your own toiletries! I couldn't have been happier with this hotel. =)I have pros and cons about this place. Pros- clean, cute, funky, nice staff. VERY dog friendly!!!! Cons-No trashcan for doggy poo in the doggy area and you have to carry the poop through the dining area/lobby to the trashcan outside. Also two days in a row I needed clean towels and they said they were being washed and dried. You'd think a hotel would have enough towels for their guests. The place even had vacancies on those 2 days. The area is lOUD. It's right across from the greyhound station and on a very busy road. (I know the inn can't help that.) Also the people who stay there were coming in and out all hours of the night and the doors are loud to the rooms. Lots of noise there. All in all...I probably wont stay there again unless I have to take the dogs on vacation again.Not being Millionaires, I wanted to go to Savannah and really experience it without having to pay.  The Thunderbird Inn was great for that.  We stayed four nights and with taxes it was about $400.  I was disappointed that there we no funky shampoo/conditioner/lotions in our rooms, I am a sucker for fun packaging but found out later that they are going green and are switching over to dispensers.  Ok, That is an excellent reason, anything to help the environment.  When we first checked in, we were greeted by Wendy, who was very accommodating.  She asked us if we had any questions and we mentioned we wanted to go to Clary's.  She didn't know what or where that was at but quickly got online and found it was on Habersham.  While this is true the one we were looking for is from the movie ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and that is at  404 Abercorn Street. :)Leo, was also accommodating.  After a day of sight seeing we came home and my husband was having low blood sugar.  I had seen the chips in the lobby so we headed down.  He offered a free Moonpie and that did the trick.  Whew!  Thank goodness for the Thunderbird Inn and the free moonpies :)Another wonderful thing in the rooms is the remote controlled AC unit.  It was steamy hot and it was wonderful to lie in bed and turn down the unit to Tundra levels :)  Especially for gadget techies on vacation.  Oh yea, free WiFi!!!!!Kitschy.  Cool.If you can't (or don't want to) afford a location right in the heart of the historic district, The Thunderbird is the perfect alternative as it's an easy-ish walking distance to the river and shops.  It's not the Ritz but you're also not paying Ritz prices.  And who would want to anyway?I've seen reviewers talk about how scary the location is.  However, not to cast doubt on the personal emotions of others, I think these people must have very thin skins?  I'll agree that once you pass MLK Jr Blvd the streets are not at all picturesque (it IS across from a Greyhound) but I never felt scared or even nervous about my safety.If/When I go back to Savannah, I will definitely be staying at The Thunderbird Inn again.Single student on a budget? This is the place to stay!Desk staff was friendly and helpful! Unlike other reviewers, there were no moonpies on my pillow- but I did ask the desk what they were (sorry, I'm a Yankee) and was given one! Desk staff also gave me directions to a few restaurants and a better map than anywhere else in Savannah provided. The room was clean, appeared recently renovated. Modern, chic. The bathroom on the other hand was SMALL!!! Standing in the doorway, I could touch the door with my shoulder and the opposite wall with my hand. The bathroom was not recently renovated. and the remote for the TV was MIA. No worries!On to the downside: I could hear traffic from my room. I could hear the neighboring TV through my room (and muffled conversation). I was Skyping one night and a truck passed by... the truck was heard over Skype. I'm a deep sleeper so it didn't bother me, but I'm not an early sleeper- so the later in the night, the less traffic there is. Also, housekeeping... woke me up at 9am. Check-out isn't until 11 so I'm not really sure what she was doing there. The 2nd day I just put the do not disturb card in, and the 3rd day (checkout day) I was again woken up at 9 by housekeeping. She came back 2x before 11 checkout too. I was nonplussed. But what can I say for not paying upwards of $200/night? Not a damn thing, lol! I would stay here again though. The best thing about this hotel is location! Right next to route 17, coming off the bridge. Near the corner of Oglethorpe and MLK, convenient to the Visitor's Center. Approximately 13-15min walk into the heart of the historic district. I never felt uncomfortable about the neighborhood. SCAD is closeby (well, where isn't SCAD close by?) and there are plenty of students walking back and forth. After walking around the city for 3 days I came to appreciate the location of the Thunderbird much more. Many of the hotels are near the riverfront, which is busy and brimming with tourists. Oglethorpe kind of cuts Historic Savannah into North and South segments, so I felt like it was a primo location. Vegas cheese? absolutely!But for the noise and housekeeping, I would have given Thunderbird 5 stars.I gave it 1-$ because although it's around $100/night it is the cheapest hotel I could find in Savannah (without having to stay by the airport).This place reminds me of the motels my parents used to take me and my sister when we went down the shore in the summer. Before they made money. Oh the memories.The Thunderbird looks like the Ocean Motel on the outside but the rooms are updated and actually very cute (I'm actually a girl). Ours wasn't a huge room but use-able and the bathroom was really small but again...use-able.We stayed here because its fairly close to the historic district and they are pet-friendly. We love pets and pets love us. So we took our pet Batman with us. There is an area behind the hotel that has a big field filled with these prickly naval mine looking things. They hurt. Batman didn't like walking back there to much so we found her some other walking places to go. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to most of the ""stuff"". This actually worked out for us because we could wear out our superhero a little bit. The staff seemed very nice. We were only there for a couple of days so we didn't need any cleaning services while we were there. We didn't have any problems sleeping in the comfy beds. I saw people mentioning that it was a little noisy. We sleep with the TV on and kinda loud, so it always sounds like trucks driving by, people yelling from the bus station and maids talking outside the room.A few girlfriends and I stayed here a few years ago on a weekend trip to Savannah.  This was the most reasonably priced hotel in the area without being far from downtown/restaurants and bars, etc.  While this is certainly not a luxury hotel, the hotel itself is actually just fine!  The outside may be a bit deceiving, but the rooms inside are updated with a ""retro"" style, very cute.  Our room was clean and our beds were very comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helped us with some directions here and there as we needed them.The area itself, as another reviewer pointed out is just ""okay"".  It's certainly not the BEST location in the area but it's certainly not the worst.  It is located across the street from a Greyhound bus depot as far as I remember, and a random person standing at the bus depot did come to our car and ask us if we needed help with our stuff...haha.  One of our friends didn't know what to do so I politely but firmly told the man ""no thank you"" and he told us to have a nice day and left.  He wasn't menacing or anything and we didn't see him again after that.  The rest of our stay here we had no issues and we freely walked back and forth from our hotel to various places without problems or being bothered.  Just be street smart as you should be no matter where you go..that's all!So, with that said-it's a good bet if you're needing a cheaper yet very convenient hotel in the area.Here is why this is one of the best hotels, not just in Savannah, but in the South. 1. The staff is incredibly helpful, courteous, thoughtful, and fun.  2. The rooms are very trendy, clean, nicely decorated and stocked with anything you'd need.  3. Pets are allowed! Not just allowed, but they love pets there, which is very refreshing.  4. Moonpies and cocoa at check-in and Krispy Kreme donuts for breakfast.  5. Very quiet, even though it faces the street. 6. And finally, it's a steal! Prices are very low, especially during the off-season and for the wonderful, unique amenities, it's an amazing deal.I loved staying at the Thunderbird Inn for my birthday at the end of September. My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Savannah and booked two nights at the Thunderbird with a Groupon deal. He told them it was my birthday and they put a Happy Birthday message with my name on the marquee! I was so excited when we pulled into the hotel and I saw my name. The room and bed were really comfortable, I was delighted by the mini Moon Pies on the pillows, and the staff was super nice. We had no problem walking from the hotel to River Street and all around Savannah. We felt safe walking around the area at night.  I was super-stoked about the oldies music playing in the parking lot and that the lobby of the hotel smelled like bubblegum. I also love the retro soap, shampoo, and conditioner in the bathroom--it's all so cute!I was bummed that there was no RC Cola left in our room because I saw a few Yelpers say they got them along with the Moon Pies. Maybe you only get the cola if you stay in a suite? (EDIT: Someone else who has stayed at the TBird messaged me and told me the RC Colas are in the ice buckets. The one place I didn't look. DOH!) The bathrooms are super small and I had trouble not getting everything soaking wet in the shower, but that's probably user error. Also, I never made it to the lobby in time to get to the Krispy Kremes, though I always went pretty early in the morning.  None of those things was a huge deal though, and we've already decided that we won't stay anywhere else in Savannah from now on! I wish we had stayed at the Thunderbird during our first trip instead of staying at the overpriced Hyatt on River Street. The Thunderbird is a lot more fun and it's more comfortable. Yay, Thunderbird!Clean, nice towels, excellent lighting, great service, very reasonable!The staff was great; friendly and helpful. It was a bit noisy at night, but given its location and the targeted clientele, not unexpected. The prices are good if you don't mind walking a few extra blocks to the historic district. It's not the Ritz, but was very comfortable and clean. Besides, you won't get a complementary RC and a Moonpie at the Ritz!Groovy decor, super-comfy beds, no-hassle wifi and free sugar and caffeine! The Thunderbird was pretty much everything I was looking for-- an affordable, clean place to crash after long days out and about. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the goodies were as advertised. My husband loved the free Krispy Kreme selection and the RC Cola.","['planning', 'honeymoon', 'road', 'trip', 'months', 'ago', 'brought', 'attention', 'offering', 'amp', 'thought', 'adorable', 'say',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/andaz-savannah-savannah,Andaz Savannah,4.5,$$$,161,"First Savannah trip! I usually use Hyatt as my ""go to"" hotel  chain if I'm not staying in a Boutique Hotel. Hyatt never fails. This is a lovely hotel situated a block or so from the river (shopping district area) and right in the center of the downtown shopping district. This location was great because we went a different direction each day of our stay to take in all of what Savannah has to offer. The rooms are super clean, staff is friendly and accommodating and price is decent. We stayed in the standard with 2 queen beds. Nice amenities and complimentary snack bar in the room! The decor was classic with a soft (almost feminine) modern twist. We didn't have a great view or balcony, but we didn't spend much time in the room. The downstairs bar was a great place to grab drinks, and there's a restaurant, but we didn't dine on location. I wills the staff did a great job with keeping the grounds (inside and out) clean. Next trip back to Savannah, you can find me at the Andaz for sure!TIP: If you are driving - it's a little tricky getting to the valet spot. I think the road is one way? (I wasn't the one driving) We circled the hotel once or twice to get curbside to unload our luggage. Valet and Staff are friendly and helpful with all that!One of our favorite hotels in Savannah. GREAT location and great staff. Hotel is clean and has modern decor.We booked one of the suites which had a balcony which was nice. The beds are comfy and the linens were crisp and clean. The bar downstairs had great cocktails!Things to consider: downtown is noisy at night, especially being close to city center. Not a deal breaker as most of the hotels downtown are going to have different levels of exterior noise effecting guests. We always travel with a sound machine which did the trick for us. I also didn't care for the shower layout in the suite, there was no door so the water splashed out on the floor, not  lot but enough that required you to have to wipe it up after every use. Neither of these things are deal breakers though. This was our 3rd stay at the Andaz and we will continue to come back!Nothing short of excellent. Being Hyatt Platinum members, we certainly try to stay at Hyatt properties when we travel. The nicest Hyatt I've ever stayed in was the Park Hyatt NYC, second was the Hyatt Regency Aruba and 3rd place is the Andaz Savannah. I really can't say enough about the exceptional service at each of the properties we stay at. This was our 12th or 13th time staying at this property in particular and it keeps getting better. A few months back when we came, I actually wasn't impressed with the service...I made a call to Hyatt about my experience and sure enough when we returned this month all issues were resolved. The hotel location is PERFECT. You're right near city market (away from some of the tourist traps on River St.) but still only a blocks walk to the river for some shopping. Starting from the time you pull up to the hotel, valet is eager to assist you in unloading while you check in. The inside of the hotel has been remodeled at least once or twice since we've been going but never loses that artsy / historical feel that reminds you that you're in one of the best cities in the south! I don't think we had to open the front door one time the entire trip and were promptly greeted every time we arrived back. Check in was a breeze and with our platinum status we got an automatic upgrade on the 5th floor. Room 514 with a balcony overlooking Ellis Square....will try to get that same exact room every trip moving forward. Once up to the room, we gave it a quick once over while waiting on our luggage to be brought up. Beautiful layout with full kitchen AND FULL SIZE fridge (which is a must with all the leftovers from the amazing restaurants in SAV). Standup shower (not an overhead rain style like in NYC) with great pressure. The bed is by far the single most comfortable bed / sheets combo I've ever experienced. It seriously makes it challenging to get motivated early in the morning. Overall room was a hit per the usual! Pool / Bar / Restaurant: Being the middle of November we didn't even check out the pool but have been numerous times in the hotter months and the pool is a very relaxing spot to hang out. That being said, I think they still have some entertainment around the fire pit and pool bar area during the evenings. The bar is well stocked and every bar tender we encountered was professional, attentive and fun. We unfortunately have never had supper at the Andaz restaurant 22 Square but if it's anything like breakfast then we'll be in luck. Breakfast has a beautiful presentation on their buffet style spread with fruits and meats and breads and the list goes on. We typically order off the menu and it's all delicious. Especially the breakfast smoothies. This was one of my longer reviews...and maybe that's because Savannah is my favorite city to visit and Hyatt has been excellent to us. But either way, you'll most definitely want to at least give this property a try and I'll guarantee you will want to come back.PS - check for fresh daily water with different fruit infusions (it's apparently made with crack) on the counters in the lobby before venturing off for your Savannah Dan walking tour!While the king room is cozier (aka smaller) than I expected as was the shower, the room and hotel has been decorated really well. The location is awesome!! Can't beat that! The staff is so friendly and so on top of things! Pricey? Yes! But a great splurge. The mini-bar is complimentary except for alcohol drinks so that's a win! Also wifi is included. The check-in was quick, smooth and high-tech. They greeted you at the door with iPads and also offered complimentary wine, a local beer or Coke selection at check-in. They also come and do turn down service in the evening, leaving the cutest chocolates with gold dusted honey bee ...I'm all about details in service and this hotel has far exceeded those! Wish the awesome fire pit and pool stayed open later. Definitely recommend if you have Hyatt points (it's a Hyatt hotel actually)!The Andaz is quality all the way. From the minute you walk in, the staff begins bending over backwards for you. I don't think I touched a door the entire weekend, because someone was always holding it open for me.  Everyone will greet you with a smile and possibly a conversation. The hotel itself is gorgeous from the lobby to the rooms. And the complimentary mini bar within each room is a great touch. Andaz may not be a cheap price tag, but you get exactly what you pay for.This is a beautiful place! Nice lobby with a clean and inviting restaurant that serves a bountiful breakfast buffet. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. Great bed! The staff is kind and accommodating. Free nonalcoholic beverages served to your room. The only thing I was never able to figure out was the wifi, but I know they have it. Bathrooms are clean and nice. No complaints! Great place!This was our first trip to Savannah. My husband and I took a long weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We chose this hotel first for the location, my husband has some disabilities so walking long distances can be challenging. The location is right on Ellis Square, right next to City market and just a block away from River street, we easily managed to find lovely restaurants and bars very close by. Speaking of bars, the hotel bar has wonderful craft cocktails-would not pass up a visit. This hotel is dog friendly as well, a huge bonus for us, although we left our pups home on this trip, it still was lovely seeing all the 4 legged friends walking around Ellis Square. I can not express enough how wonderful this hotel is, the staff were amazing- friendly and very helpful. The beds were cozy and the best part, a soaking tub in our suite to take the ache away at the end of the day. Free drinks and snacks in your room and the breakfast in the morning was perfect!PROS:1. Good location in Savannah2. If when I first walk in to check in and you offer me a refreshing glass of wine after a long day of traveling and humidity, you are golden.3. Very clean and with good decor tastes. Very boutique feel to the design.4. Free food and non alcoholic drinks in the rooms5. It looked like the bar and restaurant were good and hoppin, but sadly I didn't try it out.CONS:1. I have had friendlier and more accommodating staff, but they were okay here.2. Their pool closed really early and the pool furniture had cushions that were not tied down and I kept sliding off of them.3. Their poolside (not swim up) bar closed even earlier than the pool.4. Not a lof of staff attention to the pool area. Patrons would leave the pool and leave their towels and stuff there for someone to clean up and nobody did. So then when other patrons would come and want to sit, there was no where for them...they didn't know if those seats were taken. I would say that could also be the patron's fault too so I won't fault Andaz for that....I was very pleased that this place was incredibly pet friendly.  The staff was very nice; they opened doors, greeted with a smile, and the receptionist explained all paper work including giving us a listing of pet friendly places in the area.  The room itself was clean, however there were a couple of snafus.  Within the fridge, a coca cola had been opened but I can see how it could've been over looked since it almost appeared full.  The only reason I was able to notice it was opened was because the seal had been broken.  The steel mug was sticky and there was something wet and sticky behind the chocolate that was left at the snack bar.Aside from the snack bar and mini fridge, everything else was fine.  The location was great as everything else was in walking distance and the staff was very pleasant.  Across the street from the hotel was also a small park for you to walk your dog.They had a nice pool with a nice size outdoor lounge area and a small gym that gets the basics done.  All in a nut shell, it was a very nice hotel.  I'm sure if I told someone about the mini bar and snack thing, it would've been taken care of, but we really didn't care to have it refreshed for consumption.Would I recommend this hotel?  Absolutely, especially if you have a pet.This place was perfect. The room was huge, modern, and equipped. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Perfect location. Best hotel in Savannah. Tip: pricelineGreeted with a warm smile and wine upon arrival! Super friendly staff and hotel was decorated very well! The rooms were spacious and the bed was so soft! There is even a pit fire on the terrace and conveniently located in the historic center of Savannah! Thank you for such a wonderful experience :)Really nice location, we felt Wellcome and comfortable at the first step in! The room was immaculate, it felt to me like brand new and clean! This is definitely an hotel I will come back again and again and again!!Pretty hotel with great location on quiet and pretty Ellis Square - a block from the river, completely generic room, very helpful Concierge, and highly unpolished front desk staff. Because of a mess up we got free breakfasts, which were a notch better than many hate breakfasts.Wow- what a stay. The best sleep before the big race!Booking a room marathon weekend was tough. Hotels were selling out, far away or completely over priced for these dates. The hotel I chose through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> was in fact a corporate apartment rental off of Broughton Street. What a nightmare. Firstly, the hotel attempted to cancel the reservation, <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> called to verify the no vacancy and they come to discover that they in fact had availability. For check-in I called and the phone they use for business is a cell phone, voicemail full and the only other option is email. We corresponded a few times via email all for the manager to tell me to call <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> to verify check-in. I'm tired, frustrated, checking emails and calling all over to check-in. It was the biggest disappointment ever and on top of two hours of sleep and a two hour plane ride. I was on the phone with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> for two hours to get things straightened out, cancel my non-refundable apartment disaster and book anything else available. Thank goodness the weather was beautiful and warm because I was basking in the sun in the middle of one of Savannah's historic squares. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> finally came through in the end when even they could not contact the original hotel. Enter: The Andaz.The Andaz is centrally located near bars, restaurants and walkable to most of the city squares, parks and the river ferry.  The Andaz offers a check-in drink.  The staff is friendly and waiting to greet you with their iPad check-in and explain all the perks of the property.  The mini-bar is compliments except for the alcohol.  The snacks are complimentary.  The Andaz has a pool, patio and fire pit on the second floor that is a beautiful hidden gem in the middle of Savannah.  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> hooked me up with some sort of package that includes brunch reservations and a 3PM check out. (I was running during the brunch reservation, but extra thankful for the late check out).  The Andaz staff knew the majority of their guests were running so they set up a whole runner's breakfast at 4AM for us complete with drinks and healthy items! After the race and concert, I walked back to the hotel, took a shower, packed and was ready to venture to another part of Savannah.So, big thanks to the Andaz for being accommodating and convenient and beautiful and thanks to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> for making a terrible experience and great one.The friendliest and most efficient you will ever encounter. Very nice, modern, hip hotel with an open lobby (no ""front desk"") and an inventive bar. Great room with balcony (though perhaps overfurnished for the space).A nice, relaxing four night stay The Andaz is perfectly located in the heart of Savannah.We had the sizable ""Andaz King"" room with comfortable bathroom and walk in shower. A balcony - while not guaranteed upon reservation - was included. The balcony however is small with no chair space - it was hardly used.The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable - way beyond expectations. This resulted in wonderful sleeping nights. A true highlight. A/C worked quietly and perfectly - pleasure.Mini Bar offers free - yes free - non-alcoholic beverages and refills. Also free snacks replenished daily. This was a first for me - a nice touch.The Hotel Concierge was extremely helpful and sincere. She correctly advised us on tours and sight seeing. In fact service throughout was professionally friendly. Room cleaning - no issues. The one minor exception was phone service. Used on two occasions - feedback was cold and distant. The requested wake up call never came. We found the 22 Square Restaurant a bit disappointing (see separate review) however the 22 Bar was comfortable and enjoyed.The bed, the service, the vicinity of the hotel makes for a fine stay. Recommended.Im not in the mood to write a novel but I have to say i was very pleased with this hotel... Everything was on the money! Will stay there EVERYTIME I'm in Savannah! I wasn't happy about the 23.00 a day valet parking but you get what you pay for and I'm satisfied! Grant was very nice he even mapped out the places and recommended a awesome wing spot 520 wing!  Oh wait I cant leave out the complimentary wine at check in which was liquid gold after being on the beach with three boys! Okay im done! LolI generally don't like providing a review for places I have actually not stayed, but in this case I feel the information is useful.I made a reservation about 3 months ago to stay at the Andaz Savannah for the night of Thursday, Oct. 15th.  Plans changed and I no longer needed the reservation.  I called Tuesday, Oct. 13th at 9:14AM to cancel....  This Monday, Oct. 19th, I check my credit card bill to see a charge of $200+ from the Andaz.  When I called to inquire, they quickly proclaimed that they have a 48 hour cancellation period --- which is 24 hours longer than the average --- and that I had cancelled my reservation at 9PM on the 13th; therefore, they charged my credit card.  Problem with this was I called at 9:14AM.People make mistakes and that is fine, but what bothered me is that they were VERY defensive and accusatory, completely unwilling to work with me until I could literally prove them wrong, and they were the ones who were WRONG to boot.  In order for them to ""believe"" that I called at 9:14AM and issue a refund, I had to provide them with evidence.  For what they are charging, I don't think it is crazy to consider them in the ""luxury/upscale"" hotel business --- they need to start acting like it.So my takeaways from this hotel are: 1. They have a 48 hour cancellation policy and you better believe they will stick to it; and2. They think they are right even when they are wrong.Again, not a fan of providing a review that doesn't detail the stay, but this deals with their customer service ---- which is one of the most important aspects of a hotel stay --- and I had a very disappointing experience.I would give Andaz a  1 star rating for the disappointing customer service that my party received, however, the location and ambiance of the hotel definitely added another star. When checking in, the associate running the front end check-in area informed us that our room was not quite ready yet and that we provide an email for them to contact us when it was. That's okay we were a little early to check in anyway. We walked around Savannah and found a great place to eat lunch. 2 hours goes by and no email was sent yet. A little irratated, we walked back to the hotel and spoke with another check-in associate only to find out that the room we booked (king size suite) was no longer available and that a two queen bed  room was. Was not asked if that was okay, nor any apologies were given for the inconvenience, and the associate whom we first checked in with did not make eye contact or say anything to my party about not getting in contact with us.We took the room anyway, and it was very nice, clean, and the beds were very comfortable to sleep in. The pool area was fantastic and the associate in charge of the pool area was extremely friendly and caring for any of our needs. Overall, my experience was disappointing because exceptional service is an important thing I look for and expect from a 4 and 1/2 star hotel. If you want the same thing, I wouldn't stay here, however, if you're looking for location, romance, and modern, sleek hotel rooms, this place is for you.FAB-U-LOUS!!!That about sums it up! Staff was EXTRAordinary! Rooms were beautiful!  Bed was amazingly comfortable and cozy.  I LOVE pillows!  How did they know?  Complimentary beverage upon arrival (wine/soda).  Location location location!   Andaz gets 5 thumbs up (I may need to borrow 3 thumbs)!#dpursuitisreal #tellingyouwhatithink","Amazing people, super friendly, and the place is beautiful. I live in Savannah and deliver bikes to their guests who absolutely rave about the place. My wife and I ate dinner at their in-house restaurant and it was out of this world. Thanks so much from Savannah On Wheels.Pat the manager from Orange County was a goofball.  The room was decent, but way overpriced.  Visit here instead <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ACKhN5&amp;s=45f3cf4a6f98d342d6b02e770a08e646589f070cf894b541f9a42b82ae5e278a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1ACKhN5</a>The Harbour Inn gives you more sq footage, it's closer to the river, it's less money.  The Harbour Inn is the best deal in town!I really liked this hotel! Don't let the super simple lobby fool you!!  The service is good and the rooms are even better. Super clean, spacious, and good service. It has a contemporary and boutique feel to it..Judging from other yelp photos, I think this hotel was recently renovated and made much nicer. Apparently it used to be called the avia. Daily breakfast/brunch was included in our wknd package and they had a nice buffet with lots of pastries, cheese, fresh fruit, omelette station, potatoes, etc. The bed were soo comfortable and the bathroom were huge. The snacks in the mini bar were all complimentary too. Great location. I would def recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Savannah.I'm reviewing the bar only. Not the hotel or restaurant.  The best thing here: the bar bacon. Holy.Crap.The bacon is cooked, not fried. It is doused in sugar and it is perfectly crispy and sweet and salty (which is the best combination ever, is it not?)  And best of all: it's free.  You sit at the bar (or the seating in the bar area) and you can get yourself some free bacon!    Now, you'll pay a lot to drink with that there bacon.  But this is a hotel in a touristy area and they getcha!  Service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is upscale and quiet.  All in all a good place to grab an (overpriced) drink and delicious bacon!!I dream of coming back to the Andaz to stay in Savannah. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly. The lobby and bar is stunning and the room was something I will dream about for a long time- super comfortable king bed, large TV, great AC for humid summer days, and a beautiful bathroom, and full of hospitality. It was an amazing experience and I was blown away by this hotel. I highly recommend!There were ghosts in Savannah, alright.  In this case, they were the barely visible housekeeping staff at The Andaz.  We were checked in to a room that had a very dirty glass top table.  When I went to take a shower I realized there was one bottle of body lotion-no shampoo, conditioner or body gel.   After calling downstairs to ask for toiletries, we had a delivery to our room of everything but-SHAMPOO!.  I had to call again to have that delivered. Mirrors were filthy.  The housekeeper neglected to replace toilet paper, tissue, put the blow dryer away, and come on, this is a Hyatt.  Upon checkin we were asked if we wanted a cart for our luggage-no help was offered.We wanted to have a drink at the bar after a long day, and when we walked in, the entire place stank of fried fish.The beds were very comfortable, but the brown carpet grossed me out and always looked dirty.  The location is excellent.Although Clinton, the manager, listened and tried to have the problems corrected, we found this to be a very sloppily managed property.  And we will never go back..Oh wow, great mixologists here! Recommended a green chile gimlet and offered me their bacon maple morsels. What a treat! Would return and bring friends with for sure!!!We stayed at the Andaz on Valentine's Day weekend. It was special not only because of Valentine's Day, but also because of a surprise proposal I had planned. I researched several of the higher-end hotels in Savannah and kept finding myself looking at the Andaz - and boy am I sure glad I did. First, I needed an upscale hotel that offered luxery, convenience, and something that wouldn't absolutely break the bank. Second, I needed help at the hotel and Dan and Pat from the concierge desk ensured the room, flowers, picture (of us in the room), and reservations were made and good to go. A HUGE thanks to Dan and Pat!! Then Dan gave us tons of suggestions as far as fun things to do.Breakfast was tasty (maybe slightly overpriced) and the complimentary wine they give you when you check in was definitely a plus - who doesn't love free alcohol?! The food and non-alcoholic beverages in the in-room minibar were free.Finally, the room was more than comfortable and impecably clean. Seriously - impecable. Normally you can find a dirty window, mirror, spot behind the toilet or something - nope, NOT at the Andaz. Overall, we were incredibly impressed with not only the property but also the staff. Another giant thank you to the concierge desk for their help and extremely timely email responses. Planning a surprise engagement 7 hours away from home can be stressful but they did all they could to help. Would definitely like to stay more nights at the Andaz!This was a beautiful hotel and they were gracious. The hotel smelled great. That may seem weird, but go and you will get it. The room was beautiful. Nonalcoholic drinks in the minifrig were free. I would stay here again.For my birthday weekend, my husband planned a long weekend trip to Savannah. He got a great deal and booked our room here. I was very happy with his choice. This hotel is THE place to stay if you want to be in the middle of everything!  It's right off Ellis Square which is the main lifeline of this part of the City that is very touristy. City Market is literally a hop, skip and a jump not to mention River St which is a few minutes away. You are literally at the epicenter of everything and within walking distance. You would be silly not to stay here!The hotel is beautiful. And decorated very modern. It's stunning. The check in desk is essentially a counter with 2 laptops. I thought that was little wierd but I guess they're very much minimalists. The elevator system is a good one. You need your room key to move between floors or the elevator doesn't function. This is great for security and made me feel safe.   The room was immaculate and perfect. We had a king sized bed and it was sooo comfortable. i could've napped for days. We had a beautiful view of the pool. The bathroom was rather spacious and had a walk in shower.  Everything in our mini fridge was complimentary except the alcohol. Pretty cool perk. If you forget any toiletries, they are happy to provide as stated on a sign in the restroom . We didn't really have to use any hotel services. My husband had to get a duplicate of our room key made since he left it in the hotel room. They replaced with no problem.  Parking your car is steep but worth the peace and mind of knowing it's safe. We left it in the garage our entire stay since we walked everywhere.I would absolutely stay at this hotel again. I highly recommend if you want to stay at a hotel in the middle of everything . Looking forward to our next trip back!My husband and I stayed here on a recent anniversary trip to Savannah. The location cannot be beat! It's close to the City Walk and an easy walk to shopping and restaurants. The staff here is incredibly friendly. The front desk clerk, Megan, in particular was SO friendly and helpful. We also dined at the hotel's restaurant for our anniversary dinner which was wonderful (see soon to be posted separate review). Before arriving, we were given the opportunity to upgrade our room which we did not do. I would definitely recommend getting an upgraded or larger room when you book if you are staying more than one night. Our standard room was a little tight and the bathroom, while nicely appointed, was small. We upgraded for our last evening and really enjoyed the space and massive walk-in shower and soaker tub. The upgraded room would also easily accommodate a family with the kids staying on the sofa.The only negative to note was an experience with one of the concierge. Over our time there, we interacted three concierge (two women and one man). We asked them all the same thing: recommendations for dinner. The women gave us plenty of options ranging in price and food. With the male concierge, we wanted to speak with him about dinner options on our first night there. We had to wait about 10 minutes for him to show up and when he did it was clear he wanted to be finished ASAP (it turns out he was leaving in 15 minutes for the day). Instead of giving us options and letting us decide when/where we would eat, he was clearly trying to push us to specific restaurants (that had HORRIBLE Yelp! reviews btw) and asking us to use his business card when we dined there. It felt really pushy and completely inconsistent with the vibe of the hotel and the interactions we had with every other employee. We also noted that none of the other concierge acted this way when we asked them the same question. Other than this one anomaly, the hotel was wonderful and we would definitely stay there again.Checked in last night. The staff seemed friendly at front desk at first. I called earlier yesterday to confirm a double queen bed and they confirmed it over the phone. But when I got here they said the manager has the room and they can only give me a king bed. After waiting for 20 minutes they finally came back and gave me a double queen bedroom with the receptionist saying they met me halfway as if they did me a favor by giving me a room which was mine to begin with.Also the reception staff promised me complimentary breakfast at first but when I got my keys to the room I was not even given those passes. I am a hyatt gold pass member and treating your loyal members like this breaks my trust in the hyatt brand.Higher management needs to look into this and make sure no one else suffers from this kind of acceptable behavior from hotel staffEnjoyed a day off in Savannah last summer, and ended up settling down at this hotel. Not knowing much about the property or the area going into it, I was extremely happy to see that the front desk employees and concierge were there to help me and my fellow guests out with literally any question we had. At one point after we arrived, it started pouring rain outside, and the concierge offered myself and my group a bunch of umbrellas at no charge to walk around the center of the town. As far as the rooms go, very modern and up-to-date all around, GREAT shower, spacious living quarters, and comfortable beds with clean white linens. We did not eat at the attached restaurant, but from what I saw of the menu, it looked like it might be a good choice. Would absolutely stay again.The Andaz Savannah is my hotel soul mate.  I love everything about it:  the location, the decor, the wine they give you when you check in, the free food/drinks in the room, the super kind valet parking guys, and the killer restaurant downstairs (and the fact that you can order the food while you sit at the bar).  I travel for work and am a devout Hyatt customer.  This hotel makes me wish every city had an Andaz....I stayed at the Andaz Savannah for the Rock and Roll Marathon weekend, also Veteran's Day weekend. The staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about the area. I was welcomed with beverage of choice. The 4 am wake-up call was prompt. The room was immaculate and the hotel was just steps away from City Market and all the fun restaurants and bars in Historic Downtown Savannah. The restaurant downstairs is amazing. We went for brunch--order the fried chicken and bacon-waffles. The epitome of the south, it was a DELICIOUS reward after the 26.2 miles that I ran the day before!*Note that you MUST book this hotel early--I reserved a king suite about 5 months prior to the race.For the price and location this place is a gem. Staff is friendly and rooms are clean and comfy. Why stay anywhere else in Savannah?Minimalist, clean lines hotel for ppl who appreciate good design and a modern setting. Great location and perks like free premium snacks and non-alcoholic beverages. Impressive selection. We stayed in a suite on the square for a nominal upgrade fee, prob bc the hotel was empty bc it's off season. Fab beds, pillows, and a beautiful free standing tub plus all the expected 4star perks- slippers, robes, etc. They lose a star for three reasons:1) the cable tv is the quality of bunny ears on top of the TV. The size of the TV is great but it means nothing if the quality of HBO is grainy like its the 1970s. 2) one disenchanted front desk individual who lacked southern charm and the normal 5 star hospitality I've grown accustomed to. Maybe it's unfair to take a star away for one person, but she was fake and rude. It was probably their B-list players bc it was the night staff but I called and requested something and she told me she would call back to confirm. An hour passed and there was no call back so I stopped downstairs. Same person I spoke to on the phone acted like she had no idea what I was talking about when I saw her in person. Really?? It's off season. You should step up your game and be greeting ppl by their last name if you really want to impress! 3) non-suite rooms are small. And I know ppl complain about the parking but u can self park for$12/day around the corner.My husband and I stayed at the Andaz for one night while visiting Savannah. It was absolutely amazing. We were treated like royalty upon check in and even received a complementary glass of wine. Our room was beautiful. We had a suite style room with a king bed. It was very spacious. The only thing I did not like about the room was that there wasn't a separate larger bathtub. Usually in suite style rooms you have a separate tub...but it was still a great room. We stayed on the 2nd floor which also had a small pool and nice outdoor balcony with a fire pit. We didn't utilize the pool but it looked very nice and we were disappointed to see that the fire pit was not turned on at night. The bed was incredibly comfortable, one of the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. If ever in the area again we will definitely stay at the Andaz again. Highly recommend. I forgot to mention that it is incredibly close to EVERYTHING.Stayed here over Memorial day with friends. Cool, hip, fun, comfortable, excellent location and great staff. Now what else do you want to know!?Beautiful hotel in a terrific location right in the heart of Savannah's historic waterfront district. My fiance and I have been to savannah several times, and we will most definitely be returning to this hotel in the future. From the kind welcome (complete with complimentary drinks) to the outstanding service at the bar and restaurant, the staff made every aspect of our stay was a pleasant one.","Great hotel. Kind and welcoming staff. Very clean rooms. It was nice receiving complimentary bottles of water, sodas and snacks. This hotel seems high tech. I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.My husband and I stayed at the Andaz M-F for our 15th wedding anniversary.  The rooms were very clean.  All mini bar items, excepting alcohol, were free for us to use and there was a small piece of chocolate which I hoarded each day. The location is excellent -- two streets over from river street (totally unnecessary to stay ON river street, IMO, as most of the GREAT restaurants are not on it) and with a view of the charming Ellis square with its fun fountains for kids, visitor center and trolley/dot stops.  I was not terribly impressed with the concierge staff. Not excessively friendly.  Well, some of them were. Others were eh.  However, my husband says they were very accommodating and friendly to HIM, so maybe they just like hot guys. The bartender was a little snooty but I wasn't there to hang out with him so I won't hold it against the hotel.  The restaurant staff was charming, however, as were the cleaning staff.  We stayed in a King suite and had a free standing tub and separate shower, and a tiny little balcony we could walk out on and look over the square.  Both the hubs and I fit in the tub;)  Bed was comfortable and the water pressure was good.  There was a small pool but we didn't use it.  Parking was $23 a day, no way out of it.Overall, it was a nice place to stay if you are looking for a modern hotel, in a good location with clean rooms.There is a reason this hotel is one ranked in the top 50 hotels in the U.S.!  Pat Howard and his team at reception are true hospitality pros - they know your name, remember your tastes and always welcome you with a nice glass of wine or local beer.  The beds are guaranteed to give a perfect nights sleep and the amenities including open mini bar (all non-alcoholic snacks and drinks are free!) is really great.  Their restaurant (22 Squared) is one of the best in Savannah with some truly phenomenal bread.  I'm a consultant and 'live' in hotels and the Andaz Savannah is hands down one of the best I've ever stayed!Great location it's pretty much in the middle of everything, good solid choice there are lots of options in the downtown area depending if you just want a bed or you want a little luxury you will pay for the luxury. If you need your car allow yourself plenty of time for them to bring it around so plan ahead. Good service and accommodations.Very clean, bed slept great and staff were super friendly.  Liked the complimentary drink when we checked in. It is in a great location.AMAZING. We walked in super grubby from camping (yes, embarrassing) and were allowed to get into our room early to clean up. Upon our arrival we were offered a glass of wine. The entry way was fresh and lively, the room was gorgeous, even the hallways were cool. All the snacks in the room were complimentary, minus the alcohol, which is not necessary but certainly illustrates their hospitality. They have a beautiful rooftop pool and fire pit, although we didn't get to access those due to weather. It's an overall great location within walking distance of everything downtown. The concierge was helpful and gave us lots of great recommendations for our evening and daytime plans.The good: location, friendliness of staff.The bad: room was drab, mildew in bathroom, restaurant sold outOverall this doesn't hold up to the NYC Andaz venues.This was a great hotel and in an equally great location as everything I wanted to see was within walking distance. It was my first experience with the Andaz hotel group and I am a fan! The hotel staff was lovely and very knowledgable about the surrounding area providing directions, suggestions, and helpful tips. The bed was extra comfortable and the rooms were well designed. Also, they had a free mini bar! Yes, you read that correctly. When I checked into the hotel I was told the mini bar was complimentary (excluding alcohol). I thought I had misheard them, but when I got to the room the mini bar sign confirmed this to be true. Plus they had free toothpaste in the bathroom! It is the little things like this that make me a happy hotel guest. I appreciate the small gestures like this because it made the whole experience enjoyable. I highly recommend the Andaz Savannah!I would give five stars, but the beds are FIRM. That being said the staff, bar, restaurant, service are fantastic. Upon check in we had learned they upgraded us to a 900$ a night suite while still being charged the $250 standard room rate. I had never heard of an Andaz hotel before staying here but would definitely stay at this hotel anywhere chain wide. If you are a light sleeper (paper-thin walls, firm mattresses) this hotel is not for you, otherwise bring it on, fabulous place. Also, the hotel is pet friendly wish we had known that upon making reservations.My wife and I stayed at the Andaz Savannah hotel while in town for a short vacation. The first night we stayed in the Westin Harbor Resort and it was okay.  The second night we stayed in the Andaz and it was AMAZING.  Upon checking in, the hotel personnel sits you down to check in.  They offer a complimentary beverage including wine during the check in process.  It reminded me of a resort in the Dominican Republic because the attention to detail.  The service was extraordinary and personalized to meet our needs.  Once we arrived to the room we opened the door to find a wonderfully decorated sitting room and a plush bedroom.  We felt at home. The two rooms worked well because my wife watched a television show in the bedroom and I watched another one while on the couch in the sitting room.  I really have to give a big thank you to Melinda Ellenburger &amp; Grant Danial for their extraordinary customer service.  We have stayed at many hotels and this is by far superior to all.PROS:* Excellent customer service* Personalized service* Wonderfully decorated rooms * Snack and non-alcoholic drinks included in your fee* Centrally located; walking distance to the Riverfront and the Market PlaceCONS:* Not many. The only think I can think of is that you pay a separate price to park your vehicle. But that didn't bother us.The next time you are in Savannah be sure to check out the Andaz.  It is worth the extra money.This was our first time at an Andaz and it was a homerun.  We felt taken care of every moment of our three night stay.  Cookies and infused water in the lobby 24 hours a day!  Free snacks and non-alcoholic beverages.  Free Wi Fi.  Perfect location on Ellis Square.  One block from City Market.  Perhaps, the biggest surprise was the quality of the breakfast.  Homemade flatbreads and biscuits, yogurt, roasted vegetables, eggs to order.  And the best grits and grits bar ever!!!  Concierge and all staff were always friendly and helpful.  Only downside was a bit noisy around 2am on SAturday night from noise on the square.  I am sure there are quieter rooms but the view of the square is worth the noise.Room is absolutely spotless. The decor is beautiful, updated and modern. You cannot beat this location. The receptionists greet you by name and do their best to ensure your happiness. Your refrigerator is stocked and snacks are free. I've stayed at $400+/night hotels that can't hold a candle to to the room at the Andaz that is under $200Andaz Savannah is a WONDERFUL place to stay when you're in Savannah. It's right in the middle of everything and practically everything is walkable from this hotel. We bought our 9 month old baby and were able to go back to the hotel everytime we wanted to change his diaper - that's how centrally located this hotel is!We got one of the suites which had a real fridge (not one of those mini fridges that sometimes don't work), a stove top, and a kitchen sink. They even had paper towels and free snacks! This was a huge lifesaver for traveling with a baby who was also starting solid foods. I was able to bring a lot of foods for him, as well as store his formula in the fridge, and wash his bottles in the kitchen sink. We visited during New Years Eve and had a balcony facing City Market. At midnight we went out to the balcony and celebrated with the rest of Savannah while still being in our room and close to our baby. We really had a wonderful time here and I would highly recommend staying here, especially if you have small children, but I'd recommend it even if you don't :)I stayed in the Andaz's Studio Suite for my wedding and was in residence there May 24-25,2014. Pros: {} Excellent location. City Market is the perfect springboard to enjoy River Street, Broughton Street, and obviously the immediate surrounding area. Love it! {} Spotless, large rooms. I was especially impressed with the huge bathroom.{} Fancy decor. The velvety red sofa in our room was insanely comfy. {} Free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks en suite, including an Adam Turoni chocolate - yummmm. {} Delicious restaurant located downstairs. {} Fantastic value - the Andaz is a fraction of the price that certain other fancy area hotels charge, and it has much larger rooms to boot. {} Great selection of complimentary amenities - if you have forgotten anything from a razor/shaving cream to the standard toothbrush/toothpaste, the concierge is ready to deliver! {} Complimentary wine upon check-in - who wouldn't be happy about that?! Cons: {} Expensive {albeit not mandatory, so I'm not counting this against them in my review} valet parking at $23/day. Bummer, especially considering that otherwise parking in Savannah is completely free on the weekends {extremely scarce though it may be}. {} If you are the type to require absolute quiet while you sleep, this is not the place for you. City Market can get rowdy most every night of the week, and the Andaz is right in the thick of all that noise and debauchery.Pros:-Great location- right off Ellis Square-Good value- very nice for average nightly rate-Helpful, friendly staff-Free glass of wine with check-inCons:-Valet was $23 for the night, and took almost 20 minutes to retrieve the car in the morning. -Shower leaked onto bathroom floor-Rooms are a little on the small sideExcellent service, honest staff. We came here for our mini-moon and stayed Mon-Weds. Upon arrival everyone from the valet, the people that greeted and opened the doors for us, to the front desk were exceptionally friendly and professional. We loved the glasses of wine we received upon check in and the hotel even provides complimentary sodas and snacks in your hotel room. Such an easy thing for hotels to do, but rarely done! The hotel is in a great central location and were quick to give us anything we needed. Such as directions, recommendations, toothpaste (which I forgot to pack) and always with a smile. The BIGGEST surprise was the day after we checked out, we accidentally left cash in the in-room safe (a wedding gift) and called to see if it had been found. The managers and staff found, and stored the money for us until we were able to come back for it! I was already impressed with the Andaz and now this will forever be our spot in Savannah. Best service hands down!New property, great location. Super friendly staff, glass of wine greeting. Awesome lobby and open bar/ restaurant, very chic. Nice pool area, bar, chairs &amp; towels.Perfect size room &amp; bathroom. Clean &amp; comfy, cozy bed.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else!Pulled up to the front door and out came the valet. I asked him where we could park, it's right down in the center of town. Across the street was another big name chain hotel with a HUGE parking garage attached. The valet's response, ""We have $20+ in and out valet parking or you can go around the corner to where we park valet cars and pay $16 to park yourself!"" A hotel without parking - reminds me of New York, but this ain't New York.We got a ""deal"" off one of the hotel sites of $115 a night plus taxes that raised the price to around $150. No mention was made regarding the parking situation.So we go park and come back, walk into the lobby, and it looks like somebody went into an Ikea or a Pier One Imports and bought one of everything. ""Minimalist"" and ""modern"" was the attempted theme, but the reality was garish. It looked like someone with no taste had said ""let's make this space open and mod"" rather than warm and inviting. Waiting for the elevator was awhile - only two in the entire building and no separate elevator for service personnel so everybody's using the same lifts. When we walked in the ""Host"" offered us a ""suite with a bath"" for an extra $25. I didn't think about it at the time, but when we got to the room one of the first things I noted was there wasn't a bath tub. There was a big comfy bed and a HUGE television, as though we were going to spend our time in town in the room lying in bed and watching TV, but no tub. Essentially, imagine a Motel 6 type of room only ""luxury"" with a mini bar. Canned Cokes out of the mini bar were $4 each. There were pints of hard liquor but God alone knows what they cost because they weren't listed in the book. Wifi reception in the room wasn't very strong and was UNSECURED. Do NOT use your computer in this hotel unless you are willing to risk being hacked.What's GOOD? Centrally located to downtown. You can park your car yourself and not worry about getting in and out. There's a  breakfast place named Goose Feathers that's less than 100 yards from the hotel that has $7 eggs Benedict croissants that are WONDERFUL and cost 1/2 the price of the hotel's muffin, coffee, and a glass of juice continental breakfast. There's also a wonderful Iranian restaurant called Persopolis less than 3 blocks away that again is better and less expensive than the hotel restaurant. All in all there wasn't anything horribly wrong with this hotel, except perhaps having to ride the elevator up with bell hops carrying linens and room service. The real downside of it was that the ONLY thing it really had going for it was location. The rooms were smaller than your average Motel 6 and the amenities, while classier, were functionally equal. A TV, a chair to sit in, a shower, sink and toilet. Nothing special here except location.The funniest part was the rate card posted on the back of the room door. Apparently the room we were in was a $900 a night retail room. No wonder they have to sell deals online to fill them!Paying ultra-high end ($900 a night retail!!!) prices for Motel 6 amenities is not my idea of a 'good buy.""I wouldn't stay here again. It's just not as nice as they think it is, or the price implies. It is in a fantastic location. There are just some basic things wrong with it. The set up in the lobby is weird and frantic. I checked in online so it was quick, but the staff is all standing up around a counter; think Apple Store. The issue is that when it's busy, it devolves into a bunch of people standing around and no one has any idea what is going on or who works there given that there's no name tags.  They did give us complimentary beverages consisting of a white wine in a scratched up glass and a warm beer. We stayed in the Ellis Square suite, great view, but the room was 80 degrees during the day and the staff wasn't really interested in fixing it. We ordered room service breakfast. Not good. I ordered a sourdough egg, cheese, and tomato sandwich that arrived on a hamburger bun with no tomato. They forgot my wife's toast, also supposed to be sourdough. They were out of sourdough and apparently tomatoes, but didn't bother to tell us. Finally, the valet is awful. The truck pulled up with the seat settings, including memory changed, the radio settings changed, and some kind of sticky liquid all over the windows. The staff did take off the valet charges after we complained. It feels like there is no grown up in charge and no attention to detail. This place should be $150 a night, not $400. There are better options in downtown Savannah.Stayed here over New Years week. Can't say enough about how attentive and polite the staff was. Very helpful. The turn down service and room stocked with refreshments and snacks was great! Even had a package delivered here that they had no problem holding on to. Only set back is that parking options include 23 dollars per day for valet parking or parking in a public garage. For the week it cost us 58 dollars in the public garage. Great experience thought. If we ever return to Savannah, Andaz is where we will be staying.","Stayed for 3 nights last week.  The place had a cold look.  Bar in the lobby which I thought was strange.  There was mold in the shower.  We got back to the room one day at 4PM and the room was still not made up.  The room was very small.  Not a place I would stay at again.When we visit Savannah, we normally stay in a B&amp;B that allows a small, if ornery, Boston Terrier. Since this was a quick dash in and out for a wedding we were sans pup and weren't as worried about a walkable square nearby. Location:  the Andaz will set you up nicely in a very walkable Savannah. I know many people enjoy the market area and the river walk, but it's pretty touristy. Valet: we had about 20 minutes to change and get to the wedding. The valet guy let us stay parked out front. Totally nice so that we didn't get hit with that parking fee twice. The downside was when we called ahead In the morning the next day for our car - gave them 15 minutes lead time - and it wasn't there when we were done dealing with a billing problem. The lounge:  swanky and fun. Had a drink there after the wedding. The room:  very comfortable bed. A little noisy so close to the market, but not too bad. The police were checking out the noise level when we walked by the visitor center earlier. Pool area:  wanted to go have a drink in the evening or early morning coffee by the fire pit but it wasn't turned on either time. Overall impression:  we caught a room charge on our bill from the bar that wasn't ours (45 bucks or so) so we called down early in the a.m. before checkout.  We were told that they needed to check with the bar and they would call us back. They never did so we asked about the charge upon checking out. They took it off our bill, so no biggie. I would stay here again as it is a fun little place.Very clean rooms! Beautiful modern yet vintage style rooms that all have great views. Customer service was excellent and $23 per day valet parking was well worth it. We will be back!The Andaz Savannah is in a great location in Savannah's historic district. The hotel is close to Savannah's attractions and we enjoyed exploring all the city had to offer and could literally walk anywhere that we wanted to. In fact we didn't use our car at all during our stay so you may want to park your car yourself to save on valet parking ($23 a night). The room was a good size and the staff was very courteous.  The only drawback of the hotel is the price as I'm pretty sure I would be unwilling to pay $349 for a suite if I was forced to pay full price. Our family is on a pretty tight budget so we like to stay within the $100-125 range for most rooms when we aren't using points. However, $179 for the room we received was definitely worth it especially if you include the free breakfast, free wine, free wi-fi and free mini-bar snacks and non-alcoholic beverages.Although we would recommend the hotel as our stay was a nice one, you may want to see what other options are available if you are looking to lower your overall vacation costs and don't have Hyatt Diamond status. If you are looking for a more upscale place, the price we paid was a pretty good deal considering all that we received.Check out our entire review at:<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelingveggies.com%2Fhotel-review-andaz-savannah%2F&amp;s=afae3a208588b12b5b7aa97a2387b848345f73e4ff56bbec0c2de04aa13cd22d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">travelingveggies.com/hot...</a>Traveling VeggiesPrimo. Tastefully decorated. Clean. Complimentary drink upon arrival. Valet. Right in the middle of everything.Please do not use this hotels parking service.  They parked my new car and ended up denting the front end and not admitting to doing it.  They changed the parking ticket and circled the dent and said it was there when they got it.  filled out an accident report but nothing was done. I keep calling but do not get returned calls.  just disgusting!Stayed here with a large group for work for over a month. Was completely dissatisfied by their service. The situation with the restaurant/room service was beyond a joke. I would go to the restaurant and asked to be seated..even though there were only 4 tables occupied (this is at 8pm on a weeknight) the hostess told me it would be a 40 minute wait. I said..'uh, ok' well then can I sit and the bar and order something to eat? and she replied..'sure, but I won't be able to send someone over to take your order for 40 minutes.' WHAT?Had multiple experiences with room service that left me shaking my head. I'd call to order something off the late night menu (at 11 pm) and the person said..'Yeah, if I were you, I'd just go out and get something from a restaurant cause it's gonna be a WHILE'Another time I ordered a sandwich and a glass of wine. An hour later it still hadn't arrived..I called downstairs and they said it would be just a minute..knock at the door and there the woman was with my sandwich..she handed me a tray then said 'i have to do a second trip for your glass of wine, so I'll be back' then she turned and left. She hadn't forgotten it, she just acknowledged that carrying a sandwich on a tray *and  a glass of wine was not possible. so 20 mins pass and she came back with the wine. The whole thing was so odd. I could go on and on adding stories. (room always dirty, they lost a fed ex package for me, then after 4 days I asked if I could go into their 'back room' and found it there, clearly marked. Also, the rooms have expensive HDTV televisions, but the hotel has old basic cable wiring, so even though the televisions are good, the picture is terrible quality (480p) .The picture was so  fuzzy our group would just leave the hotel to go to a sports bar to watch the football game or baseball playoffs, because it was so lousy to try and watch in our rooms. Just a very strange experience all around. I'm not saying the people who work here are bad people, just the general feeling is they don't really care and aren't even slightly motivated to do their jobs. The hotel location is great. And I'm sure this is considered one of the nicer hotels in the city. Just if you are staying here, don't expect much in way of cleanliness in the room, don't even think of ordering room service. And you've been warned about the weird situation with the hotel restaurant, which obviously isn't into being a restaurant, cause restaurants survive by serving food to people. Not turning away business when 4 tables are occupied.Wonderful customer service, modern updated facilities, complimentary drinks upon check in, plus a great little bar and breakfast restaurant. Plus, it's centrally located to town and much more affordable and has more character than the very outdated bigger box sister hotel a few blocks away. Stay here and be happy or stay at what you think you'd like and be incredibly disappointed.Best hotel experience I've ever had.  The location is excellent - it doesn't get any better.  Plus, it is the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in, which is the most important factor of any in my book.  The bed was also the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever had - soft, comfy, and supportive.  Plus the room was well decorated, and you got free snacks every day and a free glass of wine when checking in.  The staff was knowledgable and friendly, and the fitness room was excellent with free cold water on-site provided in a mini fridge and free apples and headphones.  The only downside to this hotel, that I experienced, was the pricey parking.Great hotel and great location.  We had a nice suite overlooking the pool and round glass fireplace.  Only boo..they never turned the fireplace on!  If you want an outdoor bar with patrons, you have to turn on the attraction!  Also, didn't find a jacuzzi which would have been welcome. Would definitely stay again if in Savannah.Caveat:  we were able to book a reservation at this hotel using a Hyatt voucher, so I have no idea how much it would've actually cost us to stay here.  This AVIA is being converted into a Hyatt in September '12.  It's a beautiful resort-like facility with very helpful staff.  Our room was small, but very cozy.  The bathroom was a little odd, but no complaints here.  Location was perfect.  As the other reviewers mentioned, the hotel is within walking distance to just about everything in downtown Savannah.  There's a small gym with fresh apples, towels, and bottled water on the second floor.  There's also a small but adorable pool on the same floor that no one seemed to be using while we were there.  Must've been a not-so busy season for them, it was like our own private pool.  During our stay, we noticed that they put containers of iced water and tea by the elevators.  Nice touch!  Definitely refreshing after a day of walking around downtown Savannah in crazy humidity! The bars around the area were pretty buzzing on Saturday night and surprisingly dead on Sunday night (do people not go out on Sundays here??).  There's also a variety of shopping options available nearby on Broughton (?) Street and River Street (check out the Savannah Bee Company!).  Also not to be missed is Paula Deen's restaurant: Lady &amp; Sons, literally 3-minute walk from the hotel.  Getting reservation here can be tough, so we were happy that the front desk staff were able to get us a reservation at the last minute.   Moon River Brewing Co. is also 3-minute walk from the front door.  Dubbed the most haunted establishment in America, it has stories to tell, really good lager and cheap lunch specials.  My only complaint is that getting a cup of coffee here in the morning was tougher than it should be (and a small cup is $2.60! WTF! Rip off!).My husband and I visited Savannah for our 3 year anniversary. Very impressed with the Andaz! The rooms are beautiful. They did not have our king bed room when we got there so we ended up with 2 queens. They did offer us breakfast on them and offered us to move to a king room the next am however we opted out and stayed in our 2 queen room. The staff was friendly and knowledgable of the area and what we should do. Jacob the bartender made great suggestions of places to check out for sunset and rooftops (cotton sail and bohemian--AMAZE)! Paul, one of the chefs in the eating area explained all about their breads...and their open kitchen area. Cool concept. The breads were awesome! We didn't eat in their restaurant so I can't comment on that but seemed to have a great menu.  I would highly recommend going to have dinner at the Old Pink House. Diana - the singer/piano player in the tavern in the basement was hilarious and def made it memorable. Food was great! Def rec Andaz savannah and the surrounding area for a great get away. Another little option- we like to look at groupon or living social for little discounts around town.... Found a great little place this way.A friend came into town and I took a staycation at his hotel during spring break. This hotel has a lot of contemporary design both in the lobby as well as in the rooms that is refreshing and fun. Its also centrally located next to City Market and Congress st. which contains a lot of the bars and Paula Dean's restaurant. Its also minutes away from the tourist hub of River st and Broughton st.The room itself had a King Sized bed, which was uber comfortable and huuuge! And I totally forgot that the room itself wasn't very big. The shower was more like a room in of itself. You could also adjust the height of the shower head on this sliding bar, or take it off altogether to get those hard to reach places (lol). It also had two water settings. Another great thing about the room were the free snacks and non-alcoholic beverages located in a small fridge in the room. It was a nice touch, and reminded me of something a bed and breakfast would do. I also enjoyed the free slippers, we each got a pair. They make your feet look like marshmallows. There is also a heated pool on a second floor deck, so you can swim when its chilly outdoors. And giant pool towels that smell good. They also had a fire pit that was nice to sit by after a swim, as well as cabanas and an outside bar that looked like it mayb open in the warmer months.We decided to splurge and get the full ""buffet"" breakfast. It included cold cuts (like they do in europe, is more delicious than it sounds).. procuitto, interesting cheeses,  croissant pastries, and different kinds of beautifully displayed fruit and granola and stuff like that. Also included were the made-to-order options of bacon and potatos. AND it also included this really fresh breakfast sandwich that more reminded me of a vegetarian eggs benedict with arugula and tomao, two eggs over easy with hollaindaise on a double english muffin. It was melt-in -your- mouth bliss followed by local Perc coffee. One night, when were on our way out for dinner they had a jazz trio set-up near the bar/ lounge area which is really open and modern. They also have a little table near the entrance with locally made key-lime cookies and water while your waiting for valet to get your car which is less expensive than parking the car yourself!The friendly staff topped everything off and made the Andaz to be a great stay, we will be back. Thanks!This is a wonderful hotel. It has a great location in savannah that allows you to walk throughout much of the downtown area.  The hotel itself is hip and modern and the rooms are well appointed.  Splurge on a loft upgrade - for $30 more you get a bigger bathroom, private balcony and a living room.  The hotel has nice touches such as offing a glass of wine or soda on arrival, items in the mini bar are complimentary (except alcohol) and a truly gracious and accommodating staff.My wife and I stayed here 2 nights during a recent vacation and will definitely return again.Stayed 4 days there early June 2015. All employees are extremely nice and welcoming. There is a very nice and pleasant ambiance everywhere that made our stay very relaxing and enjoyable. Arriving we were allocated a room on the plaza. As we were a bit concerned by the noise (it was graduation weekend), we were graciously rebooked to a suite on the 5th floor with no expense. This was really great. We were using Hyatt coupons but booked using a credit card for a non refundable non exchangeable rate. The supervisor made an exception to the policy and we were able to switch to our coupons when checking out. Breakfast were really nice, especially on the WE. We could unfortunately feel that the choice was becoming narrower as the week was passing, not sure why. They were almost out of vegetable on Wednesday. The made to orders eggs and omelette are fantastic. Water and sodas are free, if you are running short on water bottle, just give a call to the reception and in a few minutes you will get more at your room's door. Quite impressive. Pool seems nice - did not try; gym is nice, enough for a good workout. Overall I can only recommend very highly this place which we will use again as we definitely plan to return to the beautiful Savannah. Walking distance from the stores, bars, restaurants and riverfront. Parking is easy ($10 a night self parking at the public parking, or $23 for valet parking, very quick and efficient).I am a local in Savannah so I have the opportunity to frequent 22 Square Restaurant and Bar often so this review is a compilation of at least 7 visits. First things first. THE COCKTAILS are incredible and artfully prepared with only the freshest mixes and the finest small batch liquors by their very talented bartenders. Their well vodka is better than others house vodka. If you are making reservations to eat at 22 Square Restaurant plan accordingly because you will definitely want to try 1 or even 3 of the pre prohibition craft cocktails. They make their own ginger beer and tonic! If you like Manhattans you need to try the East of Hudson-their award winning version of the classic Manhattan or try the original cocktail the Sazerac. You will not be disappointed. Having ate here multiple times I can tell you everything I've had has been delicious. Most if not all of the menu is locally sourced from the Savannah area. I always start my meal with a cheese and charcuterie plate. The sliced meats are always different and always tasty. Both plates are dressed with house made pickles, preserves, and bread. The Brooklet Georgia Chicken Risotto was rich and creamy and tasted great with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Every night the beef tenderloin is prepared a different way and on both occasions of ordering I fell in love.  Pro tips.1. If you are looking for a nice quiet date night dinner request the dining room. If not I suggest sitting at one of the high top community style tables near the kitchen prep table. Here you are very likely to enjoy a ""foody"" conversation with the Chef  and possibly a treat from a local chocolatier. 2. If you are alone or you are looking for a quick dinner sit at the bar or the lounge area and order the The Ribeye Sandwich from the bartender. It is possibly the worlds best sandwich. There is other options on the bar menu like a hamburger and chicken wings but trust me the sandwich is THE BEST. 3. If you want to try their soon to be world famous Candied Bacon get to the bar before 7 because it will be gone soon after. CONS:Walking into a hotel for dinner or drinks when you aren't staying in the hotel is a little intimidating. I think a second door dedicated to the restaurant would help.  The valets dress code is too casual and their attitude is very curt.I can only rate the bar as I didn't stay here but my Son did along with all his Groomsman and they said it was awesome.They have a really nice bar area on the 2nd level around the pool.It's cool becuase they have an automatic 'mister' that keeps it cool by the pool.It can get quite hot and humid in Savannah.Stayed here on a romantic weekend getaway with my husband. Pros: friendly staff, very quick and welcoming check-in. It seemed right off the bat that they were very eager to be of service and to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Complimentary mini-bar in the room (everything except alcohol is free in your room's minibar.) beds are divine! So comfortable and just lovely. Location cannot be beat! You are literally .2 miles from most anything you could want to do! Cons: they say they have room service, but the menu is very sparse. No tubs... And shower is really small. Ultimately, though, we recommend it. The staff and location are really what make this hotel a stand-out. We will be back!FABULOUS PLACE TO STAY! +Service excellent; concierge will go above and beyond to help you book any tour or find a location on the map. Front desk always friendly; riding the elevator with a staff member was a treat.  Defines southern hospitality.+Beautiful pool, w bar service nearby. Relaxing music is played throughout outdoor area.  Only concern is that I wish there had been more lounge chairs (probably only about 6 w two cabanas). +Room are uniquely decorated. +Location: close to river front, famous restaurants, and notable squares/architectures.Stayed at this hotel from 10-17 to 10-19. Very nice hotel pretty much near everything in Savannah's Historic District. Got there way before check-in time and they had a room available. I wanted a higher floor so I had to wait a few hours longer. So I went to grab some food in the area. When your room is ready they send you a text message. Cool! Very helpful staff.The room was small, but size isn't a big deal for me. King sized bed was very comfortable with very soft down pillows. The room is stocked with drinks and snacks that are FREE!!!! (Minus the alcoholic beverages which are pretty expensive). And there were plenty of free drinks. So many that I took a couple and poured them down the sink for the heck of it...JK. The bathroom was nice. No tub, just a standing shower which could've used a shower curtain but that's no big deal to me. The rooms come with free wi-fi but they forgot to give me the access code and I was out seeing Savannah so much that I didn't browse the web too much while there.It's a little cool in Savannah around this time so while I didn't get in the pool, I did view the area. The pool is nice looking but small. The sign says max capacity is 35 people. But I'm not sure if 20 people could fit in it. There are about 5 cabanas around the pool and a fire pit that was not lit while I was there.All in all it was a great place to stay. Valet is a little pricey at $23 per day. They have a restaurant and a bar but I didn't get a chance to try either. I would definitely stay here again.","This was an amazing hotel!!! Room was modern, stylish and spacious. Staff was super friendly and the hotel location was perfect. The Andaz made our days in Savannah extremely enjoyable!I took a recent trip to Savannah with my wife for a short vacation. I could not have been happier with our choice to stay at the Andaz. The staff is the friendliest, most helpful in a hotel I've experienced. The room was fantastic, and we loved the local snacks and beverages supplied. We also did a number of tours of the city, and by the end we were joking that everywhere the tours took us, we were never further than a few blocks from the hotel. Our friends stayed in another hotel further away, and the Andaz ended up being our HQ for meeting up because of it's key location. I suspect it's probably on the pricier side for Savannah, but worth every penny. I will definitely be going back again!Our arrival was greeted by a staff member with an iPad - the hotel lobby has an open design so while there is a desk, you don't wait behind it.  Rooms are spacious, the bedding comfortable, and in addition to the modern amenities like flat panel TVs, you will find lots of niceties other hotels have been dropping: snacks, drinks, a state-the-art fitness room, a spa quality pool terrace, and they are happy to bring you any toiletries you may have forgotten complimentary.  Particular attention seems to be focused on women and families, as the room had items for applying and removing makeup, child care needs, clothes steamers, and the like.Downsides are parking and the views: The hotel has no parking of its own, a city garage is nearby for $16/day and valet is $23 a day, the entire area is metered.  Street parking is free after 5pm and on weekends, but it's as bad as any college town finding a space.  Most all of the rooms view either a building or the pool terrace. Only the premium suites face the nearby square.  The upper rooms do have patio doors you can open for that nice sea breeze, but cannot be opened easily by kids (it may even take you a few tries.)Lastly, I was not a fan of the hotel's in-room dining menu.  It has few choices at exorbitant prices.  The restaurant menu is the same, but with more options. The hotel bar features live music and is quite popular. Overall, an excellent experience. The addition of a spa (the will arrange in-room spa services), a less avant-garde restaurant menu or a second more casual restaurant, and easier parking access would earn a fifth star.  If you're coming to Savannah on business or pleasure, the Andaz will treat you very well.From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with the most friendly staff - everyone from the valets to the check-in staff to the bartenders was incredibly helpful and accommodating.  Check-in was a snap (using iPads, no less!) and the lobby is all clean lines and glass.  The location was perfect - we could see City Market a block away from our balcony, and River Street was just a two block walk.  The room itself was wonderful with free in-room snacks and non-alcoholic drinks, free wi-fi, a flat screen TV, robes and slippers.  My only complaint as others have noted was that the shower in our room didn't have a door.  That's a little TOO modern for me.  I got awfully chilly without a way to trap in the heat!This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in! (of course other hotels I have stayed in are 4 or less stars). A family member put my husband and I here for a mini weekend getaway. It was such a perfect place I did not want to even leave the hotel room!Customer service is EXCELLENT from beginning to end. You are greeted with a complimentary glass of wine and valet parking is available (for $20!) The rooms are lovely and beautifully decorated. The bed is COMFORTABLE. They use a Serta Do Not Disturb, I believe. The bathroom had a cute old-fashioned tub and a very nice standing shower. Even down to the toiletries and snacks, everything was top-notch, they don't skimp on anything here.The pool area is so neat and has private areas covered with canopies you can close off. I had the best cocktails I ever had in my life at their bar. It's no nice because you can order a drink and bring it to your room. We didn't get a chance to eat here but I heard the food is great as well. I won't be able to afford a deluxe suite here again, but it looks like they offer very good rates on Standard rooms if you book in advance.The wife and I decided to do a whirlwind tour of Savannah for the Columbus Day holiday. We booked the Andaz for one night. Easy valet parking, attentive concierge, and good location. The bed was very comfortable, the room was clean, and everything, minus the booze, in the mini bar was complementary, which was a nice touch.  We didn't use the pool or fire pit, but our room overlooked them and they looked very nice. We would definitely stay here for a longer visit and would recommend to friends.This is a very nice hotel. The overall service is outstanding (doorman, welcome drink, etc.). I would give it five stars except for the paragraph below. This is a great place to be ignored by a bartender when he isn't busy. Too many other bars here with great service. Too bad since the rest of the service from hotel staff is great.Staff is amazingly friendly cordial and accommodating.  The hotel and rooms are fun and comfy.  Nice sized tv, bedding is warming and top knotch.  There was some water ceiling damage in my room but its an old old building so....I put it down to ambiance.  Looking forward to brunch....the front desk gal said the shrimp and grits are incredible.....Amazing! Friendly and accommodation staff. Excellent accommodations. Delicious good! And, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.I just came back from Savannah three days ago and I have to say, I STILL miss being at Avia.  This place is fantastic with accommodating groups (I traveled with a group of 36), and the little things - incredibly courteous and friendly staff, turn-down service, quality pillows - truly make this place a gem!Location:  It's in the middle of everything!  On New Year's Eve, I literally just had to step outside the hotel and I was in the middle of a party.  It's within walking distance to pretty much everything in downtown Savannah so it's very convenient.  On the flip side, it's loud at night since you're so close to concerts and bars, etc.Staff:  Avia's friendly, great staff won me over from the first second.  Staff members smiled and said hello literally anytime they saw me during my stay.  I've never been in a friendlier place!  Also, with our big group, they were more than accommodating with all of our needs. A huge thank you to the staff for making our company vacation a lot less stressful!Room:  Not too small, and the beds are heavenly!  I actually had a difficult time getting up in the morning because....well, I was comfortable.Food:  Breakfast was always delicious and I always had great conversation with the chefs as they made my omelette/grits/crepe!  (and anytime I can get smoked salmon at breakfast, I'm satisfied)  We also had dinner in one of the banquet rooms, and the food was excellent.  The crab cakes are HUGE!  Lastly, there's free water bottles and chocolates every night with turn-down service, AND complimentary cookies from 4-7pm everyday...don't miss out!The food was fantastic! The lobster Mac and cheese is awesome!This was home for a full week, and it was fantastic. I was in Savannah for a convention,and the association was basically pushing everyone to stay at the Westin or Hyatt which are both fine. I wanted to be close enough to the river so that i could jump on the ferry boat to get over to the convention hall easily, but somewhat removed enough from the masses. The location of the Avia was perfect. Room was very nice, turn down service, big bathroom with a doorless walk in shower (hi!), and a comfy bed. This place is new, and presumably, not haunted yet - like the rest of Savannah GA :)Stayed here 7/3-7/6 as part of my honeymoon with the hubby.  It's a great establishment and ran beautifully.  Location:located in great location in savannah.  About a 5 min walk from River Street,  near several squares.  It's within walking distance of several shops.  5 min walk from City Market. Staff:Great from the valet parkers to the cleaning crew.   We were a little confused about the parking but the valet assured us that we could park in a garage nearby the hotel for a daily fee.  (be warned there's no parking to any of the nearby hotels either and valet charges an additional $5 fee than the garage).  We parked ourselves it was less than  5 mins back to the hotel.   The front desk were great.  We were greeted and checked in my Jordan and he was attentive and informative.   Savannah raised he knew everything.  He gave us printouts of things and places to see while there and suggested several good restaurants to eat at.  Check-in was smooth and quick.  Most mornings I worked out and met some cleaning ppl there and they were so nice too.HotelGreat, great, great decor.  Near the front desk was a huge chandelier.  A bar was on the first floor too along with seating area.  They even had a curtained off area for seating.  Very spacious lobby.  Ppl from outside not staying in the hotel could have access to the bar and food they had around lunch and evening.  Elevator: I thought this was really cool.  The only way to use it was to have a room key. This made me feel more comfortable about who roamed the halls and kept a lot of diversion down too b/c only hotel guests had keys. Halls: dimly lit with huge mirrors throughout2nd floor: heating outdoor swimming pool, chaises, lounges, bar, and workout room. ROOM:  amazing.  We had a suite.  As soon as we entered I was in awe.  My babe picked an awesome hotel.  Soft music played from a radio upon entering.  The room was huge.  To the left there was a full kitchen with: regular size refrigerator, dishwasher, dishes and silverware, microwave, coffee maker mini fridge with hotel stocked drinks, on the bar were candy, water, alcohol (they all have weight sensors so that's how they know what to charge to the room).   Next to that was a heart shaped dining table with 2 comfy chairs.  A decorative chair and ottoman.  Hardwood floors and carpet.  A large red, velvet like sofa.  Coffee table with magazines.  ~40 in flat screen tv (blurry images).  King size bed with mounted, cushion headbord.  The bed was super comfortable (not too soft or hard).  The pillows were really soft and lacked definition but i didn't mind.  There were 2 side tables next to the bed with mounted images to the walls.  They had out complimentary bottled water on each side for both of us.  The room had a great view of the street and some of the pool.  We had a small balcony too. Bathroom: I LOVE, LOVE a different bathroom.  It had a huge bathroom.  Walk in shower and the floor of the shower was warm and didn't get cold.  A closet with iron and board, safe, hangers, and extra comforter.  It was spacious and had cubby holes for his and hers.  Service;We opted most days to have room service come late and they did a great job of keeping the room clean.  We got complintary 2 bottles of water daily and a newspaper.  The hotel was always spotless, quiet and relaxing.  We got breakfast one time and it was great: we got the shrimp and grits (best i've ever tasted thus far), sausage and cheese omelet.  Otherwise I can't judge the food they serve.I would definitely recommend this hotel.  It was a relaxing stay.  I felt welcomed at all times of day, greeted with a smile by all staff.  Everyone was very helpful.  Great experience.  If we ever visit savannah again I would want to stay here again.only complaint - poor internet connect.  1 to 2/5 barsbest hotel in savannah! Awesome bartenders, can make any cocktails under the sun and 22square is amazing organic cusine.  rooms are super new and done tastefully. stay here! also, you can get 10% with your AAA card.Ohhh Avia, how I wanted to love you.  Admittedly, the central downtown Savannah location and stylish yet whimsical decor wooed me after a 24 hour delay at DFW.  (A curse upon American Airlines and all their brethren).  I'll give you one star for the incredibly friendly front staff.  Wink to you Jordan.  However, I will NEVER stay here again.  Here's why:1)  Maid service doesn't come by until 3 or 4 pm.  And when they do show up, they don't really clean the bathroom.  On the second day, I couldn't let it slide anymore.  I called the front desk, they sent up a crew while we went out for a walk.  Only to return to find out that it was still dirty.  I made another call and actually watched them to make sure they actually cleaned this time around.  2)  Maybe it was the lack of bathroom cleaning, but I swear a funky odor was coming from the air vents at night. 3) Drum roll please.....my mom and I both walked away with food poisoning that we traced to the sliders we shared in the hotel restaurant on our last night.  We both spent 2+ days miserably ill.  Savannah is a beautiful town, but please don't spoil the fun by staying here.We stayed here recently from a hot-wire reservation, actually once at the beginning of our trip to hilton head island, and once at the end. Both times it was excellent..with great attention to detail. On our first night, we were upgraded, and on our second time there we paid a little bit extra to be upgraded which was well worth it. We saw the regular rooms and they were a bit small, so since we were traveling with a baby having the suite was great. Their service was great and everyone we dealt with was friendly and helpful. the location is also very good as it is a very short walk from the river. The snacks/drinks (i.e sweet tea, cookies, etc) in the room and lobby were also a nice touch!This was by far the best Hotel experience I have ever had. The hotel itself is stunning, the rooms lovely , super comfy beds, a great bar with candied bacon as a treat, warm cookies on the weekends, a nice pool, perfect location to walk everywhere, and small enough to feel homey. But what sets Avia apart is the outstanding service the staff provides- from the moment we pulled up we were treated like family. Even when my boyfriend kept going to bar to steal plastic glasses, straws and sliced fruit for our in room cocktails they were nice( and hes a handful). I would never stay anywhere else in Savannah.This was a beautiful hotel. The service was top notch. My significant made reservations here because he planned to propose to me in Savannah. When he made these arrangement, the staff at the Andaz were extremely helpful and saw to it that our accommodations were extra special. Clinton was so nice and hospitable. They greet all their guests with a glass of wine at check-in. This establishment sets the bar for how all hotels should operate. Our room was beautiful, clean, and just perfect. Would highly recommend staying here to others and will definitely come back to stay here again. Thank you for helping make our weekend so special!This hotel missed it's mark..........lady bartender at the pool was RUDE and never heard back from the GM, which makes me believe that he probably doesn't care about her rudeness.  Hotel was okay, location was GREAT!Small but good room.  Nice (modern) decor.  Great location.  But these people don't know how to run a hotel.  Look, this place bills itself--and charges--as a luxury boutique hotel, and with that come certain expectations about the service.  And yet the service here was extremely curt and unfriendly--the opposite of Southern hospitality--that became downright rude when we needed a replacement key for the one that had stopped working.  Desk lady decided to blame us for ruining the key!  Who cares!  Just replace the key.  Instead we were fussed about it--especially over my drivers' license--to the point that I wondered if the staff were being discriminatory in treating me as a common criminal for the great infraction of my keycard ceasing to work properly.  And we were awoken every day by extremely loud hammering and drilling from the live construction site directly across the narrow street.  It starts at 7am and continues through the day.  There was absolutely no warning about this.And the fire alarm light blinked in the room for the final two days of our stay.  It didn't get fixed and we gave up trying.Being here on our honeymoon, we simply expected better.  I don't plan to return and can't recommend this place for anyone.","['first', 'trip', 'usually', 'use', 'hotel', 'chain', 'staying', 'boutique', 'hotel', 'never', 'fails', 'lovely', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/inn-at-ellis-square-savannah,Inn At Ellis Square,3.0,$$,88,"This place gets a solid 4 stars mainly for its location.  3 stars for the hotel overall.  So 3.5 but I'm rounding up to 4 because I'm feeling generous.Located right off of Ellis Square, this is one of many places to stay if you're visiting for the first time. Mainly because of how centrally located it is to many of Savannah's sights. So no need for a car!  As far as the hotel goes, we had 2 rooms reserved for 6 people.  Our rooms were located on the first floor right off the main lobby. There were a few complaints about some rowdy noise coming from the lobby so keep that in mind if you're ultra sensitive to. If so, maybe request a room on an upper level or further away from lobby.  The small hotel bar seemed to be the place to be for the Senior Citizens. They were constantly packed and lively during our entire stay. The rooms were not huge but had everything we needed for a short stay. I also really liked that they had wooden floors.  There were a few things I noticed. The connection for cable wasn't very clear. There was some static on some of the stations and it never let up. While this didn't ruin our stay, it may for someone who just wants to hang out in their hotel room their entire stay.   Also, the shower temperatures were a major concern. They would go from cold to extremely HOT at a moment's notice-- no in between. To the point of being slightly burned. And it wasn't just our room. The occupants in our other room had the same complaint.  Definitely an issue they need to address. The parking situation was convenient for the most part. They have a garage right next door to their hotel. For the times when it is completely full, there is an overflow lot across the street. So that helps alleviate the stress of trying to find a place to park. Of course there is an additional charge for parking but it's reasonable. Overall, for the money we shelled out this was a decent option to stay in prime Savannah real estate.This hotel has THE perfect location. It is located at the heart of Savannah's Historic District, making it easy to walk to shops, restaurants etc..  It has a nice terrace to be outside with chairs and lounges... We were 5 friends in Savannah for a Wedding, so the hotel manager recommended a suite suitable for 5, supposedly with two bathrooms. When we arrived the suite was super dark, it had a narrow spiral staircase for the second ""room"" which was an open attic, old and dusty and just ONE bathroom for the whole suite that was placed INSIDE the main bedroom. We went to the front desk to complain about the uncomfortable suite, and the women on front desk were not of much help and unkind.They arranged two regular rooms (since we needed the bathrooms) -NO safe in the bedroom- Plain breakfast (cero tasty!) -Small + Old bathroom with no garbage can to put toilet paper ( bathroom clogged each time) - Shower curtain was ripped -The bed linens very rough-The concept of Housekeeping was doing the bed and replacing towels (but not picking the old ones or organizing anything!!!)  so everyday we entered a disorganized room just with the beds doneAt checkout you don't get a receipt so you do not see what you are paying for! They ""email"" the receipt and if they charged something extra you are screwed!!! Very expensive hotel for what they offer, for those prices you can stay in Way Better Hotels!!The place has a pretty good location, but that's really the main selling point. The room was ok, but nothing great. If you've stayed at a Hampton Inn, it's pretty comparable, if not slightly better than this room. Parking was $16/day (I am annoyed that I have to pay to park at a hotel when I've already spent so much on the room, but I guess that's just normal when you stay downtown). When we checked in, they mentioned they had a hot breakfast in the morning, so I was kind of excited about it. However, their breakfast is a typical cheap cereal, some breads, waffle station, and terrible powdered eggs and sausage so greasy, I think I had a mild heart-attack just looking at it.One of the days we came back to the room, the cleaning lady had left our door open after she finished cleaning it. Luckily nothing was taken, but that could've been very bad! The bathroom was also incredibly tiny, and difficult to move around in. All-in-all, it wasn't the worst experience, but I've definitely had better.The stars are for location only. We drove in from Atlanta last night thinking we were getting a suite for the 4 of us, and we have a tiny double. The room is old, there is dirt in the corners of the bathroom, the sink has a clogged drain, the air is loud and right next to the bed. The shower head sprays all over the place but where you need it.  Breakfast which is free and a reason we selected this place for the kids, was less than desirable with waffles and a broken juice machine.We were told to come down in the morning to possibly change rooms but the morning crew was clueless of our issue and not willing to move us nor be apologetic. I get they are tight on rooms, but a family of 4 should be accomodated not blown off like we are lucky to have a room. The conference portal had us prepay so we are stuck and they know it. Hence, We are miserable.I was in Ellis Square at night and I didn't see ghost. YES! Instead I saw ratchets! :-/In the area for St. Patrick's Day weekend with some friends enjoying the festivities. After going up and down some shady stairs we decided to find a nice spot and just people watch. Earlier we watched horse draw coaches parade people about while a concert slowly was setting up. But after dark people covered in green took pics of some drunk dude with a t-shirt saying ""turnup!"" Dude was passed out (might have been taking a nap at about 11pm) on the grass. It made for a great resting area to just chat and crack up about all the entertaining sights that passed as we waited on the rest of our friends.Good location and reasonably clean room although one of the bedsheets was stained a disgusting black color. Housekeeping didn't want to clean our room so they had us sign next to our name on a sheet that it was okay not to (didn't ask whether that was okay or not). The worst surprise came when it was time to pay for parking. Although we'd been told it would be $16 per night, we were charged twice per day we stayed. When we inquired, the woman at the desk with poofy hair and blue eyeshadow was incredibly and unnecessarily rude as she told us it was because we had two people in our party and the parking charge was per guest. I don't know if this ridiculous policy is really true or if she just made it up to not have to deal with the extra charges but the price gouging and the rude way we were treated will ensure we'll choose a different hotel our next stay in Savannah.If anyone ever told me they were going to Savannah, the first thing I'd say is be sure not to stay in the Inn on Ellis Square.  Our room is extremely small, cramped, and stuffy.  Tiny vanity with no counter space. Rickety ironing board and no ironing board stand, so it's just propped against the wall in the coat area.  I found two long black hairs in my bed last night (my hair is brown), and the room is very dusty.I was prepared to give two stars until I saw the continental breakfast.  Basically the same stuff you get at Motel 6.  Make your own waffle station, toast, cheap cereal, etc.  Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this place.The location is great. Surprisingly more quiet in room than I expected. Bed was comfy.  That's the positive. Otherwise, not a place I wish to return to unless an emergency which is how we ended up there in the first place. Our room had a tiny bathroom with a plastic razor cover holding the drain open in tub, no plastic shower curtain but a very old tiny cloth one  virtually guaranteeing a flooded floor, and clumps of hair in corners of toilet area. Some mold in shower. Sink was outside the bathroom. The bathroom area was just atrocious. We have stayed at the Andaz across the street which was amazing and this Inn at Ellis Square was just a yellowing dirty hotel. But if you are looking for a cheaper hotel in a good location or stuck needing last minute accommodations like us, it works.All I use a hotel for is sleeping and showering so my requirements are cleanliness and a good location. The room was small with a very tiny bathroom. Did like that there was a wood floor. Excellent location for a launch pad for exploring historic Savannah. It was one street away from River Street and really close to some great restaurants and had a cvs nearby.Easy check in! Great price!This was an awesome hotel! Loved the hardwood floors so much cleaner than the usual hotel carpet. Our room was nice and quiet on the first floor. Staff were very helpful. The bedding in this hotel was super comfortable and clean! I've never slept better in a hotel room. The sheets were actually soft and didn't smell of bleach. The pillows were great. The bed had a white duvet on it so you could actually see it was clean. I wanted to take that bed home with me!Parking lot was right at hotel. Only problem is they should let you be able to pull into parking lot before you check in. There wasn't room to wait out front while we checked in. We got this through a coupon deal. It would have been worth it even at full price.Hotel was in a perfect location. Booked a king suite and this room is huge. They had a special on their website and got the room for a great price. The parking can fill up fast but we were able to park in it both nights. The complimentary breakfast was great. They had waffles, omelettes, sausage, toast and more. The bed was comfortable and the rooms are not spotless. This is an old building so that comes along with it. It was not dirty by any means though. Savannah has a lively nightlife so you may hear people stumbling in throughout the night. This hotel is situated right in the middle of everything! We had a great time here and will be back.Great stay, huge suite, quiet and walking distance to everywhere in Savannah you wanna be.I see a lot of folks had issues with parking, but we had none.  There is a large parking garage next to the hotel, and we kept our vehicle there the entire weekend.  I see other people had issues with plumbing or the air conditioner, but everything in room 239 was fully functional.  In fact, it looks as if the hotel was recently renovated, so maybe our timing is impeccable.  Not sure, but what I can say is that I couldn't see staying anywhere else while visiting this sleepy old city.So I agonized a bit before canceling our reservation at SpringHill Suites and booking the IES, based on some of the reviews here and on Trip Advisor. But I just got back from a weekend in Savannah and it was a great stay there. We had a suite with 2 double beds and it was obviously one of the renovated ones - flatscreen TV, tall vaulted ceilings, comfortable beds, L-shaped room. Also came with a couch / chair area, refrigerator, and microwave, and I think about 3 sinks total! (there were 2 of us so we each had our own, which was nice) Breakfast was crowded but had a good selection of food. I really liked the coffee and water station in the lobby, helped quench my thirst a few times.My only complaints are small... Our room was at the corner of W. Bay and Jefferson and was a bit noisy. Also when we asked for a late checkout, they said 1130am (normal checkout was 11), most places would give you until 12 or 1.Overall, very happy with the IES and would stay here again! Cute hotel and can't beat the room we got for $167/n. Parking is $13/day but I know some of the other area hotels are $18-20/day.They have king suites or double rooms.  We stayed two nights in one of the king suites....first off the room was spacious.  It consisted of two rooms, one was the bedroom with a tv and the other had a couch and a tv so that was nice.  If you do stay here make sure you ask for a room NOT by the elevator.  These rooms are not sound proof AT ALL!! Any little conversation going on in the hallway you hear it all.  This made for terrible sleeping.  We were facing the river on the top floor however, the view wasn't that great.  The location was really good since it was right in front of city market and right behind river street.  They do charge you $16 a day for parking which is steep and the breakfast in the am is absolute chaos.  Would we stay here again? No.I took advantage of a Groupon to stay at the Inn so I could attend a conference at the nearby DoubleTree. I love the location of the hotel and not only is it very easy to get to, but it is near everything downtown. I thought the staff were very friendly and my room was clean and comfortable. However, I did have some issues:1. Why is parking not covered for hotel guests? I didn't mind parking in the deck right next to the hotel, but don't see why I have to pay $13 a night just for parking.2. The breakfast situation needs to be sorted out. Yes, there were a number of food options, but the weekend I was there was also very busy for the hotel and breakfast was damn near pandemonium. I took one look at the crowds of AARP-aged folks milling around and thought that the breakfast would be fraught with peril. So I grabbed a couple of bananas and a newspaper and headed back to my room.3. How is it possible that a hotel this large has such a terrible gym? First off, it is in the basement, down a flight of stairs - almost tucked away as an after thought. Second, it is a little smaller than one of the actual hotel rooms. And worst of all, it is very poorly equipped. One elliptical machine, one treadmill, some free weights and a sit up bench that is falling apart. What is this - Grambling's weight room?4. Two of the lights in my room didn't work out. Now, I didn't say anything to the front desk, but shouldn't everything work in a room BEFORE I check in?I would consider staying here again, but some of these simple things need to be worked out first.This is not like a normal Days Inn. Its a hotel. I got a deal online and since I didn't pay a lot I was very pleased.  Parking is $13 a night extra. Check in is at 400p...so come 400p there are loads of people trying to park where there is not any parking as you have to get your parking entry card at check in!  Other than that...all was fine.  Breakfast is free, and well tended too, but nothing all that exciting. Id probably walk over to Goose Feathers across the square next time.  The bed was very good quality, the bedding very good quality  but too many pillows.  Internet was fast and good.  HINT..IF YOU EXIT hotel with bags go to the east end of the parking deck and there is an elevator.  The side most go to as its where the cars enter and is closer to front desk doesn't have elevator.The rooms of this hotel, especially the bathrooms, should reflect the elegance and quality of the exterior and the lobby. The bathroom was dated and in need of repair. The hallways were in fair condition. The room was somewhat updated with new flooring and bedding, but it was still not a quality hotel.  I booked the room through Hotwire, so I got this particular hotel by chance at a fairly good price. I certainly wouldn't pay the posted rates.The location was great. We were able to walk to City Market and the Riverfront.The personnel were very friendly and happy to give any advise about restaurants.If you reserve a room in this hotel, I suggest you do it directly by telephone. I reserved two nights by using their website which links you to another website. This website did warn that if I did not make changes to the reservation within 72 hour of arrival I woul forfeit any nights that I cancelled. (Yes, I was warned) Well, I did check out after one night and lost my money for the second night. The reason I mention this is because the clerk at the front desk said that had I made the reservation directly with them (I thought I was!) that I could have received a refund. That being said, I found the room to be more than adequate and in an excellent location, smack in the middle between River Street and the city market and a block from Paula Deen's. I would definately stay here again if I return to Savannah. Room Tip: Our room faced Bay, a VERY busy street. I am not a light sleeper and the air conditioner drowned out the noise for me but if you are a light sleeper I would suggest you ask for a room that doesn't face Bay St.Parking is $11 a day, even though we paid well over $300 for a room on St. Patty's Day (one night)....so yikes for that!Price aside, I actually enjoyed my stay here at the Inn at Ellis Square. I'm not sure if it's really different on other nights, but since we were staying on St. Patrick's Day, we were each required to wear a wrist band that enabled us to go to our bedroom. That was kind of annoying because that wrist band bothered me like the whole time. BUT our hotel room was on the 7th floor (highest floor) and the room was spacious. Set up was kind of weird, because the toilet and shower were separated from the sink (sink was located in the main bedroom). Also, no fridge or microwave...just the standard bed and bath.It is smack in the center of historic Savannah, and walking distance to EVERYWHERE. Location is prime---that's what you're really paying for.Mornings they offer a continental breakfast which I really enjoyed. There weren't any hot items (other than the gravy that went with the biscuits) but I appreciated that they had hardboiled eggs, a variety of yogurts, mini pastries, cereals, and do-it-yourself waffle. They also offered fresh fruit, which is great because I looooove fresh fruit (oranges, apples, grapes).Another good thing about the place was we got to check in at 1pm (check in is usually at 4pm). We also got to do a late check out (check out is at 11am, we checked out at 12:30pm).The staff is nice. That's the only pro here. They are all young and hardworking. The bell guys were very smiley and friendly and the ladies at the front were good at multitasking. The hotel itself...meh. Location was good. The room is meh. Beds uncomfortable. Feels dirty. Bathrooms too small. The shower set of the smoke alarm. That really was troublesome.","I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews but I had a wonderful stay here! The room was really clean and staff was very friendly. I stayed here for 2 nights during the week with my husband, and we were both impressed with the size of our room...very spacious. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others for the price and location.The hotel really was incredibly friendly.  We arrived on an early train and got to the hotel around 7:30 assuming we could just store our bags until check-in... they had a room available so they gave it to us and even invited us to go to breakfast!  So nice!  Unfortunately, the only room they had available stank of smoke (it's a non smoking hotel).  They offered to spray air freshener, but I declined since I assumed that would be a worse smell.  Breakfast was a somewhat sad assortment.  You could make your own waffle or toast, there were packets of instant grits, and some eh looking warm options.  Overall a good value for such an excellent location for exploring.  But a few things were lacking.As Cool and Charming as the Trip Adviser Photo! Convenient to many of the attractions we came to see!  We walked to most everything thing we did!  Very Comfortable!  Staff was Great, Polite and Hospitable!    So if you see my Photos on yelp for the outside of this place, remember I'm making it look as Good as I can!Parking is TIGHT!!!  Small Spaces and narrow driveways... It took 8 people to get one SUV guided out of their space... Here is a SECRET - Park on the Top of the Parking Deck!Low class low quality beautiful setting but not beautiful enough to justify staying there again. The room was run down and broken. There was hair on my towel the chair was thread bare in places and stained.  There was a hole in the wall and rust on the handrails in the bathroom. The pillows were lumpy and the bed spread had something crusty on it.  Noise from the street to the third floor was such that I kept thinking my window was open. Parking is an additional $16.00 a day and breakfast was something we chose to skip.  The front desk was not interested in our stay or our concerns.   The door to the fire escape was jammed ... By the condition of the door casing I would say this has been a problem for a while.  The mirror in the hallway had a similar effect to a funhouse mirror. The toilet had a ring in it and the bathmat was slippery, due to lack of cleaning. Oh yeah and the wallpaper was peeling in nearly every place it had an edge. We would have been better off at Super 8...  DONT STAY HERE it's bad, they know it and they don't care.First and foremost, GREAT LOCATION.  Located right across the street from River St and in Ellis Square which is newly renovated.  The hotel is located in a historic building and very well kept.  The price was a little steep for what you get, but the only hotel on the river front that was under $200 per night on a weekend.Our room was a little small but adequate for 2 people.  The WiFi was spotty, but did eventually work.  The room itself was clean.  The husband said the sheets sorta smelled like dog...but I didn't notice.  Hotel staff was very friendly.  The continental breakfast was decent, a wide variety of pastries and such. Parking is $11 per day in the parking structure.  I didn't mind paying for parking as parking is scarce and they charge everywhere anyways! I definitely wouldn't mind staying here again during my next trip to Savannah.Where to even begin with this place. UGH. Horrible horrible service. This was my 3rd trip to Savannah and my least favorite because of the hotel. The place was incredibly busy and the staff was definitely showing how stressed they were. Once girl even told the phone to shut up when it kept ringing off the hook. I waited forever, and they couldn't find my reservation. I had gone through Priceline earlier that day upon arriving to Savannah. They insisted they had no reservation for me. Thankfully I had the reservation confirmation and showed it to them. STILL they insisted I did not have a reservation. So, I'm getting incredibly irate, because I already paid for this room. After a few minutes of this back and forth she tells me ""I'll go check the fax machine for the confirmation from them, but I was just back there and we didn't have anything."" She goes back there, realizes the fax has no paper in it. Once the paper was in, here's my confirmation from hours ago!! She sort of apologized, got me checked in and nobody told me about the complimentary breakfast, or how to get to my room. Once I got there the room was pretty dirty and just not anything like I expected. It was nothing like any of the places I had stayed before as far as cleanliness or size. I could also hear the people talking below the window, which was no huge ordeal because that just meant we were closer to everything, but just a heads up if you aren't a sound sleeper. On the day of check out, they failed to mention that I couldn't get out of the garage without my door key... so I'm trying to leave this dreaded place and as I get to the gate realize I CAN'T LEAVE!! The gate won't lift without the gate card. I had to pay an additional cost for parking so I was already aggravated by that, and then I go back inside to get the key to get out and she has to call someone to come out because she had already checked me out. In her defense I think she was new, but man I was incredibly frustrated. I finally got out of there and when I got home it weighed on me more and more how poor the service was, and how dingy the place seemed. I called and complained and the manager was never in. I got so mad by this point I called the corporate office and left a complaint on their voicemail and explained that I had yet to hear from the manager. When he finally called me back, he explained that he had been out of the office and I had to go through the reasons why I was dissatisfied. He was extremely friendly and apologetic, and he ended up giving me a free night to come back. He couldn't give me a refund because I had booked through a 3rd party. I agreed to that, and was going to give them a second chance, but ended up moving back up north before I could make it back. I gave them two stars because I did appreciate the effort on his part, and if I return back to Savannah, and have no where else to stay I will review them again based on that visit. Maybe it will get better... maybe not.Ellis  Square is more open than the other squares in Savannah, but that allows it to be a good place to let the kids run around.  In the summer there is a fountain/splash pad usually running.  I don't let my daughter play in it, because there are just way too many people around with cameras and you never know when one of them could be a creeper.  If you aren't overly paranoid about that type of thing, the kids really do enjoy playing in the water. There are a few little tables, great for sitting with a bite to eat and people watching.Where do I begin? First let me say, for those who don't want to read on, THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR FAMILIES!!! If you are into partying...then you've come to the right place! This is not a 3 star hotel!!Me and my husband were traveling with our three small children stopping to spend the night to break up a long trip home from our Florida vacation. I've always wanted to see Savannah and thought it would be fun to stay in historic downtown. I booked through Hotwire and that's how we ended up at this hotel(because it was shown as a 3 star hotel). We arrived at 8:30 PM. First we were unable to park in their garage because the cartop carrier on our SUV made it too high. So we had to park across the street at a questionable parking lot surrounded by clubs, pay again and wait to be reimbursed by the hotel for the parking we already paid for. Then we walked around the immediate area and all we saw were clubs and bars, and lots of people outside yelling, partying and completely drunk. I honestly think we were the only sober people in the area. After eating(at a nasty place...that's another review), we returned to the hotel. As soon as I walked into the lobby I knew we had a problem. There were drunk people hanging around the front desk and on the elevator. When we got to our floor, the smell of pot was so strong I actually started coughing. The carpet in the hall looked like it had never been vacuumed, covered with lint balls. I was scared to get into our room. The door was filthy with stains all over. We got into our room and it was so small and very outdated. It smelled old and bad. The carpet was dirty as well as the bathroom. I didn't even take any more time to inspect beds and such because I was so disgusted and couldn't get out fast enough with my three small kids. We packed up our stuff and left right away. Needless to say, we did not spend our night there. And thankfully after a bit of difficulty were able to get refunded by Hotwire.The location is excellent---a very short walk to the historical river district, shopping, good restaurants, etc., and the proximity to parks and good walking or running sidewalks through charming parks can't be beat. The inn itself has some charm too, but feels somewhat neglected.  Parking in their covered garage was quite easy, and once inside, we had free internet.  My main complaint about the Inn was that the bathroom in my room was dirty; the floors and walls needed a good scrubbing, the shower head needed replacing, and I wondered how well the tub had been cleaned.  The beds were also lacking in that the pillows were hard and lumpy and there were no extra blankets in the room. My travel companion agreed on these issues. The room itself was pleasant enough, and while it was fairly loud, the heating/cooling system worked well. The loudness was actually a plus, in that it did a good ""white noise"" job of muffling outside noises. Staff was quite friendly, but at 7am, the complimentary coffee in the lobby tasted old and wasn't hot enough.  I didn't eat breakfast there, so can't comment on it. I did not stay over St Patrick's Day, but understand that the town and all businesses are pretty crazy during that time---good if you're there to party.     I'd add at least one star to my rating if the issues I mentioned were corrected. All that said, I'd stay there again if I got a good deal on a room rate.From the start we were really disappointed with the service here. There was a mix-up with our reservation and the staff were cold and completely unapologetic about it. While they were attempting to figure it out they helped other people and made my husband re-wait in long lines. We got on the wrong (really nice) elevator until we realized we had to turn a corner to find the right one. As soon as you turn that corner you realize the quality goes down a serious notch. Our room was a little run down. Thankfully I realized that the alarm clock was still turned on otherwise we would have had an unpleasant uber-early wake up call. There was also a folder left for some financing seminar....I wondered if this room was even prepared for us? I worried that some random person would come into our room.They didn't inform us that parking was extra until we checked out. Annoying.We'll never stay here again.Our stay was 3/22-3/24.  The good:  location, easy walking access to everything, room was comfy and modern, staff was friendly and helpful, had 2 rooms, requested side by side, had to wait to check in.  1st they did try to put us in1st floor rooms on the street side, after reading reviews, we opted to wait, but got what we wanted.  Had a couple of maintenance issues, resolved right away.  Breakfast had good variety and ample seating.  Would stay here again.The not so good:  Paying $13 parking feels like a rip off, housekeeping consisted of ""only"" emptying our garbage, we had to ask for more tp, towels, coffee, etc and beds were not even straightened.  Leaky tub faucet, toilet wouldn't flush, toilet was fixed (bar of soap was thrown in), had to shut off water with hard push.  None of these would keep me from staying again.Upon researching hotels for a two-night stay in Savannah, I mistakenly thought that the Inn at Ellis Square would be a good choice. Upon arriving, there seemed to be some confusion regarding parking - as you could only get in the hotel's parking garage with a key, but you had to check in to receive a key card.  My husband decided to circle the block while I checked in.  The hotel looks nice upon entering, but looks are deceiving.  The majority of the rooms are not located in the historical section of the building.  We were placed in Room 101, which I strongly believe to be one of - if not the worst room in the entire hotel.  It is located on the first floor of the building on the corner of Bay and Barnard, which is where crowds of people will wait to cross over to River Street.  There were people shouting, and even fighting right outside of our window all night, not to mention the noise of traffic taking off from the stop light.  It was terrible, and my husband and I got hardly any sleep at all.  In addition, since the room was at the end of the hall on the first floor, we also had to deal with noise from people exiting out the back door, and entering/exiting the elevator directly across from the room.  The room was rather small and dingy - nothing like the pictures shown on the website, and the window air unit didn't work well.  I had hoped that it would reduce some of the street noise, but it did not.Breakfast was highly overrated - the hot breakfast bar consisted of biscuits and some sort of gravy mixture.  I didn't eat it, but stuck to some raisin bran and toast.  We checked out after one night - I couldn't handle another night with no sleep.  The front desk attendant was polite, but didn't offer to switch us to another room or do anything to alleviate the situation, when I explained that being on the first floor on a street corner was too loud.  Luckily, since i had booked directly through the hotel I wasn't charged for the second night.  Save yourself the time, and stay somewhere else.After eating at Vinnie Van Go-Go's, we walked around bit, experiencing some of the sight and sounds of the city. Savannah is known for its many squares and close to the restaurant was my favorite, Ellis Square where the kids enjoyed playing and I enjoyed relaxing after a long day.We picked this hotel because for the price we got a fantastic location downtown and complimentary breakfast for a very affordable price. I see that people are scoffing at the parking garage. The parking is $11 a day, but think about it, depending on the size of your family if you stay in one of the other hotels you'd spend at least that if not more on breakfast each day, so it evens out. It's not unusual to have to pay for parking when staying in a city.We didn't stay in the new section, but the room seemed renovated. New fixtures, flat screen TVs, new/clean looking linens (not the scary floral prints or itchy blankets). My only complaint was the shower. It could have just been that the shower head in our unit needed some adjustment, but it was a small, weak stream of water. I'd definitely recommend it if you are on a budget.My wife and I decided to go to Savannah at the last minute on Memorial Day Weekend. Not only did the Inn have a room available but also has the most reasonable rate amongst hotels in the historic district. The accommodations were clean and modern with a healthy respect for the history of the building as well. The breakfast offerings were ok but certainly an added bonus as, again, the highlight here is the location just off of Ellis square. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to friends and family alike.I loved my stay here. Great price, awesome living conditions and great ammenities. Close to riverstreet, Market &amp; Franklin square, walking distance to so much. Will strongly consider staying here again in the future.If it were not for the fact that my company books and pays for the hotel, I would never set foot in this place.  But unfortunately, this is where we stay.  And although I do my best to actively avoid assignments that bring me to Savannah, sometimes it's just not possible.I wish I could think of something nicer to say about this hotel than calling it a dump, but really, it's just what it is.  The outside and lobby are misleading.  You walk in, and it feels nice.  Not fancy, not upscale, just comfortable and nice.  That is of course, until you arrive in your room.  Your room which will have moisture running down the windows and walls, and smells like mildew.  I get it.  Savannah is a humid place.  But other hotels in equally humid spots are never like this.  Nothing works.  I tried running the fan all day to bring in fresh air, I tried running the a/c, and I've even tried running the heat.  Nothing works. It's just moist and wet and gross.  No kidding, it's 5:20pm.  I rinsed off a pair of tights and hung them to dry last night around midnight.  They are still damp.  I hope they are dry by tomorrow morning when I need to wear them again.  Ignoring all of that, the rooms are small and outdated.  This place recently got a facelift outside -- now what about the inside?  I think at some point this place was part of the Days Inn chain (it sure feels like it), and I don't mean this as a positive thing.  Although the evening/late staff are nice, I've not had the most pleasant experiences with the folks that work mornings and afternoons.  They aren't terribly friendly or terribly helpful.  The breakfast in the morning has gone from meh to abysmal, and not worth making the trip downstairs for.  The only thing this place has going for it is the location.  If touristy Southern towns are your thing, then this location is spot on.  But I guarantee there are better hotels in the same area.Def will not go back. Gross hotel. Maid service did not come everyday like their suppose to. Had to get new keys for the room 6 times because they were not staying programmed. Window air unit sucked. Stayed hot in the room. Bathroom size of a linen closet. Sink in hallway right by the door. Called for extra pillows and they never came. We eventually changed to a suite which was a little nicer but not nice enough. Pool was green. No hot tub. Just a old gross hotel. Needs a serious renovation if their thinking they can charge the same as the nicer hotels that are jut next door. Don't even waste your time with this place.This is a great place to people watch! We had pizza at Vinny's Van Go Go's, and then took our drinks on a nice walk around the shops. We were able to see lots of cool shops, and sit on a bench and people watch. Nothing better than good food and cool sightsThe hotel itself is nothing really special, but it was clean, and the rooms were perfectly decent, even if they are starting to look a little dated.  Wifi worked well.  The location is great, within walking distance of many popular restaurants and shopping areas, and I had a nice view of Hutchinson Island from my room.  Staff was very nice.Parking is awful.  The parking deck has a horrible design that requires you to make a three point turn if you get to the end of one level and don't find a parking spot.  Most narrow parking spaces I have ever seen, and not enough of them to accommodate the hotel guests on a heavily booked weekend.  Normally I wouldn't pay as much as I did for a hotel of this level, but on a popular weekend in Savannah, I felt like I got a decent deal compared to what other hotels were going for.","My favorite square in Savannah.  Right near the market, the Andaz, Goose Feathers...and the tourist center. Cute fountains the kids can run thru.The location of this hotel is perfect. The City Market is directly behind you and River St is directly across. Now, aside from the location this place is just your typical hotel.  The staff was very pleasant, but the cleanliness of the room was not up to par.Upon entering our room there was blood between the bathroom door and the wall. I looked into the bathroom and there were 4 spots of blood on the wall. And then there was a stream of blood dried up down the front of the toilet running all the way to the ground. So disgusting!The beds were comfy, and the room was updated enough to keep me happy.  Don't even try watching TV though....the picture is so grainy it's hard to watch.I love taking my son to Ellis square. It's a great place for the kids to run around and blow off some steam. There is a splash area and also a life sized chess set. At night the fountain lights up with multicolored lights in the water. It turns off at 9pm.The Good: Exterior upkeep. Friendly staff. Close to dining and entertainment. Nice common areas.  The Bad: Uncomfortable beds. Dirty bathroom. Loud A/C. No noise proofing in walls or ceiling or floor. Incredibly loud noise from the street...I felt like I was trying to sleep on a bus bench. You can clearly hear conversations of passers by on the sidewalk from the third floorThis is a nice park to stop that, if it's a hot day and you happen to bring along some swim trunks for you little ones. My son decided to enjoy the water even though he didn't have any swim trunks on. You just have to deal with the wet shorts and wet T-shirt for little while, luckily the sun dried them up quickly when it's a hot day.I'm deducting 1 star because of the annoying check-in process. We showed up on a Monday at about 5 PM to check in. It was raining pretty heavily by then and I was looking forward to taking a shower and putting on some dry clothes.There was a long line and we waited about 30 minutes. We checked in, got the parking key, and were then told that they didn't have any rooms available. Um, excuse me?? He said that it had been a hectic day and none of the rooms were ready yet. I asked him when our already paid for room would be available and he said that he didn't know, that they had people who had been waiting there since noon. So I was really annoyed and soaking wet. We parked the car and braved the rain to go get some dinner. We returned at 7 PM and asked if our room was ready yet. By this time I was really soaked from the rain. It was someone else this time who told us that she would make sure to find a room. After a few minutes she gave us our key. Check-in was a very poor experience but luckily the rest of our stay was fine. The room is nothing better than a motel room, but there were no bugs which is all that I care about. If you stay at this hotel you're not staying for nice rooms or great service, you're staying for the location. The hotel is in the middle of everything. No matter which way you walk out of the hotel you will only be a block or two from shopping, sightseeing, and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again because I got a great deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a> and love the location of the hotel. Just know what you're paying for (location, not amenities, service, or an upgraded room). I do have to say that the beds here were very comfortable and our room on the 3rd floor was nice and quiet during our stay.Great location, excellent price, state of the art TV and a good breakfast offering. The downside was a small bathroom, few outlets for recharging, no refrigerator, old. I would recommend for someone looking for a bargain.While it's price was very reasonable for the area, there are some improvements that should be made to the guest experience, even for a mid level hotel. The reservation I made online had automatically selected my wife and I for two double beds, without notifying us, and they were unable to get us a different room on check in. The room had comfortable beds and bedding, as well as a great TV and basic cable plus HBO. The hotel cleaning staff was very friendly and helpful, they made some great recommendations for restaurants in the area. My complaints lie with the bathroom. Our toilet filled continuously and had to be manually opened and reset after each flush, and the shower fluctuated wildly in temperature from boiling hot to freezing cold, without any input. Parking was not a major issue, we just left our car in the garage for the duration of our stay, Savannah is very walkable. All in all, it could have been a lot worse, but I would not stay here again.After I booked the room via Hotwire, i called the hotel directly to inquire about an early check-in. I was told that anytime after 12, there should be a room ready for me to check in to. The quote was ""I don't see any reason we couldn't get you in"" However, when I arrived at 1 pm, I was told I could not check in until between 2 - 3pm. When i arrived at 3:05 pm, I was told to wait until 4.   Not off to good start here. After speaking with the General Manager Anthony, I was able to check-in and he upgraded me to a suite.BTW, there is a $10.00 fee for parking. Nice.This was good, however, the suite I was in did not have working internet service. The wireless routers worked but none of the 4 I could connect to had an internet connection. This remained the case during my stay. Staff could not tell me what steps were being taken to repair the problem or if it was even being addressed at all. For this the hotel did say it was crediting my parking fee. This was also proper, but in 2011 internet service is a utility and expected the same as electricity and hot water are a given. Particularly since this is an up-market property.My room was also in need of repair. Towel rods falling out of the wall. Toilet paper holders, likewise. Furniture dinged and dented. The office chair shock did not extend, broken switches on the lamps, etc. Seems to me this hotel does not have an effective upkeep program.Breakfast was mediocre. The room too small to accommodate the number of guests, the food was average and overall the service was understaffed. There were two large groups there during my stay. These groups are booked well in advance, so there is no excuse for under-staffing.All in all, I would recommend booking a different property. There are several upscale, name brand hotels in the immediate vicinity. I would go with one of those instead.Since I booked this hotel via Hotwire, it was a crapshoot that I ended up here. But, it was listed as 3 out of 4 stars there and with an 80% recommended rating, I went with it. Usually, that high of a recommendation works out well. Unfortunately, this time it was a disappointment. At open-market prices I would have been rather cross with my experience there.The first floor was clean and attractively decorated. We stayed on the second floor, and while the hallways showed some wear, out room was fine -- just what you'd expect from any Days Inn / Holiday Inn / etc. type place. The location was SUPER convenient, situated right on the corner City Market and just a block away from River St. and Broughton St.I found the service to be very good, although perhaps not outgoing. They didn't make a special effort to greet us or whatever, but when we ended up bringing leftovers, they let us store them in their refrigerator and then also heat them up the next day in their microwave.The only two minor issues I had were that (1) our bed sagged in the middle, which wasn't a problem but was a little weird, and (2) we had to deal with quite a bit of noise on Sat (but not Fri, strangely enough) both from outside and from the hallway.Still, overall I thought it was a good hotel and I'd stay there again without hesitation (assuming it was the best price).I booked this room for the Rock 'n Roll Savannah marathon and could not have been more pleased with the location, which was literally two blocks away from the starting line. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by very friendly desk staff, who provided excellent customer service and were very efficient in checking the swarms of guests (who were also there for the marathon) into their rooms.My dissatisfaction occurred the second day of our trip, when discovering our shower did not have hot water. I phoned the front desk, informing them of the matter and they sent their ""engineering"" staff up to our room, while we stepped out for a bit. When I returned, I asked the front desk if the matter had been addressed, to which they replied yes. Once back in the room, I again attempted to take a shower, only to find that the water was still cold. I called the front desk for the second time to make a complaint and they sent engineering up (again), although this time I was present in the room. A few moments later, one of the men stepped out from the bathroom and said that there was indeed hot water and that I just needed to let the water run so the pipes could warm up. I turned the shower on myself, the water was still cold, and I further explained that the issue was not about letting the water run long enough before warming up, as two other people in my party had taken cold showers that day because the hot water never came through. The ""engineering"" staff then said, ""I don't know what to tell you, the water is 140 degrees."" I detested this claim, by putting my hand under the water and exclaimed that if the water was 140 degrees, my hand would have severe scalding injuries. I asked to see the temperature reading and he began back peddling and stuttering as he changed his story to say that what he meant to say was that the boiler temperature reading was 140 degrees. Also during this time, the man became agitated and aggressive both in his tone of voice and his body language and stance. I felt he was trying to bully me into backing down. I pointed out to him that he had just been caught in his own lie and told him to fix the issue immediately or else relocate us to another room. Once they both left, I called the front desk and explained what had just happened. I asked to speak to a manager and they forwarded me onto his voicemail. Again I called the front desk and told them to either relocate me to another room or else give me a refund. They ended up relocating me, but also noteworthy was that they had me go to the front desk to pick up my keys and never sent the bell staff up to help with the transfer of suitcases and personal belongings. There were five different opportunities to provide honest, quality customer service--my initial request to address the problem, my second request to address the same problem that hadn't been addressed the first time, my third request to speak to the manager, and the inconvenience of transferring rooms and not offering to deliver my new keys or provide bell staff services--but failed to do so at every opportunity they had to make it right. This exemplified a customer service nightmare.Decent hotel, rooms slightly run down in some areas (bathrooms), very loud traffic noise from cars and trucks on Bay Street, but great location for Riverstreet, City Market, squares.Let me just Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the (one) positive: it's a great location.Located next to City Market, Ellis Square is one of Savannah's many spacious parks. This one, however, is mainly concrete rather than green space. The center boasts a spray fountain with water jetting up from the ground. At night, the water is illuminated in rainbow colors. Be sure to look for the man reading the newspaper near the market; makes for a great photo op!Viewing Time: 10 minutesAsk for a room in the new section, or prepare for a Lilliputian adventure.  Too cheap for that?  No problem, so am I.  Here's the deal:  if you paid more than about $100 for a weekend night for this joint, I sincerely hope you're splitting the bill with a few of your dearest friends.  Location is ALL you're paying for in this hotel.  It's noisy, the rooms are crowded, the air conditioners frequently don't perform up to par, and the bathrooms are crazy small.  Often, hotel staff is generally apathetic towards your concerns and complaints.  If you're smart enough to request, rich enough to pay, or savvy enough to negotiate your way into the ""New Section"" (suites) of the hotel, then the noise, crowding, and climate issues disappear.Just about the only reason I stay at this Days Inn as much as I do is because hotel prices are cheaper than a D.U.I.  If you take it for what it's worth, ie, a place to sleep after you're done drinking your way up and down River Street, then you're in the Days for the right reason.  If you're here for a real vacation....stay at the Marriott Riverfront; sometimes, the prices are nearly the same.You will want to compare prices on this hotel DIRECT with their web site before you purchase anything, sometimes you can get AMAZING deals that way.Well charming and historic with badly done updates. Rooms were not very clean an the service was not the best. A location for walking everywhere in the historic district. They have a little 10 top bar that has the funniest and most interesting bartender ever. Her name is Jenn. Overall if you want a great location and your looking for the seconds of a holiday inn express added to an old hotel it's not bad.Ehh, the only good thing about this place was that the location is adjacent to River Street. This meant that it was absolutely appropriate for me to go out to a bar and stumble back at an odd hour without losing my way. But three stars? Yeah... Price was $370 for 2 nights on the weekend before St. Patrick's day, which was a little steep, considering:Parking: $10 to park in the hotel lot?? Not free? If you don't mind walking, there is a large parking garage about 5 blocks away that is free starting from about 10pm. Also, your one room will grant you only 1 parking pass.Breakfast: I love a free breakfast, but they probably have the worst continental breakfast in the history of continental breakfasts. The menu is identical everyday, and you get your pick between: biscuits, gravy, cereal, boiled eggs (if you can find them!), waffle, cheap donuts, and cheap bagels. A tad bit boring.Rooms: Very small... the beds pretty much take up the entire space, and you aren't left with a whole lot of empty carpet space, which made the room feel pretty cramped. Also, the hairdryer was not working, and the bathroom in general felt very cheap and old. The bed/pillows were fine, but wasn't anything special. They have a really classy looking lobby, but the fun ends there. Probably wouldn't come and stay here again, not unless it was much cheaper.Pretty costly option for Valentine's weekend as the rates doubled. Location is perfect of course. The room was clean and comfortable. We did not have issues with service as mentioned in other posts by guests.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We got our military discount and were very pleased with the very friendly staff. Our room was clean and very nice. We were on the 7th floor and were eye level to the cargo ships  passing on the river. I recommend this hotel also for the perfect location to the attractions.In one word:  Dismal.The lobby is the nicest thing about this hotel.  The rooms themselves though...peeling paint, musty odors, malfunctioning air conditioners, worn out rugs, old and uncomfortable mattresses, uncomfortable sheets, unsupportive pillows, dingy bathrooms.This place has two things going in its favor:  convenient location and being (relatively) cheap.  If you're looking to stay in Savannah on a budget, this place works.  But don't expect anything nice.  Heck, don't even expect anything adequate.  It's quite literally shelter for an evening...period.","We booked this because it was cheap and ideally located in the historic district. When we first arrived, the whole hotel smelled like mold, our refrigerator leaked everywhere, and the hotel was very, very loud - you can hear everything! The continental breakfast was impressive because they had four types of juice, cereal, waffle maker, pastries, and a hot selection like biscuits and gravy or eggs and sausage that changed every morning. We loved the view and parking is very convenient.  The worst part was they mistakenly charged over $175 to our debit card, and they couldn't take it off.I came to Savannah for the weekend and booked this hotel from a website which advertised it as 4 stars. Upon arriving, I was very impressed with the location, which is right in the heart of Savannah. Location is about the only thing that this hotel has going for it.When we arrived, we were given a swipe key to get into a parking garage and park. After several (and by several I mean about 7) attempts at swiping the key, we were still unable to get in. Meanwhile, a line of cars had formed behind us, blocking us in. We managed to back up so that another car could try (thinking perhaps it was just our key), and, sure enough, they couldn't get in either. Finally, after what seemed like an hour, an attendant came and let the line of cars in. This should have been our first indication that we should look somewhere else.We went to the front desk, and were greeted by a less than friendly attendant, who gave us the key to our room. We walked through the lobby (which, because of renovations, had duct tape piecing together the floors-- not a good look, and, again, another indicator that we should look elsewhere), and took the elevator up to our room. Upon opening the door, we were shocked to discover that someone was clearly already occupying the room- as evidenced by a hairbrush on the counter, clothing on the floor, and unmade beds. We immediately closed the door, thankful that we had not walked in on anyone!When we went down to complain, there was a couple informing the front desk that their room was not clean. At this point, again, we should have known to look elsewhere, but on a Friday night in Savannah, our choices were slim. We explained to the front desk what we observed in our room, and, very unapologetically, they said ""Oh. We will give you a new room"" (Really?? I should hope so!). They did, and it was pretty clean, with the exception of the electrical outlets which were hanging out of the wall and the shower which leaked all over the floor.Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to The Inn at Ellis Square. In fact, we spent the majority of our time at the hotel across the street, AVIA, which has a great restaurant and bar area where we could watch (in envy) the guests who had been wise enough to choose that hotel and not ours. (Unfortunately, they were booked, otherwise we would have immediately checked in there instead).Absolutely loved this place, would recommend for staying, and will stay again with the kids. Close to the Market, and had a trolley stop right outside. Didn't utilize the pool, but it looked real inviting with all the other people using it.Not sure about the others, but our customer service experience was good. Never rude, short, or unwilling to assist.Parking is tight, but able to fit the truck for it to stay the entire stay.Great location for my first visit to Savannah.  Small room (for four people), but very European feeling - which I liked.  We spent very little time in our rooms, only one night.I'd stay there again, but next time I go back, I'd like to stay in a more quiet part of the city, hopefully in a bigger room.bar was only open till ten, but then, there are 20 bars a few blocks away.The hotel is older and has had slight renovations, but it still shows as old.  It's not worn out, but just a bit dated.  That said, the customer service was 5 star.  They  were friendly &amp; attentive and did everything they could to help any need we had.  The place was packed for the weekend as well.  We booked a King Suite and it was great for us, the travelers with 2 kids, so the large room with a separate room was key.  We did pay $140/night for that right, but it was in line with other hotels that weren't offering suites.  We did have to pay $9/day for their parking garage, but that was the norm everywhere, and their garage was on premise, so it was convenient.  At the West end of Bay street, so it is a bit of a walk to the center of Bay &amp; River Streets, but it's a great location.  For those that have been to Savannah &amp; stayed in the historic sector, it's all just a short walk away.  Plenty of good bars &amp; restaurants right next to the hotel, so the location was really good to us.WORST hotel experience I have every had. I travel alot for work and came to Savannah for a wedding and relaxing weekend. The hotel looks pleasant from the outside, but the rooms are small and bland. For the price, you can do so much better.My family booked rooms at this hotel over a year ago, and arrived to a group of employees that didn't know what they were doing. After one night here, the told us we were in the wrong room and needed to change rooms. My brother in law went to check in, were given keys to find out it was someone elses room. When changing rooms, none of our keys worked. Another family member had mold in their room and had to move. After moving to a new room, they had issues as well and decided to move to a different hotel. All in all, a BAD experience and not a nice  hotel. Much better and nicer hotels to choose from.The front desk was friendly and helpful with our questions. They always said hello and smiled and seemed genuine.The guest room was absolutely beautiful and was better than expected. I slept very well in this room. It was beautifully designed, comfortable, nice flat screen TV. I wish I could have stayed longer in Savannah just to relax there. Even the fragrance of the room was a nice citrus, fruit scent which was pleasent. The bathroom is small but I expected it since this IS a historic building so you can't expect a spraling suburbian holiday inn. The hallways are dim and for good reason since the rugs are DIRRRRRRRTY.DON'T get a drink at the bar on the first floor. The bartender filled my glass with a LOT of ice and literally  a 1 second of pouring of alcohol which cost me $7. Overall, my stay was enjoyable and I would stay here again - but get my drink on river street!It wasn't bad. The only bad was 1) the hallway smelled like garbage daily, 2) the keycards kept not working, meaning my roomie and I had to go to the front desk and change them every day and 3) the fitness center blows. But the rooms are quite comfy with pillow being very, very plentiful. If you like the big, lush bathrooms, though, this place is not for you. At the end of the day, it's a place to sleep, and it does that well enough for being so el cheapo. But the Mansion of Forsyth it's not.This feels like the lively center of a very charming city. The fountains alone are good for a few memories (and a big dry cleaning bill...) but the square carries an energy characteristic of Savannah. It is busy all day and late into the night, with music flowing in from bands on the corners. Mix in some steamy humidity and I feel like I am in a Mark Twain novel.We stayed one night.  Room was a little small, but it was clean.  The price was right. We just walked right on in on a Saturday night and got a room for $89.They lady that checked us in was really busy, but she still found the time to be nice.   Easy to walk from here to Savannah Smiles.  The location was really good.  Continental breakfast was included in the price of the room. Parking is $10 a day, but that was fine and dandy with us.I was looking for a cheapish room with a great location, and that's mostly what I got with the Inn at Ellis Square.The good: I got a decent deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> (decent for Savannah on the weekend, that is). The room was clean, and the location is fantastic. Free parking with a good number of available spaces is a plus.The bad: The room is small, with a tiny bathroom and a very small external vanity.  I had a double room, but I have no idea how you'd fit four people in there.  The closet, of all things, was actually a decent size. The A/C smelled musty.My room was on the fifth floor, so I didn't hear people coming in from the bars. We were near the ice machine, though, and I didn't hear a thing. Overall, it's a ""meh"" room and hotel, but the other benefits outweighed that by far. I'd stay here again.The Inn at Ellis has gone through a major facelift since I stayed there 8 years back.  It was just cheap enough that we decided to book a night here rather than stay at the River Street Inn, which is our customary source of Historic District Lodging.The room:  charming decor, relatively clean, and with an unacceptably loud air conditioner.  However, it smelled like mildew.  Very, very much like mildew.The view:  whoa, there was one.  It wasn't fancy or anything:  just a slice of the park and an angled view of the river, but was more than I was expecting for the price.The continental breakfast:  dismal and depressing.  So processed that it hurt.  I wasn't expecting much, but there wasn't anything that I'd eat.The noise level:  not bad, but it would have been better if they hadn't shoehorned in a vending machine right beside our door.  I had visions of listening to bottles thunk all night.Final verdict:  not the most horrible time or value, but I'll go back to booking at the River Street Inn next time.The location is superb! Right in the heart of everything. We stayed in a suite and the rooms were nice and roomy. We passes by the breakfast and it looked tasty and there were a variety of items, but even in December, it was crowded. The staff were friendly. They offer parking for $11 per day. The location is prime to park your car and walk around the city.My husband were on a road trip through the south and we got the recommendation to stay here from a co-worker.  I wish I would have read a few reviews before just booking it.  We checked in on the 4th of July, we stayed 2 nights up on the 7th floor overlooking the river.  The location is prime.  That's basically it.  It isn't an awful place, but it's no, omg this place rocks.  The bed was rock solid and the room smelled like Clorox was manufactured right there in the room.  It was very very strong.  The outlets would shock you if you tried to touch them and would short anything you would plug in.  The rooms are very dated and the bathroom was meant to occupy a very small person.  I am an average sided girl and it was pretty darn cramped in there.  The bed ended up being nice enough to get a good nights sleep.   The TV offers like 10 channels.   The front desk really could care less about anything let alone doing their job.  They have an ""oh well"" or ""can you please go away you are bothering me attitude.""    The lady that puts together options for tours to to tell you what to check out was really nice and informative.   Breakfast is included and is continental....go eat elsewhere.  The selection is slim and stale.  If you want mini bagels and mini cinnamon rolls then by all means, enjoy.The parking was $10 a day, which is just absurd for a hotel, but we saw that trend at other locations bc it is in the city and space is limited.  The spaces are pretty cramped and filled most of the time and people park on the ramps.  The hotel is prime location for being in the historic square, near city markets, restaurants, the river walk, and a stop on one of the tours.  Decent hotel, but not worth the price.Beautiful place and convenient to the downtown area.  Stay in a suite and sleep through the free breakfast.  The yelp reviews of the Inn at Ellis Square made me nervous, but it was late at night when we rolled into Savannah and we made the reservation through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and got a $30 discount on a suite.  I think that might be what made our experience there better than the other good citizens who have reviewed it here.  The front desk staff seemed uninterested and annoyed, but there was a sweet lady wearing a ""greeter"" tag that followed us in and saved the day.  She was kind and informative and helped me procure a bucket of ice (there was no machine on our floor).  She went above and beyond the call of duty.  The room itself was great.  It had really high ceilings, a beautiful king sized bed, refrigerator, sink, flat screen TV, hair dryer, etc.  All of the amenities were impressive and delightful.  We had a view of the river and the bridge.  The complimentary breakfast was sufficient at best.  How much can you really complain about a free breakfast?  It was a plethora of store bought baked goods: Sweet 16 powdered doughnuts, Little Debbie cinnamon pinwheels, etc.  The fruit was obviously canned fruit cocktail, but they did have good orange juice on tap.  I ended up having Raisin Bran and being just fine with that.  My only regret is not having more time there.Will never stay here again. This is a ""Days Inn"" that charged $170 per night. Broken closet door, all safes in hotel didn't work, booked king, with written confirmation, they didn't care, said had only had double. They called a taxi to take me one mile for a dinner reservation. Taxi cost $49, think the hotel is getting a kickback. i have left message for manager twice and still no call back. went to customer service at Days Inn webpage and the complaint response does not work either. BEWARE, DO NOT STAY HERE, YOU WILL NOT BE TREATED WELL.I had an excellent experience at this hotel. I got my room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> ($79. a night)  and I feel that I got a great value considering the location and the quality of the room.  I found the hotel to be situated in a great location, close to all the historical spots and restaurants. It was nicely furnished, clean and modern. My one and only complaint was that the picture on the flat screen TV was not very good. However, I was not in Savannah to watch much TV. The bed furnishings were very nice, the pillows were incredibly comfortable.  There was everything I would expect in a decent hotel including a hair dryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. There was wifi, too.  There was even a free breakfast. It wasn't  fabulous, but it was fine, for free. There were boxes of cereal, biscuits, scrambled eggs, fruit, juice, donuts and muffins and waffles. I would stay in this hotel again in heartbeat.The area is excellent, the hotel simple, front desk is nice enough. But we had our toilet clogged before we even used it and it flooded the room leaving it with a disgusting pee/mold smell. Ugh, gross. If I go back to Savannah I  wouldn't stay at Ellis.(The following is what i submitted to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> when they asked me to review my trip....) Weary from hours of traffic and wanting to pamper ourselves with a nice, historic hotel in downtown Savannah, my boyfriend and I splurged on the Inn at Ellis Square.  Neither of us has much money, so the $125 plus taxes was not exactly a pittance for us.  We didn't expect luxury, mind you, but we did expect good service.  We got to the hotel only minutes after booking online.  The staff hadn't received our <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> booking number yet and didn't seem to know what to do without it.  After the initial confusion cleared up, we were told of a $9 parking fee we had known nothing about--this was not good news for us.  Alas.  We forged on!  The room was just the right size for us, but they spared nothing in the way of extra amenities.  One bar of soap to take from the sink area into the shower?  Seems they could have two--one for the sink, one for the shower.  No biggie, though.The fancy TV on the wall was exciting for a gal that doesn't have cable.  We turned it having gone out to a nice dinner and, to our disappointment, half the channels had an extremely fuzzy picture and two channels had absolutely no sound.  When I mentioned this to the concierge, she merely said, ""Do you know what channels weren't working?""  ""No, I don't remember, but my boyfriend might.""  ""That's okay--we just got these new TVs and they've been having trouble.""  No apology for the fact that only a handful of the channels worked after the hotel boasted of fancy new TVs with HBO and other premium services.  Frustrating.The morning we left, we looked forward to our complimentary breakfast.  The spread was pretty extensive--juices, cereals, biscuits, danish, etc.  I poured myself a much-desired cup of coffee and then added the necessary half-n-half.  How disgusting to see that the half-n-half was curdled and yellowed!  I lost my coffee appetite then and there.  Upon checkout, I mentioned the curdled dairy product to the woman on duty and she once again was not apologetic.  (I wasn't looking for an apology, mind you--I just didn't want to make a fuss about it in front of other guests and also wanted the staff to get rid of the rest of the supply!)  It just struck me as odd that she wouldn't say sorry to a guest after that experience.  Hmm...Overall, the facility was pretty, it was nice to have downtown parking, and the hotel's within walking distance of some very picturesque Savannah sites.  I wish we'd had more time there.  I would not pay that much again for this hotel, though.  I think that for all its prettiness and location, they should up the ante by getting better supplies (nicer, softer towels and more soap, anyone?) and perhaps upping the customer service a bit.Our air conditioner was broken for the entire trip (ac is pretty necessary in savannah to combat stickiness and hotness), and the bartender in the tiny hotel bar abandoned his bartending duties to come over and hit on me while I was waiting for my friend in the lounge.  Oh, and on the last day of the trip we asked the concierge to hold our luggage between checkout and when we needed to leave for the airport.  He directed us to a huge room with open doors and told us that the doors would be locked when the checkout rush was over.  Guess what doors were unlocked when we came back to get the luggage in the afternoon?Plus sides I suppose are Cheapness, Cleanness, and Location (although Ellis Square itself is under construction right now and is just a big, noisy hole in the ground.)","Another awesome Savannah square!! I love this city.It looked great on the AMEX website but that was misleading.  This is basically a very big economy hotel with a nice hotels lobby.  The first room smelled like mold and the a/c sounded like a freight train.  They moved us to a room which didn't smell as bad and the a/c worked properly.If you just need a place to stay that's walking distance to everything this is the place. However, if you want to be treated like a guest and have a clean room this is not the place. We have a 10 month old son and I was uncomfortable with him crawling around on the floor in our room. Especially after I saw the tops of his feet were black. Also the front desk had no idea what they were doing. And they were very rude.I booked this hotel based on price, location, and reviews from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>.  I wasn't expecting anything luxurious, so my 3 star rating is pretty much exactly what I expected.  The hotel is really convenient to River Street, and a trolley stop nearby to take you into Historic District.  When we arrived at 3pm, they tried to check us into one of our two booked rooms.  This proved difficult because we had booked online (who doesn't book online these days?!), and they were waiting ""for someone to fax over the paperwork.""  What that means, I don't know, but it meant that we had to wait a while for our room.  They don't guarantee rooms until 4pm, which is fine, but they couldn't even offer us a place to store luggage in the meantime.  So we stood in the lobby waiting.  Finally get checked into 1 room, and we head upstairs.  The rooms are spacious -- we had a room with 2 doubles.  Flat screen TV's, and a nice view outside were definitely the perks.  Bathroom is small and rooms are slightly outdated.  Beds are pretty comfortable though.  They advertise wireless internet, which is sketchy, at best.  It didn't work, so we had to call the front desk.  They sent someone upstairs who could only get the landline working.  Luckily we had a cord with us, in addition to the wireless card.  After a few hours, that stopped working.  And the internet in the 2nd room never did work.  Overall, the hotel is fine.  Nothing to write home about, but clean and friendly and a free breakfast.  It's very child friendly (lots of girl scouts and sports teams were staying there) and the front desk staff is very accommodating.  For the budget traveler, this will do just fine.My first time staying here this past St Patrick's Day week. It certainly fit our needs as a large group with a bagpipe band marching in the parade &amp; other events.You can tell the building is pretty old but everything was clean and the lobby, elevators etc were up to date. The convenience of the hotel cannot be beat for the price. A block from City Market &amp; 2 blocks from River St. ( across the street from 5 Guys Burgers!!)The rooms are not spacious, so if you get claustrophobic, consider getting a suite.Although a pool was listed as one of the amenities, it was closed for the season - despite the fact that it was late March in Savannah, GA and averaged in the mid-to-high 70s every day.  That was VERY disappointing, we had been looking forward to having a pool to swim in on our spring break.  Rooms were comfortable but much smaller than expected.  Television was flat screen with one or two movie channels but had pretty poor reception - most channels were at least watchable, but some were too fuzzy and some had no sound!  Rainfall shower head was nice, as was water pressure.  Front desk staff was pretty surly and were unable to provide common necessities like ibuprofen (not even individual packets for sale) or lighters/matches (in a city that JUST went all indoor non-smoking this year!) and not at all apologetic about it.  Star rating should definitely be taken down by one - which is not necessarily bad, but it is marketed as a pretty classy hotel, and it is really a pretty average one.If you ever visit Savannah, GA you must stay at this hotel! My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Savannah over the summer and we were blown away by their customer service. From the moment we walked in the door we felt very welcomed. Everyone was very friendly and personable. Our room was very lovely as well and had a nice view of the river. We went out to explore the city and ate dinner at an Italian restaurant down the street from out hotel (Another thing we liked was that we could walk anywhere and leave our car parked in their parking garage). We had left overs, but realized that we didn't have a refrigerator in our room. We asked them what we should do when we got back and they offered to let us keep it in their break room refrigerator. Also, the next day when we wanted to eat our left overs, they even let us use the microwave in the breakfast room to heat it up and gave us some plastic utensils to eat with. Janine (I think that was her name) helped us with all of this and she was very friendly and helpful. They really went above and beyond to make our experience great. Also, another plus was that the price couldn't be beat. We're college students so we couldn't spend too much, and this place was so affordable we were able to stay two nights. The breakfast they offer is great. Lots of options. The next time we come back to Savannah we will definitely be staying here again!","['place', 'gets', 'solid', 'stars', 'mainly', 'location', 'stars', 'hotel', 'overall', 'rounding', 'feeling',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/mansion-on-forsyth-park-autograph-collection-savannah,"Mansion on Forsyth Park, Autograph Collection",4.0,$$$,141,"I'm a girl who likes a good hotel.  No a great hotel.  And the Mansion on Forsyth Park delivered on everything I want from a opulent room and bathroom, to a great location, to staff who act like they like what they do.This Autograph Collection by Marriott is also a part of the Kesseler Group of hotels which always means excellence with some great little extras.  Those extras here are the amazing art collection that is in the building and the wonderful architecture of the restored home.Everywhere you look there is art . . .even in the elevator and it is stunning.  Most is too modern for my taste but the sheer scale of it all will certainly impress.My room was quite spacious with a large bathroom and separate shower and toilet area.  Know before you go that there is a partial wall closed off by a shutter between the bathroom and the bedroom (seems to be the thing these days although it makes privacy a bit harder).  My favorite thing in the room was the ""candelabra desk lamp"".  Yep.  That's right.  There is an elaborate candelabra for you to do your work by.  Let's not kid ourselves, the entire decor of this place is over the top but somehow it all works.  And the bed is so sumptuous that once you crawl into it, the crazy headboard will only be a distant dream!The central park of the lobby looks out onto the pool area. Wish there had been a bar open out there as we would have certainly sat there rather than at the lobby bar.  Location is perfect, close to everything you might want to do in Savannah.  Next time you are looking for that perfect place to stay in Savannah, all the southern hospitality you could want is right here.Lovely ambiance and great service inside the restaurant. They have elegant chandeliers, fireplace and animal trophies filling the rooms. I would say their food was okay -- nothing to write home about. We had seared tuna and the rigatoni and a salad to share; the portions were generous. The only thing I would complain about is their lift for the disabled; both when we were entering and leaving the restaurant it was a hassle to try to get the elevator to work and when it didn't, we had to help one of us up the small staircase to the dining room itself.4 stars for a lovely hotel that fell slightly below expectations for service. We arrived around 3 for check-in. The check-in time is four and they weren't ready for us yet. This was fine and we stowed our luggage with the front desk and decided to check out the downtown. They told us they would call us when our room was ready. After spending a few hours downtown, we decided to return to the hotel to get changed before dinner. We got to the front desk around 6 and asked to check-in. The front desk guy looked apprehensive and fussed with the computer and went into the back for a minute. He then told us that the room still wasn't ready and that they would call us when it was done. He didn't offer a time frame or anything else. He avoided eye contact and clearly wanted us to leave. When we made it clear we weren't happy with this answer a manager came over and offered us cocktails while we waited. This was better than nothing, but it still took another half hour after this for our room to be available. Other than this, our stay was fine. However, it really soured the experience.I stayed in The Mansion recently for an event and so my room was at an event rate of $189/night; normally my room would have been $459/night from what I understand. In my opinion, both rates are a lot of money and way too much for what I experienced.Day 1: decided to take a bath in the jet tub. The drain was broken and wouldn't drain after the bath. Also took a shower and the water sprayed out of the shower all over the marble floor (so slippery!). The bed was also pretty uncomfortable.Day 2: I was awoken by loud banging. They were doing construction on the room next to mine the entire time I was there. It would start at 7am and wouldn't end until after 6pm. Not only did the staff doing the construction let doors slam and use power tools but the would stand and talk loudly right outside my door.Day 3: ordered some room service because I was a little under the weather. Hair in my soup.Day 4: stopped by the hotel bar to grab a coca cola. The bartender told me she wasn't open for another 14 minutes and I'd have to wait. I asked if there was a soda machine anywhere and she said, ""I am the soda machine"". OK.I could go on with the bad. The only good I have is to say that both shuttle drivers I had were awesome, very friendly and knowledgeable. In general the staff was cold and pretentious, the space was cramped and musty, the ambiance was murdery. If I were paying $89 a night for this nonsense, I'd shrug. As an Autograph collection hotel at many hundreds of dollars a night, I really expected better.The Mansion has an incredible reputation but it clearly has stopped doing whatever it took to gain that reputation. This hotel has a long way to go to live up to the hype. I'm unsure if my experience was related to being a part of the event or if it's always like this but I'd say don't stay here and if you're hosting an event this is not the place to wow your guests.My fiancee and I recently stayed there on our recent trip to Savannah. The Mansion is everything that you come to expect with a Kessler Collection Hotel. Beautiful, distinctive, artful and an all around great boutique hotel. The only major drawbacks were as follows. Compared to the other Kessler locations we have seen this one could use some new carpet in the rooms as they are looking a little worn. The staff did not get our amenity to us until 2 hours after it was supposed to be delivered. As for the shuttle be sure to call ahead and schedule it as they will not take you even if you were waiting in the lobby for it. As a side note if you are a Marriott Rewards member  you will get points for your stay and as a Platinum member this is a great bonus.Fabulous location, gorgeous hotel!!  Our company booked all of our rooms here for a quick retreat that we were having in Savannah.  From the moment you walk in you are taken back with all the old world Southern decor and charm.  It is so pretty and the pool was very nice in the courtyard.  Check in went smoothly as all of their staff are very friendly.When I took the elevator up to the third floor to find my room I got lost and could not find it. Ha ha my room turned out to be hidden at the end of the floor in a cove area. Luckily, after walking up and down the hallway I found it.  Bam I open the door and fell in love.  A bath tub beautifully placed in the middle of the room with curtains surrounding it.  I was lucky as some of my team mates had a wall around their tub but not me.  My room was large, open, and just so peaceful.  I had a separate shower, a huge king size bed that was the most comfortable bed with the beautiful soft sheets and spread.There is a safe in the room, hair dryer, yay, iron, small refrigerator that did not seem to work very good.  A large TV and a bose stereo that was playing when I arrived with soft tunes.  They leave all kinds of toiletries, soap, wash, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and they smelled delightful.You can't beat the location directly across from the ever so beautiful Forsythe Park.  Each morning I woke up early walked around the park quite a few times waiting on the cafe to open for my morning coffee.  Since I am an early riser it was dark in the park and you have your shady characters hanging around but they just say hello and leave you alone so I felt safe. Ten, fifteen minutes to walk to River street and other areas.A couple of times we took Uber and taxi to get to dinner and the valet and concierge at the hotel are excellent.  They treat you like royalty, opening up the car doors for you, wishing you a great day etc.... Free wifi which worked fine for me in the room.  They have a bar in the hotel that is small but it did the job when I needed some vino.  The bartenders were all super friendly as well.This is the hotel to stay in and I was quite disappointed when my husband moved us for the rest of the weekend to another hotel.  I felt as if I was getting punished.  I look forward to visiting Savannah again and this will be the only hotel I will stay at.Absolutely stunning and as my friends pointed out pet friendly as well.Thank you for a wonderful stay.......................................xoxoxoxoxoxoxoI love staying here.  It is a wonderful hotel, gorgeous inside. Staff is always friendly.  Beds are comfortable.  They have a free shuttle to take you to the riverfront, but walking isn't so bad.Way overpriced for what you actually get!! We visited Savannah specifically to stay at this hotel since we noticed how beautiful it was during our last trip, since we both love the Kessler concept. Initially I thought the few poor reviews were exaggerated as I found the bohemian decor beautiful, the proximity to the park peaceful and the price just right for what you get... But NEVER AGAIN!.  Before the negatives, I must compliment the front desk staff as they did surprise us by leaving a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine in our room for our anniversary, Thank you :-) But the 5 or even 4 star experience went downhill from there. 1) plates left unattended outside three rooms on our way to the elevator, 2) the CD player didn't work (I normally love to hear the Kessler tunes whenever I visit a Kessler property but I couldn't this time around). 3) the portable phone next to our bed did not work so we had to make calls from the bathroom. 4) the ""soft water"" in the shower may be appreciated by some but hated by others like me (specially when the water pressure is terrible). If things couldn't get any worse... We mistakenly left our ""Kessler umbrella"" at a local restaurant two nights before and we were willing to pay $20 or $30 dollars for it.... But we're shocked when the bill charged us $50+tax for a cheap made-in-china umbrella!! We stayed at the Kessler property in Orlando many times before and loved the experience but this will be my last time that I stay at a Kessler property!! Take my $50 dollars and hire better management for this property which is way overpriced and the level of experience merits no more than two stars. If looking for a magical place to stay on Savannah listen to your significant other and stay at a 5-Star Bed &amp; Breakfast instead of this overpriced, overdecorated, far away from everywhere hotel... interesting how all the negatives come together once you don't get the WOW experience!Excellent! Great atmosphere. The best grits in the south! Good selection. Nice service and so relaxing. Good view of Forsyth park.From arrival, everyone was attentive and wonderful - exactly what I've come to expect from hotels in the Marriott family! It was also my first stay at an ""autograph collection"" hotel, and I have to say I don't think I could have picked a better place unless we'd gone with its sister property, the Bohemian.As you pull in, you are warmly greeted by a valet who provides you with a ticket as they park your car. Now, it sounds silly, but I wish there were more downtown hotels with self park lots, because sometimes you want to just get yourself all set while being able to take your time. But it's downtown, so I get that.The lobby features a view of their relaxation pool, and leads to the Grand Bohemian Gallery on the left and the first floor rooms on your right. Check-in was a breeze, though I wish I'd managed to get my first check-in on my phone, dangit! The front desk was INCREDIBLY pleasant through our entire stay and that can sometimes make all the difference when you've had a hot or hard day.After check-in, we made our way to the elevators, and were first exposed to the artwork on all the guest hallway walls... which was nice, though not stuff I'd put on my walls. And probably stuff I couldn't afford. It DID, however, lend itself well to the overall ambiance of the hotel, and it really felt like a cute little boutique place instead of a chain.Our room had a SPECTACULAR view... air compressors.Which didn't take away from the overall appearance of the room, which had two simply but also opulently decorated beds, the cool feel of the bathroom... and a half floor leading to the bathtub from one of the beds. By far that was the strangest feature of the room, but it was clean, had no lingering smells, and everything worked.We took advantage of room service and ordered a dessert and tea. The dessert was the truffles and a berry something. Now, we asked what the ""florentine"" part of the dessert was when it came up because we weren't quite sure, and the delivery person said it was the cream on it. I don't know if that's true, but it was really good!I would definitely stay here again!The Mansion on Forsyth Park is a very romantic place in historic Savannah. Very interesting place.Beautiful hotel and the rooms are so nice. Wish the bathroom stall glass door closed a bit better as well as the shower door but all in all it was nice. The bathroom was nice and big. Loved the fact that they had a shuttle with the riverfront hotel but not so thrilled when we arrived to go back and the shuttle was not there as promised. So they told us we could go to the roof top for a drink while we wait(when i had wondered why they did not just call and have it sent over). When we came back down the later shuttle was packed and we could not all fit. Poor planning folks for a holiday night.  The though was great but that shuttle should go back and forth regardless if there is one or ten people.This is a beautiful hotel. Stayed over New Years with my wife for a wedding. Food was average, the stars here are the staff members. From the front desk and bellmen to the banquet staff who worked the wedding. Everyone was polite courteous and efficient. Tiffany at the bar exceeded our expectations though. She made one (maybe 2 or 3) of the best mules I've ever had. She was a pleasure to talk to and was a wealth of local information.We have stayed here several times and for upscale travel, this is the place. We also deliver bikes to this hotel for their guests and they couldn't be nicer. Offering to keep our bikes stored safety. Everyone from the valet, conceirge, the front desk, to cleaning goes out of there way to make your stay awesome. We love this hotel and this is from people who live here... Savannah On Wheels thanks you for being top notch.This hotel was excellent! We arrived here after a 8.5 hour drive, with a feverish baby and a cranky four year old. The staff was warm and welcoming, check-in was smooth and easy and the bellman immediately took our bags up to the room. We had requested a crib and it was delivered to the room less than five minutes after our arrival. Due to the late hour and the rainy weather, we opted to order in-room dining and were blown away. The food was phenomenal and was brought up to our room in less than 20 minutes. I will definitely be staying here again.We stayed here two nights in March. Quick and easy ride from the airport. It's right on the square of Forsyth Park, a perfect location. Very pretty hotel, outside and inside. I enjoyed looking at the antique lady's hat collection. The artwork all over the hotel was eclectic and interesting. The pool area and little courtyard was cozy. Typical of a boutique city hotel. You don't come to Savannah to hang by the pool all day, so I found it adequate. We found the staff to be very friendly from check in to check out. Our room was on the third floor and gorgeous. Comfy bed and oversized chair and ottoman. The decorating style fit the location. My bathroom was large and very clean.  We took advantage of the hotel van service to their sister hotel on the waterfront coming back from dinner. It's an easy walk down to the waterfront and lots of shops and things to look at on the way.  This hotel has a luxurious B&amp;B feel, without the annoying hosts! They have a concierge lounge that had a very nice happy hour and breakfast. When we travel this is the type of hotel we look for.Flawless food execution. Big portions, good service. We stayed at the hotel(which is also awesome) and decided to have our ""fancy"" dinner here and left with no regrets. It's really not that expensive for the portions and quality you receive.This hotel is absolutely stunning! Its the perfect mixture of the old school southern glam mixed with modern amenities. I didn't know what to expect about this hotel and I didn't do much research before I got here. When i arrived, i was blown away by how beautiful this hotel looked. The room and bathroom was spacious. The decor was lovely. I loved all the chandelier details everywhere. They have art sculptors and paintings hung all over the hotel. AND its right across the street from Forsyth Park. This is definitely the hotel to stay at when in Savannah!WARNING! $150 NON REFUNDABLE PET FEE!     While this hotel is very well appointed, and a good bet for couples, I don't recommend it for guests with pets or children. While the bathrooms are beautiful, they're all glass and separated only by a curtain from the bedroom rendering the bathroom useless while a child is using the shower or toilet.      My real concern, though, is the ""sneaky"" way that this hotel adds a $150 pet FEE (not deposit- A $150 non-refundable pet fee) to your bill. Needless to say, I was surprised and dismayed when the clerk told us about the pet fee, and I asked why I didn't see or hear about this before I arrived, valeted my car and had our bags delivered to our room. She replied that it's ""on the website"". Neither my daughter, myself or the clerk was able to find it, but someone finally showed us where it was hidden-literally hidden-behind several clicks on several drop down menus. To me, this is trickery. The four seasons charges $100, and tells you about it in advance. And this place is no Four Seasons.The hotel was pretty however too far from where we wanted to be. But the hop on hop off bus stop was right by the hotel. Unfortunately there was a wedding here and you could here the music up in the room till it ended. Shout out to Greg for being a very kind and helpful person.","If you plan on staying here, first ask if they are having a wedding at the same time as your stay. Then, ask how MANY weddings they are having at the same time. We made the mistake of staying here this weekend (June 11) and had 3 weddings to content with over the course of two nights! Which meant: no pool access, no lobby bar access, no early check-in (despite Amex Platinum confirmation), loud drunk folks everywhere, and an all-around disappointing experience. Here are some additional thoughts:- The decor attempts to channel a boudoir, with lots of red velvet curtains, loud ""modern"" paintings covering ever each of wall space and faux lead christal chandeliers. - You might also enjoy the mausoleum elevator, complete with white marble walls, brushed stainless coffin-handle railing and black velvet curtains framing the ceiling. Or you might find it overdone, tacky and creepy in a bad way. - I found the glass door to the toilet an incredibly poor choice if two people are sharing the room (unless being viewed while using the facilities is something you enjoy). The all-marble echo chamber adds to the experience. - Customer service was hit or miss. The valet who was on duty when we arrived didn't greet us, offer to take our bags or understand my basic question of how valet worked (i.e. In and out all day?). Later valet staff were great and very friendly. When we checked in, the room wasn't ready (despite our confirmation) so we were told they would call us. We killed 3 hours wandering, with no call, only to come back to find that according to the new check in person, our room had been ready since we'd arrived. I think the Mansion is attempting to be a hip, nouveau boutique hotel like the Faena in BA or Ian Schraeger hotels in Miami. The difference, however, is that those hotels have trained staff, well-thought out amenities and successfully create an experience for their guests that the Mansion hasn't figured out how to accomplish (this was our third and last stay). Given its location, it might be one of the best options (debatable) but comparing it to hotels that it seeks to emulate, it falls dramatically short.Beautiful... Beautiful statues and fountain outside and beautiful, free gallery inside. Friendly and helpful employees. And it's right across from the park. Love how they light it up at night. Glad I stopped by.Restaurant located as part of hotel. Across from large park at Old Town Trolly Tour stop. If you come by tourist Trolly very convent . Good food very good service good price,Very nice hotel, and good location across from the stunning park. The concierge was great, helping us get tickets for the trolley, and giving us cold waters for the trip. My only complaint was the spa. My friend tried calling for an hour to book a pedicure, and nobody was answering the phone! Not impressed, especially for a nice hotel. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel. Just know, it is about a mile walk into the downtown.Beautiful hotel. The restrooms are an adventure with individual cubicles and really cool decor. Poseidon Spa is on the lower level. Art Gallery with very unique art and jewelry is on the street level. Art is displayed throughout the hotel. Very nice banquet rooms. The outdoor area is elegantly decorated and a perfect setting for intimate reception. There's a lounge area and monthly you can attend Martnins at the Mansion which raises funds for varying local charities. Across from Forsyth Park. The trolley &amp; bus tours stop here for tourists to enjoy. A must see for visitors and locals.This place is beyond nice.  We had high expectations and it exceeded them.  It is a drive to the river area, but so worth it.  The rooms were well appointed and the staff was great!  The art collection is just awesome too.  Make sure to walk the entire hotel to take in all the fantastic paintings.  The restaurant next door, 700 Drayton, was perfect.  The food was great!  We will definitely be back next time we are in Savannah.Stayed here for 4 nights in March.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful, our  room was large and clean, staff was warm and helpful.  The food &amp; service at restaurant 700 Drayton was very good, had a couple drinks upstairs at Casimir's lounge which has a really cool vibe/style but it was surprisingly not busy on a friday night (i'm guessing because the hotel is so far from everything else in town).Only cons:  our bed was way too soft/saggy.  We kept falling towards each other all night.  Ended up having to put a pillow between us to keep us from both ending up in the very center of the bed.  Made us miss and appreciate our tempurpedic at home! Also got a whiff of sewer smell every time we opened the door to our room to go into the hallway.  Our room smelled fine but it was kind of gross to smell sewer every time we left the place!I definitely plan to come back to Savannah and would absolutely be willing to stay here again.  It's right on Forsyth park and about a mile to walk to river street but it's a beautiful walk if you get on Bull or Whitaker Sts to head into town.  We really enjoyed being able to see so much of the Historic District every time we walked into town (at least twice a day!).  The hotel does have a shuttle that goes to their sister hotel (The Bohemian) so if you don't want to walk, you don't have to.  Staff was really friendly and helpful - we would definitely stay here again.Photographs do not do this hotel justice, it is so gorgeous. Every person we came in contact with was friendly and hospitable. The valet and bellmen are some of the sweetest people I've ever come in contact with. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are like sleeping on a cloud. It's a great location as well, across the street from Forsyth park and a 10 minute walk from river street. Definitely recommend this hotel for light sleepers that want to be close by to attractions.Spectacular service, tasty lunch starters and entrees, and right off the park make for a delightful spot to break up the day. Stopped here along the Old Savannah Tours stop #4.I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. We decided to have a ""staycation"" to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. I found a great deal at this hotel for one weeknight. We came just after check-in time and the room was ready. We stayed in a standard room and it was very nice. I LOVED the shower! It was huge with an overhead faucet. Everything was very clean and the bed and lounge were comfortable. We mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary while checking in and when we came back after our dinner out we found chocolate-covered strawberries and a personalized card from the staff member who checked us in. This was so sweet and thoughtful and we really appreciated the gesture.The outdoor courtyard area has very nice furniture and a heated pool. We didn't have a chance to try it out, but it's open till 10pm and although it's very small, the hotel didn't seem crowded while we were there so it would have been okay. The decor of the hotel makes it feel unique and a little more interesting than some of the more standard hotel chains. We ordered room service breakfast and although it was expensive as we expected, it was a fun treat while on ""vacation."" They give you a menu that you can fill out the night before and hang on your door so they will bring your breakfast at the time you specify. Everything was very high class at the hotel and the service was impeccable. We would love to stay again if we can in the future!I had decided to come spend a relaxing weekend for my birthday with a girlfriend at this hotel.  I have stayed at other  Kessler properties and I always enjoy the friendly staff and great service so I was looking forward to this stay.   We arrived early and were told our room was being cleaned.  We checked our bags with hotel and we were told that we could be phoned as soon as our room was ready.  We were phoned within the hour.  We checked into our very clean, beautiful room.  We decided to step out of our room to go to the lobby for a few minutes and not expecting anyone back in our room since it had been cleaned and inspected we left our bag unopened in the room.  Upon our return we noticed our bags had been opened and left unzipped and that we both had some cash missing.  We estimated there was around $320 missing between us.  We immediately went to the front desk and explained someone had been in our room.  The staff immediately phoned security and management and they quickly came to investigate our electronic lock to the room explaining they could read the codes and know what key cards had been used to enter our room.  They acknowledged that afternoon that there had been someone in our room and that they would investigate further and call us the next morning.  We were a bit nervous sleeping in a room knowing that someone had been in not knowing who? We also were on the 1st floor that lead to a hallway straight out to the street making for easy entry from the street.  We decided to sleep with a chair against the door. The following morning we left to go have breakfast and try to enjoy our second day.  When we did not hear anything from the hotel we called and they forwarded us to the Manager on duty.  He explained they had tried to speak to us by coming to our room(were we suppose to sit and wait for them and ruin our second day?) we asked about the investigation and he offered to send someone to our room to maybe look for our misplaced money? We explained to him that we both had not misplaced cash and that security did find someone had been in the room.  The manager asked how much money we were missing and did agree to credit it our account for $320.All in all the hotel is very nice, the staff very nice but we were treated like we were at fault.  They asked about the safe, which we did use but to have money taken within 30 minutes of a check in ??? Be very careful with your belongings here at all times.  Whoever stole the money knew not to take anything that would incriminate them and not to take all of the money hoping you will not miss it or not realize it is missing until later in your stay.  I won't return here. It was a stressful 2 days and disappointing.  I travel a lot for pleasure and this hotel will not be back on my list.  I did have a fantastic massage in the spa and would highly  recommend the spa services. Lesson learned, don't leave anything unattended for any reason, even to step out for something quick.We stayed here during the Martin Luther King weekend, and our stay was not up to the standards that we have seen with other Autograph Collection hotels in other cities. My wife found the hotel through numerous review sites which stated that it was the best hotel in the city.  We, along with our 5 yr old son, where excited to stay here because we had stayed at other Autograph Collection hotels before and knew the brand to be very nice. So, I will say that our expectations were higher coming in. The hotel talks a very good talk. We called in advance to see about the opportunity for an early check-in. We were honestly told that the hotel was busy, but that there were a couple rooms that were ready. So when we got to the hotel, we had no expectation of checking in early, but were surprised to hear that they had to upgrade us to a deluxe room that included breakfast and that the room was on the ""early clean"" list, so it would be ready in about 30 min or so and we would get a phone call when the room was ready. We went to explore, and it is a good thing our son loved the train museum, because we didn't get a call and only returned after the 4 o'clock check in time to make sure the room was ready. The room looked like all the other rooms we have stayed in before, which is a nice room, but not sure what made it a deluxe room. Maybe it was the minibar. The shower had a good amount of mildew in it.We had no intention of eating breakfast at the hotel, but since it was supposedly added as part of our ""upgrade,"" we decided to take them up on it.  The restaurant had no idea about any complimentary breakfast, so they called the front desk to make sure. Turns out there was a $30 credit for breakfast, which was nice, but good thing we asked, because we all know that food in a hotel restaurant is extraordinarily marked up. So we were able to have breakfast at a normal price with that credit. There is a complimentary shuttle that runs from this hotel to the Bohemian, which is the sister hotel. It runs on a half hour schedule on Fridays and Saturdays, but is by request the rest of the days. We were told this by the shuttle driver. We used it on Sunday and it took about 10 minutes to get to the other hotel. We got back to the Bohemian at 6pm and asked for the shuttle and was told that the shuttle would be here at 6:30, as the front desk person was calling for it. I initially found this to be at little off, because I knew it should only take 10 minutes to make the trip, and he quoted the 30 min schedule, though it should be by request only on Sundays.  But, we waited until about 6:45, when I went back to ask. Things started looking bad at that point. Valet managers got involved, multiple attempts to contact the valet at the Mansion were done, and my son fell asleep on the couch in the lobby of the Bohemian. I personally called the hotel and was promptly told that we must have missed the 6:30 shuttle, because it was there. After some investigation, it was obvious the shuttle never left the Mansion and the valet never was told we were waiting. We finished our 0.9 mile trip 1 hour later and carried our exhausted little boy to bed.It is a nice hotel that talks a good game. The follow-through can use some work. My advise, ask a lot of questions, do not assume that things are going to happen as promised, and be sure to double check on things yourself.The place is lovely and the service was excellent, however, the food was disappointing. The food combinations were clever and innovative but lacking in taste. The ahi tuna was over done and the seafood casserole in a tomato base was extremely plain. Definitely had better seafood in Charleston and New York.Nightmare on Mansion at Forsyth ParkMy husband and I came to Savannah on our 1 year wedding anniversary and we stayed at this hotel. The room was not ready, even after arriving 3 hours after check-in time. Went to the bar to get a drink while we waited and after 15 minutes sitting at the bar, the bartenders didn't even care to acknowledge our presence. When we went to room the bathroom was DISGUSTING. The sink was covered in a black filth and there were no towels. They market the 'concierge level' as the best thing since sliced bread but its just a tiny, dirty room were you get ritz crackers and one drink, and the breakfast was just an embarrassment. They did offered to pay for dinner but the food at their restaurant was subpar to say the least. Overall, this place is not worth the $350 they charge per night. Do yourself a favor and Stay somewhere else.I disliked everything about my stay.  I feel nobody working here has previous hospitality experience.  The room was way overpriced for what you get.  Dishes were always scattered in front of our room (not our dishes, by the way).  The room was not cleaned well.  When we would request housekeeping (which in itself is odd that we needed to call and request this service each day), we were asked, ""what part of housekeeping did you want?""  We would have to keep notes on the entryway table requesting that regular coffee pods be left in our room and without fail, we continued receiving decaffeinated coffee pods.  Whenever we would request a cab in advance, it never arrived (and there would always be a 5 -10 minute debriefing session with staff as to who we asked to coordinate this service and what time the request was made).  Ultimately, we would always end up coordinating our own cab service.  The service in the lounge was extremely slow.  We waited nearly an hour for one piece of salmon.  The one time we did order room service, a part of our order was missing and we had to call and request the rest of our order.  Finally, please take it easy with the decor.  We get it...the entire establishment is essentially an art gallery, but it truly isn't necessary to cover every inch of every wall along with every nook and cranny.  Perhaps a reminder of the old adage -  less really is more.  All in all, it was just an awkward and unpleasant stay.This place is too cool and with great service and amenities to boot.  I've been here twice and the fact that it's also a Marriott Boutique Property makes it even better because we get points!  The rooms are very cool, very interesting vibe.  The location right on Forsyth Park was very convenient.  The hotel has a shuttle service and that was very convenient to not have to drive/walk everywhere.  They pick you up right at the Bohemian, their sister property.Oh and they are PET FRIENDLY!  You do have to pay a one time fee for your pooch, but it is worth it.  The 700 Drayton restaurant is delicious, a bit pricey but worth a try.  There is also a little art gallery and shop with local wares that is worth exploring.On my birthday, New Year's Day, this year, they left me with a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries without me even knowing or asking them.  I came back from a day of exploring and BAM it was in my room with  a very sweet note.I will definitely be here again.This hotel is fantastic! It has so much character. I personally loved the big bath tubs &amp; chair in the room. Perfect for curling up with a big book. The staff was nice &amp; pleasant any time I asked a question. I can't wait to go stay here again!My husband and I spent our anniversary at the hotel and had a great experience. Check in was quick and the staff was very helpful and eager to please. We stayed in a concierge level room and the complementary breakfast on the concierge level was a nice bonus. My only complaint was our shower didn't really get very hot and the water pressure was very low, it took about 20 minutes to fill up the tub.Absolutely beautiful hotel! The customer service was wonderful and everyone who worked there was really helpful and nice!Perfect location. I would go back here just to get a margarita from the bar ""to go"" and walk through the park again. The staff, especially the valet service, are so nice and helpful.","The rooms were beautiful and I loved the art!  The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because we had ordered a crib for my nephew when ordering our rooms.  When we arrived (around 8:30pm) they said they were out of cribs, that a lot of people had checked in with kids.  We told them it was unacceptable, since we ordered the crib and what could they do to help.  The woman at the desk said there was nothing they could do.  Go to Target and get one?  I was not expecting such service for this caliber of hotel.  We made a bed out of a portable mattress and pillows.  We were comped drinks and appetizers.  I thought they would have gone out of their way to get a crib.4 1/2 stars. Mansion on Forsyth Park is an Autograph Collection partner with Marriott so I was able to utilize my rewards points for two rooms. For 30,000 points each room per night. The Valet parking is $20.00 per night with in and out privileges. Mansion on Forsyth Park is unique and the artwork is everywhere you turn. Even in the elevator you'll find fresh flowers and art work on the ceiling. The hallways are lined with art and sculptures in the hallways. The room had an oversized bed and was comfy. Marble is on the floors of the bathroom and bath counter with OG edgework. The mirrors are curved with bevels and the Chandeliers are elegant. The room was spacious and had a large tub but no bubble bath suds which should be in the room even for a added fee. I really liked the shower glass and commode door which was obscure yet private.Our stay included access to the lounge on the 4th floor for complimentary cocktails and appetizers until 8:00 pm and offered continental breakfast the next morning.There were a couple of issues on service like the arrival time of my welcome gift. I had to make several calls to receive it and the tub had a problem with releasing the stopper to drain the water. The last issue was booking a tour with the Old Savannah Trolley, which was a disaster. The manager at the front desk fixed the issue crediting the charge and giving complimentary tickets to another trolley company which I commend. Besides those issues, service was  spot on and all the employees were friendly and accommodating.My guest who occupied the other room were pleased with the hotel accommodations. We enjoyed the outdoor patio after dinner and enjoyed cigars and sipped on cocktails into late night which was pleasant.I would definitely stay here again when I return to Savannah.Imagine our surprise when my mom and I opened the door to our room and found a large bathroom with no walls!   A sheer curtain (think ER room curtain divider look) partitioned off the bathroom from the room.  Affirming another reviewer's comments that the only "" privacy ""were clear doors on the toilet area and shower.   We called front desk and asked for another room- we were told our room was in a ""romance"" wing.   Has anyone ever considered that a good romance always needs a little mystery?We were then given a room where the bathroom had walls, EXCEPT, the wall facing the bedroom had been cut out with a hole approx 6x8 foot and replaced by shutters that would not stay closed and had no way to make them stay closed.  The counters in the bathroom were very high and had a fabric skirt around them that did not seem to be very sanitary.   I also didn't feel the shower was super clean.  I don't know how anyone ever rationalized that these minimalist to non existent bathroom walls was an appealing idea- but they are not for me.Came for the wedding.....very cozy, but  too far from downtown.  They gave us a first-floor room next to the driveway...so noisy!  We asked the front desk for another. The receptionist  took us to different room--much better, but way overpriced! Our very nice bellman took my husband's suit to be dry cleaned for the wedding.  ""Back by 5 o'clock tomorrow,"" he promised.  The next day a phone call from the concierge informed us that in all of Savannah there wasn't a single dry cleaner who could deliver a dry cleaned suit on weekends.  Hard to believe in a city the size of Savannah and even harder that no one knew this ahead of time.  At least, an iron and board were features of our $400+ room in which I hadn't imagined myself ironing my husband's suit.  So much for a housework-free weekend!  Nice hotel...overpriced...short on standard amenities...too many others in Savannah to return to the Mansion.Awesome experience!!! Friendly staff, great room, loved the bathtub!, on time shuttle, best omelette in my life! Wow! Definitely 5 stars!!!My favorite hotel in Savannah!  Totally worth not staying on the water.  Excellent location on Forsyth Park, very friendly service, beautiful and comfortable rooms.  I personally prefer it over its sister hotel, the Bohemian (which is also very nice).Here for a family wedding. The place is beautiful and very unique. Located right across from Forsyth park. Pros: the customer service was fantastic.  Doors are always held open. Fresh water is available all of the time with citrus in it.  Fresh yummy cookies available in the middle of the day. The food at the wedding was outstanding and very tasty. The ballrooms are beautiful with all the chandeliers. The hotel rooms are very interesting.  You walk in and immediately you see a huge bathtub in the middle of the room.  The breakfast in the concierge was decent enough to eat every morning. Cons: the bathrooms in the room!!!!! There is absolutely no privacy whatsoever.  The only 'doors' that they have are curtains or the glass doors to the toilet and shower. You can completely see through them. Also the shower was kind of gross. There was mold in the grout and I felt dirty stepping on it. The shower head sprayed in many different directions (they did fix that for us on the first day). The house keeping service wasn't that great. You could tell they simply made the beds and replenished the towel supply. No vacuuming or putting ironing board away.Overall: I really wanted to give this a 3.5 star simply because of the bathroom.  A 5 star hotel shouldn't have such moldy showers!It's a nice hotel, rooms are bigger than normal ... Beds are comfortable but like most hotels the shower is not good at all :( the water barely comes out... If you have to wash your hair forget about it .... You won't be able to remove the shampoo ... So please update your shower heads to something that worksGreat place and a very pleasant staff.   The rooms are a bit gaudy, but overall pleasant and comfortable.   You may also want to check out their sister hotel, the Bohemia closer to the river.For anyone who has ever visited the charming city of Savannah, the opportunity to stay at a luxurious mansion on Forsyth Park is pretty much a dream come true!  Just a short stroll from parks, squares, restaurants, historic sights and shopping.The Mansion is filled with incredible artwork, some is not my cup of tea, but still much appreciated.  The building itself seems to reflect the unique history of Savannah.  But the hotel itself is an unforgettable hotel experience. Built in 1888, the remarkable Victorian-esque exterior has been completely restored to its extravagant, yet classic old world style.  Thoughtful touches everywhere, from fresh baked cookies in the lobby along with metal pitchers of sweet iced tea to fresh flowers in the elevator.  Complimentary bath salts or bubble bath available at the front desk.Our guest room was pure drama, rich, sparkly, complete with yards and yards of red velvet drapes, (thinking Scarlett here) with a matching wing back chair complete with matching ottoman.  Incredible lighting and an enormous free standing tub perched out in the open, could also be closed off by tugging the taupe colored draperies.  It is a tub that any woman would love to own.  So amazing, I can not think of enough adjectives to describe the splendor of our room.  Even the carpets are uber cool, taupe in color that matched some of the walls, with an French type of design and pattern.  There was a fur throw over the end corner of the bed.  A wall of rich wooden cabinets that housed the big screen and matching side closets.  Even the hotel robes were pure luxury.  The king sized bed was very comfortable.  We also had a bay window and another flat window giving us great views of Forsyth Park.The hotel staff was polite, the valet service was decent.  I would love to stay here, again.I was generally disappointed in this hotel. I expected better from a showpiece Marriott. It gives too much thought to fancy looking design but little to comfort.The good:-Excellent, convenient location.-Very good restaurant and bar area- Neat art gallery in the hotel and art displayed through out- Valet parkingThe bad:- The entire second floor has the trendy but completely insane set up of the open bathroom. The tub is behind a curtain. The toilet and shower are behind lightly frosted glass. If you are trying to sleep, and your partner wants to take a dump, good luck with that.  This can be avoided by not staying on the second floor though.- There were other silly design aspects in our room. Only one side of the bed had a nightstand for example, where as there was no light and nowhere to put stuff on the other side. - Weak water pressure in the shower. - Horrible concave mirror that makes you look like a fat midget. I would rather stay in a more humble hotel with basic decor but a comfortable room layout.This hotel is fantastic. And I've stayed in a TON of hotels.The room was a large king. I fully took advantage of the amazing bathtub. The bed was INCREDIBLY comfortable, felt like a tempurpedic, and I slept like a rock. If you're looking for an affordable hotel with a wonderful room, Mansion is the place in Savannah. Will definitely come back again.Mansion 3Reason for visit: A Savannah visitVisit date: August 17-18, 2012First time? Yes.I think this hotel might have been haunted or staffed by ghosts but in a semi-fun Disneyland Tower of Terror kind of way. Some notes: The convex mirror in the bedroom made for a creepy photoshoot. The king bed comfortably slept three. The room was always humid, which I guess is expected for Savannah in August (but the a/c was on...). The hotel is conveniently located near a park and they also offer complementary shuttle service to their sister hotel across town (which is closer to the attractions).Gorgeous hotel, centrally located and perfectly suited to the old Savannah backdrop of gorgeous mansion homes, the decor is opulent and the service was wonderful. Would love to stay there again!I loved this hotel to pieces.  The location across from a park and surrounded by trees with Spanish moss.  It has a small pool area and the rooms have huge comfortable beds, a large bathroom with an even bigger tub, flat screen television, powerful air conditioning, a safe, minibar everything you need.  The staff was super friendly and helpful and the food here was excellent.  I recommend the bar downstairs their margaritas are really good and I tried the chicken club, mussels with chorizo and fried green tomatoes and loved them all.  During the day the hotel lobby offers a variety of sweet tea, iced water, bottled water, delicious peanut butter cookies and fruit.  The bartenders are super friendly and gave me good tips for navigating from that location.  The patrons at the bar were friendly and chatty which was nice.  My hotel stay included breakfast and h'orderves and drinks at the concierge room which was great although I never made it to breakfast.  Being on Drayton Street was a walk from the downtown/ river front tourist area in the humidity was too much for this girl from the north.  At night Drayton is desolate so I recommend taking a cab back.  The park across from the hotel is nice to walk through in the colder months.  I highly recommend this hotel I really enjoyed my stay here.Stayed here during the 4th in 2013.  Service was poor all around.  The room was nice and the location is great. I just expect nice people greeting you and trying to be helpful at a place for this price.... Hotel manager needs to train or upgrade the customer service.Excellent meal at Mansion on St. Patrick's Day eve in Savannah. We are visiting friends and it was our first time at the restaurant. I had the scallops and my wife had the tuna. Both the meals and the service were superb. The prices were very reasonable. Strong recommendation.I love this hotel. They are always very accommodating and helpful. The three best parts of the hotel are:1. Pet Friendly2. Walking distance to Old Savannah 3. Across from Forsyth ParkThe decor, like 700 Drayton, is stiflingly Southern with the enormous amount of tchotchy that is put everywhere. I can forgive the over-exuberant theme due to their acceptance of my little friends. In fact, that is what bumps them up to a five-star for me. One should stay at The Mansion at least once.Alrightee then! If you read my review of the other Kessler hotel in Savannah, you may wonder why we took another chance - but we did. I was seduced by the website - what can I say? Marketing works! Maybe it was the weather.... I won't repeat things you can find on the website because  that's pointless! I will say that this boutique hotel visually turned me on! Pure and simple. I wanted to experience the rich history of Savannah (without resorting to moldy ghost-inhabitted homes disguised as ""bed and breakfasts"") - and luxury is important to me because I like to feel as though I am pampering myself when I stay at a hotel. LOVE ZONE: I  will steady my breathing as I try to write about the lounges and private event spaces at The Mansion. E X Q U I S I T E!!   Just Exquisite!  (see  website for images ... ) While dining at 700 Drayton, I experienced a moment of inexplicable bliss. One of those moments when all 5 senses are being caressed at the same time! ROOM : We had a corner executive suite which overlooked Forsyth Park - so I loved waking up in the morning to that view.  (see website for images of their rooms). SERVICE: Room service was on point and non-intrusive - just the way I like it. The  reception staff were friendly enough. The valet and porters - professional.AMENITIES: I did not have time to try the spa (very unlike me...) but swam in their pool - which is intimate and relaxing. There was a wedding set up in the courtyard area which was amazing. The executive lounge was OK.LOCATION: Perfect  for experiencing the beautiful gardens and historic homes of Savannah and convenient for any and all tourist activities, If you are a morning jogger - you could not ask for a better spot. There's also a visitors center across the street.Stayed here for our anniversary on the way back from a cruise in Miami. This is easily in my top 5 places I've stayed. I've tried a lot of places in Savannah and this is hands down the best.General: The ambiance in the room and hotel was awesome. We must have been there at a quiet/slow time because we only saw one other couple the entire time. Romantic atmosphere. Fresh cookies and sweet tea when we checked in, and really, what more could you need?Room: Awesome! Parkview, second floor. Maybe it's because I was just on a cruise, but the room seemed huge. It's an open floor plan that's got pretty much the whole space connected with the ability to section different areas off. The bathroom was sectioned off from the rest of the room by a shower curtain and had glass doors for the shower and toilet. There were also shutters over the tub in the wall separating the tub from the rest of the room. Maybe not the best if total privacy is super important to you. But really cool for a wide open feel. Room service was really reasonable too.Pool: Looked nice but didn't have a chance to try itLocation: Great. You walk out the doors and you're right in the middle of the park. Great for getting out and just walking around.Tips: Don't bother with the valet parking. You can park on the street, right next to their valet lot, for free.","This hotel was well worth the money.  We had a fantastic view of the park.  Sadly the lobby was under construction but the rest of the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Our only 'complaint' was that the pool wasn't bigger.  Our rooms were great size and clean.This hotel was nothing like I expected.  I can live with modern, but this was not to my taste.  The owners' taste for modern art is in your face from the moment you walk in.The elevator has strange lighting and velvet, not sure of the color because the lighting prevented one from identifying that.The halls are lined with modern art pieces and crystal chandeliers.The rooms have faux fur throws on the beds, crystal chandeliers, modern, spot lighted art on the wall, and green velvet around the sink in the bathroom.  The commode is glassed in.  The ottoman for the one velvet chair in the room is almost the size of the bed.Staff is very friendly and they provide free shuttle service to their sister hotel down on River Street.The park across the street is a wonderful park, the hotel is quiet, and we liked the location better than being down on River Street.Overall:  A great haunted place that you will love always.  Okay, its not haunted but they do have a story to tell.Rooms:  Very nice, clean, and roomy but a little dark but the bathroom makes up for it.This place is so nice, the staff was nice but they are not really Marriott workers so they have a different type of way they do business. I felt that the workers were very nice and accommodating then the front desk.What I enjoyed about the place was that the Forsyth Park was right across the street, my daughter loved to go and get wet in the sprinklers and play in the park.Keep in mind that they have a lot of homeless people around but even at 10:30 pm at night my daughter and I went to Krogers for some items and we felt safe.Food:  The food was good very good.  Advice:  Even though you are not Marriott employees you may want to make sure that they follow the brand.Suggestion:  If you want a nice place to stay and really feel like your in Savannah then you must stay here.  I will always visit this hotel.This hotel is part of a small chain (Kessler) affiliated with Marriott, so you get the benefits of Marriott Rewards, etc. But it's a bit quirky. The decor in all Kessler hotels is bit flamboyan - red velvet, chandeliers, bathrooms that open to the bedroom. And the rooms are dark. The halls are covered with eccentric paintings from an artist lost in the 70's. The hotel markets itself as a wedding venue, so areas are often closed off for weddings. Beware the late night parties of the wedding guests in the halls and rooms, which can get raucous. Staff is sweet but often inefficient - the desk staff always seemed to be trianing a new person, causing long lines. The hostess in the concierge lounge enjoyed keeping the television tuned to animated movies, which can be grating at 6:30 am. We wish she'd paid better attention to keeping the coffee pot full and getting all the food delivered for breakfast. If something was missing (and it always was), the answer was ""they didn't bring any today."" That said, she was cheerful and welcoming, just poorly trained.  The location is some distance south of the historic district, so it's probably best to have a car if you stay here. Ask for a room overlooking Forsyth Park, Savannah's answer to Central Park. Avoid rooms facing the courtyard, as there are often private parties there, which get loud. The restaurant is good for breakfast or lunch. For dinner, head to Local Eleven 10, a farm-to-table restaurant just a few blocks further south.This is one of the nicest boutique hotels I've ever stayed at!  There's really nothing negative I can say about this place.  The whole property is beautiful. The staff is courteous, there's a great bar and restaurant and the rooms are fantastic.  It's across from Forsyth Park, which makes for a fantastic walk or place to relax.As long as you are aware of these three items, you should be all set:- The hotel is 1 mile from the waterfront.  It can be a long walk if done often, but they have shuttle service every 30 min from the Mansion to their sister property, The Bohemian, located on the water.- Some of the rooms have only (beautiful/luxurious) curtains between the bathroom and sleeping area.  Depending on who you are going with, make sure you ask for a non-curtained room if that's what you want.  The curtains actually make for a much more elegant setup.- Toiletries aren't replenished.  We were there for 3 days and housekeeping didn't replenish the shampoo, conditioner or lotion.  We had to ask for more.Thank you Mansion on Forsyth Park for making our girls birthday weekend absolutely amazing! Our room was beautiful and the hotel location is great, but what was really the star of our weekend was the amazing staff! Everyone from the valets, to the bell staff, to the front desk was absolutely so friendly and did everything they could to make sure we had a fun stay and a fabulous trip! A special shout out to Penelope at the front desk who really went out of her way to make our trip extra special and fun....""your ladies"" thank you Penelope!!!! xo! ;)For an upscale hotel I was hoping for a little more. I booked this room because from looking at the pictures it looks romantic. I would probably opt for a B&amp;B next time. The hotel, especially the hallways, smelled musty. Directly across from our room the staff had placed a fan in the hall that ran. All. Night. Long. Apparently there was a water issue across from us. The room was nice and the bed big and comfy. The large jacuzzi tub in the room and the bathroom were nice, except for the toilet. Why in the world would you put a glass door on the toilet is beyond me. We decided it must be an artistic touch because it sure wasn't practical. Because there are large doors above the tub connecting the bedroom to the bathroom so you have to shut 4 doors to have privacy in the bathroom. What a pain! And if you are showering and someone is using the toilet you'll be staring directly at them through the glass! The decor is over the top. Opulent? yes. Tacky? In my opinion, yes, a little. It looks like an art bomb went off in there. You can't even escape it in the oddly dark elevator! And the tiny pool in the back of the courtyard is more of an afterthought. You know when there is a patio event you have to walk through the event to get to the pool? There is no side entrance for the pool so you have to saunter through someones wedding reception in your flip flops! (Not that we did that but I could imagine people do) And at a hotel of this caliber they should offer poolside drink service.The staff was responsive and professional. It's the little touches like opening the door for us when we approached. And having flavored water available throughout the day. The location is OK, but not as good if you were a few blocks closer to the river. You are right on gorgeous Forsyth Park but it is also on the edge of the not-so-nice part of town. But let's face it, nothing in historic Savannah is too far away from anywhere else. And if you were eating all that delicious food while visiting, like we were, it won't hurt you to do a little walking!Make sure if nothing else you take the 700 Cooking Class. Chef Darin is a hoot and you really learn a lot. Search the web for reviews, you'll see.The room was very nice, bed was comfortable however the help was lacking. The maid service was there the first 2 nights then it was non existent. We stayed 5 nights. The lady at the front desk ""Jade"" was no help at all when I was told on Monday that the concierge would be in on Tuesday at 10:00 am and that she would  help us schedule any tours that we wanted to take  while in Savannah and then  after scheduling our day around talking to the concierge  at ""10:00 am"" we were then told that she "" concierge would not be in until 11: 00 am.......so Jade at the front desk said she could help us and after about 20 minutes of pecking around on a computer she said she would call me when she had the tour set  for us for the following day. I left my number and we went to sightsee and after not hearing from her in an hour I called the concierge back and she said that she would get the tour set up for us and call us back and not trusting that it would get done, I pulled up the tour on the Internet on my phone and booked it within about 10 minutes. The concierge called me back in 5 HOURS.  (I never heard back at all from JADE.)The next day we sat down on in the lobby to wait for the hotel shuttle and ""JADE"" assured us she would let us know when the shuttle arrived but oh no she forgot to tell us and had no attitude of being sorry it was just so what wait on the next one or don't. My husband and I talked to the manager and he seemed sincerely sorry and the hotel paid for our dinner as a form of reconciliation for the poor hotel service. Because the manager was so nice we will probably consider staying here again sometimes in the future to give them another chance, although there are loads of good hotels to choose from here.I stayed here 2 years ago but it seems like yesterday that I stayed here with my wife. I had wanted to surprise her because she was graduating and I had not seen her in about 3 weeks. Well, I call the Mansion and I tell them it was a very special occasion and jokingly I said ""can you put rose pedals on the bed, that would be awesome"". THEY PUT ROSE PEDALS ON THE BED AND ALL OVER THE ROOM!! THEY MADE A HEART OUT OF ROSE PEDALS! She was already impressed because valet was very courteous but when we walked into the room...uncontrollable tears. Best husband of the year award thanks to the wonderful staff at the Mansion. The pool, the atmosphere, the art, and everything else will never leave your mind. Spend the money and get a room here at least for a couple days and at least once in this life time.Comfortable bed. Jacuzzi. Spacious room. Valet parking. Wonderful restaurant. Spa.Hotel is nice, rooms well appointed and luxurious. Like everything in Savannah, however, service sucks. Tables in the outdoor area by the pool were never picked up, furniture there was cheap, not what if expect for a hotel of this caliber. The other problem is its a fairly long walk to river st, city mkt etcJohn, the Bellman, made the experience a good one from the moment we stepped from our car. The room was comfortable, if not spacious,  with a quality bed - though the undersized fitted sheets kept pulling the pillow-top mattress pad from one side of the bed. Bathroom was on a par with the Westin in Ft. Lauderdale - which is to say, outstanding.  Staff is friendly and the turn-down service exceptionally so. No sweeter smile exists on the planet.Location combined with appointments make this worth every  penny.Single gripe - in a city that boasts being the second to have a Coca-Cola bottling plant, there wasn't a bottle of coke to be had anywhere. Unless you're happy with cans, the front desk suggests you walk to the nearest Kroger.  NOT what I expected to hear. Still, a very nice couple of days.Manager apologized and brought out sunflower bread. I would give them a second chanceVery nice place.  Room was great, service was excellent.  Location was top notch.I would stay here again without question.Southern hospitality at its finest, right down to the sweet tea and oatmeal raisin cookies in the lobby. The decor was grandiose and in some ways over the top. However, it fits with the mansion. The proximity to Forsyth Park was nice, but it is still a drive from the waterfront. Great place for a girls' weekend.Nice bathtub.  Nice decor. Poor on fundamentals of guest service. Just couldn't  keep up with the flow of guests, getting rooms turned, housekeeping, providing responsive, positive guest experience. Understaffed where they need it. Overstaffed on the fluffery. Could be a nice property, but just not well managed.Now this is a beautiful hotel.  So we pulled up and handed the car over to the valet.  Check-in is at 4pm, but the room wasn't ready until almost 5pm.  That's why I gave them four and not five stars.  While waiting for my room to be cleaned, they took my luggage, and I went exploring the hotel.  There is an outside marble area near the pool.  I walked out there it was a little humid, so I didn't stay in that area long.  I went back inside and walked around.  The walls are covered with really beautiful artwork.  There is a nice bar to have a few drinks.  Past the bar, I thought was a gift shop, but it was where they sell the art pieces and other miscellaneous art items.Okay, so now on to the rooms.  I get into my room, and it was really nice.  I didn't get a room with the nice view of the park, so that kind of sucked.  Not a big deal since I really didn't spend that much time in the hotel room besides sleeping.  I had a king size bed that was very comfortable, and a nice size bathroom.  My shower had three shower heads.  It was the best shower ever.  It felt so fancy.  (ha, best way to describe it)    The area surrounding the hotel is gorgeous.  It's located next to park and walking distance to a lot of bars and stores.  The hotel offers free shuttle service within the historic district when you value your car.  I liked this place a lot.  If I visit Savannah again, I'll definitely stay here again.Beautiful hotel, perhaps the prettiest place we have stayed.  Great bath tub in room.  Wish they supplied bath supplies instead of trying to sell it.  Bed was comfortable and room was beautifully furnished.  Surprisingly, this beautiful hotel is dog friendly for $150 fee.  We brought our dog and walked him on the Forsyth park.  Wish we could have enjoyed the pool as it looked great.  Enjoyed a late dinner in their restaurant.3.5  The outside of the hotel is beautiful. The artwork in the hallway is unique, a little different, but not necessarily bad.  Although the decor was very different, I enjoyed it.  We were away celebrating our anniversary, so I think the uniqueness was a great reminder this wasn't a family vacation for us. The room atmosphere  was great, very romantic. The bed was awesome, super comfortable. There were a couple of service issues.  The bathroom didn't seem very clean, The snacks/fridge weren't fully stocked, the fridge was actually opened with an interior lock broken when we arrived.  It made me a bit nervous we would be charged for something since drinks and snacks were missing, still waiting to make sure.  We called down to the front desk to let them know.  The toilet was broken, but they were up within 15 minutes to fix it, but left water drops all over the bathroom.  The next morning, even though we had requested privacy they knocked on the door twice to come clean it, thinking we were leaving, which was partly our fault since we decided to stay another two days.  They were knocking before checkout time though.  Then for the next two days they didn't clean our room, evidently we left our room too late, even though both times we left before 12.  When we called for fresh towels they were quick to bring them up, and then sent someone to clean the room.  When they did, they didn't replace any toiletries, which by this day we were out of shampoo and conditioner.  And they left the cleaning spray.  When we decided to stay another two days, the only room that was supposedly available was the concierge floor.  We took it, thinking this was the only thing available, but after reading other reviews discovered that the concierge lounge is in a different section of the building, not a particular floor, and was receiving horrible reviews.  We asked to take that portion off our bill, and they removed it.  Room service was quick, and the food was good.  They add on a 22% tip, and an additional fee that I can't remember--but we had arrived very late, just ordering before the 11 pm cutoff, and didn't want to head out to eat.  The outdoor patio by the pool was beautiful.  The pool is very small.There was daily wifi charge of $10.  They have valet parking, but we parked on the street for free, just watch for the street sweeping times.The positive was it's a very romantic room, the furnishings and bedding were great.Mansion on Forsyth Park is incredible. GOOD: - Right by Forsyth Park, which is beautiful - Walking distance to lots of things- A nice outdoor pool with lounge chairs to, well, lounge- Spacious rooms- Beautiful decor- A ridiculously comfortable bed- Awesome jacuzzi in the roomNOT SO GOOD: - There seemed to be a lot of random alarms going offOverall though, this is a wonderful place to stay. It's an escape and peaceful (when the alarms aren't going off), whether you're lounging by the pool, napping in the room, chilling in the jacuzzi, or going for a stroll in Forsyth Park. Front desk service is top notch with that southern charm. The Mansion on Forsyth feels like quintessential Savannah. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.","I love it.Lovely hotel clean and quiet.  Very cool artwork throughout .  Concierge was missing in action?????  Helpful valet staff.  Parking pretty pricey when there was parking available on street.  Complimentary champagne in lobby in pm but no coffee in the lobby in the morning--weird!!!!  Appreciate the sparkling clean linens but Clorox smell was super strong.This place is too weird. Not very clean, and burn holes in the curtains. Floor  tile grout is black with grime. Their """" Bohemian Art looks like a five-year-old would do it on a bad day. MARRIOT, what are you thinking being associated with this. You must be in financial trouble and this is scary.You've got lots of reviews to read through if you're considering staying at the Mansion on Forsyth Park, so I'll just add a few thoughts:1.  The location across from the park worked beautifully for me.  Having my dog with me, it was PERFECTLY situated.  Plus, the healthy walk to the waterfront took us through some lovely neighborhoods.  Just walk down Drayton and bring your camera to shoot some wonderful facades.2.  The decor is a bit over the top, and I wouldn't want to live with it on a daily basis, but it is quite fun and interesting for a hotel stay.  Nicely done!3.  Our room had a few issues, such as the lack of an in-room amenities book (which never came from Guest Services as promised), some mildew on the clear silicone surrounding the shower, and a CD that wouldn't play in the Bose system.  Overall, small things.  On the plus side, the bed was delightful and the staff very friendly, even to Lucy our dog.  As for Casimir's Lounge, read my other review to get more on that.  Be forewarned!  I would venture out to Local 11 Ten for a cocktail and meal which is just at the end of Forsyth Park vs. staying in the hotel.We usually stay at their sister hotel but wanted to change it up. We had a wonderful room that did not disappoint what we expected. Everything looked amazing and was completely spot on. Outstanding service by all (from the valet on up). Great location but we liked being on river street just a bit more...if only because its closer to everything on a rainy weekend..lol. we shall return and its nice to have another ""go to"" hotel!My husband and I stayed at Mansion in March, on a mini getaway.  I cannot say enough about how great it was!The location -- right on Forsyth park, within walking distance of most of the sights -- was perfect. Quiet in the evenings (not by any loud bars!), beautiful in the daytime. The rooms were great. The highlight of my stay was the giant bathtub (you can watch TV from the bathtub!), and the beautiful furnishings. Service was great and it the whole place had a cute boutique-y vibe. Do NOT park in the lot -- you can park on the street, right next to the lot, for free! Also, if you're looking to save money on food or need to pick up some essentials, its about 2 blocks from a Harris Teeter.We cannot wait to go back again, and we've told everyone we know that they should stay there if they visit Savannah!We wanted a martini in the hotel's bar next door but it was closed for a private party so we had drinks in the hotel's lounge - the Bosendorfer.  Average drinks but nice ambience.  Quiet and reserved with nice views of artwork and Forsyth Park.I found this place while on a business trip.I began looking for a hotel at all of big name places down toward the river- places that I have points at too. No matter where i went I couldn't find a rate for less than $175 a night. I finally decided to go on priceline to see what came up. Some place called ""The Mansion"" showed up for $144 a night. So I said whatever let's go.I thought I made a mistake when I drove up to the hotel. The building itself looks like something out of an old murder/mystery novel (sort of like most of the town). Walking in the door is like getting slapped in the face with a combination of hand picked architectural elements, hanging light fixtures and pieces of art. The thing that I found to be odd was that the general setup had sort of a tasteful gaudiness to it. The people at the front desk were nice enough and accomodating despite the slow computer system that they were dealing with. No big deal. I enjoyed some nice water with fresh oranges while I waited.When I got up to my room it felt as if I stepped into a different world. The room itself had a feel of Victorian, old southern feel with a hint of modern design. In any case, this place far exceeded my expectations for accommodation when I'm on the road. The beds were super comfy, and the bathroom had a massive tub with doors that opened up to the rest of the room. The setup seems like it would be ideal for a small get together with the lady. I was staying alone and the ambiance was giving me devient thoughts. My only complaint is that the front desk messed up my wake up call and taxi ride to the airport. Granted I had a 5:30 AM flight and I spent my last evening out on the town.....but still. However, in the rush of waking up late I left some of my dress shirts in the closet. I called to tell them and they shipped them back to LA for me in less than 5 days. That meant something to me.The location is pretty cool. Right next to a huge park. However it is a little out of the way for the more 'happening' area down toward the river. A late night out will more than likely require a taxi ride.If I ever need a old time southern getaway, Savannah will be my city and The Mansion will more than likely be where I'd stay.I have been wanting to stay at The Mansion for about 2 years now since a visit we made previously to Savannah. We have recently moved to the area and decided for our anniversary we would do a little Staycation and treat ourselves to a night here. The hotel is gorgeous. Lots to see. Room was very romantic and the view of Forsyth was so nice. Stayed on a Saturday so everyone was out enjoying the day at the park. I will say be prepared for noise if you choose a Forsyth Park view room. The walls didn't block much especially the people hanging outside at night. We think they were guests at the wedding that was being held there that night. The bed was very comfy and they sure didn't short us on pillows. There were five! My main complaint with the room is the bathroom situation. The area where the toilet is has only a glass door and it doesn't really close. Soooooo....yeah, you can hear all the business that is being done in there. So while the room is romantic, it kiiinnnddaaa puts a damper on things when you can hear your significant other, well...you know. Overall though, we had a very nice stay. Only other hotel we have stayed at to compare in the area was the Andaz and we really LOVED our stay there.""Heaven In the Form of a Business Trip""Y'all. This is one of my most favorite hotels - ever. And I've done more than my share of traveling. I'm feeling a bit . . . succinct tonight (for me), so let me tell you why I so adore the Mansion - in bullet-point form:1 Great location near fun restaurants in the downtown-ish area. If I didn't have dinner plans with customers when Savannah was part of my territory, I could easily check in/park my car/get out for a lovely meal without much ado at all.2 The. Coolest. Rooms. The style is what I think of as ""art-deco-y"" and all the rooms are a little different. But the second you walk in the lobby, you just feel like you are in a really neat place. Great art on the walls, fantastic appointments in every room where I ever stayed.3 Ok . . . this is a personal ""love"" of mine: huge bathtub (and I always asked for/usually got a room where the ""soaking tub"" was accented by a large ""cut-out"" window that gave me a direct view of the TV). And....the Mansion always has great movies-on-demand-plus . . . 4 . . . Great, and speedy (and not too hotel-over-priced) room service. So, after a long day of sales calls, I could order a yummmmy hamburger and bottle of bubbly (yes, a bottle!) and nestle into the tub with bubbles, and get a movie I'd been wanting to see. Life = gooood!5 Fast, reliable wireless. Always. So nice, and not the case in all hotels!I wish I still had business to do in Savannah - but I'd totally stay there for a getaway weekend. Did I mention that you can get special rates from travelocity and such sites??Don't bother staying here, unless your going to be playing in the park everyday.  Location sucks, if you go the wrong way out of the hotel you will be in the GHETTO.Hotel staff is not helpful and they are understaffed.  So plan on waiting forever to check in and out; also if you have a question.Oh yea if they have a wedding going on, then you will not be able to use the pool or courtyard.  Never again...Loved this place!! - Beautiful property- Beautiful Rooms / clean- Hotel Restaurant had amazing food- Friendly staffMy only complaint was the Bath would only heat the water to luke warm, so no relaxing bath. Other then that, we had an amazing time.The name says it all. The Mansion will make you feel like a celebrity, from the minute their attentive little bellboys open the door for you. We arrived at the Mansion after a hellish travel day, and didn't make it to our room until 1am, but it was definitely a sight for our sore eyes. The feel of the entire property is decadent, plush, and beckons indulgence. It's a little glitzy, but in a romantic-gothic sort of way, which totally fits the theme (The Mansion was once a mortuary, after all).  I hear that each room is slightly different - ours had a big tub with half-doors that opened up to the bedroom area, so you could carry on a conversation while one person is having a bubble bath and the other is lounging on the bed...an odd, but interesting detail. The shower and toilet are separated by a slightly-opaque glass wall, so once again...one person can shower while the other's on the pot and you can still have a face-to-face chat. An interesting way to ""bond"" with your travel partner or get over your stage fright...Service was wonderful. No overkill, just very attentive and polished with a hint of southern charm. For example, we went swimming in the hotel pool in the middle of a thunderstorm and instead of telling us we couldn't because of those silly pool rules, they offered to bring us dry towels when we were finished. Customer service, baby. That's what it's all about. Room service was yummy and overpriced, but you're at the Mansion, c'mon, live a little. The bar is a fun place to start or end your night too, especially if you're in the mood for more expensive grub and fancy drinks. Great location overlooking Forsyth Park and a 10 minute walk to downtown. If splurging is your game, the Mansion is waiting for you.A WARNING TO BRIDES.My bridesmaids and I stayed at the Mansion the night before my wedding. My mother in law booked the room and my sister in law called to confirm that we could take all of our photos there the day of the wedding.So my photographer and I planned to shoot the getting ready shots in the hotel room and then do a mini bridal session around the Mansion the morning of my wedding. Afterward, we'd head across the street to Forsyth Square for bridal party photos (the main reason for booking this gorgeous yet VERY expensive hotel was for its backdrop and convenience). As we were walking around, a staff member (I believe she identified herself as the on-site coordinator) asked if I was getting married at the Mansion. Giddy about my impending nuptials, I gushed about our ceremony details and how we were actually getting married at Whitfield Square.Well I guess I should have lied because she told us we couldn't shoot photos there unless I was a bride getting married on their property! Um, heeello?!? We stayed there the night before and made them well-aware of my intentions to take photos when we reserved the room!I was extremely upset about this and since then I've seen countless brides on photographers' websites who've taken portraits at the Mansion but had their ceremony elsewhere. Heck, I even saw tourists taking photos inside but since there was a professional camera involved, we were targeted!In hindsight, I would have skipped staying there the night before the wedding because they made everything a hassle and only seem to care about in-house brides and not their paying overnight guests.I gave them 2 stars because I did have a blast at their bar the night before with my girls and because the decor/rooms really are lovely.I spend over 100 days annually in hotels and this hotel was one of the worst experiences.  We checked in after a long day and at 2 am the fire alarm went off.  The asked everyone to wait outside while the fire department comes (here is the video of all guests outside at 3 am <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgmWpeyZgyR0&amp;s=0a37878ed66c38df8870a7198b080b59192ba17992db8065185c3b8b607ea69f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=gmWp...</a>).  I understand fire alarms can go off, but there was no communication by the hotel.  They basically just threw everyone out and bathrobes for an hour without any communication.  Then the fire department arrived and gave the ok to go back around 3 am.  They then had a faulty alarm, meaning false alarms continually going off until 4 am.  I called to speak to the general manager, Mr Kelly, in the morning he said it was a minor inconvenience and all he would do is give us a free breakfast.  Is this a joke?????  I never look for any hand outs, but this was unacceptable.  I paid for a nights rest, instead I got a horrible nightmare.  (The valet told us they have some club at night and they didn't realize that they were setting off the fire alarm while they were making some late night food).It didn't end here, the sheets were very old and the elastic was worn.  Therefore, every night the sheets would slide off the mattress and we would wake up on the mattress (neither of us has this ever happened to).  We asked the maid to change the sheets and explained this situation. She said ""honey, the sheets are too old, there is nothing we can do"".  To make maters worse the mattress was disgusting. The final straw was our toilet ran all night. We tried to have it fixed, but no one did anything.  On a positive note, the valets and cleaning staff was very pleasant and helpful.  The cookies were also tasty.  All and all I will never return to this place.  I am sure there are plenty of spots that value their customers in Savannah and Mr Kelly demonstrated that Mansion is not one of them.A good hotel! I am a huge fan of the decor which is really funky and modern with a wide variety of art which I really enjoy. I really enjoyed staying next to the park instead of the more touristy riverfront. All of the staff here were great especially the valet staff. The rooms were so comfortable with a great bathtub and snugly robes. They also have a pool which is kinda small but still nice in the summer time. The spa here was also really incredible. I had a wonderful facial and would highly recommend a visit.  Overall, a good bet for a nice hotel in Savannah!The Mansion on Forsyth is where we celebrated the night our engagement, and also celebrated there for our wedding reception. The restaurant, 700 Drayton, is absolutely exquisite. Every dish is carefully planned and selected for the season's most interesting fare. Dishes include southern favorites such as their twist on Shrimp and Grits, filets of fish and beef, and delectable desserts. Their banquet service was executed to the highest standard. Each selection was fresh, hot, and served to impress. Rooms are upscale, funky, and very Savannah. The place has history, art, architecture, and style. Your eye will be pleased with the interesting pieces and collections making each room different. Guest rooms are beyond luxe. Bedding is plush, but the garden bath tubs surrounded by sheer curtains (and closable doors/windows) really make the experience worthy of a four-star rating.Very enjoyable stay, valet and bell men were quite good.  Front desk was good...not great.  Overall a bit pricey relative to service levels.  Art throughout the hotel, hanging in front of curtained walls was really neat.  Bed was lousy for me (super duper soft and marshmallowy).  I like firm beds, this was the opposite.  Very well designed, can't say I love the lack of a bathroom/toilet door.  Location was really nice.  I'd go back.I'm a big fan of any of the Kessler hotels &amp; The Mansion on Forsyth is no exception! I am so lucky that my BFF opted to have her December '10 wedding reception in the hotel's FABULOUS ball room/marble courtyard because there was no excuse for me &amp; the Hubs, as well as some other lucky family members not to stay here :-) Especially when I located an excellent room rate, even lower than the reserved wedding rate via TravelZoo! From the moment one pulls up &amp; is greeted by the friendly valets and bellhops, you know you're somewhere a little extra special... The small-ish yet tastefully appointed lobby is welcoming and there's so much to satisfy the senses! My favorite being sight, as the hotel's artwork collection is wonderful!We booked a standard king room &amp; were pleasantly surprised with the room's spacious feeling (large by boutique hotel standards) and fun open bathroom, with a nice big tub and separate tiled shower. The colors, textures and textiles used throughout the hotel are magnificent - anything from crystal and mirror to green velvet...wowza!The Mansion offers free shuttle service to anywhere in historic Savannah between about 8am and 11pm &amp; we certainly took advantage of it! The shuttle drivers were friendly and offered great suggestions on the best places to go out in Savannah.The only negative - the high price for parking. I believe it was aprox. $30/car/day. A little steep, even for Savannah standards, however with the great deal we got through TravelZoo, we were a-ok with it :-)I'll let my friend post about her wedding experience - but as a guest and wedding party member, I was extremely pleased with the ballroom setup, food (although the shrimp 'n grits could have been replenished a bit more often on the buffet) and overall service. It was a great experience that I know many of the guests continue to gush about!I wanted my 95th review to be someplace special. (Saving the 100th for somewhere special in my hometown)This is one of the grandest, most beautiful, hotels that I have ever stayed at in my whole life!We stayed here the night of my daughter's wedding. The small reception was held at the hotel's outstanding restaurant, 700 Drayton, and the ceremony was held across the street in Forsyth Park (see review).This hotel is the definition of EXQUISITE!!!Top notch, high end, impeccable.The service, the rooms, the staff, the lobby, the food, beyond outstanding!From the moment you check-in at the front desk to the morning that you leave, you are treated like a celebrity.Velvet upholstery, crystal chandeliers, fine artwork, marble floors and tubs, complete class. Not a detail missed.Laying my head on the fluffy, soft, top of the line, pillows and linens was the perfect end to a perfect day!Just a side note...the groom forgot his dress socks, my husband gave him his, and the concierge actually had a bellhop run a new pair (who knows where they bought them) over to the park where the men were lining up before the ceremony started!","['girl', 'likes',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bohemian-hotel-savannah-riverfront-autograph-collection-savannah,"The Bohemian Hotel Savannah Riverfront, Autograph Collection",3.5,$$$,92,"A totally chill place to relax and have a glass of wine and a lite bite with family and friends!Service was great along with excellent views.   There is a nice amount of space to sit and stand.  Decent by the glass wine selection.  Lite bites are above average and of average price.  There two nights in a row and have enjoyed both visits.   Great river view!  And lots of people!!I did not stay at this hotel but we had dinner at their restaurant. The kitchen was backed up and we waited over an hour to get our food. We all ordered the filet cooked medium. When they came out all three steaks were charred and all three were Med-well, I'd say closer to the well side. The server got the manager for us and when we showed him our steaks he argued that they were in fact medium. My friend pressed her fork into the steak to show him how dry it was and there was no juice coming out of it, as there should be in a medium steak. He still argued that they were cooked appropriately. Two of us did not eat more than a few bites of our steak. Even steak sauce didn't help much. For nearly $40/steak, you want something that at least taste good. The manager handled the situation very poorly. I understand it was a rough night for them but he should not have argued with us when it was clearly overcooked. He did offer to comp our side items and drinks, which for me may was no more than $15, I only had one drink and one side. If I had thought about it, I would have taken pictures to share in this review. The server wasn't great because my friends drink went empty and stayed that way for awhile. However, I chalk that up to the server going back to the kitchen to find out where our food was. The bar upstairs is nice. We went there a few nights before. The view was wonderful and they have a great fireplace. I wouldn't go back because of the awful expensive dinner experience. But other people seemed to have much better experiences, we may have just caught a bad night with a poor manager.What a gorgeous hotel with a perfect location.....we stayed here for a few days over my birthday and Gloria helped us so much at check-in and made our visit perfect.  Gloria is a gem!The rooms are gorgeous and the bathrooms are very modern.  I really liked the nice touches throughout the room, especially the sitting bench in front of the window overlooking Bay Street.  I also liked the dark hallways....not sure why, but I thought they were cool.A wonderful location right on Bay so you are right in the mix. They also gave a wonderful upstairs bar overlooking Bay Street and the water to the rear.  It's a big space, but fills up quickly due to their location.  The exercise room is a closet...literally a closet so don't expect much of a workout...but boo hoo...you are in Savannah (a beautiful walking city) so you can miss a day or two.....Oh so very Savannah! This was the last stop for us on our mini-moon, and after a slight booking glitch at our condo in Tybee, we were more than ok to snag a last minute room at the Bohemian, so we could adventure around Savannah for a day. I drove past it once, as the building really blends in with the historic scene of the city. After a U-turn (I'm the queen of U-turns y'all) there we were: The valet was on top of it and a bell hop (are they still called bell hops?) helped us with our luggage up to our room. And to take the customer service to the next level... we had quite a bit of beer with us that we didn't finish at the beach, so he offered to go get us ice, and knowing the little ice bucket wasn't going to cut it (ok, we had a lot of beer left) he actually filled a waste basket full for us. A++!!! The layout of this hotel is a little strange, but in a good/cool way. The lobby is on the 4th floor (but street level) and it's filled with dark wood, leather and some very cool lighting. The hallways feel dark and mysterious.... and I was secretly hoping Jim Williams would jump out to greet us. The room was clean, and what you would expect from a Bohemian hotel. Very cool walk in shower with a sitting area, and private commode area with it's own glass door (just watch out for the bottom of the doors... they are sharp and I cut my foot. (I'm a little clumsy in the morning before coffee thou...) We had a riverfront view, and you see HUGE cargo ships, that look so unreal in the seemingly tiny river.... I see reviews here for the rooftop bar, which we did hit up when we were they, but I left the review on the bar's own Yelp page: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/rocks-on-the-roof-savannah"">yelp.com/biz/rocks-on-th...</a> (Great views, if you are staying here, check it out.) All in all, it was a great stay, just cost an arm and a leg, but that could have been due to last min booking/peak season.Stayed Feb. 19th and 20th. Room 405 if I recall correctly. Arrived at night so it's a little hard to find. My navigation app had trouble finding it too and the valet area is counter-intuitive and not obviously marked.  Valet is $30 a day (I believe) and they request a 20 min. warning to retrieve your car. Savannah parking can be difficult so, this was an expense I was willing to bear.  Check-in was a breeze and friendly.The room: It was lovely. Not too large. Plush furnishings but when we arrived there were no lamps in the room and it was very dark.  I notified the desk and they resupplied one of the two lamps fairly quickly and explained that there had been an accident with a lamp somewhere else in the hotel and they appropriated the lamps from our room.  The second lamp never materialized but it was no big deal.The historic view from the 4th floor room was of the valet area which was also near the entrance so it could get noisy.  Ask for an upper level or river view if you can.The CD player never worked longer that 20 seconds. I informed the desk and it was never fixed. (they supply a CD for your pleasure but I couldn't enjoy it)The door would also not deadbolt which is a major security/privacy issue for me. I also informed the desk of this and it was not remedied. Overall: it's a cute hotel but the service needs to match the price.Had drinks on the rooftop after a late dinner.  Really nice with firepits which keep you warm when the weather drops.  We have to come back and enjoy the restaurant as well as stay here.  If it's as good as the Castle in Orlando, then we're in for a treat!This place is amazing. Every single staff member was extremely nice, they have lots of people working here as well. Our room was so nice, I love the decor. The shower was nice, the bed was nice, there is music playing in your room when you enter. Love it here and will continue to stay here every time we visit Savannah. A+++.Stayed here the weekend before Christmas. Was not sure what to expect, as I wasn't the one to book it. It was the perfect, romantic getaway. I enjoyed the unique, ""dark"" decor. The paintings throughout the hotel were magnificent, especially the one in our room. Very eclectic taste. Rooftop bar was the hotspot. We enjoyed some tapas and cocktails before heading out to dinner. Give the ginger infused bourbon a try ;) Centrally located to everything you need to see in Savannah.If I could give this place less than one star I would. When we checked in to this five star priced hotel, the desk clerk, Alexander, assured us we had been given a ""great room."" When we returned to our eighth floor room after dinner that night we learned it was anything but. No one bothered to warn us that a full band was playing directly above us in a night club jammed with no less than 300 people. The pounding music and partying went on until 1 am.  When we complained the desk staff was incredulous that we didn't appreciate our ""great room.""  The manager Jeremy offered us an insultingly small discount and free breakfast for our inconvenience but made no commitment that his staff would warn the next unwitting guests. We won't be returning. There are some great hotels in Savannah. The Bohemian isn't one of them.Update: Eight months later. We were just telling a friend about our horrible experience at the Bohemian and warning her not to stay there. I noticed that my review got a ""PR"" response from management expressing ""concern"" and saying they were ""looking into it."" For the record, I never heard back. Except for their public statement on Yelp there was zero follow up. Trust me, unless you're happy with a drunken out of control brawl, this hotel is not for you.This place is exquisite. My favorite part is the roof top bar, where you experience breath-taking views of the city, including the bridge. The only reason I did not rate this a five star is because the band was kind of a buzz kill. They were not upbeat at all, and seemed to be singing 80's sad songs. It didn't match the crowd or the atmosphere. It brought the overall mood of the place down. The drinks are a little pricey on the rooftop as well, but it's worth it for the view. Our server was very attentive and fun, and was very accommodating. I wouldn't visit Savannah without at least stopping here.Only reviewing for their rooftop service. We ordered two drinks. The Bloody Mary was delicious. My cobbler cocktail was not. We ordered a small appetizer, pretzel bites that took longer to be served, than to make, they sat in the window for a good 10 mins before being brought to us. When we tasted them, they were dry and topped with a heavy amount of mustard and some kind of cheese on bottom. We turned them away and the bartender laughed at us. He laughed in my face and just walked away. We visited Wednesday the 8th around 10pm. It was a young gentleman working. For such a nice place, their customer service needs work. Pretty view though.The hotel sets off on the side street as if its a brick office building, but as you drive up you see the door porters waiting to open the door for you as you walk into this beautiful bohemian styled lobby. One thing that stands out as you walk through the looby looking at the decoration there's no traditional countertop for check in. As you pass the elevators you notice two desk on both sides of the lobby where you are greeted by an hotel associate. Each desk has two chairs in front of it to relax as you give them your name and information. I thought this was very different, very unique, hotels should really do away with the countertop this makes it more personalized. Somewhat relaxing.The room that we reserved was absolutely beautiful, except for the chandelier over the bed and the two lights in the bathroom area over the sink. They were hideous. They were made out of seashells. In some weird way it seemed as if somebody dipped the lights in seashells and glue. They actually look somewhat scary. But the sitting area had a large chair for two people to cuddle up in and look out over the river through our large picture view window, you can't get any more romantic than that. The walk in shower that was very nice. I would rate the room 9 out of 10. The restaurant was nice we ate right beside one of their many openings to watch everyone walk up the cobblestone Road. Not to leave out we also enjoy the boats on the river as they passed us for the Thanksgiving Christmas parade. They were about 30 some old boats with Christmas lights going back and forth up and down the river. Another added romantic treat.We spent one night here, and found this hotel to be charming, although a bit pricey. I guess the great location can demand that, though.We found the staff to be very guest-attentive and very service-oriented. The room was very comfortable and spacious, although I've got to admit having a room with the toilet just a foot from the outside wall is a rather unusual layout, especially when you have a view of the riverfront, and people walking along it have a view of you. Oh well, if you're not bashful, it's not a problem.The only fault I could find with the hotel is the rooftop bar, where it is very difficult to find seating, especially for four. The entire bar area is very noisy, and as someone else noted, the music does not really flow well--it's almost like the DJ is switching from '80's to R&amp;B to C&amp;W to Grunge (not really that bad, but you get the idea).The location is truly great--get off the elevator at the 1st level, and you're at the riverfront, or get off at the Lobby Level (4th floor), and you're right on West Bay St. one block from Bull.The art throughout the hotel is very interesting, although it won't appeal to everyone. Reservations can be made through Marriott, FWIW.Nice hotel, just not quite as cool as it thinks it is. Although at random intervals you will see Forest Gump sitting in lobby waiting for a tour bus. Everyone on the staff was excellent. Very friendly, courteous, helpful. The restaurant wait staff was really great especially at breakfast.The room is very nice but just a bit overdone like every other Bohemian I've stayed at. The bathroom is very nice and the bed was comfortable. I don't know who made the call on the crustacean light fixtures but someone should have stopped them. I kept waiting for some damn sea creature to crawl out of the one above the bed. The room was also really humid even with the AC running colder than ideal.We had drinks at the roof top which was a pretty cool area. We ate several meals at the restaurant and they were all good but not amazing.The main downside is you pretty much have to valet your car and they park it off site. So on top of valets driving your car, something I'm not a fan of, it takes about 20 minutes to get the car brought around. It's also $30 a day which seems quite high for the area. Maybe it was bad timing but every time we tried to park in the nearby public garage it was full.Loved this hotel. Very friendly staff, good restaurant, cool rooftop bar. Huge bathrooms in room, very comfortable beds. Good location on the river. Love the way this hotel is decorated- beautiful paintings hang all over. Would definitely stay here again.The five star review is based solely on the front desk employee Heather, who literally saved our trip.  I did not stay at this location, but rather stayed at their sister property The Mansion on Forsyth.  When I arrived at The Mansion on a Sunday morning there was no concierge on duty, and would not be one available until Tuesday (the last day of my stay).  I took a short trip to Savannah with my sister for quick birthday getaway.  I arrived in Savannah with no set plans, except planning on working with the concierge to book tours and restaurant reservations.  The front desk employee at The Mansion offered to help in the concierge's absence, but to be honest did not provide very helpful tips.  On a whim, I approached Heather at the front desk of The Bohemian and explained my dilemma.  She sat down with us for 20 minutes and planned an awesome trip.  She used to work at The Olde Pink House and gave us a few tips, and filled us in on the folklore of the historic location.  She picked great restaurants, and booked us some really enjoyable tours.  Her recommendations completely turned our trip around.  If I return to Savannah, I would stay at this location.  Aside from the awesome staff (Heather), the location is in the middle of the action.  While The Mansion is gorgeous it is an older, more conservative vibe.  The Bohemian is funky and hip, and dare I say bohemian?  We also enjoyed dinner one night at the restaurant, which is right on the riverwalk.  The food was very good, and scenery was great.  If you stay at this hotel, be sure to ask for Heather when looking for restaurant or tour recommendations.We really wanted to love this place but it just didn't happen.  Based on the reviews and the price we were looking forward to a luxuriousness long weekend but were disappointed.We were traveling with another couple and we both arrived to the hotel late morning.  It's complacently expected that arriving that early that rooms wouldn't be ready.   The other couple had upgraded to a suite and we had a standard king room on the river front.  What was disappointing about check in was that while our room was ready by 2:30 the other couple's wasn't until about 4:30.  This was really unfortunate for two reasons..1. one the other couple was ill and really needed to lie down and 2. there is precious little seating in the lobby so we couldn't all sit together and wait for the suite.Now let's talk service, while friendly it certainly isn't exceptional as one would expect for a hotel of level.  Not only did housekeeping fail us with check in they continued to fail the three days that we were there.  They consistently got to the suite so late in the day that we were already back from sightseeing for the day and looking for a little rest before heading out to dinner and the suite wasn't made up yet.  On top of that when we phoned down to the desk and asked that have housekeeping come make up the room, housekeeping never got the message.The views from the riverside are fantastic and it's really cool to watch the huge barges go by.  The standard rooms are pretty typical hotel rooms with comfortable beds and good TVs.  They are not exceptional by any means though.  The bathrooms again are nice but nothing really special.  FYI no tub just a shower.  The layout in the suite is strange and though on the river side did not have a balcony.  All in all we were happier that we had the balcony than the bit of extra square footage that the suite provided without the balcony.Wasn't impressed with the rooftop bar.   Waited forever to get a drink and she never asked if I wanted to see a menu.   The gentleman next to me asked for glass of cab and how long it had been open.   She said a few days ago but it is still good.   He said since there isn't much left would you mid opening a new bottle.   Little did she know I would have asked for the same glass after that bottle was opened.   She would not open it.   Horrible service.  She had no idea way was going on and who was next in line etc..    Not sure of this falls under the hotel or the bar.    The hotel should be responsible for making all guest experiences awesome. There are way to many other choices.  The only reason I came to check this out is because my best friend wants to get married and this hotel was on her list.    All I can say is NEXT!Reviewing the rooftop bar/club.  Crowded as hell on a Saturday night, and very little organization amongst the bartenders.  The DJ was terrible, and could not mix two songs together if he tried.  Train wreck after train wreck.  And what was up with his wedding party DJ setup?  The music can barely be heard outside of the bar area.  Wack.Drinks were over-priced and service was insanely slow.  No bargains to be had here.The hotel staff outside of the rooftop bar were very friendly, and extremely helpful when we enlisted them to help us find La Chica's missing cell phone, so because of that, I'm adding an extra star.  Otherwise, this would have been a 'meh' experience.Long overdue in writing this review, but just signed up for Yelp and am still so unhappy over our experience at the hotel in July 2015. We were traveling with our one year old on this trip so a crib was crucial. Due to this we requested a crib at the time of our reservation, called a week before to ensure we would have a crib, and it was the first thing we mentioned upon check in. At check in we were told a crib was not on hand but they were calling around to sister properties and would have one up to us within an hour. Six hours later (and multiple trips and calls to the front desk), we came back to the room with a message from Alex saying they were unable to obtain a crib for us and that was about it. They offered no alternative options and no apology. My husband is a platinum Marriott customer and immediately called the Platinum customer service line in front of the front desk staff. Magically, a crib appeared from behind a door in literally one minute (an hour after our daughters bedtime). The fact that we had to complain up the corporate ladder and my husband had to threaten to take his 100+ nights a year of business elsewhere to get minimal customer service was appalling. We have always had positive experiences with Marriott, but were majorly unimpressed with this location based on customer service alone.","We just returned from Savannah and our second stay at The Bohemian Hotel. I still love this hotel, but I have to say I was a bit turned off by the fact that the make up mirror was so filthy - full of the previous guest's zits. Disgusting. I had called housekeeping and asked them to clean it. When I returned after our day out, it was still dirty eventhough our room had been serviced. I called them again, reported this and left for a walk. Upon our return, it had been cleaned to the best of their ability. I cannot for the life of me understand someone that can afford 300 to 500 per room, how they do not wipe the mirror when done with it and how housekeeping could have missed this multiple times. I love The Bohemian and the proximity to everything, but this really grossed me out. This time we averaged about $300 per night. Is it too much to ask for cleanliness? The water pressure was better this time around and the view of the river and watching the cargo ships was amazing. I am debating whether The Bohemian gets a return visit from me or if I am moving on... with a couple of new boutique hotels that have recently opened, I have choices to make.Stayed here over the last week of Dec 2014 through Jan 2 2015. This hotel is in an excellent location and the service was superb. Yes the room decor is eclectic but it's a hotel not something you are going to live with forever. We had a corner room overlooking the historic district. Being a corner room it was quite large it had a couple club chairs and ottoman. The shower had excellent water pressure and the sink area was super spacious. We had breakfast daily in River Rock and lunch once. Went up to Rocks on the Roof a couple times. Make sure you enjoy the views from all sides. Food was very good. We walked everywhere from this location. It was a great hotel to be in New Years Eve. Easy to walk to the celebration but not too noisy when the thousands continued to leave around. 2 AM.Beautiful location, great views, absolutely atrocious service.  ATROCIOUS.  We came for pre-dinner drinks and again for a night cap after a party for a wedding.  Service was slow/sluggish and orders were wrong.  Little did we know that this was just the tip of the iceberg.  We asked for our tab 3 times, then when our waitress showed no desire to bring them after so many requests (she kept walking past our table without making eye contact), we went outside to find our waitress (Ranay) flapping her gums to plead for our tab, then we waited another 25 minutes for our server (who charged us 18 percent gratuity and thus didn't give a damn).  We were given wrong tabs almost an hour after we requested them.  One of them had a previous customer's bill with $11 cash in it.  We kindly pointed this out instead of pocketing it, and then had to wait another 15 minutes to wait on her to fix it (no apologies).  Won't be back, wish it had even remotely competent service because it has a lot I potential.  Can't remember the last time I saw this much lethargy and apathy.   Lamps are gorgeous (oyster shells) but nothing else is any good.  Go to any other place nearby instead!(this experience was in July 2012 but neglected to post until now)This is our third time staying at the hotel, and I hate to say it but the service during this stay was substandard. Service at the restaurant was horrifically slow. Housekeeping did not clean our room the first night we stayed and so expected a cleaned room the following day but sadly we were mistaken. nope.nothing...really? I called down and they said that we had to allow them until 6:00 to get the rooms cleaned. Um, No! I used to love this hotel but I'm afraid the love affair might be over.We were looking forward to a comfortable stay but were quickly disappointed. The carpet in our room had so much ""freshener"" in it that it gave me a headache. My dog refused to even set a paw on it. Must have had even a worse headache! Noise in the room from some mechanical equipment and the hallways were dark and musty. Our room felt less than clean, and the bathroom was separated from the room with a curtain! Would not stay there again.What better way to celebrate a birthday than a roadtrip! It was my first visit to the historic city of Savannah. We cashed in some hard-earned Marriott points for two nights at the lovely Bohemian Hotel. The corner suite featured floor-to-ceiling windows on two walls, plush leather armchairs and cool accents like an oyster shell chandelier over the bed and a driftwood floor-lamp. When we entered, there was a jazz CD playing, Bohemian branded and available for sale. Great musical selections.Staff was professional and courteous at all times. They are well-trained, and do their best to make guests feel comfortable and welcome. I agree with another reviewer that the Platinum credit of $10 per day per room comes up short in comparison with other properties that don't have a concierge level.My husband and I stayed a different hotel - the Andaz- which was great but were steered here by our bartender at our hotel. He guided us to the cotton sail for an AMAZING sunset and then suggested going to the Bohemian for dinner and drinks.... He was right. The food at the Bohemian was amazing and our server Grant did a GREAT JOB. VERY attentive and answered all of our  questions. He was a great guy- great service. Nice place, great view. We would def return for their amazing shrimp dish- we ordered a second plate it was so good. Getting a couple of their apps to share was a perfect dinner for us!This is the only the second Autograph collection property I've experienced. The first was the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. I can officially say that 100% of the Autograph Collection properties I've stayed at are exceptional. Pros: - Fantastic bathrooms; Jacuzzi tub is ridiculous (get the corner room) - Exceptional decor in the rooms - Great location - Excellent service - Solid rooftopCons: - Weak water pressure in the bathroom sinks - Gym is tiny - Platinum benefit: $10 room credit per day (for 2 guests) for breakfast is a bit lameRooftop bar is great, dancing, good drinks and apps.The views are great, nice to be able to walk outside and get away from the music, crowd etc. at times.  Went there three times during our stay in SavannahI plan on going back next time in town, maybe stay at the hotel.This place definitely has a great bar on top. Take the elevator to the roof and enter the best view of Savannah's night scene. Cocktail dresses and bonfires on a roof! What more can a single man ask for? The river's sparkling lights stretch out over the panoramic view with a breeze that can't be felt street level. Drinks are made with a smile and poured just right; no skimping at this fine establishment. Check it out!This was a great place to hang-out...definitely a fun place in Savannah.The hotel itself is chic and modern, but still very relaxed and casual.  The rooftop area was lively...I will say that it seemed to try to be all things to all people: there was a live band, a cool setting and a TV for watching sports...I guess whatever you're into, you'll find it here.My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Savannah and stayed here. We couldn't have been happier. The rooms were very nice, uniquely designed and service was great. You couldn't ask for a better location if you want access to everything in the historic district. It's located right in the middle of river and bay streets so it's a short walk to just about anything you'd want to see or do downtown. Definitely recommended for anyone wanting to stay in the area.I attended the bar expecting a wonderful roof top experience. However, I was assaulted by some rowdy patrons and I asked for the ones responsible to be kicked out. Instead, they were allowed to stay. The food and environment are amazing but I never expected the general manger to allow me to be accosted and the person responsible to stay at the establishment. I will never return!The two stars are for the location and the fabulous decor. The valet, room service and rooftop bar staffs were wonderful and attentive - and we would give them 5 stars. But the lack of more stars are for the generally pathetic service - which I will qualify up front. There are two staff (concierge) that were incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and made an effort to follow through on questions/requests. I wish I could remember the women's names. But the other rotating concierge were so lackluster, so seemingly apathetic - or perhaps untrained, that we just had to laugh at the constant comedy of poor customer service. The best description we could come up with is that the concierge staff felt like kids whose parents were out of town for the weekend, and they just really didn't care what happened.But thank you to the staff that was friendly, courteous and attentive. We loved Savannah and will definitely be back - but not at the Bohemian.When walking into the hotel there was no one to greet us or open the door. I hadn't driven to the hotel as I live in Savannah and was out for the evening and on a whim decided to check out the hullabaloo of the Bohemian as I have stayed at the Mansion of Forsyth Park and just fell in love. My partner and I meandered into the lobby looking for someone to help us. I was told that the computer system wasn't working and that if i wanted to reserve a room I should call this 1-800 number that was given to me on the brochure. There were two people in the lobby both seemingly perplexed by the computer system error.  I called the 1-800 number provided still a little unsure why one of the people in the lobby couldn't have just called the number and made the reservation for me as was the service I feel would have been exemplified the Kessler brand. Nonetheless, I called the line, made the reservation for a room that had a tub in it, river view, king sized bed. When I realize where our room is we have to take the elevator down from the lobby as our room was on the second floor. Upon arriving in the room was excited by the decor and the layout of the room. Enjoyed the decor and the bedding,  really loved that you could access your Netflix account via room television. Paying more for a river view room that you can't enjoy because the windows need to stay pulled unless you want EVERYONE on the street to see you certainly felt like a rip off though.When my partner got into the tub for a relaxing soak she turned the jets on only to be SPRAYED with water, the jets are set to start on the highest level of power compared to starting on the lowest level and then you can gradually adjust the jets to be stronger if you desire. At this point we were laughing but honestly, I felt extremely frustrated. As I got out of the tub I realized that one of the light bulbs in the bathroom chandelier was MISSING. not burnt out, not dim but completely MISSING. Once again, at a price point of a fine hotel, that was not what I was expecting nor what I had experienced with other fine hotels.Perhaps the most nit picky, but alas most inconvenient aspect of our room was that all the light fixtures in the main room, less one desk lamp, were all connected to a SINGLE light switch with no dimmer! The halogen light for the painting in our room on the same light switch as the chandelier as the same as the wall sconces. What a horrible oversight! There are so many things that I enjoy about fine hotels and one of them is how in tune the builders and designers are when making the rooms, they give all the thought to details. Care for how the guest would interact in the room seemed not to be a forethought. Overall the room was completely unsatisfying. I left in the morning after being awoken by the house keeping staff who apparently had a hub right next to my room because at 7 AM there were a group of voices talking loud enough to wake me.My partner and I enjoy staying at fine hotels and have stayed at many fine hotels throughout the country and none, NONE were as disappointing as The Bohemian in Savannah.Just stay at the Mansion on Forsyth Park and forget all about the Bohemian.Hands down best hotel I've ever stayed at. Amazing customer service, food, and location. If you're staying in Savannah this is it. Second is the other Kessler property, Mansion on Forsyth. Stellar.Bonus:  Both are two of the FEW pet friendly hotels in historic Savannah.The staff is exceptional   The housekeepers did a wonderful job and the bell men were most helpful. Dan, a transplant from Maine, was very helpful. Room service was quick and brought by a very cheerful young lady.BUT. The decor was quite different. Perhaps the decorator was trying to replicate a pirate's ship. The velvet headboard was a little too much and glass bathroom door awkward.This is for the rooftop bar. Food is delicious and drinks are priced accordingly but this is a bit pricey in general. However it is a very nice and chic place. They even have an outdoor area to hang and look over savannah. Service is good and they are very quick. Enjoyed our time here.WOWWWWWWW!So super ultra extra swanky!The Man-Friend and I had decided to take a random day trip from New Orleans and see where we wound up. 10ish hours later we had made it to Jacksonville, and not being particularly fond of North Florida, decided to head toward Savannah, a city with which I have had a fairly consistent love affair for quite a few years.We scrambled to find a room at the last minute, late at night, and we were looking for something a few steps above a Holiday Inn....Holy Crap did we get lucky. The Bohemian Hotel is easily the swankiest most luxurious and decadent hotel I have EVER stayed in. We checked in around 11pm and met Lavernitra, who was so gracious. With a few magic keystrokes she upgraded us to the super ultra fancy pants corner room, and sent up a bottle of wine and a cheese plate. The room itself is almost overwhelming. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the river, flat screen TV with Netflix and internet, soft jazz playing when we walked in,  Jacuzzi tub for 2, velvet headboard, and a CHANDELIER MADE OUT OF OYSTER SHELLS! We slept like ageing decadent rockstars. Woke up in the morning to the most delicious Eggs Benedict I have ever had, delivered to my bed, and the wonderful room service lady who helped me make math on the check as I cannot count past 3 before I have coffee.We spent the day exploring Savannah like tourists, which was wonderful, and returned to the Bohemian determined to find somewhere special for dinner.Lo and behold, the ever helpful, always friendly Lavernitra is at the desk again! She recommended restaurants, made us reservations and sent us on our way.Dinner (Vic's on the River) and adventures after, were awesome y'all, but that's a totally different review. Lavernitra (seriously, does she ever sleep?) checked us out in the morning and sent us on our way.Stay at this hotel. It is GORGEOUS. clean, friendly, accommodating and luxurious. And when you check in, see if Lavernitra is working during your stay, because she is MAGIC.This hotel is by far the best hotel I've stayed at.  Great river view - apparently Savannah river is a very active commerce waterway with huge container ships floating by.  As mentioned by others, staff is professional, courteous and extremely helpful.  Other than its great location, hotel itself is several steps above what you'll typically find at other Marriott hotels.  Everything from toiletries to room deco... it was just outstanding.  I hear people complaining about price but honestly, the same type of hotel in NYC would cost at least $600/night.  IMO its a great value for what you get.","Very nice, eclectic vibe in a town notable for historic preservation. The rooms are big, clean and super comfortable. Free wifi and very close to everything that you want to walk too. The staff re very helpful too. I left my wedding ring behind and they found and shipped it to me. The river is primarily commercial and also houses many tourist water holes. Rooms along this side have the potential to get noisy from drunks and ship traffic, caution when booking.It was our anniversary week and my husband surprised me with a trip full of activities.  He chose this hotel based on the level but think we would have been happier at a holiday inn.  We arrived early and called for an early check-in (early as in 2pm) and said ""they could not promise an early check-in.""  An odd response but no big deal at that point.  We chose to walk around and shop until our room was ready after four.    Upon arriving, frustration set in. Parking was a nightmare which proved quite convenient for the wallets of the valet workers.  Check-in took a very long time and we were denied a king bed.  We paid full price, it was our anniversary and reservations were made well in advance.  I did not understand this.  Again they said, they couldn't guarantee bed types.  Really?  I'd like to know what you couldGuarantee.  Yeah, that's what I wanted to know! To compensate for the bed, they decided to move us up a floor..  Ok, that would make sense if we had a view of the river - but we didn't.  We moved up to have a better view of the street.  Cool.  After getting ready for the night we went downstairs to receive our car to make our dinner reservations.  We waited 30 minutes for valet to get our car which caused us to be late to dinner that was .5 miles away. Because we were late to dinner we were also late to the musical in which we had tickets.  None of that would have even made me that upset had the valet worker not blamed the tardiness on me.  After waiting for 25 minutes I remembered something in the room I could grab - not a necessity but something to pass the time because we knew the worker was nowhere near having our car ready.  When I came back down, his boss was there watching.  He said to us, ""I know you have been waiting on her so now I will go get your car.""  Wow.  Most of this could have been overlooked on its own, but these mistakes combined with the price you pay to stay at this hotel seem unforgivable.  It got two stars for unique decor and lighting but that isn't even amazing.We will not be going back and if you decide to try it for the bohemian experience, be prepared to be denied lot of service for a high price.Location, location, location.  This is the place to stay!  The back of the hotel is on West Bay Street where you leave your car with valet and enter the hotel lobby, the front is on River Street.  The front desk is in need of a shape up.  They have two desks with cozy chairs where they are supposed to sit on their behinds.  When we arrived, only one was occupied.  And there was a line waiting for some attention.  Apparently, their check in procedure is a bit too complicated to be handled like a normal hotel.  When we finally got our turn, we didn't realize it, but we crowded in front of some gentlemen who were patiently waiting.  Shouldn't the desk person know who is next?  Well, and of course our room was not ready for our 4 pm check in.  Bumbling along, we were told that the bell hop would temporarily hold our luggage and the bags would be transported to our room as soon as it was available.  And we would receive a magic phone call to say that our room was ready.  Also, we could not have our key until after the room was ready.  That's okay, we want to stop by and visit the inefficient front desk again.  Time is wasting, you fool and we have lots to see and do in Savannah.  We don't want to spend any more time here with you!We spent some time in the amazing hotel roof top bar.  We then spent time walking and shopping along River Street.  Yes, it took that long to get our room ready.  And of course, when we got to our room, no bags.The hotel is not for everyone.  My bf thought the hotel hallways were dark and spooky.  I loved the dimmed halls and the crazy beads strung on dim light fixtures.  Our room was awesome, huge, really big, lots of room to move.  Trendy furnishings, the bed had an 8 foot tall headboard, partially clad in tufted velvet  The bath was open to the room and the shower was probably more than 8 feet deep.  The tiling inside it is beautiful, kind of like wood-look slats.  The water closet was in a closet.  With beautiful dark wood big slats plantation shutters.  The bath sink scones were seashell covered as was the huge chandelier about the bed.  Our room was a corner room, so we had a river view lounging area complete with a monster chaise with leather look covering.  You could close the area off when not in use by pulling closed heavy red crushed velvet drapes.Although our room was across the hall from the gym, also near the crushed ice machine and facing the party atmosphere of River Street, the room was very quiet.  When we entered our room, the Bose was playing good tunes.  Loved all the special touches of our room.  I can't say enough about how great our room was.  Another thing I liked, you need your hotel room key to use the hotel elevator.  That was a much appreciated security feature.  However, I have to say, I think Savannah is a safe and welcoming city.Another great thing about this hotel is the valet staff.  They seemed to double team us when we arrived and were so welcoming and friendly.  And they happily readied our car to send us off, getting us bottled water for our road trip.Why just three stars?  The check in is not really forgivable.  I would think that most hotel check-in's occur around 4 pm.  And they weren't staffed properly for that.  This Kessler Hotel is now under the Marriott umbrella of hotels and they should function as that.  The front desk was not only inefficient, they were also not friendly.  Plus, our room wasn't ready.  Mr. Marriott, please stop by and teach these people how to serve and treat the guests.  Another missing star for billing.  We were overcharged for our room.  Breakfast was included with our stay and of course, they charged us for our breakfast.  I even noted on our receipt that breakfast was included.  In over ten years of staying pretty much exclusively with Marriott, I have never had a billing issue of any sort.  Congrats to this team for being the first.  Sure, calling to get the credit took less that a few minutes.  But, I will have to follow up to double check my statement.  But I should not have to worry about such nonsense.  Would I stay here, again?  As much as I love this place, probably not.We selected the Bohemian for our birthday weekend in Savannah as I love all things eclectic/bohemian  - and I found the website images enticing.  I usually stay across the river at the Westin - but chose to try a different venue and the Bohemian Hotel is relatively new to the area.Even though we knew it was a boutique hotel, hence the limited amenities, we were hoping for a much better overall experience.Positive Attributes:  I love the decor in the rooms and the jacuzzi that opens up to the bedroom is a nice touch.  It is also well located on River Street and the Rocks on the Roof bar is a popular hangout for young partygoers. HOWEVER, we were a trifle disappointed with the speed and quality of service and the cleanliness of the room (I had to ask for an item to be replaced immediately upon arrival as it obviously had not been cleaned) was below par for a hotel of this caliber. My husband, who hardly ever complains, was not happy that you have to personally join Netflix in order to watch any new releases and was less than impressed with the food service.Unfortunately, the lovely jacuzzi was not enough to make us pay those rates to return to this hotel.Checked into the Bohemian hotel on a Sat evening and stayed three nights. The 5 star rating is for the level of service. It was excellent - from the valet, to the bellman, the front desk staff and guest services. The decor is not luxurious - more fun and eclectic. Be aware - the rooms are rather dark, which is great for sleeping. I only wish the bathroom was brighter - important for applying make up. The king size bed was comfortable and we had a river view room. It was fun seeing the massive cargo ships go right by our window. The location can't be beat. It's right on the river and close to City Market. TIP: save the $25 daily valet rate and park  in the public garage directly across the street for $10 a day. Better yet, go to the visitor's center and get a parking pass and pay just $7 a day. We learned this on our last day. Gym is small, but adequate. Has a treadmill, an elliptical, bike and free weights.Highly recommended. Clean and modern rooms. Friendly and courteous service. Loved everything about this place. I can't wait to come back!Gorgeous. I could have moved into my room. Better yet, the bathroom. I kept finding excuses to go in. Seriously. Was that beautiful. Rooftop bar was great. Nice vibe, perfect weather the night I went. Beer and cheese plate were spot on...sugar/clove covered grapes anyone? Mmmm...Breakfast the next morning, eggs Benedict with crab and asparagus - and a side of grits- was amazing. It wouldn't have killed our server to smile - or attempt it- though. I guess she felt differently. Upon checkout, the valet handed each of us a chilled bottle of water for our drive. Nice touch. If you appreciate great decor and architectural finishes, stay here!I like this hotel!  I travel on business quite a bit and saved all my Fairfield Inn points to stay at this property.  We got a river front room and the view is fantastic.  Like a previous reviewer said, I could move into the bathroom, oyster shell chandeliers are too cool.  The valet parking here is a bit pricey at $25 per night so remember you can park free at the meters on the weekends.A lot of the poor reviews seem to come from the service at the Rocks, the lounge on the roof top.  It's a typical noisy yet pricey bar and doesn't have the elegant atmosphere of the hotel or its rooms.  We were up there for sunset and the place was pretty busy, not many seats and the wait staff was running to keep up with the clientele.  I think if you go just expecting a bar with a nice view rather than an elegant retreat you won't be disappointed.Very pretty hotel and a lovely spot for pictures on the roof top.  Decorated beautifully and romantically!!  Friendly staff. Perfect location for convenience to restaurants and shopping.  Didn't care for the restaurant, but liked the rooftop bar. Dog friendly.My husband and I went to the rooftop restaurant to bring in the new year we had a blast, but it got off to a little rocky start. We were starving because we waited to just eat a late dinner there. The bartender gave me a menu and asked for a CC, then refused to take the order and told me a server would do it (which a bouncer said was unusual) we got there about 930 and there were no seats. Finally about an hr later we stumbled on seats and ordered. Happy we didn't leave because the food was amazing! My hubby had chicken and waffles and I had quesadilla and both were not typical, they exceeded expectations. Would def return on a visit back to savannah.Had to leave after we got seated as nobody greeted us, brought us waters, or gave us a full number of menus in 20 minutes!  This is not what you would expect from a Kessler Hotel.  My wife and I got married at their other hotel and always held them in high regard. This spot had worse service than a Best Western buffet. I haven't had a worse experience in 10 plus years.Great hotel, nice bathrooms .... Right at the river... The room was clean, the bed were comfortable, our room has the view of the river and it was pretty... Right at the historical area of the town ... We walked to the olde pink house ... Great restaurant to visit.Not terribly welcoming upon arrival, but room and hotel itself were great.  Very interesting design in and out of the room.  Rooftop is nice feature.  Staff up there were very good.  Few food items were as well.This is, like the Mansion at Forsyth Park, a Kessler property. That goes a long way in explaining a lot: the interior, while sleek and modern, suffers from the unique Kessler/Savannah aesthetic (which you'll also find in SCAD's Gryphon Tea Room--so it is not limited to Kessler alone). This approach to interior design aims for chic but, with its ample use of the color orange, moody low-light, and organic yet often dead botanical matter (like the giant ball of thorns in the dining room), winds up looking like a Martha Stewart Living magazine's Halloween issue. Seriously. If you want something not exactly goth but playfully dark, you might like it . . .  kinda. My main concern is that this motif will seem dated in less than a decade (700 Drayton and the Gryphon Tea Room both already are screaming that they were decorated circa 2005). The location is loud, yes. It is in walking distance from many of River Street and Bay Street's bars, which will be great for some guests. The front street, Bay Street, is very busy at all hours and where Bay Street and MLK intersect is one of Savannah's most dangerous corners for traffic accidents, so be forewarned. Also, this is a touristy neighborhood but once you go west of MLK down Bay and onto either West Bay or Indian Street you get into a sketchy, industrial, neighborhood. You need to keep your wits about you and stay well to the eastern side of MLK at night. I add this due to the other reviews talking about safe places to park one's car and due to the general security concerns in Savannah, and I say this as someone who lived in the city for a number of years.The building itself is nice, and the Kessler Group is trying to do clearly innovative things so that should be admired, but the results are lackluster. This is not to say it's not a cute or fun place, but your happiness here will be predicated on what you expect of Savannah in the first place. Take a long look at the Bohemian and other options.Unique decor, beautiful rooms, great costumer service, great people watching, convenient to about everything ....  Roof top bar is an awesome view of the river and amazing sunsets. Loved our experience.We stayed at the Bohemian for just one night. It was a bit hard to find the entrance to the front of the hotel when you're driving since you will probably pass it the first time, it's not readily marked.When you first walk into the hotel you know you're not in a typical hotel. The people checking you in are behind desks, not ""hotel"" desks but big wooden office type desks. We checked in at 3:30 but couldn't get into our room because they said they were still cleaning. We could have checked out bags and roamed the area but we wanted to freshen up first so we waited. On or about 4 PM the clerk said our room was ready and we went up.There are three elevators in the hotel however only two of them go the floors with rooms and you need your room card to get onto the floor. We were on the top floor. The whole place looked very posh which mean dark lighting, dark carpets and some funky stained glass wall decorations.When we first got into the room there was a crib in the room, yikes! Not for us so we pushed it into the hallway.The room was big enough, king size bed, large bathroom with HUGE tub and a separate shower and toilet that was separated by glass doors (more on this later). There was a window that separated the bathroom to the bed area but you could close the shutters so you had more privacy in the bathroom.The bed area consisted of a bed a desk that made up almost one side of the room and a padded bench which was in front of the window. The bed was very comfortable except we could hear a vibrating/humming noise when we were on it. We couldn't tell if it was coming from another room (filling up the Jacuzzi?) or the roof. The TV was also connected via some sort of computer system that you could use the remote as a mouse and scan channels or websites.I was a bit creeped out by the ceiling light fixtures in the room. Both in the bathroom and the bedroom there were chandeliers but the light fixtures were encrusted with oyster shells, I mean, totally covered. While at first interesting, it sort of became creepy.Back to the bathroom, the toilet was in its own room/closet which had a glass door. If you were sitting on the toilet or in the shower for that matter, anyone else in the room (if you didn't close the shutters between the bathroom and bed area) could see you.The products they provided were really nice and I really enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner. They had a gym here but we didn't get to try it out however, they didn't have wifi in the rooms, or at least we didn't. We could access the wifi in the restaurant or near the front desks.The location of the hotel was excellent too. It was along the water and the hotel had a restaurant in the bottom and a roof top bar. You were in close walking distant to other restaurants too.While we only stayed one night, we would definitely stay here again if we return to Savannah.Nice room, very Funky (As in hip gran-pa) nice bar both top and bottom. River view bot OMG are they proud !!!!  Thank goodness I was on business.My bad...this is a brand new hotel. Guess I wasn't paying attention to the construction after too many dirty martinis at Rocks bar last night.Fantastic rooftop bar with great drink selection. Cool vibe and decor. Would definitely recommend this spot and will stay here on our next trip to savannah !Very nice hotel with a great view of the river, well-located and cool interior decorating. The room was really nice with a fantastic shower. I really liked the small sitting room with a view of the river (the room is one room with a alcove for a sitting area and another for the bathroom fixtures).I used Marriott points and did not have to pay, but I may have a slightly different opinion if I had to fork up $700+ for the room. It was great, but not that great.","The hotel is beautiful.  It is very trendy and in a great location if you want to enjoy walking around the city.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  I'm giving the Bohemian 3 stars because of the service.  There is absolutely no guest service.  I don't think one staff member spoke a word to us during our stay at this hotel which I found really surprising.  I expected at least a hello?  We did have a few staff members brush past us as if we were in their way and annoying them but that was the only interaction.  I would try the Planters Inn for a historic stay and the Westin for a large hotel with a lot of amenities.My husband and I went for the weekend and I was extremely disappointed since the arrival to the Bohemian Hotel. HATE the decor looks very cheap, never saw an ice maker with white Christmas light, service is very bad, view nothing to comment about I wanted to leave the hotel immediately after our arrival. Menu both ""restaurants"" limited and nothing exceptional. I will never come back.Let me preface this review with the fact that I have not stayed at the hotel itself. My love for this hotel is the public rooftop bar that overlooks the river. It's one of my favorite places to take a friend in Savannah for a quiet conversation and a good cocktail. It's bohemian-chic decor and top notch view make this a 5 star for me!Stayed here with my friend at the end of august.  it's a very cool hotel and the technology aspect is the best i have ever experienced... there is wi-fi and a tv that hooks up to the internet and netflix... it's very cool.the location of the hotel is stellar... the only negative is that it's VERY loud at night, so unless you are planning on bar hoping till late at night, you will probably be annoyed by the noise.speaking of bars, the hotel roof bar is apparently the place to be at night... which means a million of people coming in and out of your hotel- it was a zoo. you need a room key to get onto the hotel floors, but still, doesn't seem 100% safe.the decor is very different, very cool and definitely was luxurious.Amazing interior and rad staff! From Gavin at the rooftop bar, Lauren at the reception and Dan, who will greet you. Riverfront rooms have amazing sunrises and the room service breakfast was still hot when hit my mouth. Would recommend this to any hip friends.Not kid friendly or worth the high cost of double the other hotels we stayed at in the area.  Over $400/night, ouch.  Was not worth that.There's a few basic things I require of hotels I stay at, one of them being providing the type of room that guests reserve before they arrive, if you cannot handle this one basic tenet of hospitality, then you have no business being in business.Our rooms were confirmed via email, and when we actually arrived at the hotel we were told that the rooms we paid for were unavailable and that we would have to take a downgrade in accommodations, thankfully my father and brother got the room I reserved for them, however,The room I reserved was not the suite with balcony I had reserved, it was a much smaller, corner room with no balcony.When we tried to explain how ludicrous it was that we were not being provided with the rooms we had reserved and paid for, the staff took a very nonchalant attitude to the entire affair, calmly explaining to my family that the 'hotel was booked and these were the only rooms available.""What? I'm sorry but are we in some alternate dimension where hotel guests are given the wrong room and no refund? With absolutely no apology or visit from management to explain why the hotel changed our accommodations without alerting us before we arrived?There are so many wonderful bed and breakfasts and hotels in Savannah that it's easy to recommend pretty much anything else, including the Hyatt, which is located right next door.Unless you like arriving at your hotel without any confidence that the rooms you reserved are going to be the rooms provided to you then i recommend you stay away. Far away.I just got home from a wonderful girls trip to Savannah and I'm already thinking about when I can go back! We stayed at The Bohemian and had a lovely time. The hotel and rooms were absolutely beautiful and the staff was incredibly friendly. We were right in the middle of it all with Broughton Street, shopping and restaurants right around the corner. I would recommend a river view room. We got to open the drapes and watch the ships come in while we were getting ready to head out. I would also say that the hotel has not 1 but 2 great places to eat and have a few drinks. Rocks on the Roof was great at night - I loved sitting outside around the fire overlooking the river. And Rocks on the River became our place to grab some pre-dinner drinks. The bartenders were awesome. I'm not sure if this is a good thing (on my part), but after the first day they already remembered our drinks as soon as we walked in the door. All in all, we were extremely happy with our stay here.We received excellent service from the time the valet service directed us off the street, through check-in and luggage delivery. The rooms are chic, with all the amenities you'd expect for $300 per night. Mostly, I enjoyed the fact that the bed was comfortable and the room is clean. Easy access to all historic district sites and an attentive staff makes this hotel a winner for me. Like other reviewers, I'm top tier at other chains (Marriott, Hyatt, and Starwood). This hotels is right in line with W Hotels.Two star for the atmosphere and design. That's it. Overall I was not impressed in the least. I was actually let down compared to other hotels. I called guest services and asked if they had aspirin. Jessie said yes. I arrive at the front desk where another man tells me no they are out and if I want I can walk to the Marriott next door. Really? I guess I should've stayed there then!! Not only that but when I went to the Marriott to get some aspirin from their mini shop , I was told it closed at 10. Seriously guys! You sent me to a closed store. One that I shouldn't have had to go to open or closed. I was told if I was a guest that room service could have gotten it for me at the Marriott. Funny thing is I had a choice between the two and the price difference for the weekend was hundreds but I chose the bohemian because it was St Patrick's day and I wanted true luxury. Turns out I paid hundreds more for a loud ass roof top bar and some cheeky decorations. Fabulous.Absolutely loved this hotel. While it wasn't a traditional suite, the bathroom was GORGEOUS. We went to the bar upstairs for a drink and dessert, and I was very impressed. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will return.The hotel is pretty nice itself, the rooms are big and the beds are comfortable.  Having said that, when I pay for a expensive ""boutique"" hotel I expect SERVICE.  There's a cool rooftop bar and a decent restaurant on the first level.  Both are called ""Rocks"".  The atmosphere on the roof is very cool with nice views, and we went there 3 times, and 2 of the 3 times we waited at least 15 minutes before a server came to us.  As for the downstairs restaurant, the food is good, but again, the service sucked.  Every time we went to get a table, there was no host/hostess at the front. Wait 5 minutes for someone to notice you.  Then sit, wait another 5 minutes for someone to come to the table.  The thing that sets a hotel apart is service, and it is lacking at the Bohemian.As a final note, you have to valet park.  They park your car in their ""secure"" parking garage across the street, plus it costs $21 a night.  The valet attendant told me the garage was secured, when we checked out and they brought us our car, it had been broken into.  They stole a GPS unit, and messed up everything inside.  When I went to the front desk to complain, I received a comment ""oh, I'm sorry, but we're not responsible for the parking garage"".   Yet, they give you no other parking option.  Plus, they didn't even offer to pay for the parking fee.  This place tries to be nicer then they are.  Granted, it's a fairly new hotel, but overall I rate these guys are amateurs.I have enjoyed a meal at Rocks and drinks upstairs on the rooftop.  GREAT Happy Hour location for snacks and drinks.  The view is amazing and the service is great.  The food is wonderful at Rocks as well.  enjoy!Blew away my expectations.  This is a funky, hip hotel for people who appreciate high end design concepts, great service, and attention to details.  From the champagne check in to the bottled water check out, the staff should be commended on really taking service to the ""next level."". The room was spacious and modern, and the whole feel of the place was ""bohemian cool."". Perfectly located, although not easy to find by car (it's set back off the road).  We saw cargo ships cruising right past our widows.  Awesome.  Beds were comfy and the blackout curtains let us sleep.  Overall, my pick for Savannah in style.nice rooftop views but the upstairs kinda smelled like stale beer...The reservation said we could have two queens and a folding bed. Come to find after we arrive they cannot add the folding bed. Then we want a vending machine to purchase a soda and they send us next door to the Hyatt. Huh???? Room was comfortable and l liked the trendy tunes piped throughout...For our first time in Savannah we were very pleased with our choice of hotel.  We were considering the sister property, the Mansion on Forsyth, but we definitely were happy we chose this one based on the location.  We much preferred being on the river and so very close to City Market and walked to all of our restaurants and took turns strolling through town and along the river.   Plus, we took the free shuttle to the other property to explore beautiful Forsyth Park which was a bonus!  We had room # 600 which was a corner with a (VERY small balcony (they all are) as it is a boutique hotel.  Our room was quiet and just far enough away from the Roof top bar which was only noisy on Saturday but not too bad (we always bring earplugs on trips).  Again, our room was generally quiet.  Staff was very friendly but busy at times.  Don't rely on room service..so many walkable places for good food..especially breakfast.   We had breakfast in room one morning and it was mediocre at best. Decor is artsy..we thought it was chic.  Coffee maker in room features starbucks and it was good!  PS it is pet friendly but I have to say we NEVER ONCE even heard an animal let alone saw one.  We would definitely go back and try to get same room!Love the room and location...great view. The lounge is cool but pricey. Restraunt downstairs is nice for lunch or a brick oven pizza on the riverfront. As happy as I am with the rooms, they really are amazing, I am mystified on how the valet service can be so god awful. First time we went they brought our brand new BMW back with a door ding. They appologized but only after I pointed it out. The last time we were there the floor mat on the passenger side (again in the BMW) had standing water in it! I dumped it out of the car and the carpet was soaked. We brought this to their attention and they initially denied any responsibility. After getting a bit ""persistant"" they finaly admitted a valet had spilled an entire drink in our car! They ate the valet cost for our entire stay, and awarded us additional points to our account. Nice by the hotel staff, but I am not going to valet our car here next time. Ill pay to park at a city lot on my own.Wow! The food here is amazing this is definitely a m-u-s-t for any foodie visiting savannah!The absolute worst ... Should be called ""The Barbarian""  Loud music next door until 5 in the morning and security is like the Keystone Cop. Called front desk five times and never got resolved.  All the glitzy ""in"" carpet and BS doesn't mean squat if you're up all night. After all this, a really nice girl called the next day and adjusted our room rate for that night. Other than the sub-humans next door with their loud music and intolerable attitude, the hotel itself was very nice.","I stay in quite a few hotels and I'm tough to impress, but the Bohemian is definitely one of the nicer hotels in Savannah, and given the choice I would stay here again.  I also like the sister property the Mansion on Forsyth Park, but it's in nowhere as good of location as the Bohemian.  Everything in town is easily with in walking distance of the Bohemian where as you'll have a long walk (not fun in Savannah's hot summers) or you'll have to drive and try to find parking to go to places downtown if you stay at the Mansion.  I also like that both of these are part of Marriott Rewards.I was torn between a four and five start rating, but like I said I'm tough to impress.  I ended up in a great corner room with huge windows that let in tons of light.  They also let in a fair amount of noise from the street and parking lot, but that's probably not the fault of the hotel.  The room has some very unusual furnishings like two tall driftwood lamps and a chandelier made of stuck together seashells which are pretty cool for a hotel.  The shower and bathroom are also very cool and spacious.  I came back to my room to a cool CD playing in the Bose alarm clock.  The CD was for sale of course if you wanted to buy it and I seriously thought about it.  The rocks bar on the roof is very cool and definitely worth a visit even if you don't stay in the hotel.  The staff is very nice and very helpful.  I wanted to find a better gym (more on this later) and the staff tried hard to find one.  One other thing that I like about this hotel over the Weston is there is no hidden ""resort fee.""Now for what I wasn't impressed by.  The workout room here is tiny, with only a couple of treadmills, an elliptical, and exercise bike, and a small rack of dumbbells.  I went to two local gyms in town to work out and the best one I've found is Lava Fitness.  The TV had plenty of stations, but one annoying thing is this Roomlink box that sat on the desk.  It's kind of noisy and the staff's solution was to unplug it at night.  It's louder than my laptop and sounds like it has a hard drive and fan that run constantly.  Of course if you unplug it you have no TV, but then if you're watching TV you're probably not worried about the noise.  Turning the TV off with the remote or pushing the power button on the front will not turn it off.  The power button only turns it on once you plug it back in.  I found myself unplugging it each night or I had to listen to the thing run while I was laying in bed.I think I have a new favorite hotel in Savannah and like I said if given the chance, I'd gladly stay here again.UNBELIEVABLE five star service! Great prices on drinks, food, etc. Rooftop bar ROCKS! Rooms so comfy, only wish there was a tub. Tv operates horribly but didn't really care. Awesome hotel! MAKE SURE CONSTRUCTION IS FINISHED BEFORE RESERVING A RIVER FRONT ROOM. LOUD LOUD LOUD!!! Choose city view, it's much prettier anyway.Being from NY and staying in manhattan often I felt like I was at a boutique hotel. I Have to say that this hotel is clean and real nice.  The hotel is in the right location to see all of Savannah. Walking distance to it all. We where given a room on the river with a balcony. The service is impeccable,(chris never forgot our names) the roof top bar is really nice. The restaurant is really good as well. We where here to visit SCAD, and if my son is excepted this will be our hotel of choiceWe had a girls night out at the Bohemian. All seven of us had a fabulous, fun filled time  The food at the restaurant was good.  I had cheese fries, filet migon, and a very nice red wine. My filet came with a blue cheese sauce, it was delicious.  I tried the calamari and it was really good.  It was extremely tender, and was not greasy.  The calamari was the best I've ever had. The wine was full of flavor.  Our waiter was wonderful. He recommended the wine that I ordered.  We ordered creme brulee as a dessert.  I would have to give the creme brulee just an average rating. I didn't personally try any of the other desserts, but they looked really good.  Two of my friends ordered filet migon.  When they got their order it was undercooked, but our waiter quickly fixed the problem. The service was excellent. We made reservations in advance, and they put us in a wonderful spot for a group our size.  We had plenty of room to eat, but we weren't to spread out.  After our meal we headed up stairs to soak in the view and a few more drinks.  The view was great.   The drinks were good. And the service upstairs was wonderful.  I think this would also be a great spot for a romantic night out.This hotel was a disappointment.  Though it's highly rated, I just don't know why.  The service in the roof top bar is sad.  It took forever to get waited on.  And the bar on the bottom floor was so cold, we had to wear winter coats to stay comfortable (yes, really ... two other guests complained about the cold air in the bar, and took their food away so they, and their food, wouldn't freeze).  Oh -- if you want noise -- stay at this hotel.  If we had known about the noisy streets that sandwich the hotel, we would have picked another place.  Too bad you couldn't run the room A/C fan continuously to mask the outside noise.  The hotel decor is nice -- but it doesn't make up for the rest.  I won't stay here again.I have stayed previously at the Mansion on Forsyth Park and it is amazing.  This sister property get's about the same level of review for comfort and luxury.  It is a great location on the river and the room was quite comfortable.  Service was excellent, although a late checkout was only good until noon, I guess I can't complain about that.  Restaurant was very good and rooftop bar was very cool!!!  Awesome view!!!Very pet friendly!great hotel, great rooms, great location, friendly staff, all in all what you'd expect from this type of place.why 1 star?  they billed me twice.  i got two receipts on checkout, asked the front desk why, they said it was an error and not to worry.  i worried and checked my cc bill, and they billed me twice.  had to call them to get a refund.  un freakin acceptable.  in fact, may even be illegal.  if it wasn't for that, they would get 5 stars.  this is something you dont even expect from motel 6.  the manager was very nice when i called, fixed the problem right away, but again, not acceptable.Great Staff, Comfortable quiet room, Good Location, only complaint was Parking. (20 min to get your car and pricey). We stayed on the street side, sounds like the river side is noisey. We will be back.Gorgeous hotel.  Nice helpful staff.  Very creative decor and the rooms are exquisite.  The bathroom is gorgeous.  They have computer access from your flatscreen, sound system in the rooms, and comfy gorgeous beds.  Can't ask for much more.  On the riverfront, and walking distance to downtown.  Can't wait to return.We liked this hotel enough to go back for an unscheduled 2nd night on our return trip through Savannah. It's very modern, comfortable, a little goth (or is it Bohemian?) and to be specific, sexy. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. Unusual nice bathrooms. Very weird art and light fixtures. Door to balcony in our room w/nice view. We stayed on the river view side which is great. We didn't have as nice an experience the 2nd stay but I'd still go back. We were very disappointed that the room we liked so much and we reserved with a credit card was not available when we got back. Huh? After about 15 minutes of negotiations, we were provided a comparable nice room. We would NOT have gotten it though if we did not balk so that left us feeling irritated. Unfortunately, the air conditioner in the 2nd room (room 600) is as loud as a jet engine so we did not sleep well at all that night. The fan is set to blow too hard and it's crazy loud. We should have complained but after the lengthy negotiation just to get the room, we didn't have it in us, and we didn't notice until late that night after returning from dinner out. Get that AC fixed Bohemian! You have a nice place there but you tested our patience. And one last tip: I'm 6'1"" and the king bed was too short. How could that be? Turns out, the head board is 5 inches thick which makes the bed shorter! Just pull it away from the wall and you're set.Bathroom lights are nice but not functional for a man trying to shave or a woman trying to put on make up.  Room service was not good and screwed up an easy continental breakfast order- my wife's order was perfect though.  Also, for some reason hotel was filled with cousin eddie and his fam - I thought we were in the wrong hotel for a while.  The roof top bar is nice and great views but the DJ type of music is a total dis-service to the bar and the patrons.  They really should close it to non-hotel guests to maintain integrity.  The location of the hotel is nice and the furnishings and decorations are superb, they just need to work on the above things.  Will stay somewhere different next time for the amount of money I paid.","['totally', 'chill', 'place', 'relax', 'glass', 'wine', 'lite', 'bite', 'family', 'friends', 'service', 'great', 'along',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-savannah-harbor-golf-resort-and-spa-savannah,The Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort & Spa,4.0,$$$,126,"My Wife and I were in Savannah for one night as we drove to North Carolina.  As an SPG member we decided to give The Westin a try and we are extremely happy we did. To start the staff was fantastic.  I was a walking with no reservations and they went thru a lot of discount codes and even recommended I use the app to reserve a room.  I did end up using the app and was thrilled that the room was 10000 points. The location was great if you are looking for a convention hotel the convention center is walking distance as is the free ferry.  The ferry runs till midnight and takes you from the hotel to the center of downtown Savannah,  The room itself was great we had a golf side view.  The bed and room were very clean and it had a great rain shower.  We would definitely come back.The only thing we were not impressed by was the breakfast at the aqua star which was just ok and a little too expensive i think.Before coming into town, I called to make sure that the hotel had recieved my StarHot form and that everything was good to go for my reservation. Kieatta was a great help and she assured me that everything is good to go. She even asked me to revise my form and she printed it out for me. I was coming in from Atlanta, a 4 hour drive, in the snowy weather. I wanted to make sure that I was good to go when I got there. After speaking with her, I was so excited to visited a fellow SPG hotel.I love SPG. However, this hotel in particular is interesting. For me, its all about service. I used to work for a SPG hotel and still work in the hospitality business. I feel like I understand the ins and outs but still was very disappointed. I drove in through bad weather on Saturday from Atlanta, GA. I was tired, and just wanted to check into my room. I self-parked but in the cold weather, that walk seemed too long. When walking up the front door, the bell staff was outside. They did not smile, greet me, or anything. I was not acknowledged at all. I kept walking inside. I arrived at 1pm and was prepared for my room not to be ready. After waiting in line for 20 minutes, I was ignored by a gentleman at the front desk. No one was standing in front of him, but I did not want to be rude and walk up to him. I was waiting for him to greet me. He looked up, then looked back down and ignored me. I wish I could remember his name, he was an older white male.  Finally, the next front desk agent assisted me. I also do not remember her name, but she is an African American female. She was nice, but not welcoming. Not warm. She just sounded like she was reading her lines from a book. Which stood out to me and set the tone for the stay. I do not expect her to be a cheerleader and be very excited to have me. However, a sense of warmth would have helped. I asked if a room with a river view was available. She said yes, for a $30 up charge. She asked me to sign some paper work for the up charge. Which basically set the charge in stone. No problem. Seems like normal protocol. However, the guest next to me asked the same thing and her attendant told her it would be $20. So now, Im not very pleased that I have not been welcomed to the hotel, and I'm being up-charged by $10. Then of course, there were a few issues with my reservation but my attendant was patient and let me check in while I figured things out. I had booked a StarHot rate and had booked the reservation incorrectly. I didn't want to complain more about the up-charge, I was already stressed out about my reservation. A StarHot rate allows a sibling or family member of a SPG employee to stay at any SPG hotel on a discounted rate, if available. A lot of people try to trick the system and make fake discounts. I know how frustrating that can be. But that was not what I was trying to do. I felt like the front desk attendant was treating me as if that was the case. I understand that I got a good deal on the hotel, but that is no way to be treated. I am just as capable paying full price for a hotel like the Westin. I came back downstairs to let the front desk know that I was able to fix my reservation.The female that helped me earlier was not there. She was in the back. The gentleman who ignored me at first was the only one available. His manager was next to him and was watching him. This time he was overly nice. It made me feel like he was doing that only because his manager was next to him. The manager walked away. I told him that when I went upstairs, I noticed a puddle of water on the window sill. I asked what it could be. Is it because its been raining and snowing? He said he doesn't know. And proceeded to fix my reservation. He did not acknowledge my complaint. I didn't want to switch rooms, I wasn't looking for a discount. I simply wanted him to see if anything could be done. The room smelled moldy and damp. That's never a good sign. I just left it alone and went back to my room. I was only staying there for one night. I didn't to be a pest. I went back upstairs and turned the air down and left the door open to hopefully let it air out. That moldy smell. I noticed other things along the way. The furniture is beat up, the carpet is gross, and the lighting is awful. 2/3 lamps in the room were out. It was not up to Westin standards. The next morning, Antonio was the attendant that helped with my check out process. He was nice. He was helping and asked if we need help with our luggage, and if we wanted a printed folio. He was trying to make small talk and made us feel welcome. If the stay would have started in that spirit, then maybe the stay would not have been that bad. I favor SPG. Westin Savannah did not live up to the reviews and to the name. Very disappointing stay.Hotel was nice but house keeping stole some of my things they maybe thought I wouldn't notice! They took my apple headphones,($30) a phone case($60), and some of my brand new Mac lipsticks($20ea). I had a lot of the stuff on the table maybe they thought since it was so much I wouldn't notice the little things but I did. It was new, in boxes, and was taken.I told the desk and they said they'd look into it but never did. I stay at the Westin all the time and this is the first negative thing and it is just so irritating.Everything else was fine. It's not an extravagant hotel but a nice standard.This hotel is good.  Room was clean.  Staff was friendly.  Service was good.  Location is good too.  Don't worry about being across the river.  It's easy access to the action via the free water taxi and the views if you're on the river facing side are really great.One of the best hotels I have ever stay at. So nice  and clean and friendly staff. A must to return. Thank u for the great experience.What an amazing property!  It's 20 minutes from the beach, the golf course is immaculate, and the staff is polite and well trained.  Our families favorite part of the day was enjoying the Amazing breakfast buffet.  I highly recommend this hotel, I will definitely be back.This is the location of the annual Christmas in the South . Although this event has been taking place here years, this was my first time attending. I'm not much of a Christmas person at all ( and no my childhood was just fine) but I finally decided to give it a go. I must admit I was a bit taken back because it's not what I expected at all . Instead of a bunch of name branded retailers pushing their products , to my surprise there were none at all just regular local people. It was actually refreshing to see local mom and pops from the surrounding area selling their goods. Did it make my heart grow 10 sizes no that only in the movies but it did put a smile on my face and that's a start :-DAmazing rooms with a variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also has a free ferry transportation and the staff is so nice.No one showed me southern hospitality more than the folks at this hotel did. Anything I wanted, whether it be simple requests like microwaving some food or large requests like being drive across to get to the gym on a misty morning, these folks always made me feel welcome.The hotel itself was very clean and very nicely decorated. It's right across the river and you can take the ferry across and walk down their river walk strip. I bought souvenirs here and recommend the ice cream shop right on the corner. I can't remember the name but it was delicious.The hotel was beautiful overall. Beds were super comfy and our view was amazing. However when we checked in, we were given no info on the ferry from this particular staff agent, just given a room key and that was it. He seemed slightly annoyed about any questions we had asked. Also in the morning at 8 am we were woken up by loud banging and slamming on doors and it was housekeeping. I was curious as to why it was so early and housekeeping was trying to get into our room. Also as we left our room and made out way to the elevators, a housekeeper followed us down and asked if we were done in our room. We told her no as checkout is at noon, and she then walked away. For such a beautiful hotel, the staff doesn't seem up to par.Stayed here 3 nights for a conference in a room with two double beds. I thought the pillows and blankets were real comfortable and the bathroom had a great shower with good water pressure which is important to me. The conference was at this hotel and all the Westin staff were very helpful when asked a question and the food we ate during our meals was good, although lunch one day was a bit cold on the buffet. I had a decent view, but it was above the entrance which was loud at times when groups of rowdy people were coming or going, but no complaints really. I'd stay there again for sure.My wife and I finally got a vacation since our honeymoon and I can say that if you must stay in a hotel, The Westin Harbor Golf Resort is the best.  Upon arriving we were greeted by the valet and he was absolutely wonderful in helping us find where we were going and where the parking was.  When we got to the front desk we were greeted with a warm smile and offered the upgraded river view room for a nominal per night fee.  When we got to the room my wife's eyes grew so large when she saw the view we had.  Everything was great about the room, with the exception of the shower head, it just did not have the normal water pressure we were used to.  The bed was extra comfortable and was very easy to fall asleep in.  We had breakfast the second morning at the resort restaurant, the buffet was amazing and well worth the twenty two dollars per person.  The best thing was the ferry back and forth to River Street,    it was a free ferry and was nice because we did not have to pay for parking downtown.  In closing if you need a nice place to stay this would be the place for you.We arrived on a Sunday late September   night so our checkin was pretty good and got an upgrade to a river facing room. Very nice comfy bed.Room and bathroom are spacious enough for any wheelchair bound person.We got room service for food and it came about 30 minutes as they said it did.You get 5 dollar point for waiving room cleanup and towel change,Ferry ride across river to the town was convenient althought the schedule changes from 2 ferry to 1 ferry .The pool is a saline pool ,I am not sure if its heated but the first 3 days the weather was in  low 80's and muggy ,so its nice in the pool. I wake up pretty early and I see them cleaning the pool in the morning.The gym and the spa is at the golf course facility and the hotel povides a shuttle service there, or you can use their  bicycle  and or walk it in 5 minutes.The hotel is right next to the convention center .The weather chnaged from summer to fall during our stay lol. I do wished  the hotel has walking trails around. Wifi is paid and not . The free is limited but if you got unlimited internet with your phone , then you dont need it.Golf Course Review......OMG the gnats....I've never heard of these small flea-like creatures that made my early morning July round nearly impossible.  That being said I found the course to be in good shape, well laid out and challenging from the whites.  It plays completely different from the tips and is extremely challenging. It's a championship 18 hole par 72 Robert Cupp / Sam Snead designed course.A complete practice facility with a driving range and a chipping and putting area. The clubhouse is fairly standard although the food is a little lacking and tends to be pricey.After spending 4 nights at the Embassy Suites in Orlando, we wanted to slow things down and get Mickey and friends out of our minds by staying at the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort and Spa.  We stayed at Westin Hotels in the past.  We knew what the Westin could offer from our previous stays.We stayed for 2 nights on Father's Day weekend.  We arrived on a Saturday at about 4 PM.  The hotel seemed busy with check ins and also preparations for a wedding.  It took them three tries to get our room correct.  The first time, the put me in a room next to an elevator  With elevators making strange noises at night, I always have difficulty sleeping.  So, I asked for a different room.  The second room was okay, but, the ghosts of Savannah put a shower cap in the toilet.  When my wife saw it, she freaked out and requested a room that was clean.  The third time was a charm.  They gave us a room, exactly as requested.  The room was nice with 2 queen beds.  It had a nice view of the Savannah River.  Everything in the room was perfectly clean, just like what the wife likes.  The only thing thing about the room that my wife didn't like was the televion station choices.  She did not get to watch her favorite TV station, HGTV.  She didn't get to dream of what to do next for our house.The Westin is full of activities, after all, they are a Golf resort.  If you don't golf, they do have a swimming pool with lap swimming hours in the morning.  Unfortunately, I was on vacation, and had no intentions of using their pool.  The landing for the Ferry is right out the back door.  The Ferry is free and will take you across the river to River Street.  Unlike other Westin Hotels, they do not have a Kid's Club at this Westin.  Last year, my daughter was able to go on a Scavenger Hunt at the Westin Kierland.  We visited the Hitlon Head Westin.  They did offer a Kid's Club.  About the only complaint that my wife had was the staff was not friendly enough.  They did their job, and that was it.  They didn't really say ""Hi"", when you pass by them. Overall, it is a decent Westin property with nice clean quite room, unless it next to an elevator, or if a ghost throws a shower cap in the toilet.  It was a lot nicer than the Emabssy Suites in Orlando.  Overall, 3 1/2 stars, which isn't bad.  But, I have experienced better Westin properties.Okay. First of all I have to say that both times I've been to Savannah I have stayed at this establishment and I still think it's one of the best. They have wonderful views of the river plus a ferry boat that takes you across to River Street and leaves quite often. Might I add that the ferry allows dogs on it which is a MAJOR plus for me and brownie points in the book of Jo.The hotel itself I think is quite beautiful, but frankly, not enough to pay $300 a night during peak season. They have a very quaint little bar on the lobby floor that I LOVE. Very old school and what a lobby bar should be like (even if the drinks are $13 a pop). The rooms are just okay. Nothing to write home about but spacious and clean, which is just fine for me as I'm not super picky. If you get lucky you get a nice view of the grounds and golf course, which are quite nice. Lots of greenery all around which is great if you have a pet (pets are allowed as long as they're small and you can shell out the $100 pet deposit).The reason why I am giving this place three stars and not the four it deserves, is because of the blatant lack of customer service. I hate to say it, but I've been greeted by nicer people at a Days Inn while on the road for a night or two. I called various times in advance to say I was bringing a dog and if there was anything (other than the fee) I needed to know in advance. I was told I did not need anything (not even rabies shots records which I found weird) because I would have to sign a waiver. Upon signing said waiver, I was informed that the dog could not be left unattended at all.EXCUSE ME? ""We would not want for the dog to start barking and disturb other guests,"" was the attendant's reply. And I can appreciate that, trust me, I can. But it's pretty evident this is something I should've been informed of AHEAD OF TIME. For $100 a night I could've boarded my dog at the Ritz Carlton and my boyfriend and I could've had a chance to enjoy the city. There went our dinner plans or anything else we had in mind (it was my birthday, by the way). We tried to find places to board him but of  course on such short notice it was impossible.We snuck out for about an hour for a quick bite and a drink at the bar. I will also confess with no shame whatsoever that we left for breakfast the next morning for a whopping 40 minutes at the hotel's restaurant and left our dog in the bathroom sleeping on his bed. The food was subpar and the service HORRIFIC. I must've shouted at the waitress to please bring us our bill a couple of times after ineffectively trying to flag her down and still she did not come to our table. I can only assume the lady was deaf, in which case, I'm sorry about that. I am still wondering why on earth I left her a 20% tip. Upon leaving, the lady at the front desk looked like she'd rather be at the dentist than say good morning to me, and replied with a faint grunt when I picked up my hotel folio and wished her happy holidays.All in all, we made the best of it, but I think it's only right that a patron should be informed of the rules before going through the trouble of bringing their pet to an unknown place. To me, it simply felt like they wanted to get the $100 non-refundable deposit and could care less what I did with my dog after that, seeing they were not liable once I signed the waiver.I still think this is a beautiful hotel, and no doubt I still would consider coming back, but I have to be honest that I was not pleased whatsoever with this last stay. Also, we spent a good $150 on room service seeing we were bound to our room with our dog on our mini vacation before Christmas. Catastrophic, to say the least.Rooms were clean, and the heavenly beds are comfortable.  We stayed in a room away from the elevators, and it was nice and quiet.  They also offer free WiFi and free parking.There is a free ferry service that runs every 20 min across the river and into historic downtown Savannah.The fitness center is a five min walk away, and it had a few cardio machines, nautilus type machines, and free weights.  The TVs on the cardio machines could have used some more channels.  I think it only had a few local channels, news channels, and ESPN.I've stayed in Savannah a number of times, and this was one of the least impressive experiences I have had. We booked online using my premier member number, not just by some Priceline, you get what you paid for option. We booked a roll away bed in a Premier Room. Upon checking in we were told we couldn't have one due to fire codes. We went to our room ( for a Premier Room, it was small), then decided to call the desk to see about options. We were told about suites that could accommodate our requests, and we're happy to pay the difference, until being transferred to reception to be told that there were no suites available. What a waste of time. We ended up booking an additional room on a different floor. At an additional cost. The concierge desk was never staffed, the reservation staff was barely responsive, and the shuttle to the riverfront doesn't really run on schedule. If you're looking to stay in Savannah, on the Riverfront, stay at the Brice, or the Hyatt. The Brice is across the green, but the rooms, and the staff make up for that.We stayed here for two nights the first weekend in March, thanks to a last minute bid since we had to attend a funeral.  Having never been to Savannah before, we had no idea what to expect, and at first were not overly happy about finding ourselves across the river from the historic area.  After arriving, however, we were immediately enthralled.  Driving up to this resort is very impressive and surprisingly just 12 miles off of I-95.  Check-in was a short wait (lots of people with well-behaved dogs in the lobby...must be a very dog-friendly hotel).  No king rooms were available, so we trotted off to our double bed room and found it to be nice.  Note to previous reviewers who didn't notice the fridge in the room.  We had one (see pic)...which is where his and hers bottles landed (bourbon for him, wine for her).  They give you a brochure with the ferry schedule when you check in, which makes it so easy (and quick) to catch the ""free"" ferry.  (Okay, so you pay $22.47 per day for a resort charge...we've had to do resort charges before where a ferry wasn't included, just sayin') AND it covers parking &amp; internet. Internet which worked for Husband but not for me. Feel pretty confident it was operator error as a result.    The ferry was way better than expected.  Covered.  Big.  Quick and efficient. And since they give you a schedule of when and where it will be, if you spend a lot of time waiting for it, it's because you didn't plan accordingly.  We DID and it was GREAT!  When we came back to the hotel after dinner in the historic area on that Friday night we were greeted with FIREWORKS.  How awesome is that?  And apparently a first Friday thing.  The hotel was also doing an oyster roast party with a live band. The only minor disappointment to our Friday night was that the Bourbon &amp; Chocolate Lounge that we had looked forward to trying was PACKED.  No room for us to sidle in and try it.   Lesson finally learned after several recent hotels with more than one bed in them.  The bed closest to the bathroom SUCKS.  Use the other bed.  This lesson finally sunk into our teeny tiny pea brains on this trip (but only after an extremely uncomfortable first night).  Second night, switched beds, much better.    Also had a pleasant breakfast in Aqua (see that review).  And I posted a review of the Bourbon &amp; Chocolate Bar that we spent a few (cough) bucks in on Saturday night.  Overall, we loved this resort.  It's beautiful, friendly, and the location is perfect for getting in and out of town without having to mess with city streets.Probably my favorite Hotel so far...View of the river is beautiful, water taxi that brings you to downtown is easy/fast/free, breakfast restaurant is delicious, staff was massively friendly and helpful, and they also had some really cool holiday themed displays throughout the lobby when my wife and I went (first week of December). We went as part of our anniversary weekend, I mentioned this to them and they went out of their way to drop off complimentary champagne and strawberries... just nice little touches like that make all the difference. A+","Were this a tourist hotel, it would be fine, perhaps even recommended. Alas, it is attached the Savannah's conference center, and a conference hotel it is not. But first let me start with the good. The beds were luxuriant, if a bit soft, and included a variety of pillows. The most thoughtful was a long, narrow pillow that I seemed to wake up hugging like a teddy bear every morning. The staff were polite and, outside of the abysmal restaurants, generally attentive. (I reviewed the restaurants separately). The fitness center was really great, and had among the best wet and dry saunas I've encountered.So what's the problem? It starts with the location .The hotel is attractively situated on the Savannah river, overlooking the city. Another way to say that: the hotel is cut off from the city by water. And the only way to get to the city without a car is via a charming, but infrequently run ferry. By car, you must approach and cross a giant bridge. As a result, it is impossible to go anywhere for food and coffee but the hotel's restaurants.Those restaurants are three: a ""Starbucks"" (not really), a ""lounge"" with take-out option, and an ""upscale"" option on the second floor. In addition to being very bad and very expensive, the two take-away options are extremely slow. If you actually want to go to your session, you're just not going to eat. My only solution was to go to town and buy take-out the night before, when I had better things to be doing. And I was forced to eat that food cold, because the rooms don't have microwaves.To add injury to these insults, the hotel wifi was abysmal, greatly limiting my capacity to work during the conference. I simply gave up on accessing the Internet during peak times. I was also mistakenly charged seven times for Internet access, although these charges were removed.Three stars because the stay was so comfortable. For business travel, though, I just can't recommend this hotel. What's more, I might think twice about attending another conference in Savannah.If this review was about our very first stay three years ago, 5 stars. However our stay a week and a half ago was extremely disappointing! We have stayed there before.. It was amazing! Then Westin has a great reputation and thus high expectations. I'll list the problems.. Positives at the end. Fortunately the problems aren't earth shattering, but should not happen at the Westin in my opinion.-The pool. Ew!!! It was NOT even close to clear.. It was clouded and had a very slight color to it of a yellow/brown. We didn't step foot in it! We went over to the kids area where water sprayed and dumped out to cool down.-Outdoor bar staff. She was so overwhelmed we didn't get a single drink from her even after waiting 10-15 minutes multiethnic times. The last time I walked up and there were 8 people including myself. 4 of which had been there a while sitting eating and drinking. She had no clue what she was doing.. If she was new they should have had someone else out there with her.. I actually feel bad if they threw a newbie out there with no one to help her..-Breakfast staff. One word, slow. Well, two words.. Slow and clueless. We had 2 servers actually waiting on us.. We ordered coffee, eggs, hash browns and bacon. Food took about 20 minutes.. Coffee came a second before our food because she forgot. Food was cold.-Filming a movie. You would think this is awesome right!? A movie set at your hotel!? Nope. There were 40-50 people in the lobby waiting to get on the elevator because they blocked it off and this is nice.. Everyone was being ""Shhhed."" So many people were angry! A couple on our elevator up we're going up to their room to check out and they also had just arrived that day. Hey Westin.. Give your guests a heads up about big things like this. Had we been given a notice there would be an inconvenience like this it wouldn't have been so bad. We would have worked around it..-Balcony door.. It was a workout to open it. Anyone elder or injured wouldn't be able to open it.+A plus, as expected the staff was all extremely nice! I am sure they were getting an ear full from angry guests but they stayed very professional, calm and friendly.+We did request an early checkin and it was ready.. That was awesome.As I said, these problems aren't the end of the world by any means.. But as I said, we stayed here before and none of the problems above happened. It's at if it has gone downhill. I do not think the problems are difficult to fix. Hopefully they have been or are tended to soon. I suppose before your stay be sure that pool was treated.. I promise you wouldn't want to go in it unless you were drunk.Not as good as most Westin's. Staff very surly and not helpful. Room service request required multiple calls.  Unlike any other resorts I've stayed at, this one charges for ice in your drinks. WTF! $30 a day for resort fees and a $1 for ice in a drink. Tried to do the ""green"" thing that didn't work. Currently they have charged my CC more than the receipts add up to. Having Mastercard looking into that. On the funny side the bathroom mirror/light is falling off the wall. Gonna need to find a different place for my next Savannah trip. Maybe out to Bloody Point.This is a very nice hotel.  I bid it on Priceless for $99 and got it on the first try.  Get a king bed with the view of the Golf course.  Regular rate would have been $259.   Parking is free if your a guest but has a free first 45 minute parking for visitors.  Valet is $23 overnight.  The lobby has a very nice decor and the staff is friendly.This hotel is lovely. The shower is so nice with the rain feature and you can switch to a hand held spray. Lighting in the bathroom is soft and nice. Beds are heavenly! I like the bath robes they provide. Also! You can leave your gym/running clothes at home. You may rent work out attire here for $5/day including shoes! They will deliver this to your room. The hotel lobby is stunning with beautiful water views. We attended a wedding which was spectacular! Dinner and dancing in the Grand Ballroom was perfect. The food was amazing. The service was excellent. The hotel provides a free ferry service to other parts of Savannah. The grounds are perfect, you can walk along the river front, play golf, hang out at the pool. So much to do here! I highly recommend this property.I was a little apprehensive about this hotel when I booked it because of its location. Let me start by saying that taking the ferry is super easy and we enjoyed the ride every time. The hotel itself is beautiful. Rooms are ok. We had the golf course view on the 7th floor. Not bad, not good. If you can get the view of the river its worth it.Would I stay here again? Probably. The price is right. The hotels in the historic district are around $200/night. I'd rather take the ferry and stay in a spacious room in a nice hot3el.Super clean, super friendly, super nice. Would absolutely go back. Played golf and for being a guest at the hotel you can play 18 for $15! Such a deal. Pool is beautiful, hot tub is riverfront, and restaurant with bar was great. Staff so helpful and accommodating.I was registered at this hotel for a conference. I would describe the facility as adequate. Not lacking. Seriously in any particular ways just nothing special either. It would not be a place I would recommend for future events. There ar too many special places available. I'm also not a big fan of Resort Fees. Especially when I don't see any specific value - I have to pay for Internet services and the fitness center is not in the building. However, the reason for my low rating is one specific thing. What I Perceived to be a lack of customer service. On my last day there I requested a delayed check out of one hour. I was told that none were being honored because they had a busy weekend coming. Today is Wednesday!  I asked to speak to the general manager on duty and was give the office manager who was professional but said no. She said what else can is do to please you and I said let me stay in my room one extra hour. No go!  Really ! I'm a SPG member to boot ( their frequent stay club). Anyway So much for Westin's. This story is definitely added to the list of lousy customer service.5 stars. Beautiful hotel. Clean rooms. Great staff. Awesome pool. Located on the other side of the river, secluded, but there is a free ferry that brings you downtown and leaves every 20 min. A great getaway hotel.Well, to start I have stayed at several Westins and have my favorites so there was a standard that Westin Savannah had to meet.  Our day started with a smooth checkin and view of our room and balcony.   Pretty happy with our room and view. Our most anticipated activity was a day at the spa.... Bellevue, Washington is by far the best out of the Westins I've visited. First, the spa is off the hotel grounds in the golf clubhouse which we had to walk to and even though they provide shuttle service no one offered to take us over.  Second, not updated and felt like I was in a school locker room.  I guess the Bellevue Westin is going to be hard to surpass. Once our services were finished we asked for a pick up since well, we were feeling ""heavenly""  but after about 15 minutes of waiting we decided to walk back to our room.  Not impressed at all with the Heavenly Spa at Westin Savannah. The hotel and room were very clean and felt up to par for anyone's standards. A tad inconvenient to take the water taxi but it was a fun added entertainment. Totally stinks when there is a monsoon outside.  We had a nice dinner in town and called the hotel for advice on transportation back to the hotel but was told ""I used to work at so and so just ask the hostess"".  Ummm no as customer service is concerned the front desk only likes to help with checkin and checkout. It was just a normal hotel and for the price I would rather stay in town.My boyfriend and I recently enjoyed a BEAUTIFUL stay at the Westin Savannah Resort &amp; Spa.  As we traveled to Savannah at an off-peak time we were able to stay at this gorgeous hotel for a GREAT rate. This resort is located across the River all the downtown Savannah action which some might see as a hindrance, but we found it perfect! There is a free ferry shuttle that takes you across the river. It runs multiple times an hour until midnight. This allows you to not have to pay for parking and avoids any driving while drinking.  Savannah allows for open containers on the street, which to some might seem great however we enjoyed getting away from this and getting to the calming and peaceful resort. There were a few hiccups: our smoke detector went off EVERY time one of us took a shower. And on the first day we were there, our room was not cleaned until almost 5pm. At that time we wished to be back in our room getting ready for our dinner that night. Those were our only negatives. All in all, we would definitely return on an off peak time for some rest and relaxation. Thanks for a great experience Westin!The walls are paper thin and it's a pain constantly having to take the ferry back and forth to town.. Also the gym is in a completely different building across a busy highway. The food was good. Drinks were not made correctly. Think this place was a 1 and done for me.Amazing place! So cool to take the ferry across to the Historic district. The ferry is free and operates pretty frequently. Waiting is fun too - lots to gaze upon. This hotel has bikes to ride in the front entrance - for free! A cute game room inside one of those semi-permanent tents. The pool is heated (wish I brought my suit).  Has a fire pit for smores but it wasn't going the nights we were there... probably too cold. Beds super comfy - Heavenly as stated on website. Good insulation between walls if you know what I mean :)Two negative things: No Bibles in Hotel rooms! This is the South... maybe in CA but here???? and, I called down to the front desk for a couple of things a couple of times before I got a response.  I wanted step stool for my son who is potty training... weird request right? BUT it was suggested in their Hotel guide book... so I took them up on the offer... kind of... cuz they didn't have one! LOL... whatever - not a break it kind of deal...I was so excited to stay at this hotel for a recent conference. I mean, look at the photos... it really looks like that! No promo witchcraft going on in these photos. It is just as luxurious as it appears. The hotel is gorgeous, the views are wonderful- your pick: river view (YES!), or golf course. I was lucky enough to score a river view and felt like a little kid with my nose pressed against the window of my room, each and every time a cargo ship would go by. These things are huge! How do they fit into the Savannah river?? I digress...My room was immaculate. Everything was spot on. I love that the Starwood line of hotels offers $5.00 vouchers for each day that you decline housekeeping. Since I have another Starwood hotel trip coming up, I went with this option. It wasn't a bad idea since my bathroom was well stocked with towels and toiletries. The only complaint I had was that when I arrived, my shampoo bottle was halfway empty. Seriously? So, basically, the hotel did not replace my shampoo. Lucky that I come prepared with my own shampoo and conditioner. Deduction of star for this.I ordered room service twice, and it was oh so tasty, but of course, overpriced. The hallways were quiet, room temp was to my liking and with an exact temperature adjustable thermostat (which was also quiet, by the way). The hotel has two bar areas, one on the mainfloor in the dining area, and one on the second floor that is devoted to bar only. Both bars were well stocked and had most any drink you could want. In the morning hours, there is a Starbuck's counter in the dining area foyer. Do yourself a favor and venture out onto the courtyard/dock area. It is a gorgeous view of the river while taking in the fresh air from a well-manicured, grassy courtyard area. Even though the Westin is across the river from downtown, there is a free passenger ferry that will take you on a 5-7 minute ride to the downtown side. There is also a spa that has every service imaginable, and of course, it is a golfer's dream. Staying at The Westin is truly how to do a trip to Savannah!I've stayed several places in Savannah, from hotels to B&amp;Bs and this is my favorite. Nice rooms, friendly staff, free water shuttle to downtown Savannah, great dining options and a fantastic spa.Fantastic hotel! Great location away from all of the commotion but close enough to be there. The rooms were nice and clean! Will definitely be visiting again.I stayed here for my birthday everything was Great well that is up until about 8:30 or 9:00 PM some Guy lit up something that smell like a burning tire something that would've triggered a smoke alarm or somethingNice hotel!!! The rooms are clean, and the view my family got was perfect. We were looking at the over view look of the river and the pool. The pool &amp; the hot tub were purely fantastic.we went during Easter and had little activities for the children all day long. (Easter breakfast, pictures with the bunny, egg hunt, etc.)The hotel was very fancy and cool looking. If you a river view, be sure to look at the big barges. They are HUGE. My children loved to look at these and would always get me to look at it.Westin's location on the water was beautiful, with a path along the water, and right next to the dock where the free ferry can take you across the river.  It's obviously a bit further away than being right on or near River St, but you can sense the peacefulness of the location....it was nice to be a bit removed from the hubbub.  Parking is either valet or self-park in a lot off to the right of the hotel, accessed with your room key.  I was here when the hotel was decorated for Christmas, so it was lovely and festive, with the lobby full of gingerbread houses and sculptures to ogle.Room- I booked a standard king with a golf course view, but I was lucky enough to get a corner room, so I had an additional window facing east, so I also had a river view, and a sunrise view, which was GORGEOUS...I couldn't stop taking photos.Excellent view of the river and downtown across the river. Super friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Nice pool area for swimming or just sitting around. The whole resort area was beautiful. Being right next to the conference center was a super plus, and the free ferry that constantly runs to the river walk is great! It was really nice to have that as an option to save gas and parking for the car. Only tried the pool and rooms, didn't try any of the other amenities. (August)","My husband and I went to Savannah and stayed at the Westin for our 1 year wedding anniversary.  I did a LOT of research and I'm SO glad we chose this hotel.  When we arrived, they had upgraded up because it was our anniversary and had champagne and strawberries in our room.  Totally unexpected!  The room was great and the harbor view was perfect!  Most of Savannah's hotels are on the river front, but this hotel faces it, which makes you able to view the riverfront.  The pool was a great place to hang out during the day when it was hot and the bar by the pool is a great feature.  One day we ordered lunch out there and it took a little while, so the bartender gave us free drinks!  Little things like that keep me coming back!  The continental breakfast was pretty pricey for being a continental breakfast, but that was to be expected.GREAT hotel for visiting Savannah!!I requested an early check in for 1 pm and that part was great. The problem started about 30 minuted later my wife and I were getting dressed when a Hotel employee walked into our room without knocking and took about 3 steps into the room before he even looked up. My wife just finished putting her top on and I just got dressed after taking a shower. He apologized and said he went into the wrong room - My question was why didn't you knock he just mumbled and walked out. We decided to go green and not have the room cleaned during our stay so we hung the Do Not Disturb tag and the Going Green tag on the door. On the last day we had another employee enter our room around noon even though we had the proper do not enter signs on the door. We were not in the room at the time they went into our room again - My question was why did they go into our room even though we had a 3pm check out? They came up with some excuse it was an accident again. On another note we had to change rooms after our first night because of excessive noise coming from the adjoining rooms, little kids screaming until after midnight and started back up at 6am plus the Safe did not Lock. Then In the new room we had the same issue with excessive noise not from little kids but from Drunk obnoxious 30-40 year olds until after 2am oh and the safe was also defective. When I checked out the front desk never asked how my stay was and I am sure it is because they already had an idea and did not want to hear it again but it would have been nice if they apologized to my face and that was the biggest fail of the WESTIN SavannahI am a LONG way from five stars for this place, despite its 5-diamond rating from AAA. Facilities  are beautiful and room was most comfortable.  Those earn five stars.  Had breakfast there once, which was MORE than enough for me -- but my wife likes to brush her teeth AFTER breakfast and there was NOWHERE else to eat nearby (had to take the ferry to the mainland for options), so we did it again.  Restaurant gets 2 stars for breakfast -- mediocre food not presented well, less than mediocre service when it was not busy and appeared to be adequately staffed.  Maybe we should not have asked for table service -- but the $23 buffet offends me in principle as well as pocket-book.  The final blow was back at the hotel.  My wife was traveling with jewelry.  We wanted to spend the day across the river in Savannah, so we asked to use a lock box.  The young woman who set it up was VERY nice and walked us through a complex process involving ID and other information -- just what it should have been.  The next day my wife went back to get her jewelry and there was NO process -- just the key -- no ID, no signature, nothing.  Fortunately everything was there -- but it was clear that any plausible-acting person who found the key could have cleaned out the box. It did give me an idea for a mystery story.  The block of boxes into which my wife's jewelry went appeared not to be anchored to anything -- just a box of a dozen or so boxes resting on a cabinet -- easy to steal and not much security.Advice:  stay at one of the chain hotels across the river in the historic area or, perhaps better, in a B&amp;B.  This place actually looks like it is waiting to get a license for a casino boat to float in the pond next to it -- I may be wrong, but it has that character about it.This review is the for the golf course.Went there for a get together during a wedding. We had 20 guys and it could not have gone any smoother. You get access to the driving range which is inculded in your green fee.They have an excellent putting and chipping area.This course was designed by the great Sam Snead. It's a beautful course with not a lot of water but a fair amount of sand.I def recommend taking the FREE water taxi over the river from the Westin; it takes about five minutes and they have a shuttle that will pick you up from the hotel and take you to the course just minutes away.Side trip to Savannah after NC...And what a great trip it was..Room was Clean Staff were friendly and helpful...Loved the upgrade to the 15th floor what an amazing view of Downtown Savannah and South Bank...Great Whirlpool and Pool...Went to the 2nd florr WAY over priced with what I can take a free shuttle boat over and have a much better not so Phoney chain restaurant ambiance.The wife and I loved this hotel and will be back.I normally love Westin hotels but, although the hotel &amp; the room were nice &amp; clean, I was not impressed. Room service took 45 minutes &amp;, when it finally arrived to our room, 1/2 of the order was missing! Then we needed a wine bottle opener &amp; had to wait almost another hour! *tisk, tisk* I expected more!No complaints and a definite recommendation for anyone visiting Savannah.First things first, you are actually across the river and not actually in downtown Savannah which has it's good points as well as some drawbacks. The great thing is that you get a pretty view of the river with all the boats coming in and out, and when it is time to go back to the hotel for the night, you are out of the hustle and bustle and get more of that ""resort"" feel and the relaxation that comes with it. The hotel offers a free ferry service to get you across the river and into downtown, and the ferry runs very regularly. The only drawback is that it stops running before midnight, so I guess I revoke my statement about having no complaints, because it did impose somewhat of a damper having to be on a curfew or pay for a taxi ride across the bridge if you miss the last boat. However, there isn't too much to be said about Savannah's nightlife, so turning in early isn't going to deprive you of the bitchin party scene going on or anything. In fact, during the two nights I stayed at this hotel, I was back early enough to end the night with a dip in the hot tub... and it was glorious.    During the day, the pool area is definitely family friendly, but they also have a nice pool side bar and enough lounge chairs that you can escape from the pool- noodle fights and viscous splashing going on in the pool. They also have cabanas you can rent which is just ridiculous, but hey, go for it if you like to waste your money. I also really enjoyed the small touches offered at this Westin. Like most things in life, it's the little things that count, and the rosemary lemonade in the lobby during the day was delightful, and the lighted makeup-mirror in the room was super! Onsite Starbucks was great too. They have a little sewing kit in the bathroom along with mouthwash and plenty of lotions and etc., and with all the cuts that I've been seeing in the hotel biz where you are lucky nowadays to get a bar of soap, these extras are definitely appreciated.  The beds were really comfy and the room was very clean and not sketchy in the slightest. So two thumbs up there. We had the breakfast buffet one of the mornings and it was a pretty good deal for what they offered. I believe it was $20 give or take a few bucks and they had an omelet station, pancake station, fruit and yogurt, bagels and other yummy breakfast carbs, breakfast meats, oatmeal, and southern favorites. I tried biscuits and gravy as well as cheese grits for the first time in my life and was please with it. My two friends I was with, one from Alabama and the other from Mississippi, were both less impressed at the authenticity of the southern fare offered, but agreed it was still tasty.  Also note that the Westin will hold your luggage for you if you get there before your room is ready or checkout before it's time to leave, so that's also nice. $20 bucks a day to park your car which falls under the ""resort fee.""I could never live in Savannah, GA, because then I would have no excuse to come and stay here.  Everything about the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort and Spa is nice. The rooms were nice, the staff was nice, the hotel was nice, the amenities were nice. A few highlights:-Free bike rentals to tour the area on your own.-Gorgeous offsite gym, spa, golf, and tennis club - just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.-Free ferry to/from old town Savannah-Lovely pool-Great kids activities. Speaking of kids' activities, we left our kiddos behind for the weekend, but I kind of regretted that because they catered so much to kids. For instance, they had a craft area by the pool. They also had a poolside hermit crab race in the evening. Our crab won a race, so we received a lovely $25 hotel gift card.Overall, I think this place is lovely. Can't wait to return!I recently had the pleasure of spending 3 nights at the Westin in Savannah. The room was well appointed, modern, and clean and checkin/check out was seamless. I was extended the ""green"" option of eschewing daily housekeeping and towel changes in exchange for 500 starwoods points per night which was lovely. The complimentary wifi was fast and reliable.My girlfriend had a lovely exfoliating scrub at the heavenly spa, a wonderful experience which included complimentary mimosas. I also noticed the option of renting new balance workout clothes for my stay for only $5 which seems like a great way to cut down on packing if you intend to exercise.The hotel also hosts a memorable jazz brunch on sundays which features an overwhelming array of hot, fresh, and delicious freshly prepared options from a highly renowned local chef.The hotel PR manager, David Moses seems to have made it his personal mission to ensure my stay in not only the Westin, but the city of Savannah, a delight. He had invited me to the hotel a few months prior and even personally drove me to and from the airport and arranged to have chocolate covered strawberries and champagne delivered to my room.I highly recommend staying at the Westin Savannah Harbor Golf Resort &amp; Spa to anyone looking to visit the area.Just leaving the resort now.   Having just recovered from the attitude of the man that checked us in, the lady that checked us out obviously has it in for her boss and hates her job.     Just blah personality from the staff.  If you can deal with that, the rooms are terrific!   I'll stay elsewhere from now on though, just don't want to deal with ANY rudeness when PAYING for a vacation.We are now wondering if because we went through a 3rd party, Priceline, and supposedly got a discounted price for our stay, we bought ""discounted"" attitude too.  It does seem that whenever we called for service or questions, everyone noted that we went through a 3rd party.We booked this hotel through a fantastic deal available through Travelzoo, which made it incredibly affordable.  I have stayed in several Westin Hotels in the past, and this one mostly lives up to the name.  I truly enjoy the aroma they use throughout the Westin chain (white tea), but here, I didn't smell it very often, which was somewhat disappointing.  The hotel itself is about as modern as you can get in Savannah, as much of the town is either older hotels or Bed and Breakfast type places.  Staying on the other side of the water was no major inconvenience, the ferry boat system seemed to work right on time.  Large boats came through at early hours (4:00 AM) at times, so you have to be aware that it could be a bit noisy.The rooms themselves seemed nice, the bed was comfortable (as most Westin beds are), and it had modern touches with a flat screen TV and Ipod/phone dock alarm clock, and dual shower heads.  The concierge there was more than helpful when we had questions, and the gingerbread display (we stayed during Christmas season) was really cool.One odd part about this hotel is that the fitness facility is over by the golf course clubhouse, which is about a five minute walk outside.  Not so bad when it is warm out, but during winter, it was about 30 degrees, and I'm walking in shorts to the exercise room.  Turns out, you can borrow one of the bikes they have sitting outside and ride over.  That made things much easier, although still quite cold.  Overall, we had a good experience, and would definitely consider coming to stay again.Probably the best place to stay while in Savannah. Extremely convenient location across from the river from River Street. Take the ferry across, and you may never need to drive. On our last day, we ordered room service for dinner. The food was timely, warm, and delicious.I was fortunate enough to win a free stay here, so I got a friend and we headed on down.  I will start with the only negative: you have to cross the bridge for everything.Positives: the place itself is pretty, feels luxurious for the neighborhood, and gives you a great view of the area.  The service was super amazing, with all of the employees acknowledging you when you walk in, walk out, and return.  I do not want to linger on this point, but seriously, I was impressed with everyone's prompt service.  I stay at a lot of hotels, so the fact that it stands out to me says something.I adore sleeping in the Heavenly beds, and thoroughly enjoyed standing on the balcony and watching the giant freight ships passing by on the river.  The place was clean, the room service was tasty, and downtown Savannah is beautiful.  I would happily go back!modern, Bed super comfortable, nice view of the savannah river if you get that view. when i ask for more towels and more body lotion :-)  they immediately sent it to me I really like that  lol.... they had green tea scent products for the bathroom that we enjoyed very much so that was cool.If i ever go back to savannah I will def stay at this place again.the only thing I didnt like is that when i called to find out activities for each day the people at the front desk never knew anything but I just went downstairs and found out my self, that was the only little thing that bother me.Love the Westin Savannah! My wife and I are spending a very nice anniversary weekend here. It's a convenient ferry ride across the river to historic and fun River Street.  Great on property dining and spa.I was so excited when SO booked a night here during our fly by trip earlier this week. The hotel staff is amazing except for one person and I am kicking myself that I did not write down his name! I had prearranged a surprise spa service for hubby and had to bump up our check-in time from 3 p.m. to 2 or 2:30 at the latest in order for us to check in and get settled in. The male staff was very flippant with me on the phone, explaining, well, if you get here and the room is ready you can have it. If not, then you'll have to wait. I was a little taken aback and called the next day and spoke to another person who assured me that everything would be ready for us.I managed to sneak a call to the hotel when hubby was getting gas to confirm we would be ok to check in by 2:00. I spoke to Ashley (who is AMAZING!) and she said that not only was the room ready, but she confirmed the spa appointment too. When we arrived, we learned that our room was a golf facing one, well, hubby wanted to be a diva and requested a room upgrade to river view, and then when we saw that our room didn't have a balcony, we upgraded again for an additional $100. We called and spoke to Ashley who took care of everything for us.The bed was a bit lumpy (I prefer a firmer a bed), but after driving through the rain for hours, my body didn't care anymore!SO said the spa service was amazing as well, and he even fell asleep! I took advantage of the balcony and treated myself to just relaxing in the warm sun and people watching on River Street.We used the ferry (it's actually not free, there is a $19 resort fee that is applied to this) and visited (and got trashed) while bar hopping on River Street. The ferry does offer a real nice way to not even be tempted with drinking and driving. I do agree with a previous post that the valet were less than helpful.The Westin is a very nice hotel, with a pretty view and informative staff. I'm had to dock it one star because the ferry ran quite late a few times, and keep in mind--it is a ""family"" hotel, so if you're not a fan of small children, it might be best to look elsewhere.An okay hotel, but definitely not up to Westin standards. Arrived at 11 pm, front desk was abandoned, it took some minutes for someone to finally saunter over and get us to our room. Similar experience in the main restaurant. We asked for a slightly extended checkout time, were flatly turned down...only to be kept waiting again trying to check out at the front desk while the clerk failed to make eye contact. Book through Priceline or similar, room rates are much cheaper than the hotel website. Reservations desk lied when asked about lower rates available online.Great location on the river looking across the river at the downtown but easily accessible with a free and frequent water taxi.The rooms are large and well maintained and the staff is gracious and accommodating.Internet fees in business center are excessive.This hotel is just beautiful. It's set right on the river, with a clear view of River Street in downtown Savannah and the Talmadge Bridge from the front. A convenient ferry system visits the 3 major hotels-- the Westin, the Marriott, and the Hyatt, the latter two of which are located on River Street. The room was beautiful and the bed was to die for. The shower was great, and the toiletries are definitely steal-worthy :) The toilet had some issues, but I'm not sure if its due to it being an old toilet, or the water system on Hutchinson Island. There was a convenient drink cooler in the entertainment hutch and a nice big flat screen tv. The wi-fi was dependable.The valets and luggage attendants were soooooo helpful and nice. We have no complaints about them whatsoever. The front desk staff seemed bored and like the last thing they wanted to do was help people. The bar staff in the Midnight Lounge seemed inexperienced and lacked personality (two female bartenders, both with different accents... Did not get their names). One standard drink (a blue Hawaiian) ended up being made with grapefruit juice instead of pineapple juice, and their ""sweet tea"" was tea sweetened with simple syrup. Ick. (That is not the bartender's fault, it's the bar's.)They have complimentary rosemary-infused lemonade in the lobby which was delightfully refreshing. We did not use the pool, but it looked nice. We would definitely stay here again, but we would love to see people more like the valets and baggage attendants in the front desk and bartending positions. Knowing how to do a job is one thing, but it's that extra bit of personality and caring about your customers that takes the whole experience a lot further.","One of the best hotels in all of Savannah... Having stayed all over Savannah, Georgia from the historic district and mid-town all the way out to Pooler and Port Wentworth I can tell you that you will get every penny of what you pay out of your visit at the Westin on Hutchinson Island. Inconspicuously opulent, this hotel and resort has everything you need for a Savannah get-away.Featuring a spa and top-notch golfing this resort caters to everyone on-site and easily facilitates travel across the Savannah river to the historic district via free and convenient ferry shuttles that run every 15 minutes or so throughout the day and night.The property is gorgeous and the rooms very well appointed. Bedding and linens are top notch, no skimping on quality or thread-count here. The rooms are over-sized and spacious offering either views across to the picturesque city or out to the golf-course and the low-country between Savannah and nearby Hilton Head Island. Having stayed here during the holidays I can attest it to me a magical place decorated with perfection and attention to detail...the sort of place that really captures the holiday spirit and embodies it's hospitality well. Stay near the winter holidays and receive a complimentary ticket to the awesome light-show in Hutchinson Island. Well reviewed, well enjoyed and most certainly recommended.My husband and I spent a very fun weekend at the Westin in Savannah. Good points: spacious room, great view of Savannah's River St., and a fun water taxi to take trips across the Harbour. The Westin also has a decent gym and spa within walking.We went on a rainy weekend - which could have been terrible - but wasn't! It was still warm and clear enough Friday and part of Saturday to enjoy the hot tub and pool. The hotel has an oyster roast on Friday night with a bonfire and live music. There is a Starbucks in the lobby bar, which is always a bonus for us.This is a hotel with exceptional service! Friendly greeted the second we pulled up. Our room was even ready an hour and half early! Free parking with the simple swipe of your room key into the parking lot. There is a free ferry that takes you right into the heart of the historic district. This being my first time in Savannah it was the perfect location to be dropped off at, and so easily accessible. The pool is amazing! Even on one of the sunniest days it wasn't overly crowded. There are servers who come around constantly serving from the bar that includes great good. Although, kind of pricey what do you expect from the hotel bar? The hotel service is constantly at your beck and call AND with a smile on their face! I only wish the dinner recommendations by the concierge were better, not good food recommendations outside hotel dinning. Though, one of the front desk woman was so kind to assist she went above and beyond to help. I wish I could remember her name I know it was ""Sh---a"" (I know, not helpful). Overall it was a great hotel to stay in, reasonably priced thanks to Expedia, and right across the river from the downtown! Definitely will recommend this place and return to it next time I'm in Savannah!This hotel is situated on the Savannah River with views of the river and golf course. It is a high class hotel with plenty of nice amenities and a decent restaurant.The lounge is a great place to enjoy cocktails or a glass of wine just adjacent to the pool.The best thing about this hotel is the location, the heavenly beds, and the golf course is just a few minutes away.It features a ferry ride accross the river (check hotel for times) and late check outs (4 PM) for preffered guests.The bed is simply amazing and once you get into it you do not want to leave or get up. This beds comes with multiple pillows to suit your needs and comfort level.Awesome place with one drawback-parking here is limited and you may need to park in the conference center. The experience here is wonderful from beginning to end.Enjoy.Very nice resort ! Enjoying the nights around the pool! The parking is horrible had to walk several parking lots over to find somewhere! This was tough on the family with kids!I was scheduled to go to Savannah for work and I was dreading it. I just felt like there would be nothing to do and it would just be hot. Boy was I wrong. As for the hotel, this place is awesome. The rooms are clean and staff is amazing. Flat screen TVs and the pool and lounges are spectator. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because room service is only open until 11. Right across the river is shopping, bars and restaurants. There are free ferry boats that take you across the water to River Street. It's so cool there. Tons to do and the city is beautiful. So much so that I would take a personal trip back here.Great worthy of 4 star hotel. Beautiful pool, hot tub. Workout facilities are not in building. Nice business center. They have a free ferry to go across river every 20-30 minutes. Very clean updated rooms. Aqua restaurant was great. Views of large cargo container barges are unbelievable! Get river view room. Do the self park, it is very close and covered.Nice rooms, wonderful amenities, fantastic landscaping and you are isolated from Savannah on the island. If you need the convention center it is right beside the hotel.  There is also a racetrack on Hutchinson Island nearby the hotel  Downside: Riding the free ferries to the other side of the river is okay, but you lose time waiting for the ride each way, every time. Also Ferry stops running at 11:30 (bars stay open until 3, cab is $15-20 to get back).  It was also cold on our weekend -- too cold to be on the water.  Parking was limited - when the hotel was full; several cars were double-parked.  The workout room is not in the building- you have to take a shuttle bus to it. Odd. Guess it was really built for the golfers using the course. The course looked great - well maintained. Super nice driving range as well.  They do rent clubs and, oddly enough, New Balance workout gear.  Beautiful landscaping, a Starbucks inside and pretty good service made the hotel shine.It ok. It was clean and comfortable.The Westin in Savannah is one of the best hotels in Savannah.  I should know; I grew up there.  It is probably the largest hotel in Savannah, and it is very luxurious.  Unlike every other hotel in the downtown area, the Westin has a vast courtyard and pool area.  The Westin is actually located in South Carolina (on the North side of the river).  All of the other hotels are located in Savannah (on the South Side of the river).  The best things about the Westin's location are the following:1. Lots of Room:  Since the Westin is located across from River Street and not on River Street, there is not much development.  That means that when the Westin was built, they had a vast amount of land to work with.  Therefore, unlike other hotels in the area, the space is not cramped.  2. Great Views:  Since the hotel is located on the South Carolina side of the river, you have an extensive view of downtown Savannah. 3. Peace and Quiet:  The Westin is not a ""party"" hotel.  The party occurs on River Street, so even if you are out on a Saturday night, you will not have partygoers hanging out around your hotel.  If you want to partake in the festivities, there is a free ferry that will take you to River Street and back to the hotel.  There are two downsides to this, though.  The last ferry runs before midnight, so you need to grab a taxi if you stay out late.  Also, the ferry comes every 20 minutes.  This is fine if the weather is nice.  Otherwise, it feels like forever.  I would certainly stay at this Westin again.  As with all Westin hotels, the rooms and beds are very clean and comfortable.I was not impressed with this Westin. The hotel/resort itself is beautiful, but compared to the Westin standard I am used to in other large cities, the rooms were subpar. The decor was outdated, lumpy beds and extremely low ceilings. Also, despite being pretty high up I could still hear footsteps everywhere and could definitely hear the party in the next room. Also, keep in the mind that the ferry stops running at midnight, so plan to take a cab if you are going to be out late.If your wondering if you should spend the extra money and stay across the river from Savannah, the answer is YES!!!!!!!!!! So pleased with our stay this past memorial day weekend.Beautiful hotel and grounds. Friendly staff. They have free fresh peaches, lemonade and bottled water in the lobby for arriving/departing guests. A small starbucks in the hotel. You can grab a coffee to go! The pool is beautiful. Jacuzzi is great. Chairs are nice. Hammocks and firepits around the property. Plenty of places to hang out outside night/day. Pool closes at 11 pm. The room was really nice too. We had a river view with a balcony. I highly recommend it!!! Great view of Savannah's river street down below. Flat screen TV and coffee maker with starbucks and small fridge. There is a free ferry that leaves every 20 minutes across the river to River Street this added to our vacation, it was a nice 5 min boat ride...we really liked it. It runs from 9 am to midnight!FYI- it's $22/day to valet park at the hotel.Clean,  modern with a great view of Savannah ' s historic River street. Offers free convenient ferry into the historic district.The golf course is kind of boring and with any real challenges. The general conditions the course is only fair. This is really a 3-star facility throughout. Should not be paying over $100 for this course.When I stayed in Savannah, I wanted to stay somewhere nice. So I booked (at the time) the only 4Diamond property in the area.  I am also a Starwood member so I thought that would help with points too.I ended up staying for 3 nights.  I brought my ford escape to be valet parked mind you.The property is beautiful mind you, and the front desk was nice as well.Then I got up to my room.  I wanted some coffee and low and behold there was mold and a used filter in the machine.  Couldn't use a cup because there was ash in one of them and lipstick all over the other one.  Not sure what had happened but I have never experienced that in even a low end hotel.When I left, I handed the valet my card, and I wait about 10 minutes, only for a Cadillac to come up.  Would have been wonderful if only I drove a Cadillac!Thankfully after another 10 minutes, I got my car back.I know we all have bad days or whatnot, but this to me just seemed like one thing after another.  Unfortunately I have not given it a second chance.I hope other people have had better experiences here because it is such a beautiful property and I am a huge fan of Starwood.I do not recommend staying in this hotel.  I stayed here for two nights after spending the four previous nights at the Andaz across the river.  I paid less at the Andaz during the week (but, also on Halloween night) than I did at The Westin over the weekend.  The Westin is across the river so you have the huge inconvenience of having the wait for the not-so-short ferry ride across the river.  While parking may be ""free"" at the Westin, you do have to pay a resort fee, which isn't cheap, and you don't really get much for it.  I wasn't there for the golf or the spa, so maybe if you are, it would make a difference.  However, while the rooms have been updated, they do still look dated, however, this place is fairly clean.  The employees were not nearly as friendly as those at the Andaz, and while the beds at the Andaz were so comfortable, the beds at The Westin were hard as a rock.  I got a kick out of the commercials that kept running on the TV for The Westin, which kept referencing the luxurious comfort of The Westin's beds.  Also, if you do have a dog with you, the dog fee is pricey (~$100). Overall, this hotel would not be my first choice for accommodations in Savannah.Went here with my wife after I dropped off my brother at GA southern because he was starting school there. I found a good deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and got the room at $100 a night instead of $159My wife treated me to the spa treatment there where I got massage, first facial and manicure. I fully enjoyed the spa treatment. Ferry runs all day from westin to river st all day. We ate and got drunk on river street after visiting couple of the bars there, but we didn't have to worry about driving anywhere or catching a cab back to the hotel because of the ferry ride back.as for the room....it was up to expectations of any 4 star hotel..loved the moon lounge at the lobby because we came back from river st on the ferry and decided we were not drunk enough and had more drinks at the bar. We stumbled to our room but all in all, it was good stay for a one day getaway trip...  it was bitter sweet leaving but I would definitely stay here again.Every day of our three night stay was so very good. This has to be the best place in Savannah to stay for location, view and pool. Only negative was the concierge so by pass him, always seemed to busy but no one was ever there and make your first stop the visitor center for information on where to walk and the free local bus. Can head on over to Savannah via the ferry boat, saw dolphins every day!Had a wonderful stay at The Westin Savannah Harbor over Memorial Day weekend. This is a beautiful hotel right on the river. We were a little hesitant that we would have to take the ferry over to River Street, but it really was quite easy and took no time at all. It's free! The only downfall, they stop running a little before midnight, so cabs might be necessary for the end of the night. The rooms were nice, big and very clean. Decorated in like a traditional Westin with the heavenly beds and contemporary furnishings. The lounge downstairs had a make your own bloody mary bar, and the other drinks were great there, but the food was just so-so for the price. They also have a nicer restaurant on the 2nd floor, the Aqua Star, but I did not eat there during my stay. The concierge was super helpful. I asked her for dinner recommendations, and she made us a reservation at her favorite restaurant, and we were not disappointed. The pool was lovely, and very resort-like. Nice, comfortable lounge chairs, and a few cabanas for rent. Poolside bar, waiters, a hot tub, along with music really added to this feel. Since this was a busy weekend, it was a bit difficult to get a chair if you weren't out there early.  There are also fire pits by the pool, and sitting out there at night with a cocktail was beautiful. We saw 3 weddings taking place over the course of our stay, and this would really be a beautiful place to get married in the courtyard, overlooking the river and historic Savannah. Overall, the Westin greatly enhanced our stay in Savannah.From the beautiful Egyptian cotton sheets to the pina coladas next to the saltwater pool overlooking the Savannah River, everything about our stay was amazing. We booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for a king room and got an incredible deal. This will be my first choice for future trips to Savannah. Only complaint: We couldn't try the room service because I just couldn't justify paying $18 for your basic bacon and eggs breakfast. Maybe next time.","This Westin lives up the normal Westin standard.  The hotel is beautiful and is across the river from Savannah.  At first, I was annoyed, but it allows you to be close and keep the riff raff out.  You simply take the free ferry ride across.The staff was amazing upon check-in, luggage service to housekeeping.  Lauren from South Africa was so friendly.  The concierge was extremely helpful.  Also, room service was really great.  We had the seafood pot pie and seafood special.  Pretty fast and fairly priced.We would definitely recommend this place if staying in Savannah!My only recomendation is that the valet parking be included in the resort fee.  I would gladly justify the resort fee for that.Very nice hotel indeed.  It had the perfect location, right across the river from all the restaurants, bars and historical places to visit.  All we had to do was jump on their free ferry service and they will take us to Savannah.The hotel room was impeccable.  Vary spacious and a great view of the entire Old Town Savannah.  The hotel's grounds are well manicured gardens that lead you to their pool.  We will definitely be back for a longer stay.I would not recommend this hotel. Although this is my  first day here- so far- I am not impressed at all. I came here to celebrate a friends 50th birthday, hoping to do something special for her. Unfortunately this hotel was not a treat and far from what the advertisements present. From the minute we drove up, this hotel was a huge disappointment. Although the lobby was attractive, the staff behind the desk were not welcoming at all. The lobby has the distinct feel of a convention center - not the feel of a 4 star luxury hotel. The first room we were given was dirtier than any hotel room I had ever visited. When we complained, we were moved to another room which was equally as dirty. Dust on all surfaces, dirt underneath the glass on the desk etc. Sounds hard to believe but it's the truth. The evening before we stayed at a Springfield Suites at the RDU airport and the room there was superior to the room here. I begged for my money back for the next two nights only to be told that it was not refundable. I chose this hotel because of the spa- only to be told upon arrival that you have to take a shuttle to the spa. We ordered a movie and it lost the signal throughout the second half of the movie. The only positive things I have to say is the manager, Greg was very apologetic and did get the maids to clean the room. The concierge, Phil was also most helpful. Fool me once- shame on me- fool me twice -well that won't happen. Stay at another hotel- it can't get much worse!I had a pretty disappointing time here. We incurred a $20 a DAY resort charge through Priceline that was not mentioned anywhere. This fee apparently covers complementary services, like the water ferry and coffee. Westin management and corporate gave us the runaround when discussing the mysterious fee for at least an hour. The pool was disgusting. Get a tiny bit in your mouth and enjoy the delicious salt water and sewage flavor.We booked a last minute trip to Savannah and wanted to stay someplace nice. The Westin deemed to be the place, however it was disappointing. More than half of the rooms face downtown Savannah and the harbor yet the placed us in a lower level room overlooking the parking lot. We heard car engines throughout the night. Did I mention this place was NOT booked up and was actually pretty empty--according to the bellhops and bar tender. The bathroom had an unpleasant odor the second we entered the room. The air conditioning was only operating as a fan with the room never fully cooling off to be comfortable. Added to that, they offer workout gear to rent but when requesting a pair of sneakers, an hour later they called to say they didn't have them. The only positive experience were the pleasant and helpful bellhops, the bar tender and the pool. Otherwise, I would do further research into another place to stay upon a return.I love Westin hotels but this location is 3 stars at best.  I wouldn't really call it a spa by southern standards.  We only stayed one night and passed on the 20 dollar extra resort fee that they tried to charge us.  The boat ride was pleasant and it looks like that they went a little on the cheap side with the renovations so that i may have lost some of its older charm.  It is a big place and when you check in you don't get much organized information about what the hotel has to offer.  For example we didn't even know there was a tennis court nearby.  I would love to come here again when things have improved.Views are spectacular and encountered no rude employees like we did at the Andaz......we split our vacation between 2 hotels.  Now we know our favorite:)  The pool is beautiful!I had a horrible experience at this Westin and will not be returning ever. 1. Items went missing from my suitcase. I alerted the hotel over the phone as I realized this once I was unpacking. I left multiple messages and NEVER got a response...just promises that the manager would get back to me. Never did. I finally contacted my Platinum Ambassador and Starwood directly. I finally then got a response from the property, but they basically said there was nothing they could do, and the person I left messages with no longer worked there. Totally unacceptable and they did NOTHING to help me or offer any solutions. The items that I believe we're stolen from my bag were very special to me, and they did not even acknowledge my concern. 2. I used Platinum Suite Nights to upgrade my room.  The 'upgrade' was terrible. It was a room attached to another room. Definitely a joke and certainly was not a Suite. 3. Staff at hotel seemed to care less my guest and I were even there. They were not friendly, not accommodating with our requests, and quite frankly rude. 4. The pool area is not nice. It was bug and insect infested and the water was an odd shade of green. I did not get in. I left with bug bites. Overall, extremely disappointed with The Westin Savannah and Starwood in General for this poor experience and lack of responsiveness. Ruined my vacation.We had a great stay even though we only stayed 3 night nice people. A few pointers Great poolNice roomsGood service Good ferry service Cool view of the golf courseWe pulled in to valet park, &amp; just sat...while to big guys argued and laughed about who's turn it was... And how hot it was...We let ourselves out, carried our own bags in... ""wanna valet it!?"" the dude barked at me as I walked by... No not now I said.  "" then gimme your keys I gotta move it"". I ignored him.  We carried our own stuff up after parking our own car... Dinner in aqua-star was good but the place was about empty and they still sat us next to a PA speaker, we couldn't hear ourselves think.  We got up and moved ourselves.Last night  We ordered our breakfast in bead to be delivered. Today it arrived completely wrong.  I called and let them know at the front desk and the woman said  ""so what do you want?  Another breakfast?"". I give up.... We have one more night here, then I'm going to need a vacation. Much nicer to stay at the HHI Westin.Yes, we live in Savannah but stay here often. Great location to riverstreet...you can take the ferry over. Great prices for this upscale hotel, rooms are great, the bed is to die for, amazing views.My girlfriends and I recently ventured to Savannah for a bachelorette party weekend. Aside from the pretty penny that a night in this hotel costs (let alone 4 nights), we loved everything about the Westin, especially the hotel bar, Midnight Sun Lounge Bar, where they serve up delicious dirty martinis. As far as the amenities, the hotel is situated on it's own private road in the heart of the historic Savannah River District. The rooms were spacious, the beds were comfy, and housekeeping very graciously dealt with all of the penis-themed decor we had strewn across the suite. If you stop by the lobby bar, say hello to our buddy Edgar.Excellent location &amp; service! Hotel and pool are along river across from downtown Savannah. Free shuttle ferry every 20 minutes or so to take you across the river. Fitness room is away from hotel at golf course about 1/4 mile walk away, but it's well equipped.Great location - awesome golf course and spa.  There is a free ferry that quickly transports you to the other side where all the shopping and restaurants are.  They have a great outside pool right on the river and there is pool service.  The loungers are really comfy and plenty of seating areas.  Outside propane fire places that throw enough heat to keep you cosy as you enjoy the gorgeous weather.   Our room was clean and well-appointed.  I found the customer service to be excellent - the staff, especially Leah and Stephanie, were awesome!This hotel saved us after a nightmare experience over at one of the ""resorts"" on Tybee Island. We managed to get out of our stay over there, and when we called the Westin they were more than happy to accommodate us... even at 99% occupancy on a Saturday night.They assured us that even though there were no more river front rooms available, they did have a room for us. Upon check in, we were given a free upgrade to the 15th floor with a private balcony. Even the non-river-front rooms still have a great view of the river and some golf courses.The staff was friendly, helpful, and truly saved our anniversary weekend.My wife and I stayed here in November 2012.  We planned a last minute anniversary trip to Savannah after Hurrican Sandy ruined our primary plans.  But this alternate trip turned out to be a great one.  My wife suggested The Westin after she stayed here for a work trip.  Even though the hotel is not in town and across the river, we didn't mind taking the free ferry into downtown.  The room rate was much lower than the comparible hotels in downtown and seemed like it had much more to offer.  The gentleman that checked us in gave us a room with an awesome view of the river.  I think we were supposed to be on the other side, but he must have switched us once he heard it was our anniversary.  He also had a bottle champagne sent to our room for free.  What a nice guy.  I wish I remembered his name.We didn't bring our son, but the hotel looks like it caters well to kids as the property has avilable recreational games.The spa service was just as great as the guy that checked us in.  The spa is a short walk from the hotel at the golf club house (less than 1 mile door to door).  The spa was very clean and relaxing.  The hotel has a complimentary shuttle to take you to the spa and other areas of the resort.They also have complimentary bicycles for guests to use.  We took advantage of the bikes and rode around the property and on the racetrack next to the hotel.  Yes, a real racetrack.  If there are no races going on, people can take their cars, motorcycles, even bicycles on them.I would definitely come back to the WestinI always love staying at Westin Resorts and this one is hands down a favorite.Check in was seamless and the customer service was stellar. I had a room overlooking the Savannah River which was a big plus. The bedding and pillows were comfy, fluffy, down filled (a must for Miss Mira) and the room was spot on clean.The hotel is directly next to the convention center which is super convenient as I had to work a booth there all week. Central Savannah is a ferry ride away...not at all inconvenient and was actually quite fun, especially at night after a few pops.If you are the type to work out while on the road, the gym is a little trek down the road located at the golf course. There is also a spa for those who need a little pampering. The hotel bar was a lot of fun and has a decent wine selection.Loved my stay here and did not want to return to Cali.My wife and I opted for a bit of a staycation for our second anniversary and we ended up deciding between the Avia downtown and the Westin across the river. I'm happy that we ended up at the Westin because the view out our window really made the difference.There was a beautiful wedding going on that evening so we got some additional lovely scenery on the house. The pool was inviting as was the hot tub later that night. Expect a mix in clientele, as we were privy to some jackassery upon walking in the door: a couple of frat 'nozzles acting like gay stereotypes because ... honestly, I don't know why. Some people just die without attention I guess.That said, most everything was great but menus were decidedly sparse at their cafe and the waitstaff was slow to take orders. Other than that everyone was friendly and helpful.""little slice of heaven""Great getaway nested in Savannah, Ga.  Came here to visit and instantly fell in love with the place.  How can you beat a place where you take water taxi across to River Street~!  If you are planning to stay, request for room with river view ( highly recommended). It was amazing to watch big cargo ships pass by while sitting down in your room.  Staffs are nice and ambiance is just heavenly.  Room:  AStaff: AOverall:  AVery disappointed with the level of service here. We are very familiar with the Westin and its usually our  standby go to for a quality stay. This is our second night: NO turndown service, no replenishment of soap and lotion after first day, towel that was hanging over bathroom door - not picked up. No replenishment of coffee or tea in room. We had to call for more towels today, they didn't restock  us. Very disappointed.","['wife', 'night', 'drove', 'north', 'member', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'extremely', 'happy', 'start', 'staff', 'fantastic', 'walking', 'reservations', 'went', 'lot', 'discount',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-savannah-desoto-savannah,Hilton Savannah  DeSoto,3.0,$$$,117,"Location: It can't be beat. It's in the heart of Savannah's historic district and is walkable to everywhere. If you don't want to walk, you can Uber for 5 bucks. Amenities: The gym and pool area are great! The gym had treadmills, elliptical, stationary bikes, free weights, and medicine balls. Everything is in newer condition and clean. The pool goes to 9 feet deep and has ample seating and views.Breakfast: Wow. This breakfast buffet (that comes with your room) has everything. Scrambled eggs, omelette bar, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, biscuits n' gravy (THE BEST OF MY LIFE), fresh fruit, cheeses, smoked salmon, pastries, bagels, croissants, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, assorted juices....am I missing anything? Probably. Room: I had to take into account that this is an older hotel. A lot of fixtures are old and rusted. The shower curtain definitely needed to be changed to a new one. The beds weren't made with a fitted sheet but a bed sheet, a comforter, then another bed sheet. We had a leaky toilet the second day we were there but it was fixed within 5 minutes of us calling downstairs. I would have given this hotel 5 stars if they did some updated renovations to the room.Not impressed. I checked in and was told that <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> had booked me a smoking king size room instead of a non-smoking room and they told me they had a double bed room if I would take that so I said fine. I've actually gone back to my <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> booking since then and my reservation said NON-SMOKING. I checked in to the room and it was right by the elevator and was a handicap accessible room so the sink was super tiny and it was a stand up shower where the water went ALL over the floor in the bathroom while/after you showered. I wish they would have mentioned that when asking me if it was okay to switch. Then I left something in my car so I had to get someone to take me down to the parking lot to grab it (under the building). Well this person (a valet) told me three times how hot I was and asked me what I was doing later and told me what time he gets off work. Not appropriate. Lastly, the room was dirty. I dropped my fitbit on the floor one night and it went under the bed and I saw M&amp;M's, someone's earring, trash, etc all under the bed. Also the toilet had black scuff marks all over it and the sink in the bathroom was covered in dirt. I run conventions and was there to check out a convention and their convention work was horrible as well. Water stains all over the ceiling in the ballroom and water glasses were never refreshed when people wanted something to drink in a conference room.Bad on all counts.04/15, 1-night stay.Pros: The location, valet, grand lobby, and views from my corner room. Also, when I arrived late in the evening, although the gift shop was closed, a lady at the front desk opened it to help me purchase some items. (I regret that I've since forgotten her name.) Also, I believe wifi was free.Cons: I wish the decor of the grand lobby was reflected in the room itself. In short, it was old. And not ""historic"" old, but more like ""outdated,"" ""unkept,"" and ""in disrepair."" The window curtain was falling off the rail and the bathroom reminded me of something you'd see in an old gym. I wish I'd had shower shoes! (My included photos tell a better story than my words can.) Overall, I believe the quality of the room wasn't commensurate with the price I paid for it.Savannah is easily one of my favorite cities in the country, after having lived there for a year. I decided to stop in for a night (on a long drive from TX to MA) and visit some old friends. This hotel was sufficient for a one night stay.Wish I would have read Alie's review prior to booking. I would recommend reading that before booking...it is very accurate.This hotel is in a great area, really conveniently located. The staff are great. However...The original hotel that stood on this site was a historic masterpiece. They tore that down in the 1960s to make a 60's plain brick hotel...blah.  Now the 'new' hotel needs updating.  Badly.When I walked into the lobby, I was charmed...when I got to the blah floors/guest rooms, I was disappointed.The hotel has odd artifacts from the original hotel sprinkled in. They do not look like they fit. Example, what is with the lion figure head spewing water out of it's mouth outside the front door onto the sidewalk?  And the DeSoto sculpture in the lobby?The rooms look like they tried too hard, but in the 1960's...southern decor meets what?  And weird, creepy pictures on the walls. Why are there sketches of girls playing with an early hula hoop?  And a sketch of a woman sleeping. Why?The room is dated. The vents are rusty and dirty. I cannot find out how to change the temp in my room (the thermostat won't change). The bathroom has a dated shower, and needs caulking and paint.  I can clearly hear my neighbors in the hallway and next door talking about their plans for the day (for hours!).I left the room at noon, and came back around 5pm from sightseeing and my room was not clean.  Disappointing.  Also, there is no laundry facilities in the hotel, nor nearby.  When I asked the front desk for options, they said Mon-Fri they could send out dry cleaning...too bad it was friday night and I was leaving on Monday morning.  This hotel is not historic nor is it up to date. I don't know what else to say...the pool was nice, if you like pool decks from 1962.  I would stay downtown, by the river, at a full service hotel.The Hilton Savannah DeSoto hotel is old time classic hotel located in the heart of Savannah's Historic District, near dining, shopping and theater districts, and many things to do. I rented a car at the airport. I only had to drive about 20 minutes from the Savannah/Hilton Head (SAV) International Airport to the hotel. The hotel only offers valet parking, which added another $25 to my hotel bill.There was a very nice letter in my room from Kevin B. the hotel's GM recognizing my Hilton Honors membership status and inviting me to the complimentary breakfast buffet. After I checked-in I was able to walk to the Riverfront Plaza, River Street and City Market. I was here for business meetings at the second floor meeting rooms. The service in the meeting rooms was above average. The pool and fitness rooms are located on the second floor.I was only here for one night. My hotel room 1206 had some great views, which you can see from my pics. My room was only $119 or about $136 with the taxes. I really liked this hotel and Savannah the oldest city in the U.S.A. I would recommend and return to this hotel.Check out my other Savannah reviews.The rug doesn't match the curtains.It's an old 'historic' hotel.      The lobby has been redone and is quiet nice.    The rooms try to be nice but it's kind of lipstick on a pig........the furniture is nice but you can't help notice the old shower, the water dribbled.....felt a bit dusty.Overall it's in a good location and was fine for a 1 night stay.I will say service was great, everyone was super friendly!Older property located in the heart of Savannah.  Rooms themselves are a bit dated and the air conditioning was fair.  Getting the car from valet can be slow at times during busy hours.We went during Mother's Day weekend so the place was packed.  We did eat in the hotel restaurant for a few meals.  We had free breakfast which was a standard buffet.  One night we had dinner which I enjoyed a lot because the dining room was not crowded.  Then finally we had a special Sunday brunch which was good, but felt a bit too much like a wedding.Check in and check out was painless and the staff was very friendly.  For overall location, I would probably stay on River St. again instead of this property.The staff was the best part of our stay. Every single person we spoke with was extremely helpful and kind. We left our car at the valet and didn't see it again till we left. We were on the 11th floor corner view, well worth the money. Also had a balcony with a view of the city and we saw the fireworks from there without having to fight the crowds. Bed was comfortable but the pillows left a lot to be desired. The pool is on the 2nd floor and has a view opposite the city. We ordered room service for lunch and it was excellent. Extremely surprised for hotel food. Hotel is in a great location of savannah,  not to busy but just enough surrounding to walk to.I liked the location and feel of this hotel.  Got a great price from Priceline through ""name your own price"" of 99.00 per night.  They charge $ 25.00 per day for valet..... like everyone else in Savannah.  Ask for a higher floor room with a balcony. Our room was clean with Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathroom.  I would bring my own pillow and also a small fan to block out sounds coming from the hallway at night etc.   For the price, you can't beat it.From the very moment I arrived here at the Hilton Desoto, I felt like I was home. As a HHonors Member I was welcomed by name by the front desk staff. The lobby is beautiful and should, itself, be an exhibit in a museum. The entire staff is so friendly and accommodating. I am required to make a trip to Savannah twice a month. I am happy and proud to say, this is my Savannah home!I'm so happy to be here! This is a beautiful hotel with amazing rooms. The check in process was easy and the concierge was very helpful and sweet! Our room is amazing with breathtaking views! The room is very clean and we love the decor!GREAT front desk service. I wish I remembered the girls name who checked me in because she was fantastic. Gave great advice on local places to dine and explore. The room was beautiful and had a great view from the balcony. However it was a little weird that the balcony didn't have any furniture on it despite being large enough. The concierge was also great as she booked us a haunted pub crawl. My one complaint is that the room got sweltering hot in the middle of the night and none of us could figure out how to change that.  Note** parking is expensive ($25 per night)! But there are parking decks within walking distance that are half the price or free!I would like to begin this review by stating that, in terms of the room itself, this is the worst hotel experience I've ever had.With that being said, let me list the reasons:- Upon arrival, we (my fiancee and I) discovered that there were blood stains on our pillow.- The next morning, we discovered a scummy, crusty, gummy substance on the topsheet that happened to be in the general region of my face all night.- Possible blood stain in the basin of the shower.- The very white, white-haired lady that checked me out after  breakfast the next morning was snooty and arrogant, as though it was below her station to even look at me.- The shower was extremely difficult to turn on the first time, to the point that we were afraid we were going to break the handle trying to turn it.- The shower temperature fluctuated wildly, ranging from ""temperature I wanted it to be"" to ""literally scalding hot."" Luckily for us, the shower made a ""FWEEEEE!"" sound before it decided to shoot out the boiling hot water, and the shower was spacious enough to avoid it.- There was a nasty, hard, white scum on the front of the sink beside the towel bar.- The wifi was spotty and occasionally ridiculously slow.- Nearly every chair in the entire building was uncomfortable, as though they made a concerted effort to deter lounging/resting.- The front desk tried to charge us for the room that was already paid for, then called us when the bank denied their attempt.- Most of the analog TV channels were fuzzy and nearly unwatchable.- The chairs in the conference areas were absolutely filthy and horrendously stained.- On our final night, we discovered that our down feather blanket was shredded in the corner and was spewing feathers everywhere. We called the front desk and asked if we could get another one. A half hour later, no one arrived. We called down a second time, and after a total of 45 minutes, we were finally able to get another blanket. The guy who delivered it to me was very rude, and acted as though I was inconveniencing him by having a shredded blanket. After we shut the door, we inspected the blanket; it too had a gaping hole in it, all the way at the bottom. At this point, we were too tired to wait another 45 minutes, so we called it a night. we're still picking feathers out of our belongings three days later.- The next day, the only item I ordered from the ""Grille"" was macaroni and cheese. It was still cold in the middle. I didn't care. I just wanted to get the hell out.Now, for all these grievances, the hotel did do SOME things right: Most of the staff was very polite and helpful, including the Starbucks girls and the valets, and the pool was lovely. That's about it.Hung up on me when I got wrong dept. Then called to ask if they still had great buffet. They said yes unenthusiastically. I figured go see. Went checked buffet . lady was wondering about saying no food on a 22.00 buffet. I made same conclusion . low county boil looked like was sitting for hours. Half the food they used to have. Low end fried seafood instead of fresh. We walked out. No greeter.This Hilton location was satisfactory, although there are some maintenance oversights and thin walls which detract from the experience somewhat.Pros:+ Free Wi-fi.+ Beautiful views of Savannah from almost every room.+ Friendly front desk staff.+ Great location central to Savannah, in walking distance to River street and many other attractions.+ Climate control works well.Cons:- The only parking option is valet for $25 per night.- The gym is relatively nice, with free weights, a large rubber floor mat, elliptical, bike and multiple treadmills.  Unfortunately, the machines have not been well maintained (buttons were inoperable on the elliptical), and the air conditioning in the gym doesn't work so be prepared to sweat.- We were woken up many times by the sound of doors slamming down the hallway.  Walls are thin here.Just checked in I can't believe my eyePooped in toilet..The glass was greasy and someone's lipst was half wiped...Disappointed! !!!!!!!!!!Five star customer service. Check in, valet, customer service were all very accommodating and friendly. They really go the extra mile. We asked for a roll away at check in and it was in our room when we opened the door. We then received a phone call from the front desk asking if we needed anything. Then when we were down in the lobby again they asked how we were and if we needed a map. Parking is $20 a night and there is valet service. You can request your car as often as you need to. The location of the hotel is good. You are close to a lot of landmarks and small boutiques. The lobby is pretty and well maintained. They serve Starbucks and have a restaurant. We did not eat at the restaurant, so I am not sure how good the food is. The rooms are clean but outdated that is why I gave three stars. Beds are uncomfortable and pillows are too, unless you like really flat pillows. Bathroom is really small and falling apart. The shower has great water pressure with plenty of hot water. But why don't they have a fan? Also room had a great view. I think the room is average but does not seem like a Hilton to me. I have never stayed in a run down Hilton before.This hotel seemed to be very centrally located, a few blocks off the interstate and within walking distance to the river (about 6-7 blocks), civic center (3-4 blocks), oodles of shopping and dining options in every direction, parks and landmarks. Our party was able to comfortably walk to all planned events.The lobby area is quite large and tastefully appointed, with bright elegant chandeliers. The guest room was slightly dated (we had a standard room with two double beds) but a decent size and it was clean and comfortable; the bathroom was also slightly dated and very, very small. We did not visit the pool, fitness center, or any on-site dining.Our room was on the 7th floor and offered a beautiful view of the historic district and the bridge. It was, however, just off the elevator and the alarm went off several times during the night (waking me each time). I think the walls may be a little thin as I could also hear an infant crying in an adjacent room and other guests as they passed outside the room.Well unfortunately I couldn't help but to stay here bcus of the group I'm with. But, as soon as I arrived the front is full with bellman out front. Not ONE attempted to assist with my luggage. But, one did direct me to the pathway to roll my luggage up. Then I get to the desk to check in and it's ladies #guest at the desk complaining that $350.00 was stolen out of their car from someone in the Valet Parking Services. They just arrived as well... LOL! Lord keep me near the cross. I have to be here until Saturday... uhThe guest services / reception was warm and welcoming.  Very nice and our room was ready early!  The hotel is also in a great location.The bummer parts:1.  The room was a little old and dingy, there was paint coming off in the bathroom, etc...2.  Very load by the elevator is where our room was and unfortunately at 7:30am we had cleaning crew up there, talking loudly, opening and shutting doors and the elevator going up and down.I would probably stay there again, but not at that price point.  There are tons of other hotels in the area with better prices that are quaint.Not a terrible experience, but not the best experience I've had.  The hotel staff were all very kind, which was a plus!","We were not given the type of room booked. The room was in need of renovation. One of the pictures in a grouping was missing with one hook and a hole remaining. A lot of rust on metal grate in bathroom. Upholstered chair had a broken leg. Paint was peeling on bathroom door. Carpet was old and dingy.  We have stayed here many times. Staff is always courteous. Some rooms are nice, some bad. Location is great. Overall pricey for quality of rooms. Would not recommend this hotel until rooms are updated, then it would be a great experience.Well, I gotta say, MY experience here was GREAT. From start to finish, everything here was outstanding. The people:  Some of the the nicest hotel staff members I've ever encountered anywhere in all my travels. Consistently helpful and smiling although I didn't have cause to ""ask"" for anything, much less complain. The housekeeper knocked at one point and said she'd forgotten to bring washcloths. Very nice lady.Speaking of housekeeping: The room was very clean, the bed just beautiful and inviting. Actually the bed was *extremely* comfortable. And I never sleep well (hardly at all, really) in hotels, whether ""high-end"" or lower-end. Here I slept VERY well -- both nights. Truly amazing. I can hear a twig snap a mile away. Seriously. And I did not hear ""noise"" through ""thin"" walls, or anywhere else. The AC was actually cold enough for me, too.View: Stunning views of the historical area and the river for the Fourth of July fireworks. A Starbucks in the the lobby with a very friendly and efficient barista who actually listened to the drink order and made it perfectly every time. Room Location: This was not the ""penthouse"" or anything, lest you think I paid a top price or something and got a special deal. It was an upper corner room, true. But we didn't ask for that. We are not royalty or with the Hilton management team or anything. Just regular people who booked a room! The check in was easy, fast. So was checkout. Amenities: No problems with the elevators being ""slow"" or anything else, either. On a crazy-busy holiday weekend, too. Ice machine working, everything working in the room. The water pressure in the shower blasted. Better than mine at home.One tiny gripe: The wi-fi in the room was free but very slow. Perhaps the router was too weak to reach our room, because the wi-fi in the lobby was fine.So. As they say, YMMV. But this was my honest experience at the DeSoto and, based on this experience, I wouldn't hesitate to return. Thanks to all the staff and management. Job well done!Came here for brunch on Sunday morning and the food was delicious! I loved that they offered a good range of breakfast and lunch items including a carving station for prime rib or make to order omelettes. They did have some desserts there, however they were not too appealing after eating breakfast food. The staff was courteous and checked on our party of  more than 50 people numerous times to see if we needed any extra beverages during the course of our meal. It was a nice location right across from one of the squares and easily accessible via horse drawn carriages or walking through the beautiful historic district.Great location- room unimpressed, appeared in need of a serious renovation and ""moldy"". Did have a Starbucks in lobby, gym sucked. Again great location and that is it . Very ""moldy"" everywhere in room, gym. Company paid for my room, no way I would ever spend 1.00 to stay there.Stayed here over memorial day and the hotel was not too bad. It's dated and mostly not in a charming way. Rooms need some renovation, because whatever renovations they've undergone previously were done very poorly. The breakfast was excellent and free if you are diamond of course. The dining room for breakfast is gorgeous!It was disappointing to get a downgrade on our room rather than a Diamond upgrade. We had one night booked for corner room and one for regular (don't ask me, hilton reservations department was incapable as always). Upon arrival, they downgraded both nights to a regular as they could not give us a corner room for both nights and I did not want to switch rooms. What a joke!Anyways, this hotel was a great reminder of why I started staying in Starwood now for work. With hilton, you earn up points and status, but rarely get an upgrade or at least a notable upgrade.Not the typical Hilton experience we have grown accustomed to as Hilton Honors members...our room was bare, no fridge, no microwave, small television - when we called to request a fridge and microwave we were informed only certain rooms have them (despite initially being told one could be brought to our room).  This may seem trivial to some, but my family rarely finishes restaurant meals and we had to toss all our leftovers over our three day stay.  The front desk claimed this was because they are a full-service hotel, however, full-service usually means full amenities and convenience.  Definitely not worth the exorbitant price.  The pool was not heated, and in mid October, a heated pool is needed in GA.  The location was convenient.Here I am at the end of my stay at the hotel. I have never been happier to leave somewhere. Let me start off by saying that a room ""upgrade"" means you get the same room but with a balcony. I had to change rooms because of fleas in the bed. After getting a ""upgrade"" I noticed the room smelled better. After the flea incident they gave me free breakfast coupons so I decided to jump on the offer. It was decent and had a buffet that was quite nice. Definitely the best thing they had. The new room starting having AC problems and was so hot we couldn't sleep. After the guy came and fixed it it came down slightly and felt better. I would've given this place 0 stars if I could. Please,Don't do it.Great location and the staff is wonderful!Unfortunately the walls are paper thin!!  The first night we were there we got a noise complaint at 8pm.  To say we were SHOCKED would be an understatement because we were only in our room about 15 minutes and were just talking.  The last day we were awoken by our neighbors just before 9am.  Their singing could only be compared to a Rebecca Black impersonation contest.  Apparently another guest in the hotel complained because we could hear their conversation with the front desk over their noise complaint!!!Trying to get an elevator to go down while staying on one of the lower levels is virtually impossible.  We were on the third floor and mostly used the steps.  When trying to check out with our luggage, it took us about half an hour to get down to the lobby.  The best suggestion I have is to go UP in order to go DOWN.  Otherwise, you will sit and wait forever for any room to squeeze in!If you're looking for a convenient place to stay and don't mind being as quiet as a mouse while you're there, this place is for you!Beautiful welcoming lobby. We really enjoyed the convenience of the valet. Staff was friendly, personable, professional, and happy to share their knowledge or the area with us. Savannah tour information is available in the lobby via a representative. Tickets may be purchased there as well. Great location and only about 15 mins waking distance from the river. I really enjoyed the central air system as it has a heat/ cool option whereas other hotels just have varying degrees of cool air. Only cons:  The bathroom could have been a little cleaner and the shower temperature is dangerous going from a set temperature to burning hot for no reason I could find. The  building exterior could really use some love! This building is an eyesore compared to the historically beautiful architecture found around town.Let's just list the points:1) good rooms.  Larger than most in the historic district, clean and comfy.2) elegance, class, and location!! Yes.yes.yes!3) the views.  THE VIEWS.  Best in the HD!Pros: perfect location; great friendly staff.Cons: VERY thin walls, you will hear your next door neighbor sneeze!  Not the most comfortable bed and low pressure shower. We had couple appetizers at the hotel bar...SKIP eating there..food was flavorless!Wonderful location, friendly staff. Great breakfast with omelette station. Rooms need updating, one out of three elevators working with 15 minute wait to get to lobby to check out--disappointing that no Hilton managers stepped up to manage issue.Stayed here one night on the way for vacation to FL. No street parking, unless your lucky. Parking is in the garage and $25 per night. Must be taken in by valet. Room was super small. The beds were comfy, but the pillows were too soft for me. I used 3 and still sunk to the mattress. The TV channels barely worked. Most were fuzzy. The bathroom was super small. The water pressure was horrible. The shower handle was backwards so hot was cold, etc. after walking around we stopped at the hotel shop to pick up some waters....$3.50 each! Wow. Will not stay here again.Great location, not so great hotel.  First, our AC didn't work.  After a few hours of calling the front desk they finally sent a guy up who said ""there is so much dust in the vent"" that he couldnt get it to work.   So they put us in a new room at 10pm.  Then we saw a roach crawling up the bed, one of those small german roaches.  Also found a dirty fake nail in the bathtub.  The whole place was just dirty.  The breakfast was horrible and over priced. Dont be fooled by the pretty lobby and friendly staff, this place is no good.Not sure why the bad reviews?!  The service here is amazing!!  Check-in took less than 5 minutes, requested a rollaway and it was brought up immediately.  The front desk called 10 minutes after the request to make sure the rollaway made it.  The rooms are super clean, great location, amazing views!   Walking distance from great restaurants and bars and the Savannah museums.  I would highly recommend!  Roof top pool a plus for our 3 year old :). We travel monthly and stay in other Hilton and also SPG hotels; I'm still puzzled as to why people have rated this poorly...Before our stay at the Hilton Savannah DeSoto, we viewed the Hilton as quality. Our last stop at the end of a long trip, we were looking forward to rest and relaxation in a beautiful, somewhat luxurious Hilton room. What we got at this hotel seemed more on par for a hotel less than half what we paid for it and surely something without the Hilton name. Just a few things we encountered during our two night stay:- Too tall for shower. At 5'10"" and 6'1"", my husband and I hit our heads during every shower. So cramped. - Terrible water pressure that went down to almost nothing several times in one shower. - Just two towels. Just two towels was tight when we wanted to take a second shower before housekeeping came. - Dirty. One of our two washcloths fell on floor and was immediately unusable because it was covered in dust. - No pool towels. We visited the pool Saturday morning to find no pool towels stocked. We checked again at the end of the pool visit and still no towels. Had to walk back to the room to grab our used bath towels. - Seat broken. The lounge chair we chose near the pool was broken (usable but the seat back was wobbly). - Clock 90 minutes off in room. Would expect to not have to change the time right after checking in. - Non stop running toilet. All hours of the day and night, our toilet would loudly run. We had to keep the bathroom door shut so it wouldn't wake us. - Thin walls and constant loud noises.- Elevator takes forever to go anywhere. Don't do it.This hotel is right in line with a city that feels like you're stepping back in time. Service was excellent from start to finish. Our room, 1208, was a nice size, well cared for, and had a balcony. The decor is reminiscent of a boutique hotel and didn't feel like the mass-produced laminate junk at most major chain hotels. Style? Southern colonial. After arriving and settling in, we headed downstairs for a cocktail before walking a few blocks for dinner. I'm not familiar enough with the city to say much on the location, but we were able to make due without a  cab, which was nice.After dinner we had drinks next door at The Public and then headed back to the room. The city noise is clear even on the 12th floor but it didn't bother me. We stayed here for one night to break up a drive to Florida, and I'm very happy with the value we got for the price.I want to start off by saying that this hotel has a perfect location.   Tourists can walk everywhere in the historic district from there.  However, there are some goods and bads, aside from the location, that should be considered.  Goods: city view, clean pool, friendly valet/front desk.  Bads: mildew in shower (wear shower shoes) I dropped my soap and just left it...you don't want to touch the dirty floor,  not friendly bell-hop  (he want even ours!), four people were booked into a double room with only a king sized bed; when addressed, previous to arrival, was told a two bed  room should be available to switch (didn't happen).  Maids left bags of laundry outside of our room all evening and night,  and the walls after very thin. NOT what you'd expect from a Hilton hotel.This hotel is really well situated in the historic district, just a couple of blocks from Oglethorpe Square.  The hotel itself was obviously built in the 60s and doesn't really fit in well with the architecture of tge historic district.  Fortunately the hotel has been remodeled.I met my husband here after he had already been at a conference for a couple of days. This room was not ideal and needed some repairs.  The slider to the balcony was off track; some wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom; and the bed was messed up. We asked them to fix the bed, but it wasn't done properly. The front desk moved us immediately to another room with no fuss. The next room was much better with everything in working order. The people at the front desk remembered my husband and I when we passed through the lobby and asked how our new room was working out. We really appreciated the good customer service.So far, so bad.  To a hotel manager that is reading this:  here's how to accommodate weary guests - be considerate.  When someone checks in, and they tell you they've been on a redeye, it's your job to be mindful of this.  Meaning, yes, we got in earlier than the suggested check-in, but what your protocol should be is to prioritize the order in which the rooms are cleaned.  When I went to the floor that you said our room would be on (an hour later), and I see the maid cleaning OTHER rooms instead of the one you directed us to: you either switch us to one of those cleaned rooms OR YOU HAVE YOIR MAID PRIORITIZE THE ROOM FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME IN ON A RED EYE AND ARE WAITING.  To make matters worse, try to wait at the bar and grab a bite and coffee and am told 'the bar opens at 1' when its 12:53?? Really?   I'm usually a Hilton fan, but not here.  Strong dislike.","We got this room as a hatwire hort rate, but the standard price is 239.00.  I would be appalled if we received a room like this one for 239!!  The room itself was horrible.  We were put in a handicap room w/o requesting it which means no tub.  Walls are paper thin and we can hear the elevator ding each time it stops on our floor.  The room smells a bit like smoke too.  The furniture is in bad shape, and the table lamp has a short in it.  Very disappointed.  Room was the only issue.  :(Great rooms, love the views!! The concierge however was not helpful at all and acted as if we were being an inconvenience! But super affordable for the location.Awful !!! I have stayed in $40.00 a night hotel that was cleaner and nicer than this one .. First room we checked into our child complained of bites on his legs and after looking on the bed we spotted what we think was fleas jumping around on the bed . The musty smell of the room should have been a warning sign but what do you expect for $239.00 a night ...after complaining we were offered to move to another room and gladly excepted and even gave us a free breakfast buffet "" Lucky Me"" .. The next room was a little cleaner and less worn but had issues with air condition ... As for the location I have heard rave reviews of the Historical District which is beautiful but lots of homeless people and sketchy people so was concerned about walking around with the family...Can't wait to get out of here and our bad hotel experience made our trip less enjoyable ..Very nice location. Close to everything.  Clean rooms, comfortable beds, good food in the restaurant,  but the staff made the stay even better. The staff was friendly, accomodating, &amp; very professional. Nice views in every room I went into, &amp; some of the rooms have balconies. Get for cigar smokers like me. The bathrooms inside the guest rooms are very small and so is the swimming pool. The gym facilities had state of the art equipment, but not enough of them. You have to use their valet service because they do not offer self parking, but the valet staff were courteous and fast. In a three day stay, I never waited long for my vehicle...&amp; they didn't rob me of my change in the cup holder!For the business traveler, this hotel is adequate. For a vacationing family, maybe not so much. All around decent hotel for Savannah.The Hilton DeSoto is a tired old hotel with a staff to match.  I am a Marriott Platinum member and only stayed here because we were in town for a wedding and the wedding party was staying here.  I'm used to much better service at Marriott's.  Started off by (valet only parking) valet parking.  The attendant wouldn't help get the luggage out of the car.  She went over the car noting every tiny speck of a paint ding as if I were threatening to take her to court over car damage.  Similar experience on the way out - she stared at my luggage with the trunk opened as if it were a UFO until she finally muttered she wouldn't pick it up.  Has NEVER EVER happened in a Marriott before and I probably have close to 1000 nights in hotels for business and pleasure.  The rooms were clean enough but small, including the bathroom - very small.  The front desk folks normally shook their head one way or the other rather than answering questions with words.  Seemed like we were a bother to them.  Other members of the wedding party were treated rudely by the folks at the front desk.   And there was an issue with being put into rooms that were already occupied.  Bar staff was hit or miss; some good service mixed in with head nods and rude behavior, again, as if we being a bother to them rather than a guest.  Rooms came in at about $200 a night - no way worth it.  I do not recommend the DeSoto and if we had to do it again I'd stay somewhere else, wedding party or not.Old, but... Nice and clean.  Very friendly.  Check in and check out was awesome.  Will come back!Pros: location, super friendly staffCons: almost everything else (for the price)First off, we only paid government rate, so at least we didn't pay as much as some people pay for this hotel room which can only justify charging so much because of its location.The pillow cases were dirty when we arrived. They had make-up stains and other miscellaneous stains, so we got most of them replaced, but we're pretty sure that's where my wife got pink eye.The tub would not drain quickly enough, so we were standing in ankle deep water within three minutes of showering. We asked them to fix it, they said they did, they did not. If anything it got worse after they ""fixed"" it.They want $10 a day for wifi, even though my reservation said it was included. (Fortunately, there was a super nice lady that gave me a promo code and it got it for free; that's how they earned their second star)And they want $20 a day for vallet parking (no other parking available), and most other people said it took a really long time to get their car. Fortunately, our car had a roof rack so it stayed on the street and we didn't have to wait. Also, the vallet folks were also very nice while they made people wait. Long story short; if you're staying 1-2 nights, don't have a car, and get a drastically reduced rate then it is a great location, as long as you don't spend a ton of time in your room. Otherwise, there are better places to stay for a lot less.Wow.......such a disappointment for this hotel to be a Hilton! I am a loyal Hilton Honors Member and have never stayed at a Hilton with such low standards. No dusting at all was done (must show you a picture of what I found when I lifted the breakfast menu....OMG) on top of all the cleanness need the room is extremely small for which a guest pays. The best part of my stay was when the gentleman help us to our room making us feel welcomed! I will not be returning here and for others who are planning to come here should be aware of misleading pictures.The most ghetto hotel I have ever stayed in..... Had people on my floor all night loud and inconsiderate for who are sleeping. This is also non-smoking hotel who ever it was smoking.....this night has been unbelievable!I absolutely do not recommend this hotel. Upon our arrival we were met by the valet. However no one else arrived to assist us. I had to ask for a Bellman's Cart and they eventually brought me one. I loaded and transported my luggage which  to me not a big deal BUT, I though I had booked a full service hotel. Okay, I am a big boy and can move my families belongings and so I did. Now after we arrived inside I essentially had to break up a lovely conversation between the two ladies behind the counter. Now I was able to get checked in and headed up to our room. Again, no Bellman, not even an offer for one. Okay,so we are in the room and noticed there is no way to close the door without slamming it. Sorry neighbors, you have to slam the door to close it. Speaking of doors the bathroom door will not close fully and always stayed cracked open a bit. Okay, we are not a prudish bunch no big deal. The room was damp really damp. It felt like a sauna but cool if that makes sense. The condensation accumulates over you in the shower giving you quite a thrill when the ice cold water hits your back. Oh and the mold on the curtain was a lovely shade of dark green if not black. The water on the floor under the HVAC vent made for yet another thrill if you are barefoot. Now back to the rest of the good stuff. Pubic hair was found in the tub, on the counter and in a bed. Oh and the beds, Uncle Fester would love them. If you need a firm mattress bring it with you.  I almost forgot the bar is nice and the beer is cold. The coffee shop serves Starbucks but they are not one and it shows. Not the best coffee and certainly not up to the name they display ""Starbucks"".The balcony was nice and the TV worked well.Checkout was the reverse of checking in. While very nice and polite the counter staff are very lacking in proper training for a full service hotel. I informed the staff I was checking out and yet no one made an offer of assistance. So after paying my bill I asked for a Bellman's Cart.  I found a bellman and eventually asked if I could use his cart. I of course dropped several obvious clues of my pending departure. The lack of intellect perhaps prevented any of them catching on.I loaded up and then went in search of my keys which the Valet had. Finally one person who wanted to do their job.  So if you stay at the Desoto Hilton in Savannah, I can honestly say the Valet service is quite good. The TV has lots of HBO for you to not see while working or out having fun and if you get a balcony you get a great view of the pool, the HVAC roof tops units  (RTU)  Awesome. I would not recommend this hotel and its a shame too. I have been a Hilton member for years and travel a great deal. Maybe motel 6 is more in line with the brand they need to display than Hilton.I know Desoto 6 at least they will leave a light on for you :)I just returned from a very pleasant 2 night stay at the hilton desoto. Great location. An easy walk to the river.  The room was clean, cool and very comfortable.  The bed was perfect.  Beautiful view of the river and city from the 12th floor.  Highly recommend this hotel.We stayed here for a business trip/mini family vacation. Rooms were nice. Beds were comfortable. Pillows left something to be desired, so next time I'd bring my own. The shower was bad - the lever to change the water from coming out of the shower head to the spout was broken so when I gave my son baths u just had to wait and wait while the tub slowly filled via the shower head. And the temp of the water changed a lot during my shower, but maybe that's due to there being people in other rooms showering at the same time. I don't know. Sometimes it would get scorching hot though. The staff however was extremely friendly and helpful. The valet was great. $25/day is crazy expensive though... That's plus tips. I don't mind tipping since I used to wait tables, but it adds up on top of the $25/day fee for parking. The hotel was beautiful and in a great location. Lots of restaurants, parks, shops, etc nearby. We would stay again.I don't have much to say about the Hilton except that I was here as a member of a wedding party.Staff/valet was friendly and attentive, food was excellent, and the room was clean and comfortable with a great city view.Definitely a nice place to stay.  It's not right on the water, but it's all so close because Savannah isn't that big that it doesn't matter.  Stay a little inland here and save some money.This hotel's style isn't exactly my taste. But it's the Hilton's take on the southern comfort style. And it was comfortable. I got the king bedroom with a view of the city. It was a great view. The room was not that big but the gigantic window helped to open the space up. The bathroom was tiny but well decorated. They have all the shower perks but no toothpaste. There's a CVS up Bull Street so you can help yourself. So the room isn't anything impressive. However, there's two great things about this hotel: the location and the service. The hotel is on Bull Street, you get to take a short walk up towards the main shopping area while crossing all the squares. Then south of it you're right across the street from SCAD's admission office where you can take a tour of the school. The service is excellent. I sent a print job of my boarding passes from my computer to the main desk. For somehow reason it didn't print. The guy at the main desk went online and printed them for me himself, which was not something I would expect them to do. I came here on a taxi from the airport. It's a tiny relieve to see there's always taxis waiting outside so you can take off whenever you are ready, without flipping the yellow pages.An excellent stay. The room was spacious and very clean. Great staff that is very professional, courteous and friendly. Walking distance to a lot of Savannah and a great bar in the hotel with a hummus plate that is addicting. The third to last stop in 3 months on the road with the book tour in only Hilton's...This is one of the top ones of the entire tour across the US.The guest services including front desk, valet, and housekeeping deserve 5 stars.  Location is 4.5 stars.  What makes this hotel an overall 3 are the rooms. They are small and dated. Not what I expected for 149 per night. Shower head is poor. Handle was loose and water got cold unless I moved handle back to previous position.  Bed was ok. Not great though. Bathroom small. Rooms are just not upTo date with the lobby or the staff. Overall it's just ok.I wanted to specifically review our dining experience at the DeSoto Grille. We ate the breakfast buffet there for two mornings and I couldn't be happier. It was free (two meal tickets per day for your room) but I would even consider going back if I had to pay. The buffet is $16.00 which is expensive but the buffet contains a full area of fresh fruits (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, and pineapple.) All are delicious and not the typical ""fruit like cocktail"". Other things like bacon, sausage, eggs (and plain egg whites!) grits, oatmeal, muffins, toast, turkey bacon, corned beef hash, and french toast are included. You can request pancakes, waffles, and custom omelettes and they will bring them to you fresh and to order. A selection of juices, teas and coffee are included and available as well. The best part in my opinion was the smoked salmon that is on the buffet. It was so yummy and definitely something that I have never seen on a breakfast buffet. Our server was very nice and accommodating as well. I recommend this place and will be going back next time I am there.We finally made it to Savannah and decided to crash in our hotel room for a while after a long drive.  Our stay was pleasant and the hotel was accommodating to our needs.  It was convenient and within walking district to almost everything in downtown Savannah.  The room was clean and was supplied with free coffee and water bottles each day of the visit.  If you're one that has to have internet, the wi-fi is complimentary for guests.  They have a restaurant, bar, pool with a tiki bar, and valet parking at the hotel.  It's worth the price to pay for the parking since it can be expensive to park anywhere in the city.  I would definitely stay here again if I return to the area in the future.While I am not sure about the staff's recommendations of local babysitting services, they have only been friendly and cordial while I stayed here.  I have chosen to stay here on each of my visits to Savannah because I enjoy the location of the hotel. . . it is quite, full of small shops/restaurants, and a nice coffee shop across the street.  While river street can be fun, I really like the fact that the hotel is away from all the noise of the touristy river street and paula deans restaurant.  However, the Hilton DeSoto is only about 10 streets (10 minute walk) from the river street if you really need to get back there after a nap. The hotel itself seems to be quite old.  The lobby is in fairly good shape, but obviously an old design.  As mentioned above, the staff were great and always said hello as we walked by and made sure we were having a good time.  Be forewarned that they do charge $16 for self-parking and I would imagine several dollars more if you chose to use their valet service.  In terms of the rooms, I have stayed in a room with a king size bed each time which has been extremely comfortable.  The bathroom is outdated, however, the shower pressure was some of the best I have ever experienced (almost knocked me over at first).  Overall I am a fan of the hotel, but will knock it down to 2 stars for the $16 parking fee and outdated rooms, but bump it up to 4 stars for the quiet location and friendly staff.Nice hotel in a quiet, almost residential location.  Property has a bit of character and is very clean.  Staff friendly and helpful.  I personally liked the room decor, done in cool blues rather than standard hotel beige.  Bed and pillows not as comfortable as ones we enjoyed at the Hyatt though.Location wasn't my favorite.  If this hotel was on or closer to the river, it may have been at least one more star, possibly two.  It's a doable walk (13 blocks) to the river and the more touristy things to do.  Not much in the hotel neighborhood itself in terms of bars or restaurants, just one or two of each.  We did have some difficulty getting a cab one night that caused us to be late for and almost miss a birthday dinner reservation.Valet service (an additional $20 per night - ouch!) distinguished themselves though.  We stayed for three nights.  On the second day, we took the car out to go exploring and the valets noticed that something had dripped on the car during its time in their garage.  By the time we checked out (it took some coordination as we wanted to use the car while we were there), valet staff had the car detailed and pristine.Would I stay there again?  Likely yes.Perfect location! Walking distance to just about everything. Stayed here for Thanksgiving weekend. When we arrived the room we chose wasn't available so they gave us an upgraded larger room. We had a balcony with a great city view of the bridge. The rooms were clean. Great soap products and I usually hate them all. They were so good I didn't need to use my own. This NEVER happens. The staff was fantastic! Southern hospitality at it's best. Great restaurants within walking distance along with a market one block away that has anything you could possibly need. No need to stay on River street. My husband and I liked this neighborhood much better than the crowded River street hotels.","Expected more from a Hilton.  On the positive: Staff was very good but very small.  On the negative: Little things are annoying:  The mandatory valet.  My complaint is not due to the cost, which is competitive at $20, but the necessity.  I like having easy access to my vehicle, valet service makes this difficult.  The Bell hop brought an empty luggage cart into a crowded elevator, generally not something you see in a proper hotel.  Air Freshener smell in the lobby is quite bad.  Worst feature was the dining:  We ate at the restaurant one evening due to being too tired to go elsewhere.  Food was sub par at best but top priced.  Fried items were all burned.  Spinach salad had ingredients missing.  Desserts were frozen and the whip cream was out of a can.  Really like Hilton, stayed all over the world with them, very disappointed in the DesotoI was here for a week and as Julie C mentioned if you are here longer than two days you'll start noticing why this place isn't the best besides it's location. The first thing you'll notice about the rooms are that the bathrooms are TINY. There is barely enough room for one person as it's the size of a small 6'  x 6'  closet if I had to guess. The dimensions might say its larger but I highly doubt it unless I just happened to get 'that room'. They seem to try to save on a lot of things as my shampoo, conditioners and soap were not replaced after the second day and they didn't have trash bags in the trash bins. The food is overpriced and not worth it. The elevators are slow. There always seemed to be something wrong with the main floor bathroom as two of the faucets didn't work the entire time I was there in addition to a few of the stalls. The heating and air conditioning in the conference room were miserable as it was either 90 degrees or 40 degrees and it was always on full blast.Great location.  We walked everywhere.  Staff friendly and helpful especially the conscierge.  He remembered where we went and where we dined. He was very helpful.  Didn't spend much time in the room. Very good value.We got this hotel through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> and boy did they make us know that we weren't higher paying customers. First off, parking is expensive so park on the streets- weekends are free and there was a ton even on Easter weekend. When we checked into the grand lobby, the manager was behind the counter too, a middle aged man and they gave us a room with DOUBLE beds for my boyfriend and I. I thought it was a joke. I even let them know that  I write reviews and that I'm even a hilton honors card holder. Didn't matter- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> buyers are guaranteed nothing I am informed. I said ok.......well how much does it cost then to get the room I want? He said no king beds were open that night. I said ok well tomorrow when you do put us into the king room you are going to upgrade us for this inconvenince? He said umm.....no. So we went up to the room. The beds were smaller than the ones at home. I started to cry.I called Hilton's guest services on the hotel phone and a KIMBERLY answered who actually was the same woman who answered the phone earlier and gave us better directions than what we had in the car. I told her how I was so disapointed we weren't treated better at a HILTON and within 5 minutes she had sent a bellboy up with our new keys to a king room!!!So the manager had LIED TO US! Are you serious? We were so impressed with Kimberly's quick action to help us and we are so thankful that we could get the room we desired for our romantic get away.The rooms were nice, the breakfast overpriced so go across the street to the Soho South cafe and get the pecan waffles! Great unique place with fun student waiters. The concierege was a lot of help too, take advantage of their wealth of knowledge but then make your own decisions based on what you read in reviews here too.Up front must admit I did not stay here. I wanted to but I erroneously booked the wrong dates and the hotel was full. However, Raymond, the manager on duty went above and beyond to find me another room closeby. The lobby is gorgeous and every staffmember I did interact with was outstanding. Valet is $20 with unlimited in/out but if you don't need your car there is a garage one block away that is 10$/day but no in/out.  Conference facilities were terrific.Awful Awful Awful.  I'm a very loyal Hilton Honors Member who travels extensively.  This leisure trip was a disaster and ridiculously overpriced.  Hotel was OLD and badly in need of remodeling.  TV didn't work.  Staff blamed Comcast, but I missed all the Saturday afternoon football and it required me to go find a restaurant with a TV.  Then the shower leaked requiring hours of maintenance coming in an out to repair.  Barking dogs outside, paper thin walls (other guests and I were talking about how you can hear conversations from  adjoining rooms).  And although the staff was very nice and tried to be helpful, the stay was a mess.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!  And I can't wait for Hilton to send me their usual email asking how the stay was.Friendly staff &amp; awesome location! This hotel is within walking distance to everything.I came here for a two day conference and initially had a problem with getting a room within the conference block that was set aside for the last night of the conference which would have meant switching hotels or flat out getting another hotel for the entire stay.That eventually got resolved and the suite I got was very nice, indeed.  It's not the absolute quietest place I've ever stayed.  There is another conference or party or something and it is some kind of loud and you can hear people walking up and down the halls when they come in chatting and carrying on.  The rooms, though, is nice and what I particularly like is that there are tons of electrical outlets embedded in the table lamps so I don't have to deal with crawling around for a place to plug in my computer or my CPAP machine (for my sleep apnea).There are other hotel chains that are nicer but for the rate and the general amenities this is a nice place in the historic district of Savannah.T he location is pretty good. However, there are many  thing  that were not.1. $20 parking fee per night 2. $9.95 for WiFi3. No continental breakfast, not even a cup of coffee.4. Not all rooms have a view of the river as stated on their website. Ours did not.For $129 per night, most of the above should have been included.  Our friends stayed a few blocks away for $59 a night, with FREE wifi, FREE continental breakfast, FREE parking. I DO NOT recommend this hotel.This was my first visit to Savannah. I attended a corporate get away weekend and the hotel was a great choice.The Good - The hotel is ideally located in the historic district. Easy walking distance to numerous attractions.Beautifully decorated rooms and common areas.Friendly and cheerful staff.The BadIt can be noisy. I could hear guests in the rooms on either side of me. I prefer not to have an audience when I sing in the shower. I could also hear hallway traffic throughout the weekend.There is no mini fridge in the room.The room doors do not automatically close. I inadvertantly left my door partially open all afternoon. Fortunately, none of my belongings were disturbed.The self park garage did not work properly. I had to buzz the desk for help to get into the garage as the ticket printer did not function. When I checked out, the room key failed to open the gate to exit the garage and I had to buzz the desk once again.The restaurant staff needs to be organized. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. The breakfast buffet is standard Hilton. The first morning that I had breakfast, I was nearly finished with my meal before I got my coffee. I was asked if I wanted coffee by the hostess however she was apparently taking a survey and not actually offering to bring me coffee. Once I received my coffee, I had to flag the waitress down again as I had no creamer. The 2nd visit for breakfast was similar to the first although I did receive my coffee quicker. The wait staff, while friendly, seem directionless.Despite the negatives, I would certainly stay here again. The location is great for exploiring Savannah.This is a below-average Hilton. They don't have queen beds -- the choices are king-sized beds or rooms with two doubles. The housekeeping staff is exceptional -- they're nice, responsive and helpful. Ditto the bell staff. Front desk people are okay. There are add-on charges for most every service (even Internet, for which they charged even though it didn't work), and the pool is small and has no hot-tub. The bar restaurant is far below average and the other restaurant didn't look all that appealing, either. Redeeming points are location and the bell and housekeeping staff.This is my second stay at the Holton Desoto. First off the hotel definitely doesn't disappoint on location. Easy walking distance to so many shops, pubs and restaurants. It's only 1 min away from my favorite pub - sixpence and a short 10 min walk down to River street and city market. The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms are kept up well. Both times I have stayed the staff are so accommodating, friendly and helpful. They go above and beyond in their customer service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting savannah ga!!Nice hotel in a great location.  A bit of a walk to the riverfront, but still very doable.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  There is a Starbucks and full restaurant and bar in the lobby.  Some rooms have a balcony that is accessible from the room.I judge a hotel by its stairwells. And while I don't like to eat, drink, or sleep corporate if I can help it, sometimes conferences happen, and to get the discounted rate and be somewhere close and convenient to the meeting rooms, you gotta' go with the flow.So, the stairwells, huh? Call me crazy, but I am not a fan of hotel elevators. To avoid them, I prefer to walk up and down stairs both for the exercise and to spare myself the long lines and awkward elevator moments of uncomfortable smiles, furtive glances, and polite pushing to enter and exit these ingenious but irritating little metal boxes of miraculous vertical conveyance. It's not that I fear the ride, or am a misanthrope, or object on aesthetic grounds. Indeed, some elevators can be elegant, even enchanting, works of art nouveau, Victorian, or clear-glass splendor, especially those that cling precariously to multistory poured-concrete monoliths while racing up and down the sides of the building at vertigo-inducing velocities.But the DeSoto's 'vators were run-of-the-mill, slow, and crowded. And unfortunately the stairs were even worse: dull, depressing, confusing, and indelibly smoke-scented (from workers or patrons on clandestine and most likely illicit nicotine breaks). They were not done with the attention to detail of someone who actually liked to USE stairs made for walking, but instead they looked and felt like ones that were simply placed there to fulfill the fire code by providing an emergency means of egress when all other options failed.I did use the stairs, but I didn't really like them, There was no marble, no brass, no sign of custodial care, human compassion, or divine spark of creativity here: just hard stone steps and metal hand rails, as cold and emotionless as the mega-motel global corporate empire that has taken over this once-historic, venerable local landmark and sucked out its soul for the sake of quick quarterly profits.Tourist-friendly places like Savannah typically have SCADs (pardon the pun*) of B&amp;Bs and funky little family-owned places (like Gallery Espresso) where you can relax and refuel while touring this alluring little gem of a Southern seaboard city. So do yourself a favor and try one of them next time. I sure will!(*) A less-than-subtle reference to the Savannah College or Art and Design. I think it's a pun, but I majored in History, not English, in college and tend to play loose and fast with the rules of grammar. Are they really rules? Or just recommendations? Either way, my apologies, Mr. Keillor!I wish I could say we had a pleasant stay at this hotel. We recently booked a trip to Savannah to celebrate a special occasion. I used <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> and chose a 4-star hotel in the historic district, and we were given the Hilton Desoto, which I was excited about. I am a Hilton rewards member and have stayed at multiple Hiltons throughout the country, usually always enjoying my stay. Since I was not able to select a room, I called the hotel two weeks in advance to request a room with a king sized bed, as my husband is 6'4. The woman I spoke with said that should not be a problem. Great! Everything was set. We arrived around 5 p.m. on a Thursday and checked in. When I confirmed with the front desk associate about our room, she informed us that there were no rooms with king sized beds available, and we were given a room with two double beds. I told her that I had called the hotel a few weeks prior to request a king sized bed, and she informed me that since I had used Hotwire, my room could not be guaranteed. I was disappointed, but accepted the room. I found it hard to believe that there was not a single room available in the hotel with a king sized bed, so when we arrived in our room, I went on my phone, visited the hotel website and saw that there were indeed rooms available with king sized beds for the dates we were staying. Basically, the front desk associate blatantly lied to my face. I was livid. I called Hilton Rewards right away, and the woman I spoke with was completely rude and unhelpful. Again, she blamed the fact that I used Hotwire to book the room as the reason why no changes could be made. So you're telling me, that even though I am a guest at Hilton, because I went through a 3rd party, nobody can accomodate our needs? I even offered to pay the difference for the room. She told me I had to call Hotwire, and the changes had to be made through them. Great. I called Hotwire, and the girl I spoke with there was actually extremely helpful and sweet, and she put me on hold and called HIlton right away. Amazingly, the associate lied to her as well, telling her that the hotel had ""overbooked"" their king size bed rooms. Funny, as they were still available online. I gave up, upset about the whole situation. After having the worst nights sleep ever and my husband having to move beds in the middle of the night, I awoke cranky and upset. I decided to take a hot shower to make myself feel better but oh! Was there any hot water? No. Lukewarm at best. Fabulous. With my anger beginning to brew again, I decided to call the 1-800 Hilton number to pretend to book a reservation, for a KING SIZED room. And guess what? There was one available! Shocking. I angrily but politely explained our situation to the reservationist, and how I would GLADLY pay the price difference for a room with a king sized bed, and she put me on hold and called the hotel. When she came back on, she told me that the front desk would now be able to switch our room for us. Funny how that happens. I appreciated being moved to a new room, and it was definitely an improvement. As others have complained about, the walls are very thin, and we were right across from the elevators, so we heard just about everything. The maids were also extremely loud outside of our room. Speaking of the maids, on Saturday morning they knocked on our door around 11 a.m., and we hadn't left the room yet, so I told them we'd be out in 45 min. When we arrived back at our room around 4 p.m., our room had still not been cleaned. Lovely. We were tired of complaining, so we just let it be. Sadly, our stay at this hotel has changed my view of the Hilton family of hotels. I 100% would not stay at this hotel again. The fact that they flat out lied to my face multiple times was enough to put me over the edge. I had no idea how different you are treated depending on ""where"" you booked. If you want to be treated well and have your accommodations met, do not book through a 3rd party source. Yes, it will be cheaper, but you will not receive what you want, and no one will be willing to help you.  I sure learned my lesson. Oh and, the valet parking is $$$. But it's pretty much the only choice you have.The service was outstanding! Everyone from the valet, front desk, room service, retail store were all great. The only thing that kept me from giving this hotel 5 stars was the Paula Dean book on display in the hotel store. For me this was a turn off and really unnecessary since it was the ""only"" book on display.Ok what can I say about this place that was good. Ummm. The location is OK. It is on Liberty Street which is about as far out from the historic area as I would like to stay if I was planning on walking everywhere, which we did. But the location was good. What else can I say? Ya that is about all the good that we experienced.Now for the bad:Parking is $20 per day valet only. Weekends are free at the meters around the building as they like to remind you. What they don't tell you is that they lock all the doors, except for the front door, at night. So there is no secure way to get from the back streets into the hotel without walking all the way around the hotel. This is a problem at 2:00am when you do not wan't to walk past the bar on the corner with all the drunk people or the homeless group around the other side. You should have a secure entrance in back that can be unlocked and not just lock the door that is back there.Our room was OK I guess. Our down comforter  had a blood spot on it that we did not notice until the morning because there were sheets on the top and bottom of it. Our AC did not blow air at all. I guess it seeped air at best. So there was no air circulation at all and even though it ran all the time, the room never got below 75 degrees. The bathroom is small and the shower is low. The shower head is about 5'6 high and I am 6'3"" so that was a bit of a problem. The walls are thin.. You can hear everyone walking down the halls and I am sure they can here you.. So not the place to act out your romantic ""50 Shades"" weekend! Did make it hard to sleep in past 8:30 am. Did not try the food because it was too over priced and there are better options around Savannah but the bar drinks were OK. We had to have a drink at the bar because our room was not ready when we tried to check in at 4:00pm. (God only knows I was not going to get back in the car and go somewhere to have to try to find parking again!) So we had a drink. It took us about 15 mins to find the bar tender but, in her defense, she was in the kitchen trying to get other people's food and it was a long walk. All in all, I guess I just expected more for $140 before tax. I do not mind the age of the hotel because you are in historic Savannah. I would even have been ok if it was not as remodeled as some of the other hotels. But it did not WOW me for that price and next time we will spend a bit more money to be at a nicer hotel, closer in the middle of everything and with free parking!As other guests have stated, this is a below average Hilton. Very tired and worn out decorations and housekeeping is inadequate. The staff overall has been the only redeeming quality. Each person I spoke with was incredibly friendly. The location is in a quiet area and is within walking distance of many restaurants, shopping, and historical sites.Not the bestBefore the Hilton, it was a very dated hotel. Hilton's renovations were substandard because it still looks very dated even under Hilton's style.We reserved a non-smoking room with a king bed, but they only a smoking room with a king bed and a non-smoking room with a queen bed (for the handicap). We choose the handicap room. The bed and comforter were nice, but their pillows were horrible. Their room service breakfast was very mediocre, and we hardly ate anything. You'll get better food out of the hotel!","I have been waiting for years to review this hotel! In the past three years, I have probably spent 60 nights (at least) at this hotel. I never wanted to write a review because I always had to stay there for work. I am pretty confident in my knowledge of this location. Let's start with the pros: The staff is really nice! They are always polite, remember your name and ask how your day is going. The beds are comfortable, the showers are large and the rooms are a decent size. If you are a diamond or gold member, ask for a corner room - it is REALLY and spacious. The regular rooms could be a little bigger, but they aren't unbearable. The location is decent... it isn't right downtown on the main streets but it is an easy walk.But then there are the cons... The staff is super nice, but they are not always on top of things. If you stay for more than 2 nights, guaranteed your room will not be fully stocked. Your room will either not have replacement towels or coffee every single day. Sometimes you'll get 4-5 packets of decaf coffee but no regular. If you decide to eat breakfast.. you will wait a LONG time for service. Its a buffet, so this might have something to do with it, but really the service is scary scary scary slow. Sometimes you will be the only person in the restaurant and you will sit for 5-10 minutes before anyone brings you coffee. There have been times when I have finished my meal without even receiving a glass of water. The food is pretty good (unless you go right at the end, in which case it will not be refilled) but certainly not worth the steep cost. I would only recommend eating here if it is free. Also, if anything is wrong with your room... good luck getting it fixed. Once I had a room with a broken air conditioner. It took them 10 hours (5 phone calls) before they let me switch rooms. Lastly, the elevators are the slowest elevators I have EVER ridden.I've saved my biggest con for last. The room keys demagnitize about every three days. They blame your cell phone... but there is no way that is possible. I stay in hotels about 100 nights a year and only once have I had a key demagnitze outside of the Hilton DeSoto. Now, it might not seem like a big deal that the keys demagnitize... but it truly is. You see, to get out to the pool you need to use your key. You also need to use your key to get in and out of the gym, which has an outside entrance on the roof behind the pool. Once during a really bad thunderstorm, I was locked out of the hotel on my way back in from the gym. I was out there for twenty minutes on the roof before another guest saw me and let me in. I was about 30 seconds away from throwing a chair through the glass doors. All in all, you might come here and have a wonderful stay. If nothing goes wrong and you only stay one or two nights... you'll love it. But if you are going to stay longer... chances are you'll run into a problem.I have stayed at this Hilton more than a couple of times because of the service, location and cleaniness. The staff are always helpful, from the bus boys, to the front desk, to the maids. Great service and amenities. The lobby is especially grand.The on site restaurant, the DeSoto Grille, had wonderful food and service.This location is very convenient to all historic squares, museums, mansions and a nice walk to the riverfront.The hotel itself is very old world charm but they have recently upgraded most rooms. On our last stay a few months ago I had a newly refinished corner, king room which was terrific.A few caveats. The parking garage is underground and is very isolated. It will also cost you at least $12 per day to park.The street noise can get very loud no matter where your room sets, either facing north or south but that's what you get for being in the midst of the historic district.I will definitely stay here again!We stayed here on our short trip to savannah.  The hotel is in a great location and you can easily walk to most attractions in the historic district.  We valeted our car and didn't get it out again until we left. Everyone was extremely friendly from valet to housekeeping.  We arrived early and they provided us a room right away.  I requested a balcony and they were accommodating.  Our housekeeper was very sweet and gave us some tips on local restaurants.  The rooms and bathrooms are a little small but the bed was extremely comfortable. We will definitely be back!Did not stay here, but ate at the Desoto Grille.  They have a buffet during the day and it is very reasonably prices.  I had clam chowder, red rice, Sole stuffed with crab cakes, fried chicken, red velvet cake and ice cream.  It was a weekday and totally packed.  My whole meal was less than 15 bucks including tip. I highly recommend itWe stayed at the Hilton Savannah Desoto for three days. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of downtown. Our room was mistakenly booked as 2 double beds, but at check-in, they fixed it without a problem. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff was pleasant and helpful the entire stay, with the exception of the gentleman at the Tour Desk. The elevators can be a bit slow. Otherwise, it was a great stay.Reason for getting two stars &amp; not one star: location &amp; great price on Priceline (naming my own price: $60/night). Now the reasons behind the low rating: unclean, less than average customer service, Initially very happy that they checked me in several hours earlier than their normal check-in time b/c I had been traveling all night &amp; morning. Then went to get in the shower to discover several long &amp; short pieces of hair in the bottom of the tub. Called front desk &amp; 10 min later someone showed up who didn't want to clean it, so he said he'd call housekeeping. Thirty minutes later I call the front desk &amp; they say they will send somebody right up. Ten minutes later I am at the front desk asking for the cleaning supplies &amp; gloves, so that I can clean it myself. They then move me to a different room where I find eyelashes on the tub rim, but otherwise seemed decently cleaned. I should mention that in both rooms it appears that they had not been vacuumed for several stays. I noticed that the cleaning crew does not carry a vacuum, just a broom.Other items to note: the elevators are not responsive, no valet for 10 minutes so I chose to self park - the garage is deserted &amp; looks a bit sketchy, and very thin walls &amp; doors.I've stayed at several Hilton hotels, but this is by far the lowest quality one that I have stayed at &amp; I would not return even with the amazing price I received.We booked our room at the last minute on hotwire. I felt like we got a good deal on the price, but after staying here I would say that the price was about on par with the hotel. Great location. You can't beat a 15 minute walk to River Street; less to City Market and other shops and restaurants. Front desk was friendly. We did get double beds when we would've preferred a single larger bed, but we're not d-bags and we know that when you get a discounted rate through a third party website, you don't get to make demands for ""upgrades."" The other staff we encountered was great as well. The rooms have obviously been updated nicely, but they didn't do a great job of hiding the age of the building. Low ceilings, damaged woodwork, etc. The tile job in the bathroom was about what I would be able to accomplish as a DIY project. Everything seemed pretty clean though. One really gross thing was that the person across the hall got room service and the food smell was horrendous. Then they left their partially eaten meal tray outside their door for hours and it just got worse. I guess the employees should come back and check for those kind of things a little sooner.All in all, I can't complain too much. It's an average hotel. I just would definitely not pay the regular rates.So just returned from a week long trip for a work conference.  Came back with some good memories of Savannah and BED BUGS.  So the staff is very friendly, but no one seems to be terribly proactive about serving guests.  It took forever to get a luggage cart for my bags after a LONG drive and then I had to take my bags up myself.  Which isn't a big problem, but usually the hotel offers to take bags up for you.  The rooms are extremely old and in need of a major updating (despite their advertising that they underwent major renovations).  Our toilet broke while we were there and the rest of the room was filthy.  The hotel is pet-friendly which is a plus and we had our dog with us, but the carpet looked like it hadn't been steam-cleaned since they put in the carpet.  Our dog would not stop sniffing the carpet.  Since they collect a $75 non-refundable fee for pets, I would expect them to steam clean after each stay.  The elevators are insanely slow and the door locks to go to the ""gym"" were constantly broken so the ""maintenance"" people finally just stuck towels in the doors so they would stay open.  That said, the gym has very nice Precor equipment, but it's in a pool house so it's extremely small and needs better ventilation.To top off our trip, we found a lot of bites on our body and didn't think too much of it until we did some research and found out our bites are reflective of bed bugs.  We freaked and cleaned everything we had that was in Georgia and our beloved dog got a bath and haircut.  Fortunately we haven't been bitten once we got home, but gives credence to the fact that there were bed bugs in the Hilton.  I've also seen other reviews on TripAdvisor talking of bed bugs after the fact.  Would not repeat.  There are newer and better hotels closer to the river as well and most of Savannah outside of Paula Deen's empire is fairly reasonably priced when it comes to hotels.I'm a fan of Hilton hotels so I decided to stay at this one in downtown Savannah. It's about a 15 - 20 minute walk from River Street but you can take the DOT (it's free!) and shave off some of that time.I wasn't very impressed with this hotel. It is quite old and I feel like I've stayed in Motels that were better than this. First, parking the car in the garage is kind of sketchy. I didn't feel safe at all. Once we got into the elevator area, we had to wait about 5 minutes for an extremely slow elevator to arrive. The hallway to get to the room was very dark and dim - it was like they were trying to hide something. That something was the crappy room.In the hotel room, there's peeling paint in the bathroom and the furniture is nicked and chipped. The carpeting is kind of sticky and I wouldn't sit in the chairs if you begged me to. Also, the linens were stained (thank goodness no bed bugs like another reviewer mentioned) and the pillows were completely flat. The air conditioning crapped out on the second night leaving to room very humid.The only good thing about this hotel was the fact that we had a balcony and an amazing high view of the city.I wouldn't stay here again.Most three stars don't charge for parking. But here they force you to pay $18 a night. Our first room's tv didn't work. The room they moved us to 45 min later was next to the old noisy elevator. The next day we didn't get washcloths or new coffee packets. And this morning they want to charge me for the business center computers and also for every printer copy. Wow. Disappointed.I have stayed at this hotel many times.  Whenever I come to Savannah, I always stay at the hotel.  I found Rod Musselman, the manager to be a good manager.  However; with that being said, I will never stay at this tourist trap again.  They have hidden costs and there is no honors floor.The rooms are motel 6 at best.  I'm surprised that Hilton still has it in its family group of hotels.The staff is very slow (thinking) and acting.Do yourself a favor and stay at the Hampton Inn near Bay St.  Its a much better hotel and a much more professional staff.With my AAA card, we only paid $104/night.  Cheapest deal in the area, which aids in overlooking some of the other lacks of the hotel.Pros-free wifi-nicely furnished rooms-cardio machines with attached TVs in the exercise room-good priceCons-VERY LOUD...we faced the city/the river and lots of street noise as well as heard noises from the hallway distinctly-no fans in the bathroom?  odd for an already humid city-We had a broken chair leg and I didn't particular mind, but I know some people would-pool was fine for laying out but could have used a little clean up-no mini fridge, that would have been niceOverall, I was fine with it for the price and walked everywhere.  Heads up that street parking is free on the weekends, so skip the hotel parking ($13) or the hotel valet ($17) per day and find a street spot.The hotel felt old and outdated. It appears that the hotel underwent some type of refreshing, but it wasn't really up to par. Just because you put lipstick on a pig doesn't make it any less of a pig. This hotel was not very Hiltonesque. It felt more low end Holiday Innish.The first room that was given to me had blood on the comforter. Gross. Like a serious wtf? I was told the red stains I saw was pen markings and that somehow a pen had gotten pen markings on the ""fresh"" linens. That explanation just ain't jiving with me. So, they send the loveliest man to come and change the linens. When he is done changing the linens he has no new comforter to place on the bed. He looks in the laundry room and they have no more. Room switch. The next room I get to also has no comforter. Why do some rooms have comforters and others don't? The front desk manager states that some rooms do not have comforters in the warmer periods. It is December and not Savannah's warmer period. He suggests that I look in the closet where there will be an additional comforter. Looks in closet. Empty. Fail. They finally come back with a comforter that has no duvet. I suspect that comforter was the same one they took off of my original bed or some dirty one. Where the hell did this comforter pop up from if  there were no comforters just a few minutes ago? Why is there NO duvet? Won't be staying here again.Horrible experience at the Hilton Desoto;  I booked online and made a mistake with the check-in date (admittedly my mistake, but it was a simple human error).  I spoke with Front Desk Manager who was incredible unsympathetic and insisted I pay a $50 no-show fee even though I was already checked-in on the correct day.  The manager was willing to lose a customer rather than do the right thing.  He was totally unreasonable and failed to realize the value of treating people right.  I feel the Hilton Desoto Hotel tries to squeeze every dime out of you.  I left the Desoto and went down the street to Marriott Courtyard and was able to get the same rate PLUS free breakfast PLUS cheeper valet parking.  Overall front desk service was pitiful at the Desoto Hilton and they have lost this customer for life!  BE WARNEDI stayed at the DeSoto Hilton for a meeting last week, my first visit to the hotel since 1993. I heard that the hotel had been renovated, and everything seemed to be in good shape. The employees were all very friendly and helpful, providing restaurant recommendations, assisting with billing concerns, and making everything as pleasant as it could be. We heard some noise from the city (sirens and horns) and some from the hallway (sixth floor, not too bad), but overall, I was pleased with the accommodations.Amazing hotel. I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I'm not sure what those folks were talking about. Nothing to me looked old, outdated or dirty. Then again, what do people expect in a city this old? This is the HISTORIC district, people. The whole reason you come here is for the charm.I booked a same day deal on Priceline for $120/nt. I was told double beds but ended up with just a single bed in the room - no biggie since I was traveling solo. My room (318) overlooked the rooftop pool and had an amazing view of a beautiful church down the street. The bathroom looked nothing like the pictures here - it was HUGE and very spacious. No vanity and no tub, but that wasn't an issue for me. You could seriously have fit 10 people in the shower.Room service can get a bit pricey. I had the crab cakes, a spinach salad and a Coke for $42. The meal was unremarkable, especially for the price. I wouldn't recommend room service unless you're really hungry or lazy. I also wouldn't recommend eating at the onsite restaurant. Service was HORRIBLE and I even talked to another diner in the elevator who remarked that service there was bad his entire stay. They do have a breakfast card that you can fill out and hang on your door. Continental breakfast is $9 which I thought was steep for a pastry and some juice. Valet is $18/day. Free wifi. Outdoor pool.The front desk was so nice and the hotel in general is really beautiful. No, you're not on River Street, but for the price and the quality, this hotel can't be beat. My go to has always been the Hyatt Regency but the Desoto has replaced it as my new favorite place to stay in Savannah!The hotel is dated, not clean, I didn't even want to shower because the tile work looked horrible (I wish I could post a picture for you to see). I was unpacking and I noticed hair all over the sink and what looked like puke in the toliet. I called them and they cleaned it, but I mean... if those are things I can see... I was freaked out what I coudln't see... I was hoping I had a black light, but lets just say I slept fearing that i may end up with some std......I stayed at the Desoto for a long, winter weekend in Savannah.  The room was about $110.00 a night and included a $14.95 breakfast buffet which was above average.  Parking your car yourself was $13.00, I just came back from Seattle where a hotel charged almost $40.00 for valet parking only, so I think $13.00 was a steal!!  Ivey (pronounced Evie) was very pleasant and helpful at the desk, as a matter of fact, she was adorably professional.  The rest of the staff were helpful and very friendly and I loved the Savannah charm.  Southern hospitality to the max.The hotel room was nicely done, with very comfortable mattress and bedding.  Beautiful view, flat screen TV, very nice walkin glass shower stall.The hotel is in a literally perfect location in the historic district, everything is close by.A spectacular walk from behind the hotel, up Bull Street, through all the remarkable squares lined with beautiful historic homes to Forsyth Park is an unforgettable must!!  Run, walk, whatever you can do to see Forsyth Park.  You will never forget it.The only negative we experienced was the noise.  Especially from late night revelers in the hallway.  There was noise from outside, but not too bad.in a nutshell, what we got for the money was a steal!!  I would definately go back.It's... ok. Kinda hit and miss. Had to wait quite a while to get into our room and they initially had us in the wrong one but then we got a very nice one (go for the upper floors, quieter and great views). It was a corner ($20 extra per) but the big windows and views were worth it.Staff is super-friendly. Rooms were clean enough. Didn't eat at the Grill but tried the bar a couple times. Oy! No offense to the elderly but they had two pretty darn old ladies tending bar and they were barely standing. Wouldn't even try to make a mojito for another guest (that damn pestle!) and I had to ask for more rum in my rum &amp; coke so I wasn't just drinking soda.The location is PERFECT tho for exploring the Historic District (and or visiting SCAD). Seriously, everything we wanted to do was a 12-minute walk at most in one of the nicest cities to stroll in. Would probably stay there again. Maybe bring my own bartender tho...Stayed here for a wedding. Convenient location, newly upfitted rooms with nice mattresses, LCD TV, and large clean bathrooms. Friendly staff. Price is about what you'd expect for the flagship brand Hotel in a tourist town when the weather is nice. Decent enough pool area.","['location', 'beat', 'heart', 'historic', 'district', 'walkable', 'everywhere', 'walk', 'bucks', 'amenities', 'gym', 'pool', 'area', 'great', 'gym', 'treadmills',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-savannah-savannah,Hyatt Regency Savannah,3.0,$$$,134,"Stayed one night with family recently on a trip back through Savannah from Florida.  Had a great rate which included breakfast/valet.   We were looking for a hotel with an indoor pool and connecting rooms, this fit the bill.  Check-in was a bit slow, but we received great service as they couldn't find us connecting rooms (they are replacing beds in a lot of rooms so many weren't available) so upgraded one of our rooms to a suite with roll-away bed.   The room was very large with a separate seating area and plenty of room for the roll-away bed.   The decor is very modern and has been recently refurbished, so everything was clean and in good condition.  Really like the modern look of the rooms.   The interior of the hotel is a bit dated, but ok, and the exterior is definitely nothing to marvel at.  They have a rooftop garden that is very plain, basically just a cement rooftop with some chairs and a plant or two.   The pool was pretty decent for an indoor hotel pool, was reasonably warm, and they have a really nice fitness center.  Buffet breakfast was pretty standard for a large, upscale hotel....though there were no pancakes, waffles or omlet station.   Overally, we had a nice stay, this fit the bill.  If you are looking for nice rooms, and indoor pool, very large lobby/atrium, and a typical large-scale hotel, this is a good option.  The location right on the riverfront is nice too.Positives: Nice, modern rooms, indoor pool, riverfront location (though the view is pretty industrial, it's a working port).Negatives: Run-down exterior and riverfront, no character, common spaces are a bit dated.Quick summary: Buyer Beware!  We paid for and confirmed our reservation in advance, then arrived and were asked to wait, told that well after out check-in time, the room still wasn't ready and asked to wait in a basement room with excrement on the ground.This, obviously, was totally unacceptable.  Eventually we simply left, it being after 6pm and they still didn't have our room ready.  We were able to make another reservation at a different hotel but, since we were now reserving at the last minute on a Friday night of a holiday weekend, we had to pay hundreds of dollars more than the rate we had paid at Hyatt well in advance.But what could we do?  We were travelers in a foreign city with literally nowhere to sleep.  Hyatt kept apologizing but never offered a solution.  Never offered to give us a room in another one of their hotels or offered to reimburse us the difference in cost between our new reservation and the old one that they couldn't honor.I reached out directly to Hyatt's customer service right after we left, and again over 48 hours ago, and I have received no reply at all.  Awful experience that wasted our time and money and deeply impacts our trust in this brand.We went to Savannah thanksgiving weekend and stayed here one night. We rented an apartment the other nights but decided after we booked it we wanted to stay an additional night so I was able to get a good deal on jetsetter for this hotel. The hotel is definitely in the heart of downtown, right on the river. We weren't too fond of the riverfront since most all the stores are touristy. Our apartment was 2 blocks off Forsyth park, which was residential and quiet so this was quite the change. The hotel room was quite large and spacious and has been renovated. Besides that  there were a few things I didn't like thus the 3 stars. First, the rooms all face the interior courtyard which sounds great except if you're not appropriately dressed and your curtains are opened, any one of the rooms across from you can see you! I saw one of my neighbors from across the way. So basically you have to keep your curtains closed. Second, because of the hotel's layout the sound travels. That day there was a wedding going on to the later hours and you heard all the rambunctiousness in your room. So sound will travel. And lastly, $28 for valet- which you have to do regardless- is rather high. We weren't there for more than one night and I'm glad because it wasn't a place I would come back to because it doesn't have the southern charm you want from this city. If you're looking for a place right in the heart of everything then this may be right up your alley.I used to work for Hyatt while in college about a decade ago and am so very pleased to see they are upholding their standards for superior customer service. There is no better location in Savannah as everything is within walking distance including the stop areas for tours, the boat rides, and shopping. The room was well kept and and very comfortable. Every employee we came in contact with was friendly, welcoming, and in a good mood. The breakfast buffet is well worth the price and the manager from the restaurant even came and chatted thanking us for visiting. I only wish we had stayed for their lobby sized Thanksgiving buffet. We can't wait to come back and visit.Overall a good 4 night stay. But some of the classic housekeeping problems came up. My hair is short and mostly gray. So when I find long red hair in the bed it is not (generally) a good sign. The housekeeping was done early and I do appreciate that. The hotel catering was also generally good. the food was properly prepared and served and of high quality. The front desk staff were helpful and efficient.The staff was very friendly, however, I made reservations a week in advance but when I got there she told me that they overbooked so they no longer have the room I wanted for me even though I checked in on time. I accepted a different room (even though 2 double beds isn't what we wanted for our honeymoon...we reserved a king). I also had reserved a closer room to the hotel due to me being handicapped and we were literally the last room at the end of the hallway). Either way, I tried to call to see why this happened and what could be done to somehow rectify this and I was pretty much told that we got a room so there's nothing more that could be done. Very disappointed!Comfortable 2 night stay with basic needs being met. The room was clean and everything worked. I liked the darker colors in the room (reminded me of a dimly lit restaurant). Basic wifi was free which was a plus and it was strong enough to stream continuous video.Things were not perfect, but nothing major. 1) The valet only asked if I was checking in and then started a ticket for valet. Slightly deceptive. They should at least ask if you'll be using their valet 2) Booked a King, but they only had doubles when checking in at 3:30pm. 3) The breakfast buffet wasn't good to me. I will skip that the next time around. I  could stay here again easily, but it wasn't so superb that I must stay here.Stayed 1 night so we could explore so we could explore Savannah on our way to Tybee Island. Arrived close to 10pm &amp; then checked out early.  We stayed in a junior suite.   During our quick visit staff at front desk were very helpful.   Room was clean and a good size.   We could see the river and watch the ships go by.   Bed was comfy.   There was a sign posted by elevator stating quite hours.  Was please with that because don't appreciate loud hotel guests in the middle of the night.Negative: (1) we check in and the room service tray was left in front of our door from the night before!!!!!!!!!!! we didn't even get to the room until 8PM, so it had been there for 8+ hours!!!!! asked the front desk to have it cleared and they forgot until the following morning, again (2) we asked the concierge (man named Phil) for directions to get to the Wormsloe Historic site and his response is ""why would you want to go there?""................come on..................Positive: good, central location Summary: hotel is what you expect (except for issues above of course) and will certainly not be back any time soonStaying @ the Hyatt  Regency here in Savannah Geogia. The room I'm staying has an amazing  view of the river how awseome. This  is my first  time  here in Savannah and  I'm having a fabulous time, the weather is phinominal and peope here are so friendly  and have great manners.Never have I been to the hotel where the housekeeping  staff have greeted me from a far away  distance, they have gone above and  beyond asking if my room is up to  standard. How nice. I will remember  my stay here, awseome.Rooms are ok I guess, inside lobby area is really more reminiscent of an Embassy Suites. Definitely an older property, even with the newer renovated rooms. Stayed here in a room with a river view which is nice. However, the wifi is a complete dud, and the parking situation is about as bad as you can imagine. I worked here as a valet over a decade ago, it was a sh*t show then and it's even more of a mess now. 15-20 min to wait for your car, especially when it's parked in viewing distance, during check out hours is unacceptable, I don't care where you are.Very helpful, friendly, hospitable staff. Best room service of my life! Food was delicious and was hot. Was here for a conference and they did such a fantastic job with all the lunches, rooms, and  coffee breaks.Parking is not free.  Valet parking only at $26 per day!  So be aware. No bathtub, shower only in my king room.  However, buffet breakfast for two was included in the $139 room cost and that was excellent. Staff all very nice.I Priceline-d this sucker for $70/night. At that price it was exceptional value. I had a double king room all to myself, and whilst it was business-y it was as spacious as all get out, I could've swung a cat by its tail and not hit the walls! The bed was ultra comfortable and the room felt new.However, there was a couple of gripes. Wi-fi sucked donkeys balls, it was unuseable anywhere except the lobby; the shower had a drainage issue, meaning that when I was taking a shower I was also taking a bath. I'm a tinea-phobe so even in a hotel shower I am wearing thongs... Kinda defeats the purpose when your entire feet are covered in the water... So they probably need to take a look at the plumbing.Having said that, at $70 a night this place was an absolute steal.A Hyatt is a Hyatt. The location is the best in the historic district. Had a newly redecorated room that was very nice. Location location location .Pros: Great location, decent rooms, and friendly staff. Little pricey, but all and all we had an awesome two days. You can not beat the location if the riverfront is where you want to be. Cons: Hyatt corporate needs to invest some $$$ and do some sprucing up. The pool and lobby are pretty dated and the hallways and common areas need some stronger AC.Wasn't terrible but we've definitely had MUCH better stays at Hyatt hotels. Our bathroom shower was so tiny (and I'm a petite person!) I couldn't even shave my legs and there was no threshold so the floor was completely wet. We called the guest services to request a room with a larger bathroom and were connected to the front desk where no one answered. Then we were told housekeeping would come later in the day while we were out. No one ever came and we had to request towels twice because we to use ours to sop up the water from the inefficient shower. There were also very loud noises from the A/C or refrigerator that was disturbing while trying to sleep. Very disappointed in this Hyatt stay. Only good part was the location.After staying on Tybee Island 4th of July, 2010, we loved visiting Savannah. Now with kids in college, we wanted to stay in Savannah during a cooler, less hectic time. Wanting to be close to the historic downtown district, I spun the Priceline name your price wheel and got the Hyatt Regency. So, the price was very good. I had one of those ""half-river"" views, which look better at night with the bridge lit up. ALL the staff were very pleasant and eager to please. The concierge booked us a private horse/buggy tour where we were picked up at the front door...nice! We decided to eat light and dine on 2 for 1 apps at the Vu Lounge. The drinks and apps were very good and our waitress again friendly and attentive. The elevator right down to River St. was awesome to have available.Now, again, for the price I paid I'm not complaining, but the rooms as alluded to by other posters, are very tired and dated, like '80's dated. No refrigerator and no bathroom exhaust fan, and older lime crusted plumbing were noted. In their defense, they were renovating a couple of floors. All in all, convenience of location made up for any discrepancies, and the money I saved paid for the parking and the carriage ride (almost)Great property with all the amenities. Location on river and super close to dining, shopping and stuff to do.Hyatt is always my number one choice for hotel. Hyatt Regency at Savannah was very comfortable to stay at. As soon as I walked in, I went to check in and was greeted immediately. She was very polite, courteous, and helpful. I stayed there with Georgia School of Addiction Studies. I am glad that they chose Hyatt as the hotel. My room was in 7th floor. Good view, I was hoping for a full river view but instead got a half view of river and the other half, a view of garden. Garden meaning bunch of lawn chairs where people sun bathe. So I guess it's a good view? However, right across from my view is a restaurant. There are people sitting in the balcony that makes me paranoid whether of not they can see me in my room. Therefore, I had to close the curtain most of the time. I got a king bed, it's huge! Very comfortable with tons of soft pillow. I love the pillows!!! So soft, I didn't want to get up in the morning. Room tv was decent had good channels. In room movies cost from $15.99-$17.99. Too high!!! I ordered room service. Their menu I feel is limited but delicious. They charge $3 for delivery charge plus 20% gratuity. It was fine with me. Bathroom is small and tight. Before shower, make sure you put towels on the floor so you don't slip and fall like I did. I was like, ""I'm falling and can't get up!"" But I'm ok. Shower water pressure was great! Sink water, not so much. Services everywhere in the hotel was excellent, superb!!! They were so nice and courteous! 5 stars for the services!!! Kudos to the team! Recommendation: sign up for gold pass. You get free newspaper and free wifi. You can accumulate points for free stays. -valet your car even though it costs $24.99. At least you can go in and out for free afterwards. If you park yourself, you have to pay each time you come in and out.","This is the second time we have stayed at this Hyatt. This time has been much better than 2 yrs ago. We asked for a crib for our daughter and they not only brought a crib but also a baby care package. I bought room service on our anniversary and they gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne.Also 5* location in the city.What a sorry state of hotel mismanagement... a stark contrast to my most positive experiences at other Hyatt properties.Starting with the arrival as we drove up to the entrance, we had to wave down a valet attendant to take our car, and then request a bellman to help us with our luggage.Then the most surly bell attendant didn't like being told how we wanted our possessions handled. Such a negative attitude with an audacious combination of disrespect and insolence caused us to feel that we didn't want to check in.  She acted as she was entitled to do her job they way she wanted, and us expressing our desires was interference and disrespecting her!!  What an attitude of entitlement!! We advised the front desk supervisor, who we asked to escort us and our belongings to our room, so we wouldn't have to deal with the bell attendant.Our room was fine, except the lack of cleanliness was noted (see accompanying photos).  Further, the housekeeping staff did the minimal job of replacing our tissues (facial and bath) as absolutely necessary (again, see accompanying photos).Breakfast in the dining room was very mixed.  The actual buffet was excellent, yet the lack of service from the staff was noted.  Since 75% of the breakfast diners have breakfast included in their stay, the tips are automatic, and therefore the staff doesn't have to service the guest, nor the used dish area (again, refer to the accompanying photos).  So, we are forced to dine with the stand of used dishes and cleaning supplies in our face!!!We had turn down service once in three nights.  One evening, when I called @ 9:30pm inquiring about the service (not that I really needed it at that point), the supervisor apologized stating that they were busy, and had forgotten.Though I asked for extra coffee to be delivered each day, I had to request this twice, each day!!!This was my second visit to this Hyatt property in Savannah, and I will do everything in my power to stay elsewhere on my next visit!!!Upon checkout, I asked for the managers card so I could share my experiences via email/phone.  The clerk instead had the Asst Mgr come out, and after hearing that I felt the hotel failed in delivering good service, to his credit, he offered to comp my stay.  I refused, as that wasn't the point of my sharing my comments. I just felt the hotel could be so much more, especially in a tourist town.I highly recommend you stay at the Hyatt if you are planning a trip to Savannah!  It is on the harbor and if you upgrade to a harbor view room, you can watch the ships come and go.   It is like having a show right outside your window.  The location is also close to many attractions and provides easy access to classic restaurants like the Old Pink House (also highly recommended).   The hotel is modern, the colors are current and the rooms are clean.  There is a Starbucks in the lobby, a great restaurant and bar also with harbor views.Great location. Close to everything!!!!ROOMSwere nice and clean. The beds are amazing. When first entering, you thought they forgot a duvet because there is a sheet as the top...but it's just hot in Savannah and this is how they do bedding. It's so comfortable to sleep in and I was very happy with the room. Bathrooms are nice and clean, and we had an extra little section where the desk was. I think our room was near the end or a corner, but the layout was a bit weird...like there was an added space to the side...but no complaints because it made it bigger. Balcony has no seating as there is only about a foot and half to stand but if you get a room with the river view, it's a bit more expensive but worth the fresh air and balcony. LOCATION is the best. It's in the historic district, close to EVERYTHING awesome like all the good restaurants [Alligator Soul, Olde Pink House, Huey's on the River, etc]. You can take the elevator down to the riverfront walkway where all the fun strips of candy stores, ice cream parlors and restaurants are. WATER BOTTLES in the room cost an arm and leg so buy your water elsewhere.WIFI there is a charge for wi-fi.PARKING is $24 a day which is really expensive...but you can go in and out as you please and they pretty much valet it for you each time. The garage across the street charges $16, so park there to save some cash...or find parking on the street. Just be sure to move it on time.Great location, close to restaurants, parks, clubs and little cute stores.Parking cost $24 but we parked in a parking close by for $10/day. Only later on we found out that that there is a VISITORS PARKING PASS!!!VISITOR DAYPASS - Visitors may purchase a two-day parking pass for $12, or a single day parking pass for $7 from the Savannah Visitors Center or the Mobility &amp; Parking Services Department.However, there was also a very small gym, lots of ""slammimg doors"" noises from 8am and VERY HARD and UNCOMFORTABLE BED, PILLOWS.I could not sleep on my pillow for couple of hours and later, when I was woken up by slamming doors outside in a hallway, my shoulders and hips were hurting really bad.Then my husband woke up and said that his shoulders and arms hurt too. So I guess I wasn't the only one who thought the mattress was super hard and painful.I would not like to sleep on that bed again, if I had to - I will bring my own pillow.Somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  For location, you cannot beat this place.  It's right in the thick of activity on River St.  You can literally take an elevator from the lobby level down to the street avoiding the crazy stairs.The atrium looks nice and airy, but still a bit muted when comparing it to the Hyatt in San Francisco.  There are 3 elevators and 7 floors of rooms, so getting to your room isn't too bad.  We've gone during Christmas and recently 4th of July.  The hotel was much more crowded during July but it was still ok from an elevator perspective.The rooms are ok at best.  The bathrooms need some serious renovations.  The first room we had was a standard studio.  This last room we had was a much larger room.  It was still a studio, but the room was divided by the 52"" tv which swivelled.  One one side was the bed and desk while the other had a couch and footrests.  Additionally it has a wetbar and fridge (empty).Even though the AC was running at full blast the entire time we were there, the room would get stuffy sometimes in the middle of the night.  This is when I wasn't happy to have a larger room.Check in and check out is relatively painless.  They have express checkout with a machine (but put it near the line to work with the front-desk -- a bit awkward)I'm more into a modern contemporary look, but old charm is what Savannah is all about and this hotel fits into that.Room: We had room 418 which is river facing. The river view was really cool. We saw lots of container ships passing by, tugs, had a great view of the Talmadge Bridge and the Savannah Riverboats. I highly recommend a river view room. The other option is a room with windows only to the interior of the lobby. We had a standard room which was typical of Hyatt Regencies. I was able to unplug a bedside light to plug in my phone. No other really major pros or cons worth mentioning regarding the room. Service: Mary at the front desk was really nice! When our lobby facing standard room wasn't ready when we arrived early at 1100 she was able to upgrade us to a river view room and get us upstairs right away ($35/night value). As GP members we were given a magic happy hour card to make it happy hour at any time of day in the lounge called Vu. Vu has a river view balcony and a great friendly bartender, Vicki, who gave us a great restaurant recommendation for dinner. Food: In addition to Vu mentioned above there is Windows (cleaver names right?) which has - you guessed it....windows facing the river. This is the brekkie buffet/menu spot as well as dinner. We had the buffet each morning and really enjoyed it: fruit, breads, scramble eggs, onion/pepper potatoes, grits with various fruit and nut toppings, bacon, various sausages, and an egg bake. Made to order omelettes were also an option. Service was top notch and the staff all remembered us on our second visit and welcomed us back with the excitement you'd greet a long lost friend! Location: The Hyatt  may be the best located hotel I've ever stayed  in. As tourists my friend and I went on a Savannah Riverboat Cruise - it was located literally right to the east (right if facing the Savannah River) of the hotel. We went on a Savannah Taste Experience food tour - the tour meeting place was literally one building west/left of the Hyatt in the River on the Rocks restaurant. We did an Old Town Trolley tour for which tickets were sold from our hotel (though cheaper online). There were also several trolley stops just blocks from our hotel. This property also has two lifts that go right to River Street - no need to march those unlevel stone steps. Other: $22 valet each night. There is a nice spot to wait for your car that is indoors and air conditioned. You don't pick your car up in the front of the hotel, but on floor P3 in a nice lobby area with seating. The main lobby of the hotel is also nice with various conversational seating arrangements set up.The level of cleaning and customer service at the Savannah  Hyatt Regency is not on par with the Hyatt brand. I had to contact the manager 4 times regarding the cleanliness, or lack thereof, of my room. In addition, the staff left my door ajar two times. Luckily my belongings  were still in my room upon my arrival back to the room. The saving grace in my case was Mr. Brown, the manager on duty, who when I showed him pictures of my disgusting  room, immediately  rectified the situation. When I returned to my room, Mr. Brown sent up a nice tray of cheese, fruit and wine. Unfortunately, the wine bucket and wine glasses set empty outside my door for 2 full days! Needless to say, the best thing about this hotel is the view of the river!  I will not stay at this hotel again!I'm a cheap mo-fo and I use Hotwire to get rooms. I paid $100 with tax for 1 night when we were in town. I don't have some sorta expectations other than a clean room and friendly staff. Look, I'm paying $100, not $250... Even at the $250 mark this place ain't bad. Check in was simple, girl was friendly and got us right in with a room that viewed the river. Usually Hotwire gets you a broom closet and I expect that. I'm booking this room for the location on river street. We had food early afternoon at the bar and the weather was decent so we are on the patio/deck overlooking the river. Drinks were outstanding, mojito's were spot on. As for the tuna it was overlooked!!!! Oh well... Room was clean and modern. There was construction during our stay and we did not have water from 1-4pm but we had no plans to stay in the room! We were out enjoying the city.  I'd recommend this hotel for location and for comfort.Location, location, location! I could nit pick a couple of things about the stay (shower did back up and leave the floor pretty slick and some room service was left out in the hallway for well over a day before it was picked up), but, honestly overall it was pleasant. Also, did I mention its location? I mean, yay for that!Super nice. Clean. Our room view was amazing. You could see river street perfectly. Definitely worth every penny.First off, great location and the front desk employees were very professional. Didn't park at hotel, which is expensive, but their is a sign that tells you that. Do yourself a favor a go to the Savannah Visitor center which is directly underneath the hotel on River street and but a parking pass $14 for 2 day pass, you can park on Hyatt property or parking garage block away. VU restaurant draft beer taps were not working, and the housekeeping was atrocious, worse at any Hyatt or much less any brand name hotel that we have stayed at. Manager was quick to solve the situation. I would stay here again, great location, the Andaz while nice, didn't like the lobby area and not near as good location.The best thing about this hotel is the location.  Right on the Savannah River and walking distance to everything downtown... tons of restaurants, bars, historical sites and Savannah's famous parks. The hotel bar, the Vu, is also great location overlooking River St and the river... and the drinks are pretty good too.But take away the location and what your left with is a dated, tired, dingy 90's conference hotel.  If you stay here, definitely stay in one of the rooms overlooking the river as that is the only real positives about the rooms.  Otherwise the rooms are basic and dated.  We stayed in a Jr suite and while the extra space in the room was nice, the bathroom was tiny, the couch was dumpy complete with stains.  On a plus note, the beds was comfortable and the room was clean. Overall, I thought the room was pricey for what it offered.Construction was going on and it wasn't the highest quality for the price. But I didn't even pay. So whateva!Not so much a fan of this hotel, I hate to say. I was here for a conference and it served its purpose well, but I barely spent any time in my room...thank gosh.So let's start with the good - the location. It's right downtown, near tons of restaurants, bars and shops. Check-in and check-out staff are quite friendly. The meeting rooms are good, and the food provided at the meetings was good. I never did try the restaurant or bar in the hotel itself. Oh, and if you have a river view, it's wonderful. I got to spend some time in one of the big suites overlooking the river and it was lovely.Now the rest. Which is basically the room. It's crap. The place is in some serious need for renovation, both in the rooms and the common areas, which are often scuffed up, dirty, and dinged. My room did not have a view. And I don't mean it didn't have a view of the river...it didn't have a view of the outside world. A significant (half?) number of the rooms look on to the lobby - not the river, not the city, not the outside world in any way whatsoever. I hate that so much that words cannot describe. Nothing in my room was all that nice. The WiFi was okay, but not great. At times, it got incredibly slow. I ALMOST stayed at a Hilton family hotel nearby, but chose to stay at the conference hotel instead. I wish I had chosen elsewhere. It's an okay hotel, but there are plenty of others nearby that I'll try next time.Recently done overRoom and bedding adequate Service and staff  excellent.TV reception and screen need replacing Need to get expanded station coverage. Room service coffee terrible but they do have Starbucks in the lobby.Location excellent problem with wi fiThis place is a joke. 1st off this fancy ass hotel had no microwave in the room and the sheets were dirty. We also had housekeeping come into our room on Wednesday saying they told them we were checking out that day, when we were actually staying thru Friday.  The front desk were clueless and here is the kicker WE GOT DOUBLE CHARGED FOR EVERYTHING!! Please make sure you look at your bill they give you when you leave, and then check your account. Not worth the money or the hassle. Go three blocks down and stay at the Staybridge. This place is soooooooo unorganized.In short - I was disappointed in this location and would not recommend it to others.I travel frequently and stay in hotels, Hyatt's included, often. During my Christmas stay over 5 days in Savannah I stayed at this location. When I pick a hotel or review one there are three things I look for: comfort, cleanliness, and location.Hyatt Regency Savannah is a business hotel, not a luxury hotel. The location of this hotel can't be beat is why I chose to stay here. I specifically booked and requested a ""River View"" room for my stay. Call me a kid, but watching the ships go by is pretty cool for me. ""River View"" is not the same as ""River Street View"" which is what I got. The staff were either unable or uninterested in meeting the requested room I booked. The ""River Street View"" does include the river and the ships, good, but it also includes the tower bell right outside your winder striking every 15 minutes making it difficult to sleep in on vacation. It also includes music from the ""River Street"" restaurant/bar patio that they hotel an control the volume of. They can't control the volume of street performers, so I don't hold that against them... oh, except they are on the ""River Street View"" side. For a walking city like Savannah, a few blocks is not big. Unless you want to see the ships like me, location can be ruled out as a deciding factor to pick this hotel.Comfort is the next area of consideration for me. Are the beds ""Westin Heavenly""? No. But they are comfortable. I slept well, outside of the bells and music outside my window. The room was functional. Bathroom is small, but the shower worked.I did not feel comfortable staying at this location however. The staff are nice, but not trained well. Often I would walk to ask a question of someone and feel like I was interrupting a private conversation the staff was having. That's pretty uncomfortable. The largest sources of revenue for this location in my estimation is the valet parking. I like valet, and my rental car was never harmed; but the team running the service took people in line behind me on two occasions - just skipped me or ignored me. That sucks. My biggest gripe, I went to have a drink on the patio bar looking over the river (you know, ships and stuff). I asked the bar tender if they were serving on the patio, or I should order and carry at the bar. ""No, I'll send someone out to help you. Pick any seat"" is what he said. What he should have said was, ""I am going to finish watching this football game and no one is going to pay attention to you, even though the place is empty and there are three people on staff."" Not professional.When I asked for a new room, it was also an uncomfortable situation. I explained that I came here for the ""River View"" specifically paying more for that, and didn't think the ""River Street View"" was equal. I became ""that guy"" who mentioned the status of the member program. On the third day, I was pretty flexible I thought, to say, ""could you just turn down the music on the patio at night?"" But no. Each call to the (I'm guessing the front desk) was, ""So sorry, can't, nope, full, no flexibility, hands are tied."" Walking past the front desk on my day before last, there was an elderly couple tangled in a similar conversation and it was just sad to over hear it.Earlier I mentioned that the staff needed improved training. Cleanliness is the area I think this is best addressed. The room was clean, just worn. There are seals on the window that have been patched, the furniture is scared and rugged, carpeting is starting to show ware marks. There was a 24 hour period that room service trays would sit outside doors. I passed an abandoned vacuum cleaner on the third floor at least six times one day just sitting there, power cord unraveled, not doing much. Someone must have gone running in mud and trampled through the floor one day. That mud trailed the pathways for hours.... There is no basic understanding that if you see something, say something, or better, do something! Pitch in. Pick it up. Put it in the right place. Again, the staff is nice, just not working as a team.Here, after all this, I will say my biggest problem with this location - thin walls.  I think they know this is a problem as there are small signs everywhere in the building asking guests to be aware of this after 10 PM. My problem with the music at the window was part of it. The thin wall problem made for very early mornings and late nights sandwiched between two very passionate couples. The one on the side of my headboard had very good rhythm which sounded like she really enjoyed, but I don't need to wake up to that. Good for them, not good for me.  Neighbors on the other side enjoyed the delicious cocktails at night, that lead to slamming doors and drawers.There are better places to stay than this, pick one of them. I will.St. Patrick's Day in Savannah is a must do. Though the hotel is centrally located to everything, it comes at a cost. You have to have a wrist band to be inside the hotel. You get two free for your room, any wrist bands after that are $35. So if you have 4 in your room it will cost you $70/night or something ridiculous like that. We have a big group staying at different hotels, they're not allowed in, we have to go out to meet up with them. Supposedly this cuts down on noise and partying, but I thought that's what all the security guards are for? It's more like a price gouge. For as much as you pay for a night here, during this inflated rate weekend, you should be given guest passes for free for up to 4 people. The rooms are decent, the beds are comfortable and the maid service has been very good.On to the bad, the hotel is under construction and I was never notified of this prior to seeing a piece of paper stating so on the desk when I got in the room. I've stayed in hotels that are under construction and I vowed to never do it again, its horrible. When I asked about it they said they are pausing construction for St. Patrick's Day and the weekend. Well, construction started in the room next door, at 8am THE MORNING AFTER ST. PATRICK'S DAY. The paper advising of hotel construction stated that work would only be done after 9am, that was obviously not the case. With the popularity of St. Patrick's Day in this little town, you'd think they'd have an appreciation for hotel guests that will probably be sleeping in! Going on 2 hours of holes being drilled into the wall. Called downstairs, ""nothing we can do about it"", asked for a later checkout to make up for lost sleep time ""we can give you an hour"". I've been staying here for 6 days and spent $2k on a room and I've been a Hyatt Gold member for years, you'd think that would earn me some common decency. Had to call down again to see if they can give me ear plugs, that was my only victory (and they're not even good ear plugs). Called down a third time to get a late check-out, ended up just paying the $25 to stay until 3pm and get the 3 hours of sleep I lost, back. This is the second year I've stayed here, the first time was alright (minus the wrist band thing) but after the treatment this time, I'll be looking at other properties. I also had to get my key rekeyed 3 times because it would just stop working for the elevator and/or my room. The last couple times I've tried to go through Hyatt customer service, they either don't reply or refuse to help, the website for the complaints is terrible on an iPhone.Service was absolutely great. Everyone was so kind and friendly. Breakfast buffet that was included was yummy and valet parking is always nice! Rooms could have been maybe a little more stylish but overall a great stay.","This hotel was beautiful! Excellent breakfast buffet. Price was 330$ a night. We decided to go ahead and give it a try, we only had one night in savannah so we wanted be right in the historic district to make the most of our time. Valet kept our car and were fast and efficient. Our bellman gave us a recommendation for dinner and it was awesome! Savannah is awesome!Great location and friendly staff. City view was great. Was not a fan of bedding it was crispy sheets they were not soft enough in my opinion. The pillows were feather downs which I dislike. But overall very nice place. Definitely good to book on Priceline we saved $Hotel is in a great location. The friendly staff was exceptional. The lounge was clean and prompt! Awesome drinks and food was fresh. The hotel maybe in need of a ""refresh"" but overall good for the money.5 star view for a glass of wine from the hotel bar patio! Also got 1 night on Priceline's express deals for a great price!Great location on Bay Street with elevators that take you down to the riverfront. We were in a standard room so we had a balcony that opened into the hotel lobby. It was kind of strange but I guess it is better than not having a window at all. We also heard a lot of noise from the atrium as a result of this. Scoring a room with a bay view would totally make this hotel a great place to stay. We had a small infant with us so they brought us a mini-fridge so that we would be able to store his milk and food. They normally charge $25/day so we were grateful that they were willing to accommodate us.We also came back one day and housekeeping had missed our room. Rather than make us wait for housekeeping, they just had us move into the clean room next door.Overall, great location and excellent service! It doesn't have the charm of the B&amp;Bs in the local area but this is a great place to stay.Great location and walking distance to literally everything. My hubby and I are big time walkers so we don't mind treking a mile or two or three! The hotel is right on the river which is nice, super close to River Street and all the bars, restaurants and shops there. Our room was a decent size and had a really nice view of the river. Be careful though some rooms, probably 35% maybe, don't have views to the outside world at all and actually face inward into the lobby which seems horrible. The room was somewhat dated and a little dingy but honestly that's what you are going to get if your paying $160 a night so don't expect the Ritz. We spent most of our time in the city so this really was just a place to crash at night for us. Our last night in the hotel a 9 month old baby was somehow dropped from a 5th floor balcony that faced in toward the lobby. It was an awful scene and I still can't get it out of my head. My husband and I and many other guests were witness to this tragic event. Probably wouldn't stay at the hotel again due to that awful memory.Rooms were obviously recently renovated and were very comfortable. The river view is a nice bonus. The lobby is open with a huge atrium. Being in the south the humidity inside goes with the territory. The staff was exceptional.If this hotel didn't have such a great location I doubt they would have much business based solely on their lack of customer service and abysmal communication skills.  During my stay, I valet parked my brand new 2015 Ram 1500 truck with only 2000 miles ($24 per day).  When I went down to pick up my truck from the lower level parking garage, I was told it was over sized, so it wasn't in the garage and it would be brought around to me in front of the hotel.  It wasn't until the day after I checked out that I noticed that the shark fin style antenna on the roof of the truck had been smashed and the roof panel had been bent and damaged, leaving the hole for the antenna wires exposed to the elements.  Now I know how they were able to determine it was over sized!  They never said a word to me about the damage and there is NO WAY that the person who did this wasn't aware it happened.  I called immediately to report the damage and had to leave a message with the parking garage manager.  This was on a Saturday, so I didn't really expect a call back until Monday.  Monday comes and goes with no call from anyone, so I called again at the end of the day, spoke to the parking garage manager and he emailed me a form to complete.  Within 30 minutes I emailed him the completed form, a scanned copy of my receipt from my stay along with several pictures showing the damage done to my vehicle.  Tuesday comes and goes with no response to my email and no call from anyone representing the hotel.  I called again on Wednesday, spoke to one of the hotel managers who assured me that getting my situation resolved would be a top priority and he apologized for the lack of communication.  About an hour later I get an email from the parking manager notifying me that it normally takes 3-5 business days for their claims department to respond, but he would have them expedite my claim and call me that day or the following day at the latest.  (WHAT!!!  3-5 BUSINESS DAYS?!?!  How many damage claims does this hotel get that it takes 5 BUSINESS DAYS to make a phone call????)  Anyway, no call before the end of the day and no call yesterday.  It's now almost noon on Friday, so it's been a full week and still no communication, no call and no resolution whatsoever.  So, here I am with a brand new truck that cost $40,000 with a smashed antenna and a damaged roof panel with a hole that I have to keep taped over so that the rain doesn't get inside and cause more damage as a reward for being a customer of the Hyatt Regency Savannah.  It's obvious that this company does not care about their customers one iota.  They damaged my brand new truck, tried to conceal the damage from me and they don't even care enough to make a phone call, let alone fix the damage they've caused.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  DO NOT STAY HERE!!!  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!Worst hotel ever.  Ghetto.  Front desk was actively mean and had friends hanging out while they made fun of all their guests to their faceOne thing about this hotel is the location...it's right in the historic district within walking distance of most of the popular eateries---Ruth Chris, Lady &amp; Sons, Your Pie, etc.  Although- I would say this hotel is not the best ""4 star"" I've stayed in it's definitely one of the lower cost in the area. The hotel itself, though dated, had a clean room. The bathroom showing visible signs of  it's age,  with patches on the ceiling, some residue on the bathtub. Bedding was poor-- sheets laid on top of very uncomfortable, cheap hotel bedding. Choose this hotel if it comes to price and location.Had a great time in the hotel bar with Rachel the bartender -They have infused vodkas, gin, and whiskey. Great time.  If your in Savannah come stop by here their AwesomeThe place is terrible, and home to questionable ethics. Do not patronize their business.Good service, clean, nice pool, incredibly helpful and friendly staff.  Not as quiet as I'd like because of the layout and that they were renovating.  The location was great though.  The outdoor bar has a great view of River Street and the river.  We had an issue with our final day room service and our pre-paid breakfast, but that was partially due to our very tight schedule.  The front desk addressed the problem they couldn't remove the charges so they ended up comping our parking.We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. If you're considering a trip to Savannah and need a place to stay, here are a few things to consider:Pros:It's right on the riverfront so if that's what you plan to visit, you can't find a more convenient hotel. The beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows.The water pressure in the showers is excellent.The breakfast buffet is very good.Cons:The 80s/90s decor is very dated. It feels like it hasn't seen a revamp in at least 20 years.Wireless costs extra.Parking costs extra.The in-room movie prices are ridiculous. $16 to watch a movie on TV?The bathrooms are tiny, don't have a fan, and smell like mildew.The rooms don't have a mini fridge or microwave so no point in boxing up those leftovers from dinner.Hopefully you didn't get dinner at the hotel's lounge. The menu is sad.Make sure you get a river-view. The interior-facing rooms are depressing. Guess which one we got?If you want to go to Tybee, find a rental on Tybee. The traffic to get there from here is awful.The Hyatt is an eyesore. It looks terrible on River Street, and it is disgraceful that you have to walk through it while strolling on the street.Sweet Lord Jesus this felt like HEAVEN after the night before's stay.This review might be a bit skewed due to the traumatic events of the hotel we stayed at the previous night. BUT this was the answer to our prayers as far as we were concerned.In stop two of our road trip we decided to stay in Downtown Savannah. This hotel has a GREAT location for you urban explorers who like to walk. Right on River Street there are a bunch of shops, restaurants and even a pirate boat you can visit. Not to far down is the Historic Savannah area with parks and some beautiful houses.Now to the actual hotel. They only do Valet parking which is the main reason I don't give the hotel 5 stars. $22  per day can add up pretty quickly (Luckily we were only there for one day). The valet guys were super nice and helped with our bags.The lobby is nice and the check in clerks were very nice. Taking the elevator up I felt Like I was in a cruise as it is all glass and you see the main lobby as you rise up.  The room was CLEAN (HALLELUJAH!) the bed super confy, the view of downtown not bad and the bathrooms CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN! (This is the possibly skewed part of the review, but it was a great price on a nice clean hotel, so I can't be too off!)The cool part was the morning after as I went to get some ice I stumbled upon an open terrace on our floor (third). Judging by the smell of the hallway leading out to it this is usually for smokers but early in the morning there was not one smoker out there. The weather was perfect (still really cold, but a nice change for us) and the terrace overlooked River Street and the bridge headed to SC. Great view! We snapped some pics, got some fresh air and enjoyed the moment for a few minutes. A great stay and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the area.PS: $9.99 for internet per day?! Come on now. I used my Iphones connection to surf the web and saved the money. Internet should really be free in all hotels in this day and age!Sadly this hotel does not live up to the reputation of the Hyatt Regency line.  Out of my numerous trips to Savannah this was, by far, the worst value for the money combination out of a hotel -- in fact, I'm hard pressed to think of a vacation even outside of Savannah where I've seen a worst value-for-money ratio.And I want to emphasize that - ""value for money"" - this hotel wasn't ""bad"".  My sheets, room and bathroom were clean.  Nothing from the hotel kept me from getting a good night's sleep.  The hotel did its most basic job.Of course, I say that about Holiday Inn Express places I can find at Interstate exits that cost $99/night too - but that's not why you stay at a Hyatt Regency.Heading to Savannah for my anniversary I decided to splurge and book a river view room with a balcony.  The view was exactly what I expected it to be - the rest of the room was quite sad.  Furniture, television, amenities, wallpaper, ceiling, carpet - just the whole thing needs to be updated with a whole room renovation.  This simply didn't feel like a $300 per night room.While the rest of Savannah has figured out that it's a boutique touristy town and charging out the ass for food and gifts - they're at least providing top shelf products.  This hotel needs to get on the bandwagon or lower its rates.Stayed here Saturday into Easter Sunday. We had a upgraded room with a king an full huge comfy couch. The room was modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable and we instantly regretted not being able to stay longer. The location was great, close to all. Would love to come back!My dad came to visit me from out of town, and he stayed here. Not only did a valet steal over $10 in quarters from his change holder, but he obviously hit a white car with my dad's new black Fiat and ruined the paint job. My dad saw the valets ""handling cars like they were in the Indy 500--tires squealing."" He called to complain, and no one would even call him back! He finally got through, and the valet manager told him, that his guys ""do that sometimes."" He is calling Corporate. DO NOT VALET PARK--thieves!!!!!!!!!!! All this after he paid close to $300/night on a ""special rate.""This is a review of what happens before you even GET to the hotel. I booked a one bedroom suite. I was able to use a AAA discount. When I called back to inquire about a two bedroom suite, I was told that I may not use a AAA discount on ANY of their suites. After a third call, the woman, Kathy, told me that the one bedroom is really ONE room with a king bed next to the pull out sofa. The two bedroom suite was ONE bedroom and a living room with a pull out sofa. When did a ""living room"" become an acceptable name for a ""bedroom?"" I inquired more about the rooms, the locations of the rooms etc but Kathy did not know the answers b/c she works at a reservation bank. She transferred me to the hotel itself where the above mentioned was confirmed. Thank goodness I found out about the misconception of the room situation before we arrived. I expressed that I felt the website and verbiage was misleading. I've cancelled my reservation.","Quick check-in. Friendly, efficient service. Quick check-out. In between we had a room that looked over the river, which made us happy. The waitstaff for our conference seemed genuinely happy to have us, and they would go out of their way to get answers to questions out of their purview. Our room attendant Maybelle was the queen of customer service, with an attitude that can best be described as joyful. Even though it's a large hotel, we were treated with the personal touches that are usually found in a small hotel. Even my tweets were answered within 5 minutes. Now, if only I could have found stairs to use instead of the very random elevators!A sad, tired, and old hotel that's sorely in need of an update from the 20th to 21st century. Everything from the gold and navy ""regal"" carpet to the navy curtains to the cream tiled bathroom needs a complete overhaul. However, fans of the authentic 80's style will be pleased to see that their bathroom comes complete with yellowed, crinkled wallpaper and a complimentary gray, plastic tub mat. If the Hyatt Andaz is available, please do yourself a favor and book a room there. Do not waste your money, or your company's money, by staying in this hotel.This hotel was in a great lovation.  Close to everything. Walked to all the tourist spots and more.  Definitely took advantage of the visitors day pass that another review stated...money saver.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  As for others saying out of date and dirty, I'm not sure what they mean.  I found it to fit the style of Savannah.  I'm sure upgrading and renovating are concerns, however, it's not unpleasant.  I feel those guests stayed in the room and hotel throughout the entire stay and did not take in the city for what it was for.  Would stay here again.As far as Hyatt Regency's go, this one was one of the best, if not the best. They get it! Everyone, including housekeeping staff, was incredibly warm and friendly. They were helpful and made you feel special. When you walk by someone else's room and the door is open and the cleaning lady yells out ""how ya doing?"" or ""good morning"" you know there is a top to bottom culture of friendliness and customer service.Room was nothing special. Bed too soft and didn't have fitted sheet on bottom (?) so it kind of came apart as you slept. Bathroom very small. But I'd take a shitty room with really nice people over a great room with shitty people every time.Centrally located and has pretty much everything you need.Smiley faceGreat service here. The entire team from the staff that greets you to those that wait on you in the restaurants and bars do an exceptional job. Superb location overlooking the river.Time for management to re-invest in the facility though. The room furnishings are tired and beat and the furniture in The Windows restaurant is really tired , the leather on the chairs is torn and the tables are beat.This hotel has been absolutely FANTASTIC! I would stay here anytime ! If you do, try and stay on the south side  because the views of River St. are the best in town! From the front desk to the staff to the staff in the windows dinning hall, and the maid service, this hotel is top notch. Book with confidence that your stay here will be well enjoyed.The location is terrific...but this place needs some updating. The worst problem was that the elevators to the valet and river street level stopped working. None of the staff members had any idea what to do. We parked valet for $22 per night..,but they couldn't get the car out of the garage - they made us drag our stuff around the front of the hotel and down the vehicle-only valet ramp because the elevators weren't working. It was very poor customer service. Why did we pay for valet if we had to move our own car? That's called self parking and it costs less. You don't have to be a four star hotel to have four star service....absolutely cannot fault this hotel in any way.  After reading the prior reviews, I still decided to go ahead and book a room here as I was heading up to Savannah from Miami to attend a wedding and the rest of the wedding party had already booked in months ago.  While they probably had secured a much better rate, I am and always have been a last minute booker so I reserved a room a week in advance and off I went.Checking in at about 2p.m. I was greeted by a wonderfully friendly lady by the name of Patricia who told me that my room was ready to go, asked me if I needed help getting information about where to go around the city and pointed me in the direction of the concierge and gave me her name. Who goes on a trip without having first checked Yelp though so I didn't need a concierge to ask advice on where to go.  Check in was a breeze and within 10 minutes myself and my boys were in the shower (me) and sprawled across the beds fighting over the remote for the telly (my boys).Having read previous reviews I was well aware of the valet parking charge, but that was OK for me.  Coming from Miami where you need to valet your car at almost every hotel on South Beach this was nothing new.  I knew Savannah was a walking city, and the hotel being located right on the river I knew I was going to park it, forget it and not worry about it.  Besides, you can in and out your car all you want and street parking in Savannah, like Miami, is hard to find....""Ain't nobody got time for that!!""Anyway, we fucked off to the wedding in Forsythe Park and then back to the hotel for a couple of drinks in the Vue lounge and then on to the reception brunch later at the Olde Pink House, all within walking distance of the hotel.   After the reception was over we reconvened at the Vue bar at the Hyatt for some drinks and an impromptu singsong on the outside patio overlooking the river.  Apologies to other guests there that night, we were a little raucous, but the staff were excellent and even let us bring in a bottle of our own liquor and provided shot glasses so we could toast absent friend.At about 9p.m. we decided to take the party to one of the local bars for some live music and on the advice of the staff at the Vue bar they sent us to a totally appropriate venue for us to take our party into the wee hours (Molly McPhearsons Scottish bar - it was a Scottish themed wedding so it was totally appropriate).My only gripe with the Hyatt was the price of their gift shop stuff.  I had forgotten to pack spare batteries for my camera, wasn't about to go out around town after a feed of drink looking for more batteries, so ended up spending about $17 for four AAA batteries and a couple of packs of candies.  Ouch...total fuck up the arse there.  But having said that, I would expect to pay as much in the likes of the Marriott on the beach in Marco Island so hey, if you don't come prepared, be prepared to pay.The room was very comfortable and super clean and as it should be for a Hyatt, we weren't charged any extras for anything (other than the Valet which I was expecting) and the staff from check in, room service staff, bar staff, valet staff and just about everyone who we met with a Hyatt badge were more than friendly and accommodating.Location, location, location!Likely the best thing about this property.Property itself is starting to look a bit dated, like it could use a facelift.  But the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and everything is clean and kept in good working order.Bed and pillows were the best I've had in a very long time.Had the breakfast buffet in the restaurant Windows on the morning of July 4th and was impressed.  Everything was fresh and the omelette was fabulous.  Restaurant is appropriately named as the wall of windows looks out over the river.Because of the location, will likely book this place again for July 4th which is my tall handsome charming Brit's birthday.One note - our GPS at first took us in to the back of the hotel, along the ballast-stone River Street side.  Valet parking ($20 per night - ouch!) and true front entrance is off of Bay Street, away from the river.Don't check in unless you look rich. We pulled up in our 2012 Chrysler Town &amp; Country. Nobody from valet came over. My wife went inside to check in while I waited with the kids. During this time, a couple in a Honda and a man in a SUV had valets swarming around them. The man had a valet cart his one suitcase into the hotel. When she came out, we began unloading the luggage. Again, none if the three valets standing around bothered to even look at us. I told my wife that I guess I had to park the van myself. She went to the valet stand, and someone finally came over to tell me that the hotel is valet only. I replied that someone should have come sooner. As we each rolled a suitcase into the hotel, nobody offered to help us to our room, although we passed several valets. With as many hotel choices as there are in the area, I see no need to be treated like trash while spending my hard-earned money. Next time we are in Savannah, we will stay somewhere else.Do not waste your money.  The hotel is very outdated. While the staff is friendly they cannot make up for the facility.  The carpet is worn, the shower would not drain and there was an odd smell on the second floor due to construction. Plus to top it off our neighbors partied on the balcony next to us- it was like they were in the room with us.See Melissa B.'s review for detail but this place just needs new front desk management.  All other facilities parts and pieces seems fine, just fine.  The rooms were cleaned well daily, the parking attendants were nice and polite.  It's just the front desk and the check out proceduce we endured that was a nightmare of sorts.  My simple and easiest suggestion for those staying here is to make sure you know what you are getting charged before agreeing to the charges.  In short, we were almost charged an additional $50 for no good reason.All of that being said, those that travel know how tricky checkout can be when you accrue additional charges during your stay.  Being down here during St. Paddy's weekend also complicates the matter so just be careful.Workout facilities were nice and clean, gift shop, wait staff in dining room all were fine and never had an issue.  TIP:  The police departments from all over stay at this hotel during St. Paddy's so it's probably one of the safest spots to stay.  They also give out arm bands to make sure those that are in the hotel actually are staying  there.Its a good place to stay. It has nice views, and is central to everything in Savannah. It is built totally out of character for everything else here. It bothers me after being here that they ripped out so many buildings to build this place. It is comfortable, and rated against other places in other cities it stands up in its class. I would say the concierge is inconsistent with his time.  My questions about what to do and see were better answered by chatting up the docent at some historic houses and the waitress at the micro-brew across the street.This weekend makes the fourth year we've stayed here at the Hyatt. The staff is super awesome, the hotel is always clean, the rooms are sizable, the River view rooms offer a MAGNIFICENT view of the city and the noise level is always suitable. I am however only giving this hotel four stars because EACH and EVERY of the four times we've stayed here there's been some sort of quirk. On one of our stays we were charged three times for one stay, another time housekeeping neglected to clean our room during our entire 4 day stay. The general manager (Matt, I believe) was very helpful each time we complained and needless to say we were happy again. I would definitely recommend this hotel for both its proximity to the hustle and bustle of Savannah's downtown attractions and for its outstanding service.Pros:Great location right on River St., clean, smelled fresh, nice staff, comfortable bed, excellent fitness area, Starbucks in lobby, negotiated a great deal on a name your price travel site.Cons: $9.99 charge for Internet, $22 for valet parking and no self park option, had to use the room key to activate elevator and other areas in hotel (made me wonder why the security was so tight, was this an unsafe area?)The location is probably the best aspect of this hotel.  There are several activities, restaurants, and bars within walking distance.  The extra charges for Internet and valet parking however will have me looking for a different choice next time I'm staying in Savannah.Got the room through Priceline so I can't judge too harshly! The location is wonderful, you can walk anywhere in the historic district of Savannah in less than 10 minutes and even up to the park in the right shoes. It's very clean and the staff is friendly. Perks cafe downstairs is great to grab a quick coffee or Greek yogurt on your way out in the morning. Upon check in we were even able to upgrade our inside atrium view selected by Priceline to a city view. All good things.Negatives, as many people have commented there is a $10 charge for Internet. We purchased and it was so slow nothing would stream or open.  the hotel did refund the charge. $22/day valet no other parking options. This is kind of standard for the nicer hotels in savannah considering the general parking shortage but its still a bit steep. My biggest complaint is that the doors are paper thin. Ours shook anytime another would open or close and the noise from general hallway conversation made it sound like we had guests. Kept us up most of the night and early morning once housekeeping started.There's plenty of choices in downtown savannah so I'll probably see what else is out there next time.Been here twice. Both times we were able to call and get a room for $99/night. We were even upgraded to a higher floor with a view. This is a perfect location for exploring the River Walk or to walk out the front door and roam around town. The River St exit is a bit awkward. You need to take 2 elevators to get there. Savannah is awesome!Stayed here for a conference. Everything was OK overall, but given the option I wouldn't stay here again.As Hyatt's go, a great experience.  Laid out in an Embassy Suites style (interior atrium lobby with rooms on the perimeter.), they were fast and efficient at check in and rooms were clean and modern.  Situated right along the river front, guests can meander to the Vu Lounge which overlooks a section of River Walk and enjoy some tasty libations and appetizers.  A short walk or elevator ride down to the river front and you are off exploring the many shops and bars that pepper the area near this great waterfront hotel.  The area (being downtown) is saturated with many great bars and restaurants, many of which are literally right outside the front door to the hotel, one in particular, Moon River Brewing Company....a great brewery and restaurant that caught my eye.My wife, daughter and I walked across the street, they sat us immediately and had a great dinner and great beers at Moon River.  One of many outstanding places to eat in this area.  Parking is all valet so prepare for that, but the checkout process is very fast - you go down to the parking garage, they can pull your car up for you or you can do it yourself, load your bags, and your off.A great gym and indoor pool (which needed a bit more chlorine) is also available.  Would definitely stay here again.We booked through Priceline. Our King was given to another person so we stayed in a double the 1st night (lobby balcony). As soon as we walked in the room I called guest services to be moved to King immediately as we were away from home/kids enjoying some relaxation &amp; being in separate beds wouldn't work. We were put on a list &amp; told they would call us if one became available the next day. As departing the next morning I went to GS &amp; they entered us in for a transfer (would call when ready). We enjoyed breakfast &amp; since it was a rainy day returned to the hotel (being from Savannah we know rain doesn't last long), it was a little over an hour so we knew our room wasn't transferred. Returned to GS where a lady quickly sprung into action moving us to a King room, facing Bay Street. She was very understanding about our complaints with noise &amp; space. We immediately moved our things to the new room.As I feel it was not the hotels fault we were stuck in a double the 1st night, I gave them 4 starts. I don't like the $22/day parking. Being from the area I know a little - - park in a garage nearby if you can't find parking. Move out the garage &amp; into a nearby parking space after 10pm (there will be plenty), from 8am-6pm is parking meter cost, after that or weekends it is free. Don't stay in a lobby facing double. The hotel was nice, the staff was extremely nice &amp; even the shampoo smelled good.","So I stayed here for a conference July 15-19. The actual conference I attended was across the river at the Savannah Trade and Conference Center. I'll go on and say up front the only things I liked about this hotel was the fact the ferry stop is right behind the hotel on the river street side, the fact that you could walk to many different things, and that I could do a web check in that kept me from standing in like 20-30 minutes after a 4 hour drive from Atlanta.The first night there the fire alarm went off. Mind you I'm staying on the 6th floor of the hotel (the hotel has 7 floors) and I have my mom and grandmother with me. My grandmother is 76 years old with a bad knee. She didn't appreciate this too much to say the least. If you haven't guessed by now, this was a false alarm. The alarm went off at 5AM and apparently we missed one that went off at 4AM. The alarms kept going off consistently for 2 hours. Needless to say I didn't get to sleep in that day, and I was looking forward to this because that was the only day I could wake up late for my conference. Now, the reason why I say the hotel employees are not organized is the fact that you would think that someone would be at the emergency exits to inform guests of the ""emergency situation"" at hand. Us and about 100 other guests were on the back side of the hotel by ourselves and the only way we knew to go in was from someone taking the initiative to keep the door open to listen for some kind of all clear signal. Now we all know from our fire drill days that you don't go near a building that could possibly be on fire. No one knew what to do. When we got back to the lobby we still didn't hear what was going on. Needless to say that was a big fail on their part. My mom went to ask what would the compensation be for the false alarm and they said they hadn't figured it out but would know by that evening. Well, we get a knock on our door that evening from a young lady that was handing out Pralines from River Street sweets and a apology letter. Mind you this was an individual praline, not a package. Now yes, those pralines are good but they don't make up for waking us up at 5AM!! The young lady that delivered the pralines didn't totally know about the situation and when she was told she suggested we call and talk to the GM because that form of compensation wasn't enough. Long story short I guess they were just waiting for people to come and complain and then compensate them with additional things such as breakfast and a credit to the account. The first time I said something about it I was told I had a $50 credit and breakfast for two. I went and told my coworkers to make sure they asked about the same for their rooms. One did and I saw that she was talking to the supervisor on duty. This supervisor claimed I didn't have breakfast on my account, only a credit. Ohhhhkaaay fine. Then my mom goes back later and the lady she spoke with said she saw the breakfast credit, increased it to where it would cover 3 people and gave us a $100 credit. She also told me that when I checked out my stay was tax exempt (I work for a gov't entity). When I checked out with the same lady that claimed I didn't have separate credits and breakfast (by this time we used the breakfast), we still had a $100 credit and we were told by the nice lady that waited on us in the restaurant that she saw breakfast on our account. I'm confused. And I get a bill with taxes on it only to be told I was suppose to have a tax-exempt form. Why didn't the other lady tell me this? This is where I believe they were misinformed.Oh, the day the room was cleaned the maid didn't even make the beds all the way back up. SMH. And also I couldn't hear from the rooms next door but there were tons of children here and I heard them running up and down the halls and screaming everyday. Now I know this is something the hotel can't control but just know you can easily hear hallway noise.In all, my stay was so-so but I will not stay here again. I don't care how close it is to the ferry.We stayed 5 nights at the end of November for some holidays (actually my husband was working, I was mostly alone in day time with my 4 years old son).The service was good at the Window restaurant the morning. The housekeeping was good too, except ONE morning when we found the beds done like a child would have done... we didn't understand if it was done in order to get some tip the next time. But we were angry so it did not work !The Vu lounge is good, very good food, a bit expensive but it really worth it.We had a little problem (not a big deal), when we ordered some MILK for our kid before the night AND for breakfast : they gave him some water with milk chocolate powder with a LOT of sugar and... no milk. My son spent one week without real milk and I was sad because he loves that and most of all he NEEDS that.A 4 stars hotel should be VERY careful about that when families stay a long time.What I didn't like AT ALL were 2 things :1)  The smell in the bedroom... Out bedroom (with river view) was SO humid... I had to ask the housekeeping to put some perfume on the carpet to try to avoid this smell. Impossible to aerate the room because windows are totally closed... One night they did repetitions in case of fire, and ALL THE NIGHT we had an HORRIBLE smell coming from the corridor in front of our bedroom... I could'nt sleep at all and was crazy about that.2) Also, other BIG problem : the BEDS are REALLY uncomfortable. The mattresses are so soft that my husband only slept 2 or 3 hours a night. As soon as we moved back we suffered. A hell for 5 nights !!The condition of the mattress is unthinkable for a 4 star hotel...Great location - central to downtown Savannah highlights.  I was here for a conference and the hotel catered food was really fantastic.  Since I was staying at a discounted rate, I was next to the elevator which was a little loud.  The housekeeping/cleanliness was suboptimal. The gym facilities were decent.  I did appreciate that the hotel checked out umbrellas to guests during a deluge.Friendly staff and clean rooms. Great view from river rooms.This hotel has a cheesy layout where the main lobby area serves as a courtyard of sorts.  In other words, the interior rooms are provided with a ""view"" of the hotel lobby.  Fortunately, I didn't have to worry about accidentally flashing the whole hotel, as I received one of the exterior rooms, which overlooked the river.The room was outdated and the entire hotel was in desperate need of a makeover.  While I was comfortable during my stay, I was grateful that it was only for one night.  The hotel bar was slightly less expensive than usual, though I suspect the location had something to do with it.  I don't think anything in Savannah costs more than $12.  Including a Kettle martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives.The motto of this place should be 'How many stories can I make up in 20 minutes to justify why I am overcharging you!!'  We stayed there 4 nights this past weekend and it was an otherwise fine stay.....until we went to checkout.  So being St Patricks Day this past Saturday the hotel had us fill out a form of the names of two guests staying in our room.  No problem.  Form, wristbands, $25 for each extra person in the room.  That equals $50 bucks right?  Well not according to the black lady with the red glasses working behind the counter when we checked out.  When we asked why were charged $100 extra for our guests instead of $50, she came up with all of these stories:1) 'you were charged for four people in your room Saturday night'....um you mean we were charged to stay in the room we rented?  should we have slept in the hall and let our 2 registered guests stay in the room?  nope try again...2) 'The room tax on the Saturday night was the extra $50'.....um you mean you have 100% tax rate here?  nope try again...You have to set the scene properly too - this entire time talking to us and cursing at her computer she was plucking at a calculator shaking her head saying 'it's right it's right.'...was this supposed to intimidate us into paying?  It may have worked on less traveled folks.3) 'We had to charge you $509 for Friday and Saturday night because it was the weekend'.....um you mean when we prepaid in December that was not for this hotel?  nope try again....At this point I asked to speak with the manager where the lady replied she WAS the manager.....4) The fourth story she came up with was that the average room rate was wrong from the package we bought so they had to charge us more because of the holiday weekend.  nope try again....I think at this point is when I told her $25+$25=$50 that a light bulb went on in her head.  We should have only been charged $50 instead of $100 for our guests staying.  She then plucked on the calculated some more and shook her head around and started blaming her coworker for the error.  'HE charged you wrong, HE screwed your bill all up.'  Whatever - why did this take 20 minutes and undue stress to figure out???  We all make mistakes but FIX IT IMMEDIATELY and we go on our way.  She lied to us, tried to intimidate us and was unbelievably rude.We will obviously never come back here and will not recommend it to anyone.This is my first night at the Hyatt Regency in Savannah.  I gave the hotel 2 stars because of its helpful staff, excellent location, and cleanliness.  But, for the price of staying in this hotel, one would expect more than two stars.  Here is why the Hyatt Regency Savannah does not measure up:1. $10 gets you very slow wi-fi.  Forget watching a movie.  I have had better (and free) wi-fi experiences at Hampton Inns. 2. If you get an atrium room (facing the interior of the hotel), you get noise from the lobby and no natural light.3. The building is tired and ugly.  That wouldn't be so bad except its appearance defaces a beautiful waterfront.4. Keys.  I get very annoyed if I check into a hotel, get all my baggage to the room and the key doesn't work.  Next, I stand in line (again) to get help at the desk.  Go back to my room.  One key now works, the other doesn't.  Go back to the lobby. See the long line at registration.  Give up getting a replacement key until tomorrow. 5. No microwave or fridge in the room.  Thankfully, there are extra electrical plugs by the bed.  Sadly, they are behind the nightstand.I have never used this location for accommodation reasons, but it has been an incredibly convenient location for us with valet parking, especially with the closing of valet parking at the garage near Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.Spent my 2010 Thanksgiving with my sis at this Hyatt.  The room was very comfortable, and although we were on the inside instead of overlooking the street or the river, we had a sliding glass door to a small balcony, which was great for people watching!Every employee I encountered in the hotel proper was very nice.  Even the handyman asked if everything was okay when I was on our floor's 'foyer' outside the elevators, reading my book in a comfy chair (it was).  The concierge was gracious and tried to be helpful when our car was vandalized in a nearby public lot (the one in the lot in front of the hotel next door...a number of cars were vandalized, it turns out.)  Even one of the valets offered his help and a referral if we needed it.The only 2 employees that weren't wonderful were the one in the gift shop, and our server at the Thanksgiving brunch.  The gift shop lady followed my niece and I around; she is 2, but she was very well behaved and NOT doing anything wrong.  She was also rude to us when I paid for our items.  The server barely did anything more than bring us our original waters and our check.I liked the convenience of accessing River Street. It was next to some great views of both the river and the bridge, and next to all of my favorite places to shop and visit!We got a great price through Priceline ($70 last minute, over the holiday weekend!). OOOOOHHH do NOT use the phone for anything.  I didn't find what the calls cost anywhere in the room, and it was quite a shock (our cells were not working, long story).Definitely a good price for this Hyatt!!This place could use an update. My room smelled kinda mildewesque and there was some in the shower. And I realize hotels are pricey in the food department but $4 for a bagel just seems a bit ridiculous. Bed was comfy. Staff knew next to nothing about conferences and such that were scheduled. Super noisey and really thin walls.Stayed here for 3 nights on a girls-get-away with my friends.  I can't say enough good things about the hotel staff.  From the moment we walked in until we left we just had an overall wonderful experience.  Staff is friendly and helpful and contributed to us having a fun trip.  The location is perfect.  Around the corner from the fun bars, right next to all the cute shops on River Street, and a few blocks from the boutiques.  They also have a wonderful military discount.  I highly recommend choosing the Hyatt if you stay in Savannah.I really don't understand the mediocre reviews on here because I have stayed here twice and have had excellent stays both times. The hotel is very clean and comfortable which is worth paying a bit more to me. All the staff are friendly and were always asking if they could help in any way. The valet price does seem rather high but I guess it's just part of staying here. The rooms and beds are very comfortable. Fitness center is very adequate. In short, if you want a clean, dependable, large hotel experience in Savannah then you can't go wrong here.From the check in desk with Tamika, to valet with Maya, to the Vu Lounge with Vicky, hospitality at its best. Room was clean and night time River/River St. view provided a great backdrop to the staffs smile and warmth. I used the ""name your price"" feature on priceline so I got the room for almost half off as well. :-)We decided to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Savannah b/c I had a gift card, and it looked like a perfect location for the family to explore the city.  MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Beautiful hotel in the perfect location for Savannah...great valet staff giving us a warm welcome upon arrival, great front desk staff explaining room upgrades for river view.  Very friendly concierge services reps, although they could have been more prepared with actual recommendations of things to do for families in Savannah. Overall, we had a great all-around experience at the Hyatt Regency and would gladly return in the future.We stayed here for St. Pattrick's day week, so we paid close to $500 a night for our room. I know we paid for location, but i didn't realize that's almost all that you're paying for.Extra charge for wifi, $5 bottle of water, $20 valet charge, no breakfast included. I heard that even on non-holiday weekends this place is $200 and up per night. I've stayed in $100 a night places that were as nice as this. Definitely not crappy, but nothing out of the ordinary whatsoever. I can't say that i would automatically say no to this place sometime in the future, but i would definitely look hard for other options.Used the valet parking; upon my return the porter couldn't locate the keys to my new car (still w/ temp tags).  Porter I left my car/keys with @ the valet stand wasn't there when I returned.  After 10-15 minutes they were found unattended @ the valet stand ... not okay.This 4-star hotel is smack-dab in the center of historic downtown Savannah within walking distance to all major sightseeing. The hotel is definitely situated on the historic Riverwalk, but from our room (and from none other, could that be visually verified).The hotel design was less than stellar for a romantic or casual getaway. The open atrium which allows voices to carry from the ground floor concourse to the uppermost 7th floor, which made it truly difficult to sleep.All items we encountered, which would be considered complimentary in most hotels were expensive - everything is charged (i.e. bottled water was $5 each &amp; wifi was billed by the hour). Overall, this getaway was a bargain find - for a better overnight stay, we'll stick with mid-level (3-star) hotels with amenities that we can count on.This hotel is nice especially with the new renovations that have been done to the hotel recently. My room has a view of the river and the historic city hall. The staff has been superior and definitely will stay here when I return to Savannah.""Oh baby, oh baby, yeah....""I've stayed here two times now - once in 2008 and last month. While I've had no problems with the service, location of the hotel or the quality of the rooms, my most memorable experience with the Hyatt was on my first night of this visit.  I woke up from a dead sleep at 6 in the morning to what I thought was a ghost, but was actually the sounds of the couple next door having sex.  And for quite some time.  I woke my bf up to make sure I wasn't hearing things and I swear I tried not to laugh my ass off too loud.  It went on for about an hour before they got tired or whatever and I went back to sleep cracking up.  The bf slept through it all.If you happen to get a shared door room, I recommend you place a pillow at the bottom of the door, just in case it happens to you.Nothing to really complain about here but they could use a few upgrades for their cost.  Luckily we didn't have to pay as it was expensed on my wifes business. Their service was great and did alot to help out with us having two adults and three kids.  I would even say they went out of their way.  The staff was great in every aspect of the place.  The one thing I will mention to others is, this place in smack down town in Savannah's historic area.  Your going to pay alot to stay here.  Like with most hotels in popular areas you will get a high cost and not a lot of stuff out of it other than a room as anything extra will cost you more.  Realize that before you book here and you shouldn't be upset.","['night', 'family', 'recently', 'trip', 'back', 'great', 'rate', 'included', 'breakfast', 'valet', 'looking', 'hotel', 'indoor', 'pool',
