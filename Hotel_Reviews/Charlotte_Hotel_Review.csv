http://www.yelp.com/biz/quality-inn-and-suites-airport-charlotte,Quality Inn & Suites Airport,1.5,$,18,"I stayed at the Quality Inn due to a flight delay. The hotel was very close to the airport so it was a relief knowing that I didn't have to worry about a long commute in the morning to catch my new flight. The shuttle picked me up at the airport and the driver was very friendly. Upon arriving at the hotel the lobby was very comfy looking with a lot of comfortable seating along with a television. I unfortunately forget the name of the guy who was working the front desk but he was great. He was checking in nine of us due to a delayed flight and even though he seemed a bit stressed he was kind and polite the entire time. He was patient with all of us and made sure he got us in quickly since it was after midnight and we were already tired. Plus the computers were down so he had to check us all in the old fashioned way. He even provided me with toothpaste because I did not have any. My room was pretty nice I had an AC, a flat screen TV, a fridge and a coffee maker. The bathroom was pretty spacious and clean. My only complaint would be that the middle blanket on the bed was stained and ripped but other than that everything was great. Also, continental breakfast is not supposed to start until 6 and when I came downstairs to catch the 6:00AM shuttle to the airport the same guy who checked me in already had a lot set up so I was able to grab some food before I left which was great.Had to stay here because its one of the very few low cost hotels in the area that has double queen handicapped rooms. I came to Charlotte for my sisters wedding and we had to stay in this sh**hole. Overall, worst hotel I've ever stayed in! As we were checking in, I was rudely interrupted by the lady behind the desk. She treated me like I was 10! I'm 21! When we got into our rooms, the air was off and it was stuffy. Plus the channel buttons on the remote doesn't work. In the bathroom, there's plenty of space for a wheelchair, but the shower?! The splash guard is too low and causes the whole floor to get flooded! Also the shower curtain isn't long enough to reach the floor! We left for most of the afternoon and came back finding the room uncleaned and the dirty towels still on the floor! I went to the desk to ask for clean towels and we had to wait more than an hour to get them! I'd give this place less than a star if I had the chance!!I called with a question and the attendant woman was rude, saying she is busy and has other guests. She quickly threw out an answer and had a very clear attitude! Called Nov 22nd morning, around 9 am.Wish I'd read some of the reviews here before agreeing to let American Airlines patch me through to the Quality Inn when our flight was changed requiring an overnight stay in Charlotte. My wife and I waited over an hour for the shuttle in sub-30 degree weather. Once it finally did arrive, a large party snagged the available seats (pretty sure we were there first). We finally ended up grabbing a cab. What really did it was the number of times we called only to be told ""you must have missed it"" and ""it would be there shortly"" with no assistance offered on how not to miss it again (the loading zone at Charlotte-Douglas is a free for all). The staff were very short with us and not accommodating at all.  We finally had to ask them what the shuttle looked like and that they contact the driver while we were holding to get a timeframe. The room seems clean, although the hotel overall seems a bit run down. I'm generally not one to leave reviews like this but making an exception in this case. Can't speak for other hotels close to the airport but strongly suggest looking elsewhere (and just grab a cab if you don't want the hassle/frustration of the shuttle service).I'm just going to call this place motel hell. I got stuck in Charlotte due to weather, and called this hotel without doing my homework (and I will no longer use Choice Hotels without serious research!). This is possibly the scariest hotel I have been in since sleeping 6 to a room in Port of Oakland on New Year's Eve for Grateful Dead concerts. There was a bloody handprint on the bathroom door jamb, and I decided not to call housekeeping because I was too uncomfortable to allow *anyone* into the room. I slept with a chair shoved under the door and didn't let my bare skin touch anything.To it's credit: the bed was comfortable, and it had no bed bugs. Terrible. Don't stay here.It amazes me that there are so many bad reviews, and the actual company itself has not done anything. This is a national company with standards! (or you'd think...?)Like many yelpers, I was here because of a weather delay. I needed something cheap, close to the airport and clean. I didn't want to cough up extra money for a place I didn't care about, I just needed a clean bed. I figured it's a national chain so I should expect something at least clean. First I was put in a smoking room. They didn't have anything else available, so I won't default them for that. But who has smoking rooms anymore?? My suitcase and everything in it for the rest of my trip smelled like stale cigarettes. There were, what looked like cigarette burns in the tub? A lot of them in fact. There were holes in the wall, the TV had no remote and was from the early 90's. The carpet was rippled in areas (not attached to the floor properly) and had red stains all over (I PRAY to god it wasn't blood!!) I tried to sleep, but on top of all of that, the curtains were sheer and there was a spotlight from the parking lot shining directly into my room and lighting it up. Also, people were walking by all night being loud and I could hear everything. They could basically see me in bed too which was uncomfortable. Also in the morning, there was a fight between a customer waiting for the shuttle to the airport and whoever was working at the front desk. I think they were both a little correct, but at some point the response should have been: ""I apologize sir, but thank you for bringing that to my attention"" maybe an offer to get him some coffee? Something? So the entire shuttle ride was SUPER awkward. I'm going to forward this to the corporate offices. I just don't understand why someone isn't doing something about it!!!Not even at the hotel yet and it's looking grim. Waiting over 30 minutes for my shuttle and no sight of a driver. I've tried calling the hotel numerous times and no answer ... Or ringtone for that matter. More to come. If I ever get there.This just in. They FORGOT about picking me up. Nope. Not off to a good start.The stay never improved. Dirty accommodations and inattentive staff.I feel bad writing this because at the point in our delayed journey when we arrived at the Quality Inn we were just happy to have a bed and somewhere to sleep, but I honestly think I would rather just taken a nap in a rocking chair at the airport. Our non-smoking room smelled like it had previously been used exclusively to host chain smokers anonymous meetings, the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned in this decade, and I know that the air conditioner was straight up lying to me about the temperature. Me and my traveling companion both ended up spending the majority of our 3 hour stay having a scratching contest, one that I'm worried neither of us will win, and could last for several weeks past our stay. The girl at the front desk was nice and the shuttle service was relatively painless, but between the itching and the sirens (it sounded like they were filming a homicide show down the street) I can't say that I awoke well rested or in any better state than when I arrived. Next time I hope American Airlines just cuts me a check and tells me to pull up a rocking chair.Grimy, dirty room.  Exposed wiring, most outlets non-functioning.  Broken furniture.  Awful!  The airport put us up here after they cancelled out flight.This is a no thrills but really good hotel near the airport.Rooms were a nice size with two double beds, some come with microwaves and mini-fridges.  The tub and toilet area was pretty smallLocation was good, next to a gas station, Cracker barrel and Waffle House, also with a short drive to a Walmart and other small shopping center.All in all you get what you pay for, it isn't the Ritz but you'll get a clean room with comfortable beds in a safe area. Definitely worth the price if you're looking for a decent hotel in the Charlotte area.After waiting over an hour at the airport for the shuttle to arrive (alongside other guests) the shuttle finally arrived.  When I got to the hotel I walked in the doors and immediately knew I made a mistake.  There is a smell in the lobby that makes you want to shower instantly.  It only gets worse when you finally make it to your room.  Spend the extra 20.00 to stay somewhere else!Place is nice &amp; clean, just was disappointed by the very cold &amp; unfriendly staff. I missed my connecting flight due to a winter storm. When I called to make hotel reservation, I was told hotel was full and was hung up on, while I was talking. Yet, I was able to book oa room online. Then, when I called front desk to kindly ask about late checkout since I wasn't able to get on a late evening flight. Barely finished talking and was hung up on after telling me I can stay till 2pm. :(This was really one of the worst hotel experiences I've had. The top reason for the poor experience: the staff. They were unpleasant and frustrating every step of the way.This was a business trip and the credit card auth from my major, well-known workplace via our well-known travel agency hadn't come through. An inconvenience, but it's not like it's the first time it's ever happened. And other hotels have always understood and worked with me - it's never been an issue.With this particular hotel, though, major issue. On a Sunday night, there's not a whole lot I can do as nothing is open, but after some serious haggling, I get a key to a room. And then on Monday morning, I get a call at 8:00am telling me my personal credit card wouldn't go through. Well, of course, it won't - and they shouldn't have been trying to get it to go through anyways. And I was told that I had until noon (check-out time) to get it sorted out. And they wound up charging my personal credit card for one night's stay (even though they knew they were getting an auth from my work AND it wasn't even check-out time (they're deadline) or anything yet). And the worst part of it all was just how unfriendly the staff was. You'd think I was a criminal or something trying to scam them. I guess business travelers aren't common here.And on that note, I would say that is probably true. There were a couple of families, but for the most part the clientele was on the sketchy side. I'm never one to be put off or freaked out by a hotel, but I definitely had a prickly feeling staying here. So I would add safety to the list of concerns about this place.And finally, the rooms. Well, they aren't too too terrible. I would give the rooms themselves 2 stars. Older and not particularly well-kept. But there is a TV, fridge, microwave, desk, and plenty of lamps. Bathroom wasn't too bad either. A/C system was one of those under the window things, which is horrible and never gets the room feeling comfortable (and certainly does nothing about the dreadful humidity).So yeah, go elsewhere. There's really no reason to stay here.What a horrible experience!!! The website made this place look decent for the price. It would be a huge understatement to call that misleading. We arrived and the front desk clerk was on the phone screaming, laughing, and ignoring us. She finally said to the person on the other end: ""let me get off this phone and do some work"". She then hung up the phone and just looked at us. We asked for an early check in because I was ill and needed rest an possibly a doctor. She simply said ""NO"". She was rude and extremely inconsiderate. We returned later in the evening and checked into our room. There were parties, slamming doors, yelling, loud music, airplanes landing, and everything else that might possibly keep one from relaxing. The room was small and the building is just plain dirty. If you're looking for a pleasant, clean and relaxing experience, save your money and go someplace else. I have nothing good to say about this hotel.Staff was friendly and welcoming .Rooms appeared clean. Not bad for $55 night for a double .Surprised I saw such bad talk about this place. I almost did not book it.... Luckily, I did. It was very nice, the staff was so helpful and went totally out of their way to help me..Breakfast was pleasant, but what can you say for a continental breakfast?Easily accessible to the  highway, walk to eat some dinner or if you need to head to Walmart it's a short drive away.After a flight delay, I ended up at the Quality Inn and Suites.  The place was a bit run down with the staff needing some much needed time off.  The overall quality was medium with getting a good night sleep, hot water in the morning and a basic breakfast though would not call it a continental (more like a Costco breakfast).  I would not go back as the Red Roof Inn and others adjacent are cheaper and look just fine.  Overall, if you need a quick place to stay off the highway, it would work, though I would not recommend more than a night there.  The hotel overall feels like it needs some help.By god, what an abhorrable experience.  One star is far too good for this dump. My wife and I stayed here the Saturday and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, 2012.  The individual who checked us in and who was working the evenings, Andrea (I believe), and the male fellow working in the mornings/day (never got his name) clearly do not know what the phrase ""customer service"" means.  Here's a sampling, dear readers, of what we had to experience.  I will number them so you do not get lost, there's THAT many instances:1.  When we arrived, there was no, ""Welcome to Quality Inn/Charlotte/insert appropriate greeting here"" by the attendant, Andrea.  It was a short, curt ""Reservation?""  Answering in the affirmative, she uttered, ""Method of payment and driver's license please."".  Mind you, during this entire interaction it was conveyed that we were clearly infringing on her time.  We were never made to feel at home.  She gave us room 200, which should never be allowed for human occupation.  2. We arrived in the dreaded room 200, said by Andrea to be right above the lobby, and it was readily apparent that the following were issues:A. The carpeted floor beneath the huge air conditioner vent in the ceiling was soaking wet due to condensation dripping constantly.  B. The tub had a very slow drain, as my wife unfortunately found out during a shower.C. When attempting to call to report this, the phone was apparently disconnected.D. There was no hair dryer.E. There was no coffee pot.F. The room did not feel entirely secure.3. I immediately went downstairs and informed Andrea that the room was substandard and that we needed another room.  A couple of her friends/co-workers were also at the counter and overheard me saying this.  One of them said, ""Sounds like room 200 again."", which indicated to me that the room was known to be a substandard room.  Andrea gave me my new room key cards to 202, with nary a word of apology or empathy.  Again, I felt like I was infringing on her time.  4. At 5 am the following morning, we received a wake up call that we did NOT request (I informed the male desk staff at breakfast the following morning about this and to make sure we did not receive another one the next morning).5. Breakfast was substandard.  The hard-boiled eggs were substandard and old, the milk for cereal was warm, and the entire breakfast area was a mess (dirty tables, crumbs on the counter and tables).  6. After coming back to the hotel from a jaunt to downtown Charlotte, we discovered our key cards did not work to room 202.  We both went to the front desk and found Andrea working, so we told her the key cards no longer worked.  Again, with no kind of apologetic response or empathy, she simply re-keyed our cards and slid them back on the counter to us.  She clearly did not care.  7.  Yes, I am actually up to seven.  At the time we came down to get our key cards re-keyed, there was another lodger there who was clearly waiting in line for a while.  The male staffer was also there with Andrea and finally the lodger said, ""Excuse me.  I still haven't received room service"" (which indicated that this was an ongoing issue with her), to which he responded very casually with no sense of concern, ""Yes, we know."" He went back to whatever it was that he was doing behind the desk.  That was then we dealt with Andrea and her incompetence or purposeful neglect at not keying our key cards.8. My wife happened to walk by room 200, which was open at the time, and discovered two disgruntled guests who were stunned at the room they were given.  My wife quickly summed up our experiences with them and they promptly went down to the front desk to demand another room.  Though they appeared to have gotten another room (or left), later in the evening we found a 'Do Not Disturb' card inserted in the top of the key card lock, indicating that this room had been rented out again.  Incredible.9. When we checked out, the male attendant from the previous day was there and arguing with a lodger, to whom he swore at on the phone.  The overall feeling throughout this ordeal was that we were either dealing with a fantastically incompetent hotel staff or being targeted by them for whatever reason.  Also, we did not feel entirely safe in our room since previous treatment by the staff, particularly Andrea, suggested that she may have been capable of tipping off some undesirable elements of where we were staying so as to rob us.  This is not an exaggeration.Since this was our first time to this part of the country, we had no way of knowing that this experience was to be an awful one. Please learn from our experience and steer well clear of this place.  How anyone could willingly treat people like this in such a customer service position and clearly not be bothered by people's reactions to their callous, carefree demeanor is beyond me.  I will be seeking a full refund once I am done writing this much-needed review.",,,,,"['quality', 'inn', 'due', 'flight', 'delay', 'hotel', 'close', 'airport', 'relief', 'knowing', 'worry', 'long',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-charlotte-arrowood-charlotte-2,Courtyard Charlotte Arrowood,4.0,$$,17,"This Arrowood Courtyard was a very nice hotel. It is in a very good location. You just need to check your routes; and see which route you want to take. It is close to the interstates, I-77 and I-485; South Blvd; and Tryon Street.  It is also close to  attractions, Uptown and very good  restaurant; and shopping malls, which we found out on our last night. Our room was very nice. It had a big flat screen TV in it. They also had a small  refrigerator, that had a little freezer in it; and it kept our drinks real cold. The bed was  comfortable , but the  mattress was a little too soft for me. And, Ladies, the  Vanity is in a  separate Room, from the tub and the toliet.  I loved that part.  I felt like the hotel was in a pretty safe location.Burned up some of my Marriott points to have my Mom stay here while she visited in Charlotte. The location is great, right off the Interstate. Plenty of parking. Very friendly staff.When we were walking up to the room, I spotted some trash on the floor. And a moment later, one of the staff picked it up. No waiting until the cleaners got to it. This guy just... did it. That's great!The room was quiet enough, other than a bunch of idiots shouting in the hallway late one evening. Seriously, folks. People are sleeping. Otherwise, all good.We did not stay here. Theres a bridal event taking place. The lobby is cool....honestly I wouldn't mind hanging here all day. Also the staff is very friendlyMy grandmother came to visit me for a couple of days and since I live in a third floor apartment we had to find something with fewer steps so that we could make sure she enjoyed her visit. Enter Courtyard Marriott. I mean, it's a Marriott...how could we go wrong?Well, the good first, the remodel that they did to the lobby and entrance was beautiful. Very modern and hip. There's a bistro that serves up some yummy breakfast and Starbucks coffee...so that's totally a win. The rooms on the other hand could use a makeover. They seemed a bit dated. The wallpaper was old, there was no refrigerator and the bathrooms were just meh. The bad; there was one small incident when we arrived, the water was running very dirty. All brown and rust colored, when we called the front desk, they sent maintenance right away and even left a chocolate hammer (YES, I said chocolate hammer....I included a picture!)  with an apology note! Nice touch. Overall, I don't know if I would recommend family staying here again but it was reasonably priced and close to home so it served it's purpose for this visit.This is a pretty nice hotel.Everything was OK except for the trash in the room above me.Every ten minutes they were lighting up a cigarette and for whatever reason my AC was sucking it into the room.There is no feeling like sleeping in an ash tray.A group of friends and I decided to do a quick weekend getaway. We choose Charlotte and I was tasked with finding a hotel for the six of us. I went to Expedia as usual and found this hotel. The pictures were nice as well as price. We arrived and walked through the doors and all I could say is wow. The property was newly renovated to perfection. The rooms were spacious with balconies and refrigerators. The staff was professions and attentive. I was thoroughly impressed and will definitely stay here again!!!Typical Marriott Courtyard. Updated lobby. Normal size rooms. Nice and clean. My only complaint would be my toilet seat was chipped. At first glance, it looks unclean but it's just the paint/surface chipping.A standard Courtyard Marriott... This location has an updated lobby with The Bistro (food/coffee/beer &amp; wine). The parking lot has plenty of (free) parking. The wi-fi is complimentary and offers decent speeds. The rooms were really clean and the beds were comfy.Location wise - Super convenient access to I-77. Starbucks, Jack in the Box, Sonic &amp; Wendy's are within walking distance.Recently renovated hotel done in the original Courtyard style (block style building with room balconies surrounding a central Courtyard). Has the newer bistro in the lobby with bar / coffee shop / restaurant. Prices are much better than the older $10-$12 buffet breakfast.Rooms and decor are that classic bulk interior of any Courtyard in the country. Same images, same shelves, same furniture. Wifi is free and reliable. Rooms were very clean, the beds are that amazing foam, and everything worked well. Will stay here againThere is a real Starbucks next door (within walking distance) too.Excellent customer service. We drove 6 hours arriving at 10 am and were able to check in and rest before beginning our day in Charlotte. The room was nice and clean and the bed was comfy. Right off of 77, within walking distance to multiple fast food joints. Would definitely stay again when in the area.Checked in at midnight, front desk girl was nice and helpful. Beds are firm. Shower heads powerful but not so that it feels like being stabbed with a million needles. Room clean but we found a bug of some variety when we tried to use the pull out couch. My rewards profile says foam pillows, asked for in the morning but wasn't in the room that night. They did send some up after second request. ""Bistro"" with Starbucks in lobby :) pool is being renovated.I read some not so good reviews on google and I must say those have got to be prior to their remodel. This Courtyard Marriot has been remodeled to look just like the rest of the chains hotels. The rooms are renovated, the lobby is new and the staff is friendly. Id def recommend this hotel for a business trip or overnight stay.Excellent customer service!  Hotel was very clean.  Bartender Irish Lady was awesome...Had a great time and would definitely recommend to everyone!!!Rooms are smaller than I am used to,  but the coffee is free, the room a/c worked well and was quiet, and the lobby was very attractive.  Breakfast available if you want, but it costs.  Easy to work in the room.Clean. Great for price. Comfy bed and pillows. Nicely maintained. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Nice lobby with bistro. Free wifi. Free parking. Pool and small fitness center.Nice, typical Courtyard in a convenient location.  The rooms and public spaces are very clean, and the staff are friendly.  I'd never think it, but the actual courtyard itself is one of the nicer ones I've seen at this chain where you'd expect it all the time.Across the street is a Starbucks (1/2 star for that), and some fast food.  That's about it for the area, but it's within driving striking distance to a lot.Great location right off I77. Not far from airport. Starbucks across the street. Older Courtyard lobby. Due for a upgrade to the new concept. Which leads me to the breakfast. Nice and easy, but old style buffet. I don't want to go to the trough for breakfast. I would like something prepared for me. Save the buffet for the Fairfield Inn. Rooms need an upgrade too. The pillows felt like balls of nylon. Not to comfortable.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-points-by-sheraton-charlotte-charlotte,Four Points by Sheraton Charlotte,3.5,$$,20,"I stayed in this hotel 2 times this week and both in suites with king size beds.Pros: The people at the front desk were very nice and polite every time. The exercise room is open 24 hrs. Rooms were very clean. Parking is well lit with security cameras. Nice setup and roomy. Two nice flat screen TV's in both rooms with clear picture.Cons: The rooms are a little bit worn and dated. No complementary breakfasts.Conclusion: The room was paid for by using points so I don't really know if the price is right.A solid 4 star hotel in my book.You want to charge a $150 fee for a dog stay on top of a room fee that is only $106.  Are you people fucking tripping???This hotel by every appearance seemed good, possibly even above average. But as I will detail there are enough issues to rate it below par in my book.This stay was complimentary by US Airways because my flight was delayed. I was forced to stay over and it was beyond my control as to which hotel would be chosen. The hotel shuttle picked me, other passengers displaced and some airline crew up to deliver us to the hotel. This was good, no hitch in the transportation at all.Check in was also flawless and easy, no issues here. It was after midnight and I just needed to get something to eat and go to bed. The staff directed me to a 24 hour diner which I hit up.The neighborhood is somewhat sketchy, if your not careful you may accidentally roll into one of the two strip clubs that are within a half mile. I let that urge go, I was beat and just got something to eat. My assumption is the area has prostitution and as you will later hear details I think this hotel is utilized in this activity. After dinner it was after 1 AM and I entered the floor to screams. I thought WTF, is someone being murdered. As I approached my door I found the screams of delight coming from across the hall. Sometimes you just can't resist and I went to the door to see what was up. Sure enough it was someone having a really good time in bed, at least she was because the shrill screaming seemed to go on and on. The do not disturb sign made me only want to bang on the door and tell them to quiet down, but I let that urge go too!The room appeared in order, but I later found the sheets worn. The room was outdated with no plug ins in site. I called for a wake up call. Next morning a live person called me, nice touch...but it was an hour early and they apologized. They reset it for an hour later, but never followed up, so I almost missed the shuttle and never got a hot breakfast offered.No issues with the shuttle back to the airport and after getting settled in for breakfast a cockroach was located on my food tray which I thought seemed weird, but it was not on my food, the woman in front of me freaked out as I flicked it off of my tray. Later in the day on my travel another cockroach was located by a passenger who yelled at me saying sir, sir you have something on your bag. My assumption is something I cannot prove, but in my opinion they came from the hotel.Possibly the best thing about this stay would have been if I had hit a strip joint up. I will remember this hotel and never set foot in it again.If not for the sign on the building I would think I was in a $50 hotel. The worst I have experienced-appears to have been last renovated 20 years ago, ceiling tiles do not meet the wall in the bathroom and are stained. The shower curtain rolls downhill on the rod, cannot keep it closed. Walls thin so hear every word said in the next room and the coffee pot was filthy. The halls smell of smoke despite being a non-smoking floor.  The response to my concerns was to come back for another visit...totally tone deaf.  Plenty of hotels in Charlotte - no need to go here.This is honestly a great hotel. Very nice rooms and always clean. I have to give it one star though because EVERY TIME I stay here I NEVER get a wake up call. I am in this hotel multiple times a month and have learned to always set my phone and alarm clock instead. The employees at the front desk always say they will look into it but it never changes. Obviously they don't really care about the issue. You would think as a hotel close to the airport they would care about this issue. But they don't. It's not that I don't hear it, I stay in hotels 20 nights it of the month and never have a problem except here. The phone lines are always crackling and when you call the front desk to set a wake up call and are talking to them you can still hear a ringtone on the line. I'm sure that's a part of the problem. But once again even though I explain that to them nothing changes.Hotel was lovely. I stayed with a friend for one night on a stopover on our way to the west coast. Clean room, comfortable bed, located next to a variety of food options. We used SPG points and were given a free upgrade. Free airport shuttle which is convenient for travelers. Overall a nice stay -- Only low point was getting a terse call at 7:04AM from the front desk asking if we were still planning to take the 7:10AM shuttle and if we could please hurry up.Location - Great.  Everything is nearby.Parking - Literally, we nabbed the last spot in the lot.Hotel - Lobby is small.  Rooms were really shabby and old.  Also, the walls were super thin.  We would hear people walking by and talking very clearly.Nice hotel, not much to look at from the outside and kind of tucked behind other businesses, yet the suites are big, clean, and bright. It's close to the airport and there are a ton of dining options several you can walk to... Good for business travel...The shuttle starts at 5:30 NOT 5am like their website says! Now we have a get a cab and pay $20! Grrrrrrrr!!!!!!The rest of the hotel is clean and comfortable. I'd stay here again if the shuttle time wasn't a factorVery nice Four Points, with a complementary airport shuttle.I usually stay at the Sheraton across town, however, this hotel is located within walking distance to many local restaurants and the LYNX Light Rail Public Transportation Train system, a quick trip to Downtown Charlotte.Everyone we encountered here was fantastic, kind and beaming with true southern hospitality.Thank You Four Points !I roll through Charlotte often, and usually stay at the magnificent Westin in that great city.  This trip I just happened to notice the very competitive rates being offered by Four Points, and if I am being honest, cheaped out. I was most pleasantly surprised.  Wonderfully clean, spacious rooms, truly convenient.  There's even a light train down the street that takes you past the Westin itself and into the center of downtown.  You simply cannot beat their rates.  If you're a cash and points hawk like myself you can literally steal a great room at this property for $30bucks and just 1500 starpoints.  Free parking.  Eloquent Alex at the front desk is wonderful and has the greatest sense of service and humor.  This is how you win over the business traveler.  You combine the best people, with quality and value.  My new temporary home in Nawfkarolyna.Hey, it does the job.  It's cheap, has everything you need.  Close to food, good TV channels, and reliable internet.Not a full service hotel.  Food service is strictly breakfast (not free, you pay at the front desk).  They have comp coffee in the lobby.  There is a tiny bar off the lobby.  Rooms are nice, beds are great!Some restaurants that are walkable, and if they have the time, the van will take you to nearby locations.  The light rail system runs right past the hotel and NO you cannot hear it.  Don't worry.My wife and I were heading to Charlotte for the Carolina Rebellion and as SPG members we called ahead and booked a room here. When we got to our room we were surprised. We got a suite so we had a living room and dinning area that were separate from the bedroom and bathroom. The bed is a king size and very comfy. This is easily one of the nicest Sheraton owned hotels I have stayed at.The kitchenette has a one cup coffee pot, microwave, small fridge, cabinets and a two seat table. The living room area has a desk, sofa with side tables, coffee table, chair &amp; TV.The bathroom is very small as with just a toilet and the shower. The shower does have the curved shower rod so the curtain isn't right on top of you when you shower. The sink is outside of the bathroom and the counter top is fairly spacious. I have few complaints with this place but the ones I do have are as follows:The coffee tasted like cardboard. When I opened the pack it smelled great and as it was brewing it smelled nice but the taste was just cardboard. I am not sure if it is the coffee itself or just the cups it brews into but either way, not good. At least they have real half and half and not the powdered crap.The soap. They did not give us new soaps when they cleaned the room, we had to go to the desk for some.We called for a late checkout and again the following morning room room service was knocking on my door because the dude that was working the night before did not put us in for it. WTF? What is so hard about that? All in all, if that is all I have to bitch about, not bad! If I come to Charlotte again I would have no problems staying here again. On a more positive note, some of the employees like Alex are very friendly &amp; have no problems recommending some things to do in the area.In town for a mix of work and play, I chose the Four Points by Sheraton because of great rates and a convenient location. We had a party of 3 who stayed for 2 nights. The staff was friendly enough and the rest of the amenities were average at best. However, I do not plan on returning and cannot recommend it.Our observations (best to worst):1. Location. Nearby, McKoy's has delicious food (assuming you're not on a diet). The ladies at Expert Nails right in front of the hotel are really sweet, do a great job and offer a steal of a deal - $35 spa mani/pedi. Everything else you need is really close by, plus quick access to 77.2. People watching. We witnessed a middle-aged man who appeared to have met just his, um, ""lady friend"" for the first time. The gas station on the corner nearby always seemed to have a police car or two. We witnessed a guy getting arrested, while another gentleman filmed the whole thing on his phone from a few yards away.3. Poor TV quality, no DVD player, no iPod or USB hookup. We ordered a movie one night and the quality was so terrible that it was difficult to watch. Parts of the movie were so dark that we literally could not make out what was going on.4. No access to stairs. I realized a new pet peeve: hotels that do not allow you to use the stairs. The stairs were for emergency access only. Please allow access and stop encouraging everyone to be lazy.5. A few odd smells. Upon entering our room, we detected a faint urine smell. We sniffed around the room and it went away. The beds smelled clean. The next day, the elevator reeked of gasoline.The room service is a bad set up. The food is prepared off-site. I ordered cheese garlic bread and two glasses of wine, they said 30 min. It took over 40 min and the garlic bread was a large hot dog bun with cheese in the middle. Because they don't actually cook the food here its not like you can get a better one without waiting another 30-40 min. I wanted to give my cc# over the phone when I made the order but they said they would bring the cc machine up with the food. The guy forgot, so he had to go get that, 20 min later he returned. My advice to Sheraton Four Points, don't offer room service, I could have easily put shoes on and gotten a roll from KFC next door and a bottle of wine for under $10 within 10 min and be relaxing now.The 4 points staff were amazing! We hosted an engagement party there and all of our guests were comfortable, happy, and well fed. Shuttle service to the airport is hourly which is amazing. Would come back!!! Brandon was absolutely wonderful :)I got stranded over night at Charlotte-Douglas, and jumped at a hotel voucher I was offered by the airline. The first choice I heard was for Sheraton and went with it with no previous experience. I was very pleased to arrive at a clean, comfortable hotel, and thrilled to sink into a memory foam mattresszzzzzzzzzzz.................Not too bad but right next to light rail line.  Easy in and out.As a person who is relocating to Charlotte I have had to stay in a hotel room for the last month.  At first I stayed at the Hyatt Place near the airport.  Would definitely recommend NOT staying there.  Moved to the Four Points and am very happy.  The staff is what makes this place.  From the front desk personnel (Alex, Jeff, and Kookie) to the engineer Walt to the bartenders (Cindy, Cathy, and Dane) it is just outright EXCELLENT staff.  It comes from the top - Mr. Mike (the GM).  The room is clean and comfortable, there is a nice fitness center with good workout equipment, a pool, washer/dryer available, and a bar.  They also have a shuttle that goes to the airport at no charge and Al is the taxi driver who services the Four Points (the front desk will call him at any hour if you need a ride).  All in all it is a great place to stay when you're in Charlotte.  You do get points for Starwood.",,,,,"['hotel', 'times', 'week', 'suites', 'king', 'size', 'beds', 'pros', 'people', 'front', 'desk', 'nice', 'polite', 'every', 'time', 'exercise', 'room', 'open',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-charlotte,Country Inn & Suites,3.0,$$,17,"I'd love to give this hotel 5 stars because the staff is super nice, breakfast is good, reliable shuttle service, the rooms, for the most part are usually tidy and comfortable. But there are quite a few inconsistencies at this location, compared with most Country Inn and Suites that I frequent. The fitness room is Awful! Nothing works...treadmill is out of service, the elliptical wheel turns but nothing on the screen works to monitor or set workouts, the weight center is missing a bench and accessories, and the TV has no signal (and 2 employees couldn't figure it out either!). And no free weights! Now that winter is upon us, it'd be nice to be able to exercise in a fitness room that had working equipment like most hotels. There is also usually a fridge and microwave in my room, but this room, both were missing, as well as my TV had no signal until the maintenance guy came and did something. The next morning...same issue, except there was no maintenance guy around to push whatever buttons he pushed. I tried, but instead got all kinds of menus that just ran in circles, so no TV.This is what a cheap airport hotel should be. Fantastic staff, two outstanding shuttle drivers, and beds as comfortable as the 189$ Holiday Inn we stayed in the night before. With every amenity you could expect and a solid free breakfast for $50/night, I will be back any time I'm stuck in Charlotte. Or even just to visit. They made being here on an overnight layover enjoyable and comfortable.The place is a little dated, but I can't knock them for that. This is a hotel where you'll feel very at home. Bonus points for quietness and cleanliness.Overall - OK. BEDS SEEMED CLEAN. rooms were clean - but no friggen elevators?!?!wow. I'm writing another line so this is a review and not a tip. Am I there yet??Nice clean hotel with free internet, good breakfast, outside pool, little library room, nice personal. Exercise room has weight machine and treadmill machine. No elevator but nice clean hallways. Good place and for me 3.5*As we travel around each week we have learned that we like the Country Inn &amp; Suites, except this one. I think this was the first one ever built. Ew. Don't get me wrong here, we would stay here again compared to what else is around. But compared to other CI&amp;S this one sucks. And there was no water in the pool! The rooms were clean just old. Since our room was in the back we went out the back door, or we went out to the ashtray. It smelled so bad right around the door. Somebody clean that crap up! One our last day we brought out our breakfast to the dinning area to use the toaster, we sat in the dark. Apparently since the food was not ready they would not turn on any lights! Lucky I didn't trip and break my neck.Oh and let me warn you about the shower head. More water came out around the the head than the place it was supposed to. And the toilets didn't flush well either.Where to begin...The beds were extremely uncomfortable. The Air Conditioning, despite being set to 65, never got cold. The shower was made for short people (I'm only 5'9"" and I had to duck to wash my hair). The stopper was out of the bottom of the tub and all kinds of junk came out of the drain when the water came on. Then the water drained extremely slowly. The towel rack mounting screws were halfway out of the wall. We were left with 1 towel the second night. There were no refrigerator or microwave in the rooms.The tv was grainy. There are no elevators at this property. Won't be staying here again. Recommend you don't either.We chose this place during an emergency situation when weather interefered with our plans traveling through Charlotte.  The venue is convenient to the airport.  It is clean and the service was above average.  We received a discount due to our assocaition with the airline that dumped us in Charlotte.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The beds were comfortable.  The free 24 hour shuttle is a plus.  Free Internet.  I would definitely recommend this property.Gross, gross, gross!!!! First of all, check-in took forever! Then there was no elevators. I asked them what about being handicapped accessible? And the front desk lady got offended and babbled something under her breath. Thankfully I didn't have my big heavy luggage or I would've been pissed having to carry it up the stairs...regardless, I feel piss for the people that did have to carry theirs. Secondly, this place stinks and everything looks nasty!! I have never stayed at a hotel that looks so run down and overall dirty. The carpet feels so yucky but I didn't bring my flip flops. Ugh! Honestly, if they weren't running a special, I wouldn't have stayed here. I'll suck it up since we're only staying a few hours, but I definitely will take a long hot bath to wash off the stench before I leave!Horrible.....horrible.Hole in the shower Stains on carpet Horrible stench I could go on forever.Stay here at your own peril!Ok....I believe in giving a balanced assessment of a property when I yelp because I'd want nothing less when I read a review of a potential place to stay . That said, my stay at country Inn was a mixed bag ...not a nightmare but there's definately room for improvement here *management take note*THE GOOD:*It's convenient to the airport* free  24 hr shuttle service to and from airport* friendly staff* suites are moderately priced , nicely appointed and spacious* free internet!!* free freshly baked cookies and coffee at reception area * complimentary breakfast THE BAD*water in the shower NEVER got hot (grrrrrrr)* unsupervised kids made noise at the pool well past 1030  with a hotel attendant right there!  I even observed the shuttle driver walk over to the attendant and asked him to quiet them down as it was late and some guests may be trying to sleep ...the hotel employee walked over to the pool on his phone and just continued his chat .....never admonishing the kids and simply walked back to where he was chatting  .....reallllly???)Consequently, these are all fixable things and the good outweighed the bad for me so I'm giving country Inn  suites 3 starsI mean, I guess its okay. But it stops there..we stayed here b/c United airlines gave away our tickets, felt bad and bought us a room. VERY close to the airport. They have airport shuttle every 30minutes, always. bummed b/c the room service was not really room service. It was made at a separate establishment and had to be delivered which was super weird and probably wouldn't taken forever to get to us, so we opted out. No vending machines and the continental breakfast seemed sort of beat, so we went to bed hungry and ate at the airport the next morning. the AC unit was loud, but I find it comforting. It certainly did the job, but was no luxury suite!It is what it is. A budget airport hotel. The staff are friendly. The free cookies are fresh and tasty. We were there from 1230 - 6. Slept in a comfy bed. Had a hot shower. No complaints.Only needed a one night stay in Charlotte, arriving late, so made reservations based on the fact they had airport transportation. (Was going to pick-up my rental car the next day as they were closed at the airport). Desk clerk made reservation for a taxi for pick up the next day since we were not picking up car at airport. Shuttle driver that evening was prompt and very friendly. Hotel was fine for what we needed, close to airport etc.Would stay again for the location.I hate to dis on a place that I stayed for free after being stranded in an airport after a cancelled flight....It wasn't great but it did the job.  The AC was loud and made it hard to sleep, the sheets were scratchy (cheap detergent), the continental breakfast was not so yummy, but the customer service was nice and it was 5 minutes from the airport.  If you are in a bind at Charlotte International Airport it is a convenient option.They are so friendly here!  We were put up here after our flight was cancelled.  They got us right to a room and made us feel very welcome.Horrific experience not worthy of even one star. Only redeeming factor was super nice front desk staff, Amanda.Called ahead to ensure accessibility &amp; said no problem. Upon arrival, the room was NOT accessible; however management insisted their room was accessible ""because it passed inspection.""  Front desk staff, Amanda, was very nice &amp; offered to upgrade us but bathroom still not accessible.  Would like to meet incompetent inspector:  path if travel in room not required 36 inches?? Really!?  Because the path if travel was so narrow &amp; restrictive, it was not possible to turn AC or heat on/off or get to other side of bed. No hand held shower &amp; maintenance/management not able/willing to install one.  No bench in shower/bathtub. No grab bar on back if toilet. No accessible parking provided anywhere near our room's side of hotel.  Seriously?!Called from the airport for a pickup and was told the van broke down so they had an employee in his POV pick me up.  I got there and was helped immediately and was in my room within 5 minutes.  They have old CRT TV's with the typical channels.  The room was clean, odorless, and actually pretty nice.There are many restaurants within walking distance.",,,,,"['love', 'give', 'hotel', 'stars', 'staff', 'super', 'nice', 'breakfast', 'good',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charlotte-university-charlotte,Holiday Inn Charlotte University,4.0,$$,17,"The stuff are so friendly, helpful and fast in responding, the room is big and  clean, I love the breakfast buffet. The location is close to every thing, 20 mins to downtown...Stayed here on March 9, 2015.  The staff was very friendly at check in and the outside is very neat and clean.  The overall appearance is newer, and has been remodeled in the last 5 or so years.  The area has many restaurants that are close which makes this an ideal spot.Great value for a low cost. Close proximity to I-85 and UNC Charlotte. Stopped in to rest during a cross-country move, using a 16ft rental truck. Parking lot had ample space to park. Clean hotel, great open lobby bar. The hotel seems situated within a commericial office park, so Target and pharmacies are within a 5-10 min drive. Chinese Buffet, Japanese Hibachi, Chilis, and TGI Friday restaurants all within walking distance.4 stars for the $9.95 breakfast buffet, which is the scrambled egg, bacon, sausage; fruit, and packaged cereal standard fare would you could normally get for free at most other Holiday Inn locations. Not even omelets made to go. They gave me a 50% off coupon as an IHG Gold member, but the breakfast is still not worth the price.The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was spot on to the pictures and reviews from the web. My only complaints were having to pay for breakfast and the other guests. The hotel was highly occupied by tons of youth, and on my floor they kept running up and down the halls at 11 o'clock at night! Couldn't get to sleep right away because of all of the noise!Came here to visit on business for two days. Got a pretty sweat deal for an executive guest room. So private you need your keycard just to use the elavator to reach the floor (made me feel special). Checkin was pretty easy, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the front desk attendant had horrible writing, so my room number look like it ended with 4 when infact it was 8. I accidentally was trying to get into the wrong room...then I heard someone coming to the door so I walked away to guess my room. Eeek!!! Stranger Danger!!The room itself was pretty nice, free waters in the fridge, some luxury candy, comfy king bed. The free fitness facility was good so I could recover from the free chocolate. The coffee was cheapo-depo, generic hotel brand stuff. No tea (I'm Persian so I gotta have my tea!!)  Overall impression, hotel was very nice and clean. Room was in perfect order. If you are staying for a few days, this is a great value, if it were going to be a week or more, I would search for something a little nicer since there are numerous other hotels nearby. Can't beat the value though if you don't have unlimited funds!Beautifully updated, decor, clean room, comfy white bedding! GREAT staff!  I was disappointed there was no free breakfast buffet, but free coffee is available and breakfast for purchase.  Peaceful setting hidden from the main road ways.Pretty unremarkable Holiday Inn. Club level room is locked when not open, so no free drinks from there.  Otherwise standard room.  No accessibility to local area by walking, however, with very few crosswalks to get to other places.Very attentive staff, and clean updated rooms.Nicely appointed standard Holiday Inn.  Close to UNCC.  Breakfast buffet was well stocked and clean.  Nice bar in lobby.  Lots of parking.Great hotel to stay.  I was here for business trip in September, 2014 -  second week.  Every thing was good, very nice staff.  great complementary break fast and evening snacks.  Free shuttle service!! I really enjoyed my stay and i would recommend to everyone.Got a deal on Priceline for a couple of night here. They honored my request for a King Room and we also put in a remodeled room.  Microwave/fridge, new bathroom, tons of pillows on the bed.  All of the employees we talked to were very helpful.  Great value for a stay in North Charlotte.Second time I've stayed in this area, and this hotel was better than the last. It's very nice and clean, and the location can't be beat. Only 10 minutes from the race track and within walking distance of many places to eat.Okay, so I was completely prepared for the worst when I got here, since the average review for this place was about 2 stars.My flight landed in the morning, and I called to see if checking in early would be an option. It wasn't. I should have a shot around 1:30pm, though.  Okay, cool..I'll find something to do for 4 hours. So I drop in at 2:30pm--surely they have ONE clean non-smoking room ready, right??No....they don't. I'm a little annoyed at this point, but the girl behind the desk can't really do anything about it, so I walk back to my car and sleep for an hour....then finally, success. There's a $20(?) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these ""deposits.""About the room:-It's not new. But it's not old, either. -There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee!). -The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight....and waking up in the morning.-Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade...and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom...-Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub....it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there.You'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on.I really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room. I'm mad at myself for going through Priceline...the cheaper rate I got is not worth the hassle this place has been. Don't do it.Hair on the sheets, hair on the pillows, hair inside the pillows, hair on the floor, hair on the walls.  Hair.  Lots of it.  And it's not mine.  Did I mention there's hair everywhere?We used our holiday inn rewards to stay here. We had an excellent experience. Our room was upgraded to a gorgeous a suite. The hotel and room were very clean, and the staff was professional, friendly, and helpful! I'd stay here again anytime!Got a deal on priceline.. Recently renovated rooms it seemed... Spacious king size bed with fridge, microwave and lg tv.. Nice shower and bathroom.. Front desk staff super friendly and nice.. Pleasent surprise for the cost.. Some construction downstairs but it didnt bother us a bit10 out of 24 mini bulbs in one elevator are out.  TV in the room mysteriously overheats and shuts off.  No complimentary breakfast and a $10 charge for a microwave and mini fridge in the room, but ""we serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the hotel restaurant.""  The list goes on and on and on.  The little things matter, right?  Well, these are sort of big things.The ironic part is that there is a highly visible sign in the elevator explaining the customer survey and that ""100%"" is what guests should put for their level of satisfaction.  This Holiday Inn is like a prowling cougar at the hotel bar - friendly (the staff), well worn (the rooms), and probably will lead to an expensive, regrettable night at the hotel.Make sure you're ready for NASCAR! This Hotel is as close as you may want to be from The Charlotte Motor Speedway. Get your Motor running.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-house-charlotte-airport-charlotte-3,HYATT house Charlotte  Airport,4.0,$$,24,"Really enjoyed my stay here.  They definitely pay attention to repeat customers which is very nice.I was able to get a room using a corporate discount which made the hotel very affordable.When I came to check in, the front desk heard from my co-worker that I was coming in that day and had a note to give me a room with good cellphone reception because she thought I had AT&amp;T.  That was really great that they actually remembered that note and give me a good room.  She also remembered me every time I called for something and had a warm greeting when we left and came back.The hotel also has a shuttle for business in the area.  I was able to use the shuttle to get to work in the morning.  I didn't need it for the afternoon, but I could have also called it to pick me up from work.  They dropped us off at a restaurant for dinner and picked us up within a few minutes of calling after dinner.  I also heard that they would pick up and drop off at the airport.  I didn't use that this time either but will next time.Beds were comfortable.  Everything was clean in the room.  I liked having the kitchen and living room as well, although it was more room than I needed for a business trip.  All the room would be great if I had my family too.This place defines customer service. We drove straight from Central New York to Charlotte, NC (approx 12 hours) and arrived at the hotel around 10:30 am exhausted. We had reserved a Trio Suite months ahead of this trip that we were splitting with another couple. We knew the chances of us being able to check-in early were slim, but decided to give it a try. Patrick at the first desk was absolutely amazing. He looked through to see if anything was available (there weren't), then told me he'd give me a call as soon as one was cleaned up. He read the note that we had requested a crib (we traveled with my 1 year old son), and told me he'd make sure it was there for me. At 1:30p we got the call from Patrick and we drove right back (less than 5 minutes). Patrick remembered me right away, got me checked in, gave us a brief tour, and off we went. The room is large and spacious, but enough privacy for 2 couples and a baby. I realized that the crib wasn't there, so I called down and Patrick answered just a few rings later. He knew who I was right away and told me he'd have the crib to us shortly. Not even 5 minutes later the crib was delivered and Patrick called to make sure it arrived. House keeping was AMAZING at working with us, as they had a tendency to arrive when our son was down for a nap. They would come back an hour or so later and take care of our suite once our son was running around or we had gone out. You cannot complain about the breakfast. So many choices and all very tasty. My only complaint was the omelet bar. The 1st day we had WONDERFUL omelets, but the 2nd day they were literally drowned in butter. You could tell we weren't the only ones who experienced that, as day 3 no one was ordering omelets. There was plenty of other options to choose from, so no one was complaining. Thank you so much to the entire staff of HYATT House Charlotte Airport. You made my first road trip with my 1 year old son an amazing experience. We'll be raving about you to anyone who mentions they'll be visiting the Charlotte area.UPDATED REVIEW:  to be fair there were numerous issues with my room and I originally gave a 2 star rating, however once I showed the manager the issues she refunded my points &amp; gave me additional points.  So, while the room had issues the service was 5-star, which is why I updated this review.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Hyatt House is one of my preferred hotels but NOT this one.  It is dirty and just feels old, dark and uncared for.  Stayed at the Hyatt House in Richmond, VA for the last two nights and give them 5 stars!!!  Then I arrive in Charlotte and don't want to even touch anything in the room! How can 2 Hyatt House's be so completely different in cleanliness and care?  Next time I am in Charlotte I will pay the extra $22 valet parking fee to stay at the downtown Hyatt House...it has got to be better.  And if it's not I will stay somewhere else entirely!Gave this location a generous 2 stars rating only because I used points so it was free! Room 518Description: Handicap accessible, 1 bedroom suite w/two double beds, separate living room, kitchen and bathroom with tub, 2 windows, 2 closets, &amp; 2 TVs. Review:+ great size room, nice layout+ towels are soft, thick &amp; large+ room was quiet+ full size fridge+ plenty of hot water+ coat closet had light in it+ peephole's had covers+ bedroom a/c unit provides white noise+ optional grippy bath mat provided for inside tub+ lady at front desk was nice &amp; accommodating+ self parking- no hair dryer - a/c in living room rattled so loud could not use- shampoo/conditioner was used and 1/2 empty- a/c units dirty (see pic)- nasty stain on bedroom window shade (see pic)- horrible stain (vomit/blood?) in dresser drawer (see pic)- power strip coming down in kitchen, cords hanging down (see pic)- bedside table had water and food particles on it - not wiped down- poor swiffer job on the carpets...I don't think they vacuum- ice machine on 1st floor in nasty laundry room- no trashcan in bathroomDue to a flight delay, US Airways booked me here for the night. What a hotel!A shuttle arrived at the airport within 15 mins of me calling, with a wonderfully friendly driver, Eddie. He helped me find a place to order dinner from while the very helpful front desk attendant got me checked in. They were more than helpful and went above their expectations.The room was splendid, with a kitchen, living room with TV, bedroom with TV, and very spacious bathroom, all with new appliances and remodeling. More than enough towels and complimentary coffee. For breakfast, there were enough options to have three full meals! Everything was fresh and tasty.If I ever get delayed again, I will be very happy indeed to return to the Hyatt House.Not impressed. The location is somewhat sketchy as is the clientele. It felt more like a Motel 6 than a Hyatt property. Children were running through the hallway, heard a lot of profane language among guests, and didn't see what I expected which would include professional business travelers.No, I would not recommend staying here.This is a great place to stay, esp for the price. Booked thru hipmunk and double suite with hot breakfast was 160 incl tax. No charge for wifi. Cozy sitting area off the lobby with bar. The suite is like a small apt, very comfortable for a family of four. The staff is super nice, helpful, and accommodating.From the other reviews, I expected everything to be great at the Hyatt House.  That was not my experience at all.  I guess the problem is in room 110, and maybe the rest of the hotel is fine.  In room 110, the air conditioner had a terrible leak, in fact, the floor was soaked.  They attempted to fix it and acted as if this was a new problem, but while I was putting a towel on the floor beneath the unit, I noticed that the carpet floor board had separated from the wall, showing long-term water damage.  Their fix didn't work, and we spent almost one week with a soaked floor.  Additionally, I had reserved a crib for the room and they brought me a pack n' play which was loaded with crumbs and covered with stains.  There was constant noise in the hallway, even overnight.  Slamming doors, etc.  The staff is very quick to apologize, but never truly offered a solution to for our soaked floor.  At&amp;t did not work so I had to use my cellphone while standing by the window.  Plates and silverware in the kitchenette were dirty.My review is pretty much identical to the one from Stephen C. Our 45 minute layover heading back to Toronto turned into 26 hours, and Hyatt House saved the day. The staff was amazingly courteous, and their shuttle service even took us on a shopping run since the checked bags went on to Toronto.Got this hotel for $109 a night include a king bed, complete kitchen area and TWO TVs .. Free parking, and WIFI. This hotel is really good for its price. They also have shuttle bus to airport too. You don't get any better than this:)Hyatt as a brand has really stepped it up.  The decor, staff, and comfort of their newly updated look is truly impressive and home-like.  This one particular, though, just isn't quite up to the rest.  It needs just a little bit more renovation. 1. As soon as the doors opened to the lobby, I was overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke.  And I'm not one normally overly sensitive to it.  I smelled it everywhere - even the gym?2. The staff are super friendly and helpful and go out of their way to do the little things - like remember your name for your whole stay.3. My room felt way too much like my first solo apartment in college.  It's those old white cabinets with the wood trim, popcorn ceilings, ugly carpet, musty smelling.  You can see some of the upgrades in things like the bedding and pillows, but even the curtains felt dated and old.4.  The layout is odd and solo elevators are hidden in little corner pockets without clear instructions on how to find them.5. Monday - Thursday night there's a free buffet and happy hour from 5:30-7.  The night I was there it was nachos.  And lots and lots of wine.In short, there are other Hyatts not too far from this one that I've also stayed in and they are far superior.Had a wonderful experience starting with Melissa at check in.  Ate dinner at the bar and had wonderful mushroom and Brie soup and a great house salad.  Room was very clean and inviting.  Love this place and we booked it off Hotwire at a great price!  Highly recommend it.Nice clean hotel with free wifi and breakfast. Friendly staff as well. Not sure if it was just the day I was checking in but only had one shuttle that doubles duty dropping hotel guests off at nearby restaurants so had to wait 40 min at airport. Saw every other brand hotel shuttle come and go twice. If weren't for the shuttle I'd give four stars.This was a one-night stop over, but I really enjoyed my stay! The hotel staff was kind enough to allow us to use the pool area even though it had closed for the night which my daughter really appreciated! Rooms were very nice and the hotel was so clean that I decided to eat my breakfast from the tile floor in the lobby and I'm still alive. That's clean!I would definitely stay here again and again.Overall, I wouldn't stay here again or recommend anyone else to.I don't understand the glowing reviews of this place... This place is in need of a dire face-lift. We stayed for 9 nights while on a house hunting trip. We drove up expecting a decent place with all the great reviews. We walked in and the lady at the counter was pretty friendly. The check in process went smoothly. We took the elevator the the third floor to our room. The elevator was painfully slow... You are really better off taking the stairs. Plus the layout of the hotel is weird. We had a pretty long walk to our room. The deafening hum of the wall mounted heating/cooling unit just added to the poor feel. All the walls in the hallway are scuffed up and dirty looking. First impressions of this hotel were not positive...The hotel doesn't give off a 3 star hotel vibe... Closer to 2... Maybe 2.5... So, about the room. The bed wasn't the comfiest but it was bearable. I hated how little lighting there was in the bedroom... Only two night stand lamps and a closet light... The bathroom configuration was strange... The shower and toilet are in one ""room"" with tile floors but the sink area is carpeted. There is no door that separates the areas. There is a door from the bedroom to the toilet area and a door from the living area into the sink area... It's just weird. There was a small kitchenette in the room with a microwave that looks like it's from the 80's, mini fridge, mini dishwasher and mini sink. There was also a two coil electric cook top... But zero counter space to do anything on. I could go on and on but it isn't worth it... They offered breakfast in the mornings. Pickings were pretty slim. Icky scrambled eggs, some protein item (bacon, ham, pink slime), and various carb loaded items. The coffee was drinkable in a pinch. The only reason they get two stars is because they had offered a social hour from 5:30-7 M-Th with free beer, wine and food. Oh... Btw... The internet, while free, is painfully slow!!!Very nice hotel. Convenient to the airport and downtown Charlotte, NC. You do have to be mindful of your surrounding. Some break in of cars in the parking lot have being reported. Excellent breakfast everyday with a very helpful staff. All the rooms have been updated giving each room a very clean very upscale feel!I got placed at this hotel by US Airways because they caused me and many others to miss connecting flights.  It was only about 10-15 minutes from the airport and they had provided a shuttle at about 11pm.  It was very quiet when I arrived.  I saw a bar but it closed at 10.  They had a little room that you could buy some things including beer and wine.  I didn't have toothpaste so the man at the desk gave me a few packets.  They also had some contact solution for purchase which I really needed.  The suite was large with a king bed.  The room felt clean and new.  I didn't look around so can't comment on pool or fitness room.  At the complimentary breakfast I ate some eggs Canadian bacon and English muffin and fruit.  The breakfast was good with plenty of choices.  The shuttle leaves for the airport every half hour I think.  I was glad this was the hotel I was placed at and would stay at another Hyatt house.I stay at Hyatt hotels frequently, but I was beyond unhappy with a recent experience here. I was on a connecting flight through Charlotte, and due to air traffic control, was stranded in Charlotte overnight. I called Hyatt House, and the call center customer service rep from Nebraska on the phone told me they had availability, so I booked and hopped a $20 cab over since the girl told me the shuttle was unavailable at night. I get to the hotel, and low and behold, the shuttle was available and actually about to head out to the airport for another drop off/pick up. Then, I go to the check in, only to find 6 other fellow stranded passengers in front of me. Stranded person #1 and #2 tell me that they've been waiting for 20 minutes for the front desk people to help reaccomodate since the entire hotel was booked. How I can simultaneously book and pre-pay for a room 20 minutes ahead of time, pay for a cab I didn't need to pay, and then get to a fully booked hotel at now almost 2am is ridiculous. Then, I and stranded passenger #3 get on the phone and make some calls, and after a minute, I find availability at the hotel next door. The front desk expressed shock and said, WOW, I've been trying to get on the phone with them to reaccomodate you all! uh, no you didn't, you were trying to find availability at another Hyatt, all of which were probably booked for the night too due to the mass of stranded travellers. Extremely disappointed at the customer service here, I will not be back.The advertisement for these hotels is right on point! It really does feel like being at home.The rooms don't look as good as the lobby or the outside but they're clean, well as clean as a hotel can be.  They have small fridges, stove tops and microwaves in their mini kitchen.  Though small, it was far and beyond what was given to me in the dorms so give credit where it is due!  They serve real breakfast in the morning, so you don't have to actually cook breakfast after a nice little night of debauchery!Get you some.I booked this hotel for a short (2 day) business stay because of its positive yelp reviews. The price was competitive at 139 per night with little short notice booking. There were some good points: 1. The hotel is accessible from the highways2. Rooms are spacious with separate living room, multiple TVs, and kitchenette3. Place has free daily happy hour with free snacks, beer, and wineHowever, there were a few surprising negatives1. This place is pretty old and its starting to show2. The AC are units in the room and they are extremely loud when they turn in3. The hotel hallways are not air conditioned get very hot, to the point where I broke a sweat walking to and from my room4. 3 of 4 exercise cardio machines were not in service5. The ""free internet"" was painfully slow to the point where I used my 4G phone instead even though I had my computerOverall ok experience. Don't know if I would stay here againThis is a nice property conveniently located off I-77 and near the airport. The location is an attractive alternative to staying downtown Charlotte with their free parking, quiet surroundings, and close proximity to LYNX Light-Rail.  The washing machines and dryers (needed two cycles to dry) are a bit dated but worked well enough.Restaurant and shopping options are also located within five minutes of the hotel as well.","Work required weekly visits to the Charlotte which, in turn, required me to choose from the Company's pre-approved list of hotels once every seven days. I always chose this hotel. Oh, it's nothing fancy, but I always selected this place over some of the fancier hotels on the list. Why? Let me count the reasons:Free breakfast.Free Happy Hour from 5-7pm (free Yuengling for the win!)Big, two room suites.Relatively close to dining options.Hyatt PointsThat's not a large list, but enough for me to keep coming back. It's not perfect. The Tvs are kind of blurry, despite being newer LCDs. Though updated and newly renovated, some rooms had unfortunate, um, stains on the carpet. Oh, and if you have an iPhone, reception on AT&amp;T is nil. Depending on the room, I had to stand by the window to call my wife. It was enough to make me want to beat Luke Wilson with a pillow case full of quarters.Still, this is the place I always stayed so I've got to give four stars at least.I have stayed with this hotel three times over the past three years and on all accounts, it's a good place to stay if you need to be near the airport. The staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are large, with new plasmas and free internet, and the breakfast is good for what it is. I do wish that they offered some sort of room service or restaurant option. All in all, I have had good enough experiences here and will stay again when work brings me to Charlotte.We were here for a wedding. Everybody invited was from out of town and we all stayed here-A good 50 people or so. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and bent over backwards to make us happy. The rooms were large and had a nice mini kitchen.  I can't recommend this hotel enough. Everyone else we spoke to was highly impressed. They even helped us heat up large bins of leftover barbeque and let us store the food in their kitchen for a pool get-together.  The shuttle to and from the airport was very handy as well.  For the price, we were so happy the bride and groom choose this hotel.good place to stay for extended stay.",,,,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'definitely', 'pay', 'attention', 'repeat', 'customers', 'nice',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramada-plaza-charlotte-airport-hotel-and-conference-center-charlotte,Ramada Plaza Charlotte Airport Hotel and Conference Center,2.0,$$,29,"It was exactly what we needed. A clean place to stay. The hotel bar is terrible and needs severe updating and training for its employees. But the front desk staff was stellar, shuttle got us where we needed to go and we felt safe. My only gripe is that the hotel is out dated and the rooms are in need of some TLC as far as cracking walls and ceilings.The best thing about this hotel? The fact that they had a room for us to stay in since Embassy Suites turned us away.I take that back. I would have rather just slept in the airport than at this motel. We missed our connecting flight and were stuck in Charlotte for the night. Embassy Suites told us their airline rooms were full and we ended up in Ramada. It's right next to a gentleman's club and whatever restaurant used to be attached was boarded up. Our room had hair on the bathroom floor, something hard and white that resembled a tooth on the floor by the TV, and dust everywhere. The room smelled like dog food and we slept in our clothes because we felt so gross. I kept feeling itchy and I still don't know if it was bugs or just my imagination. All night we kept hearing a tapping noise, and finally figured out that it was water dripping in the pipes in the ceiling. We figured this out because when we checked out in the lobby the next morning, there was water steadily dripping on the floor behind the front desk.The hotel shuttle that was supposed to pick us up at 5:30 was pulling away at 5:27 and we had to wait until 6 to get the next one. The entire stay was a disaster, and my best advice is to find somewhere else.This place is awful.  The food at the restaurant just behind the lobby was of very low quality, and for some odd reason isn't affiliated with the hotel, so even though it has a room number spot on the receipt, you cannot charge you meal to the room.  I found old carpeting from the hotel rolled up and dumped in a back corner of a hallway, dirty cleaning supplies left out, and the hotel smells funny (my room had the smell of cow).  On top of that after returning to the hotel at 4pm I found my room had not had maid service.  I called the front desk to let them know my room hadn't been serviced and the woman first asked if I wanted the room cleaned (of course I did!), and after I said yes she stated they might make it to my room to clean it.  An hour has gone by and still no maid service.  I recommend avoiding this hotel.This hotel definitely isn't the best, but there are a few positive things. The shuttle service from the airport is good, they got there fairly quickly and even had a 2nd shuttle there when we left for the hotel. The room was decent, clean, and smells like it was remodeled somewhat recently. The bed is also very comfortable and the curtains do a good job blocking out that annoying morning sun. I managed to get 9 hours of sleep with no problem. The hallways are extremely hot...probably trying to save money on a/c costs. They provide a TV channel guide which is great, except that it does matter because they don't have a digital adapter so the majority of the channels don't actually work anyway. The hotel is attached to a clarion hotel and is undergoing remodeling I think. The last negative I've found to this point is that the Internet is very hit or miss. The best I have been able to get in my 3rd floor room is 2 bars out of 6!  Keeps cutting out. I would recommend staying here if it's cheap, but otherwise you should prob pass.  I wanted to give it 2.5 stars, but couldn't.I'm an avid user of yelp but I've never left a review. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in- and I've stayed in a $20 motel in Junction City, KS. The room ACs work but they were turned off throughout the rest of the building. The room smelled awful and the furniture was noticeably dirty. I felt grimy all day after staying there. The staff was fine but I had minimal interaction with them. My company booked this hotel and I checked out early and moved elsewhere. My advice to you is spend an extra $20 a night and stay somewhere else. It is within walking distance of a strip club so I guess maybe that's a plus?This hotel is ok. My Room has been renovated but all the furnitures are old and dated. No designs and no decorations of any kind.  Room is a bit smelly.  No refrigerator in the room but there is a microwave. Wtf? Lol!  Service was so so..  None of the people at front desk are friendly.  I was afraid to bother them cuz I want them to bite off my head. Lol. No smiles of whatsoever. They look like they hate being there.  Didn't bother to look at you when you talked to them.  At least shuttle drivers are on time for my trip.I just found a giant roach belly up in my room.  It's not dead yet.  Still moving now.The room was nice. Front desk service was excellent and great fun attitude. Gift shop lady was great. The beds were comfy and had three pillows on each bed which was great. The downfalls: the TV remove worked when it wanted to. I turned the bath water on and the water was brown which only happened once in my 7 days stay. $77 a night without room cleaning service. Or $87 a night with room cleaning service. They didn't leave extra toilet paper so we had to ask front desk for more and for additional towels. I was disappointed that there was one two sheets and a thin blanket. I was cold but not freezing enough to turn on the heater. It was spring so it's not like it was freezing outside. They do have simple dining and bar which I didn't eat or drink there. Lobby very clean and nice decor. All in all I would stay there again but would ask for a closer room because it's a little haul to where our room was located.Worst. hotel. ever.  The place is a dump, the staff is rude and worthless.  I was told that they ""have no quiet hours"" and there is nothing they can do about the room full of loud partying guests next to my room at 3:50am. The van drivers probably don't have licenses and gas it on yellow lights, take corners at intersections at high speeds and drive incredibly recklessly. The food choices nearby suck and the area is pretty sketchy. May want to avoid this place if at all possible.I really felt comfortable stayin here. The Staff was so friendly. And sittin in the meetin area doing my emails was great. With All of the Water Features there , being from Hawaii the sound were so familiar. I really didn't miss Home. Which is Hard 4 me 2 Believe. Mahalo Susie QGot a hotel voucher from US airways because of a mechanical issue. The room was fine. Nothing special but clean. No complaints.The receptionist and both shuttle drivers were very nice and polite. I was content with my experience here.Got stuck in Charlotte overnight due to US Airways (surprise, surprise ).  They put me up in this hotel and i was pleasantly surprised. Very friendly desk lady and was extremely helpful.  The 24 hour shuttle was convenient as i had a 6 am flight.  Room was clean and bed was comfortable. You can tell it's an older hotel that has been updated but they did a good job with it.  Not sure why it has such low reviews. They must have put some work in to this place.  Pool was closed due to upgrade.  Bathroom size was my only complaint but other than that it was a good experience.Dump. Bus from airport never on time. Rude folks answering phone at front desk. Sh""thole.Eh.  I did not want to stay here.  My flight was delayed until a day later and I was given a hotel voucher by US Airways for this hotel.  The lobby was nice as was the receptionist, but other than that I thought the whole place was drab.  I did notice some parts were blocked off for renovations- a good move.My room was okay.  No fridge, no robe.  Not so clean shower, but plenty of towels and toiletries.  My sink didn't drain in the bathroom but I was so exhausted and truly only there for 6 hours that I didn't care to complain.Walls are thin, I could hear my neighbors until 1 AM.Never again! I could forgive the general griminess, the long dark hair in the bathroom (mine's short and blonde), the treadmill with the slipping belt, the fitness room with no garbage can, the worn sheets (well, maybe I couldn't forgive it all), but then there was the staff. I called to get directions--the woman who answered the phone said she would google it for me (!!!). Then the 9:30 shuttle, for which I had a reservation, left before I got to the desk at 9:27.  No apology from the driver. I usually disregard such negative reviews--I know I sound like a whiner. It was surprising to me how bad it actually was, though.I use Yelp fairly often but have never posted a review... until now.  This was by far the most horrible hotel I have ever seen.  There were cockroaches everywhere!  Most were dead but there were a few live ones.  We didn't stay the night, didn't even feel comfortable opening our bags for fear we might let who knows what else into our things.  DO NOT EVER STAY HERE!!!  GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS!!!US airways flight got mechanical issues and we got these hotel vouchers. (Details after hotel review).Lobby: clean spacious and there are couches. Decent. Lady at counter was nice and quick. Elevators are past waterfall (yes there is a small waterfall in the hotel to the side -it's very odd.)Rooms: I got put in a double bedroom. It looks clean from the beginning however if you look at it closely there are weird just colored stains on the sheets.Bathroom: this part killed it for me I came in to bathroom and I grab a towel in which I found hair on them still. It looks like the maid just re-folded them from prior usage because they looked clean the most part. On the sink, there were smoke smudges of some sort which I do not know where they came from.This was very gross upon entrance-it looks decent but I'm closer examination hotel was not very clean but I guess what you expect from a free hotel or a two star hotel? FYI-There's also a gentleman's club across the street making this a very odd location.*travel voucher-If this happened to you-be careful! There will be hundreds of people in same boat so the shuttle to and from hotel will take forever cause they take 10ppl at a time in 25-30min intervals. Once off flight,  you wait to get the voucher then you have to wait for the hotel shuttle then you have to wait to hotel check-in! so ends up being about 1.5hour by time you get to your hotel room! They put you first flight in the morning so you get about 3-4hr sleep then shuttle back to airport. :/Smelly and old interior, their Clarion which is attacked to the same building is newer and better! I requested a wake up call, they didn't set one for me, luckily i had back up, otherwise i would had missed my flight out of this dumpHorrible. The only reason I give this one star is because I cannot give it 0 stars. The receptionist, Sharon, was rude and not helpful. Took 45 mins to check in because the receptionist wouldn't start checking in anybody until 3 on a game weekend. No sheets for the sofa bed and they messed up my reservation. STAY AWAY!If I could give zero stars to this place I could. I was put up here by US Airways after my flight from Charlotte to Denver was canceled last weekend. While I am extremely grateful that they put us up in a hotel, my experience at the Ramada was very disappointing to say the least. The rooms look like the places where terrible affairs and small scale drug deals happen and the hotel is across the street from a dilapidated ""gentlemen's club"" . Everything was filthy. I reached behind the nightstand to plug my phone in and really wish I hadn't as my hand was covered in dust bunnies and who knows what else. I didn't even take my socks off as I didn't want my feet to touch the floor-that's how bad it was. The bathtub was brown. I believe it was ""clean"" but was so badly stained that it really didn't matter anymore. In fact the entire bathroom was like this-brown when it should have been white.I could have dealt with all of this-but there was more. I woke up the next day with 32, yes-32, spider bites covering me from head (I have 4 on my face) to toe (yes I have some on my feet). My sister got bitten up as well as another traveller we met at the hotel but the spiders seemed to like me the best.As my sister got ready in the bathroom the morning of our departure I actually saw a bug crawling in her sheets. I still haven't told her as I know she would freak out! I am still itching away at my bites-thankfully the ones on my face are becoming less noticeable. Ramada staff-if you are reading this I am not asking for a refund (as I didn't pay for anything) or a free room anywhere, I just think you deserve to know what is going on it your rooms, specifically 1322. Perhaps you should take a look at your housekeeping standards. Having worked at hotels myself I know (as does any layperson) that situations like these are not the norm. Honestly I am quite disgusted with my stay at the Ramada Plaza. In short, I would not recommend this place, even in the most desperate of times, unless you too want to be the ""fourth meal"" for a whole host of hungry spiders.Stayed here one night while visiting Charlotte. Place is not the worst iv seen but DEFINITELY not the best. Place seems kinda old and run down....halls and rooms are smelly. Just a place to stay if you need a cheap room to get ya some.","This is literally the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I would give it negative stars if I could because I feel there is no excuse for a chain hotel to be this incredibly awful. I'm genuinely surprised they don't charge by the hour. With how horrible the rooms are you think only destitute travelers (like myself) and prostitutes, or maybe drug users would end up in this decrepit, ugly, smelly, dirty, horrible place. You walk in and it's two hotels in one (???) the lobby looks semi ok as long as you don't get less than a few feet away and realize everything is filthy. Then it opens into some bizzaro atrium/restaurant/indoor apartment complex (???). It looks like the hotel Cedar Rapids was filmed in, but more gross and since you're actually here you can't get away from the smell. The rooms are not at all what are posted here. They are old, stinky, and dirty. My bed has what appears to be sparkly lipgloss on the flat sheet the other bed looks like it was slept in and simply remade. The mattresses are yellow with age and filth. The toilet won't flush unless you hold the handle for a good 30 seconds, although with out much inspection the bathroom seemed cleaner than everything else. I would never, ever, come here by choice. I've stayed in my fair share of cheap hotels, many cheaper than this hotels advertised ""managers special"" of 59$ but this place is by far the worst of any of those places. Take your money else where. Hopefully I don't catch body lice or some other disease sleeping here tonight. On the plus side, free wifi.After a horrible day of flying cross country where nothing went right, I was booked into the Ramada Inn for a night. Upon check in, I was given a time for the shuttle the next morning so I could catch my flight.  The next morning, I arrived at the shuttle only to find it was completely full. By pre-selecting a time for the shuttle, I was under the assumption there was no way it could be full. After all, that is a reservation, right? Wrong. When I addressed this with the front desk woman, she informed me it was ""not her fault"" that the shuttle was overbooked. Actually it is. It is clearly written the amount of people that need the shuttle and the amount of seats available. The front desk woman continued to be extremely rude throughout this whole experience and provided zero assistance to me and fellow stranded travelers. This place was a nightmare through and through. Besides this terrible shuttle experience, the rooms were gross and outdated. I would never stay here or any other Ramada Inn following this awful experience.This place was....AWFUL! It is huge, and old and the rooms all smell awful.  The toilets barely worked.  More importantly, this place is a crackhouse hotel.  There were prostitutes all over and crackheads running around accosting the guests when we returned at night.  We were offered every kind of drug you can think of.  There are crackheads living here with babies.  The free internet computers are mobbed by crackheads at all hours.  And I can say they are crackheads because one asked for a lighter to smoke crack with and would not give it back.  This place is DANGEROUS. I was almost assaulted by people in the elevator because I would not accept $40 just to hang out with a guy.  People are visibly high out of their minds.  I called and told the management what happened and that I would be checking out before the second night and that I would not be paying for the first night.  One security guard popped his head around and he was ARMED!  They agreed.  ""I said, I'm from NYC and your hotel scared me.  You have crackheads running around like lunatics and you know it.:My family and I decided to stay here while traveling for Labor Day weekend and I should have just stayed at another hotel considering there are other options in the area. We awoke at 8 and wanted to shower then hit the road but we were short on cloths and towels. I went to the front desk to request these items and a woman named Sharon Faile told me the hotel was out of all these items and that we would have to wait unitl 930 when housekeeping arrived at work. At a hotel? Come on. So I asked if there was anything that could be done and I was told to just wait until housekeeping arrived once again. No effort, no professionalism. I then went next door to the Clarion and the lady at their front desk was much more helpful. She went and found housekeeping and some towels and was very nice and professional handling this situation. Overall stay was ok, I mean we slept, but overall service was horrible so I'll pass on this Ramada if in the area again.After US Airways had a delayed flight and I missed my other flight, I had to stay here overnight. US Airways was not going to pay for anyone's hotel voucher because of some the problem was a safety issue, though a mechanical problem first. Luckily that meant they would give us vouchers, but onto the actual review of the Ramada. The place is relatively okay, though I do not know the cost. They have plenty of places to sit and eat, there are many rooms, a swimming pool and gift shop. Everything was closed when I arrived and left early in the morning, but they could be good. The lady, Lisa I believe, was very nice and the driver from the airport was great too (nice guy from New Jersey). I went to my first room and though it was non-smoking, smelled like smoke. From what I saw it was spacious, but I decided to ask for another room so I wouldn't have to breath it in all night. I got an upgrade to a king sized bed bedroom and the room was great. Also had free internet, but not secured. There was a yellowish brown stain on one of the sheets... but other than that it was comfortable. Outlet had the piece around the actual plug missing, but that didn't bother me. Bathroom was clean and tidy, and the room had a television in it, but I didn't use it.YUCK!!!! Do not stay in this dump. Lets start off by saying they only got 1 star because I had to leave one. First thing first the girl at the front desk hates life is the impression we received. Then we went to the room after getting lost trying to find it, yea that's right good luck trying to find your room through the moldy smelling halls. Then we got there oh my gosh!!! It was gross, the sheets were dirty, there was fecal matter in the toilet, the sink had standing dirty water in it because it couldn't drain,oh and there was trash on the floor?!!! Wtf? So I went to the front desk to talk to the manager and was told no manager was on duty but the Owner was here so they called the owner and she told them she didn't have time to deal with me! So i checked out and checked in to the Clarion that is connected to it. And it is owned by the same people but better rooms, beds, and smells better. There was a lady at the Clarion front desk that was checking in also that checked out of the Ramada after going in her ""clean room"" and finding dirty wet underwear on the floor! THE RAMADA IS A DISEASE INFESTED MOTEL DO NOT STAY THERE!!!!Stayed here on business because the Holiday Inn Billy Graham - my usual stay -was sold out. Good location - it's on the other side of the I77 overpass where all the convenient places to walk are located. It's a very pretty facility, if somewhat aged. I didn't get to try the pub onsite nor did I sample their menu. The room itself was very large, and the king size bed was quite comfortable. The pillows didn't feel like they were there at all though. Not a good thing. It wasn't that they were soft so much as flimsy. Hot water pressure was good but the tub felt...almost slimy...definitely very slippery. Wear shower shoes. Typical in-room coffeemaker included but mine was messed up and leaked hot coffee all over the floor. I was not happy about that. Smallish bathroom overall, but still comfortable.What will get me staying here again, though, is the location. Conveniently located right next door to a gentlemen's club, raw bar and billiard room, and a 24 hour IHOP. It's also a very short walk to a Shell station, BP station, Bojangles, Captain D's, 2 Mexican restaurants and a steakhouse. Unlike the Holiday Inn you do have a choice in what to eat.As much as I travel, a room to me has become a room. It's as much about convenience to other places to go as much as anything. With that in mind, I think the Ramada is my new place to stay in Charlotte on business.I hate to write negative reviews, but this was an awful hotel. The staff was great and responsive, but the property is decrepit and Ramada needs to figure out a way to update this property. I stayed at this hotel over the Democratic Convention and though convenient, I would never stay at this place again. This is out of date property that should be classified as a motel 6 not a Ramada.Conveniently located about 5 miles from the Charlotte - Douglas Airport, with free shuttle service 24 hours a day (and sometimes cabs instead of shuttles, but as long as you're not paying, what's the difference, right?).  Convenient when your flight through Chicago is delayed (shock!) causing you to miss your connection and end up in Charlotte at midnight on a Thursday.  Also convenient - you share a parking lot with not only an IHOP, but also a pool hall and Gentleman's Club.  Because what the hell else are you going to do while stuck near the airport in Charlotte for 6 hours in the middle of the night?  Cuddle up under your highly flammable nylon bedspread?  They earn an extra star just because it's a hell of a lot better than sleeping in the airport.",,,,"['exactly', 'needed', 'clean', 'place', 'hotel', 'bar', 'terrible', 'needs', 'severe', 'updating',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-charlotte-airport-south-charlotte,La Quinta Inn & Suites Charlotte Airport South,3.0,$$,30,"Arrived here a few hours ago and everything was in tip top shape. Shanese and Antonia (the two woman at the front desk) were very friendly and helpful. They provided me with restaurants to call so i could get dinner delivered and let me use their printer for homework. I give them an A+++ on excellent customer service. Pros:: Good location, right off of 77.Very clean lobby, bathroom, and bedroom.Nice and pleasant staff. PET FRIENDLYLet me pick the floor and room I wanted to stay inCon's: They don't serve eggs. I know that's a little dumb of me to say, but if you eat eggs regularly, it kind of sucks. But you can have waffles!Breakfast closes at 9amMy first stay at a La Quinta ever and I'd consider the chain again. I was at this hotel on a business trip and I needed everything to be fast and efficient so I could make it to my meetings on time. Check-in was a breeze and I was in my room in minutes. The free &amp; relatively fast Wi-Fi was an added bonus and easy to access. The elevator was slow and rickety, but the gold brushed detail on the inside was impressive. The room appeared to be clean and modern but the beds were AWFUL. They really were: saggy in the middle and the box spring edges poked me when I sat on the side of the bed. The pillows were a little on the stiff side, too. The way the room was configured (an awkward octagonal shape, maybe?) the light from the hallway was blocked, but on my way to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the glare bothered me. No need to cut on the bathroom light! The hallway illuminated it for you! The breakfast in the morning was your standard juice/coffee &amp; fruit/make-your-own waffle, but the breakfast area was clean, well-lit and each table was adorned with a fresh flower. Nice touch, La Quinta! Overall, I'd try another La Quinta and maybe be hopeful the beds aren't as crappy.Very friendly dude at the front desk.  Room was huge, yet kind of, uh, old-ish.  Dog friendly!Horrible hotel. Room was hot. And when I mentioned it to the staff, they said they would have maintenance look at it. Which didn't happen. Breakfast didn't have protein, which is a no no for me. And water pressure was poor so I never felt clean. I didn't get any rest, which makes this hotel horrible bad.My husband and I stayed over this past weekend and had a wonderful time.  The room was very clean and their beds are SO comfortable.  Breakfast was plentiful in the beautifully decorated lobby.....we will stay again!Not bad. I didn't like the heating/cooling unit - either blasts freezing or hot air. But when we just turned it off the room was comfortable. It's basic amenities - for the price you could prob get a better hotel on Priceline or Hotwire but the guaranteed proximity to the hotel + shuttle make this a good option. No glaring problems (I can't give it 5 stars just because it's just an average hotel.) They did get an A grading for cleanliness, certificate displayed in lobby.  Comfy bed. You can hear other guests if they're loud in the halls a little too well.The rooms are filthy. Used towels, trash, hair, and mold found all in my room upon arrival. Do NOT book here. Also, the air conditioner in my coworker's room as well as in my room would not get cold at all.WiFi works great at this LaQuinta! No ID or PW to enter! I could connect literally instantly. What a difference from the Fairfield Inn by Marriott I stayed last night. I am usually a Marriott guy for my business trips but this time, I booked this one because all the Marriott chain hotels in this area were too costly. But this LaQuinta Inn &amp;  Suites has such a user friendly WiFi, very comfortable beds, and the non-woody bathroom floor!  And the rate was very reasonable.I highly recommend this LaQuinta to everyone.Very disappointing. Stayed here last year and enjoyed our stay - breakfast included eggs, bacon, sausage as well as breads and waffles.  This year only breads and yogurt. We had to go to the front desk to get towels ( none in the room ) as well as soap, shampoo etc. Also had barking dog - all night - in room next door.OK with disappointmentsTypical LaQuinta :Executive Suite (layout-excellent), clean, friendly and empathetic staff, pet-friendly, location is near transportation, restaurants, etc., breakfast typical (just OK).  Disappointments/problems: whirlpool and exercise room were closed entire time with no apparent repairs in process, opening door was problematic even though we changed keys 4 times (again no attempt at repair although we were offered a change of rooms); a bit noisy at times, can't walk far from hotel because no sidewalksWe stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!  I'll list the good and bad separately.Good:  The sheets were clean, the room was clean, the water was hot, the amenities were good for the price point and the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.Bad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that ""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. ""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  I suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....Also of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter.My relative and I had a 13 hour layover with US AIRWAYS and wanted to sleep at a nearby hotel for a few hours. After reading the reviews about hotels near this airport I was very hesitant. But surprisingly the hotel was quite pleasant. We did a full inspection of the room because of the reviews I read. The room was great , clean , decent sized and extremely comfortable. The only thing I could say negative was the smell of hallways , it smelled like smoke. Other than that  The staff was very friendly and helpful , gave us food menus for a late dinner and was prompt on picking us up for the shuttle for our early flight. Overall a very pleasant stay and I would suggest you stay here if you need something near this airport.Stayed here while in town to pick my daughter up from the airport for her spring break visit to Boone.  The hotel was fully booked for the CIAA tournament.  While walking through the corridors, I could hear voices coming out of every room and worried if I would be able to get any sleep with all the noise.  I'm happy to report that once I was settled in my room, I really didn't hear any noise from the adjoining rooms.  Breakfast was the usual La Quinta fare with bagels, waffle station, yogurt, fruit, cereal and hard boiled eggs.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  Like most LQ locations, this one is pet friendly with no added pet fee.  While there aren't many places on site for pets to do their business, there were nearby areas to walk the doggies and they did have potty bags on site.  My room was clean, included microwave and fridge and had a very comfortable king size bed.  Lots of places to eat within 5 miles.  I enjoyed a yummy fried chicken meal from Price's chicken coop just 3 miles away.We usually stay here when in Charlotte - really appreciate this place for the courteous and friendly staff.  Hotel is always neat and clean, well-maintained. Can always get a shuttle (ok except not so much when it snowed last year!) Every La Quinta I've visited has been great - that's why I like it so much for business travel!Wow... To begin its just a ghetto hotel... From check in with no personality.... To getting into room and the stench of wet dog odor and oldness, then went to get the bucket for ice and wow it was halfway full of cigarettes and some water.  Went outside the black lady driving the van about hit me then blew her horn.. She was flying... Extremely loud place with slamming doors the loudness of the employees hollering from one employee to the next.  I'll never return to this hotel again and problay not these style of hotels at allThis was possibly the most disgusting hotel I've ever stayed in. The first night, the fire department was there removing an overly intoxicated person. The second night, the cops were there arresting a prostitute. There were bugs in my bed, my sink didn't drain, and the shower floor buckled like tissue paper when I walked on it. The electrical sockets went off when the lights went out,  and every single thing in the room and bathroom was the lowest possible quality. The breakfast buffet was nearly inedible. The pool was never unlocked and looked pretty filthy. Despite how cheap the rates were, I would recommend sleeping in your car before staying here.Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again.C and I have stayed at many La Quinta hotels during our travels and in our experience they vary from excellent to poor. This hotel was perfectly acceptable, HOWEVER, they allow pets and that is not acceptable to us. (Not sure if all La Quintas allow them). A dog was barking loudly when we were trying to fall asleep, so we called the front desk. The clerk said that she would track down and speak with the owner of the dog. The dog calmed down and we fell asleep, only to be awakened by a call from the clerk (!). Grr. The clerk, a nice woman, apologized again and reported that the owner apparently left the dog in the room and went out. She said that she was unable to reach him. Fortunately, we didn't hear the dog again.This policy of allowing dogs is flawed. The next night we stayed at another La Quinta and spoke with the clerk first. She said that they (the people at the front desk) have no idea if someone has brought in a pet or not. If the people tell them, the try to located them on the lower two floors, but that's not a firm rule.La Quinta should have a firm policy on animals, requiring owners to register them and to disallow leaving unattended dogs in their room. Also, they should only allow dogs on one floor, so people can ask for a quiet room assignment. Meanwhile, we are now staying at Hampton inn hotels instead and always ask if they allow dogs. So far we have stayed at a 6 or 7 Hampton Inns across GA and FL and none accept animals.I had booked a different hotel that let me down, and so I found myself at this La Quinta. It was a little before 2am, I had been stranded at the airport, and when I called La Quinta reservations, they told me this hotel had availability. When I get there, the front desk girl named Chelsea was a little flustered because it turns out that their entire computer system was down and she said that she wasn't able to check anyone in the system for the next half hour. However, she put her thinking cap on and then decided to manually checked me in to a room that she knew was open and got me set up within a few minutes, noting that she could check me in later electronically when her system was back up rather than making me lose another 1/2 hour of sleep. The room itself was clean and comfortable, and I was happy to have an uneventful night's sleep and a shower next morning after being stranded for so long at the airport. More hotels should have caring staff with common sense like Chelsea! 5 stars all the way.I really liked it here.The only reason for 3 stars and not 4 is that my husband has real problems with cigarette smoking.  When I say problems I mean adverse reaction.  I don't smoke but it's not an issue.Anyway, when we got up to our floor (third) there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke along the hallway.  Our room smelled really strongly too.  Once I opened the windows for a while it was ok.  We stayed two nights but although the hallways didn't really smell anymore every time we went out and came back I had to open the windows of our room because the smoke smell was so strong.I'm not sure about their ventilating system - I'm assuming it was the people next door smoking.Overall, I really liked it here and would stay again.  The rooms were clean and we had ample space.  We called before we arrived to get a roll out..away.. whatever you call it.  And it was there in the room waiting for us on our arrival.The staff were friendly and everything was cleaned.We had breakfast in the hotel which was pretty alright.  Bagels, bread and a toaster.  Cream cheese, butter etc.  They had cereal and a waffle maker and boiled eggs.  Tea, coffee, hot chocolate.  You get the gist - it did the trick.It's about a 15 minute drive to airport.  Charlotte is a pretty small city so if you are driving you'll be able to get around no problemoh and I mustn't forget FREE WI-FI (love that!)","I arrived in Charlotte and didn't really feel welcome until I checked in to the hotel. The staff is super friendly and made us feel right at home quick.Another good review for a La Quinta. A decent room that was quiet and insulated from the hallway noises, though on the ground floor I had easy access to the parking lot and the occasional ""beep"" from a car alarm being set. Comfortable large sized room with coffee maker, microwave and mini-fridge, the bathroom was good sized as well. No complaints, other than the price ($79) seemed a little high for a king-sized bed.LQ breakfast seems a little limited, but it fits the bill. If you want more, there's a 24 hour IHOP nearby.I would stay here again.It's a basic hotel. Staff is polite and considerate. Little things were a problem; three days to change a moldy shower curtain (not to mention the excessive mold upon the grout in the shower), cleaning staff insisted upon disconnecting our charging devices during the day, and the breakfast is a bowl of cereal and a pair of pre packaged hard boiled eggs. And stained bed sheets.We got there at 8PM and found our suite we had book was not available.  I'm not exactly sure if they overbooked or had a mechanical problem, but the hotel compensated by letting us have two adjacent rooms for the price of one.  I like the fact that this chain is an affordable but nice hotel which is dog friendly.  Parking lot got VERY crowded in the evening, and their note saying not to leave any valuables in the car didn't make me feel very good.  But the beds were comfy, and I got a good workout in the treadmill and nautilus machine the next day. I wish the pool had longer hours though.This was my first stay in a LaQuinta since a very terrible experience in a LQ a couple years ago.  I didn't book it, so it was out of my hands.  But my experience at this hotel changed my view on the company...  maybe a little bit in the positive direction.Staff - Amazingly friendly, at ALL HOURS of the day.  3 am and have a question?  Like asking your Auntie for a favor.Rooms - Decent and updated.  WIRELESS!!!  Plenty of channels on the boob tube, lots of counter space in the bathroom, big desk to get work done.Price - incredibly reasonable.  We didn't use the free breakfast, but should have.  Beats the heck out of where we did go.Thanks Charlotte LQ - and I hope ""El Corpo"" appreciates your efforts.  Other LQ's could learn from you!The hotel was ok with pleasant staff.  Just stayed one night as we had an early flight.  Our room was average overall and was clean.  I would recommend the North location as it is closer to the airport if you are taking a flight.I have had some of my worst experiences at La Quinta Inns. While I travel most weeks on business, we were in Charlotte on R&amp;R on this occasion. I generally stay clear of La Quinta. Some are cheap motels with bad rooms and loud guests. I tried this one for 3 reasons: 1. They take pets (at no charge!) and we were travelling with our small dog, 2. A lot of Yelpers had good things to say about it. and 3. The price was really good. So, I gave it a try.The hotel is just that, a hotel, not a motel. It's well kept, clean, and contemporary. The room was extremely nice. Very clean, very modern and up-to-date. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. However, in today's competitive hotel market, in this price range, most hotels have upped the ante on their free breakfast. La Quinta has the worst of all in this price range and this one was no exception. If you're satisfied with a waffle, an un-pealed hard-boiled egg, toast and cold cereal, you're right where you want to be. I, on the other hand, expect a hot egg option, a hot meat option and a bonus (like biscuits and gravy) like the other chains provide. I guess you could make the case that, with the money saved, I could go buy breakfast (which I did - at Zada Janes).Travelling on business, I would not stay here. I don't allow the time to stop somewhere for breakfast and tend to make use of the hotel's offering. Travelling with my wife and dog, however, I'd probably stay again.We were stranded in Charlotte and were the LAST flight to be cancelled on a day when 3"" of snow fell.  As a result, all hotels in the immediate vicinity were full.  This hotel is 4 miles away from the airport which was a quick &amp; relatively inexpensive cab ride.  (NOTE: they usually have a free shuttle but it wasn't running due to the road conditions).It was 1:30 AM when we finally arrived at the hotel and the person who greeted us was still cheery and helpful.  We had 8 people in our group and needed 3 rooms between us.  They were more than accommodating and room rates were reasonable ($85/night for a double).The rooms were very clean and the hotel has free wireless, a fitness center and free breakfast that includes make-your-own waffles.I ended up leaving a piece of jewelry behind which they retrieved and mailed to me which says a lot about the honesty of their staff down to the cleaning person.While there aren't any good restaurants right near by, there's an Enterprise Rent-a-Car across the street which is very convenient and South Blvd is a cheap cab ride away ($10) and has many great restaurants.I was very pleased overall with the level of service and convenience.  I would stay there again if I was traveling through Charlotte again.I have left well rested and satisfied. After all flights in the northeast got canceled due to snow storms it was a mad scramble to find a clean and decent room that wasn't some sketchy motel and with shuttle service to/from the airport. After calling around to all the Hilton's, Hyatt's, Sheraton's and Marriott's with no luck, I felt very lucky to have found the last room here but was a bit apprehensive as i had no idea what to expect having never stayed at a La Quinta.  What i found was exactly what i needed after all the airport chaos,  friendly staff, a clean and quiet room that was well lit, spacious, free wireless, late night food delivery options and most importantly a clean bed and shower.  They have the basics done right.Stayed here during a road trip with the hubby and our mutt last week.  Everything about the one night stay was pleasant and comfortable.  The price was fine, especially given that they take the dog without charging us extra.  The clerk that helped us when we arrived was incredibly friendly and helpful.  All of the staff said hello and was friendly when I saw them in the halls.  Our room was very clean, air conditioner worked well - I'm sure this is a must in the summer here - and the bed was comfy.  I was disappointed when it was too cool to swim on the morning we left, but the outdoor pool looked nice.  The breakfast was good, average offerings with everything looking fresh.  Express check out was convenient.  The location just off the highway worked out really well for us, and we did drive downtown (not on the highway) which was convenient.  We will definitely look to La Quinta again when we travel, as long as they take dogs, of course.",,,,"['arrived', 'hours', 'ago', 'everything', 'tip', 'top', 'shape', 'woman', 'front', 'desk',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-charlotte-arrowood-charlotte-2,Hyatt Place Charlotte Arrowood,3.5,$$,29,"Stayed here on business and it was fantastic!  The staff were wonderful; just the kind of southern warmth and hospitality you would hope to receive in NC.The room was a standard King and was oddly spacious for what I was expecting.  The TV was huge and swiveled to be viewed from the living room, bed, and bathroom. Was a great way to keep news on from anywhere.They had a decent dessert menu and drinks avail in a quaint bar area at any time of day.  All in all for the price it was a terrific value.  Starbucks and other eateries are right across the street.  I'd definitely stay here again.Much appreciation to all the staff!The room is nice, nice big king bed, couch with a pull out, wet bar, desk, large flat screen I think 50 in or so. The con is the closet, I can barely get anything in there and I'm here for 2 months. Plus the bathroom sink is outside the bathroom. But it's more updated then the Residence Inn off Tyvola where I just left. The cable here at Hyatt is horrible, not enough channels or variety.Here for soccer with my son and wife. Clean hotel, comfortable bed, and good hot breakfast. Breakfast could have a little more variety, maybe some type of potato but still better tan most hotel breakfasts. Friend staying here said that when the room next to him turned on his shower it was very loud and woke him up.I was here for a couple nights for work and it is a totally acceptable place to stay. The quick rundown of the good stuff-The front desk staff is nice-There's plenty of parking and it is free-The room looks recently redone, it was very nice-The whole hotel was clean, including my room-The wifi was free with my rate-The free breakfast was nice, lots of optionsThe not so good:-The location, while I know where I booked, has nothing much to do around it. If you're there on business whatever. If you're there on vacation you'll probably be bored.-The fitness center was not so much a center as some very aged equipment that sounded very broken when I used it.All in all fine to stay at if you're just passing through.This was my first stay at a Hyatt Place. Based on price, facilities, food and amenities, I'd say their target market is road warriors staying at Hilton Garden Inns and Marriott Courtyards. BUT, the rooms are definitely a cut above and are pretty nice junior suites. Each suite has a bed area open to the living area. The sofa is comfortable. A bar sink and coffeemaker with coffees and teas are provided. Vodka is not! The work desk has ample space to spread out. The only negative is that the TV is ""split"" between the two rooms and I couldn't view the TV from the work desk. I ended up putting my laptop on the ottoman and working from the sofa.The bathroom area is clean. The missing amenity is body lotion. I didn't pack it as this was the first hotel in years of travel that didn't have body lotion. For a Hyatt I was surprised.A limited selection of food can be ordered and picked up when ready. The tortilla soup was good and the burger ""good enough,"" especially since I didn't have a car and was basically stuck at the hotel with nowhere to walk to at night. It was very dark and there are no sidewalks on the roads.Skip the complimentary ""hot"" breakfast items which looked as heatlamp overdone as they tasted. Plus they looked the same for the three days I was here. There's coffee, cereal, oatmeal and fruit to get you started.The staff is helpful and cheerful. Overall, I'd select this hotel again if in the Arrowood area. I just have remember to pack a little hotel bottle of body lotion in my TSA bag.Not a great stay at all. I had booked a double room and when we got there they told me they had guests who had extended their stay and that we had to take a single king bedroom. We had 4 people. It worked out that my teens shared a pullout and I shared a bed with my sister, but it was a little tight.  On top of the inconvenience the mattress must have been really old or worn out because it dipped in significantly and caused me a horrible nights sleep! The people crying at 2 am right outside our hotel room didn't help,but that's not the hotels fault.  To add insult to injury, breakfast was probably the worst complimentary hotel breakfast I've ever had! We remember the coffee being Starbucks from a previous stay years ago, but now it too was on par with the rest of our stay.I've stayed here twice, and I couldn't be more disappointed in this subpar location.  The pillows are sad and lumpy, the rooms smell musty.  The bedding and towels have random strands of hair woven in them!  Disgusting. The ""fitness center"" consists of two broken treadmills and a broken stationary bike.  Although the staff is pleasant, these are major deal breakers in my opinion.  When you practically live in a hotel, it's so disappointing to not have basic comforts.Small and cozy Hyatt! The entire staff is incredibly nice. Free breakfast every morning and it's delicious!! Freshly made! I would definitely stay here again and again.Nice place.  Clean.  What I have come to expect from  a Hyatt Place.  the only problem is in the morning the staff just seams to be socializing with each other and don't notice the people lining up at the front desk.  Once they see you they are right on it--but I would assume they should be at the front desk waiting to help in the first place.Chose to spend the New Years with the family there. Not sure if this Hyatt is old or what but the place was dingy and not welcoming compared with other HyattPlace I have stayed. Food quality was to the floor. Old tasting. Chewy textures and lack of variety. I truly regret this stay. For a New Year's Eve, the staff was so not cheerful and the hotel did not offer any activity for the guests.We recently booked the Hyatt Place Arrowood for a group of volunteers coming into town for a weekend conference. It was an excellent experience from beginning to end and working to secure the rooms with Christine Champion was a joy. The service was way above my expectations - they were incredibly flexible when we approached them with change after change, the prices were more than reasonable, and the rooms are a cut above the industry standard. It was truly a wonderful experience and I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Charlotte.The staff was great, very friendly and whenever there was a problem they did their best to fix it. They serve Starbucks coffee and have a good free breakfast in the morning. Only bad part was that the wifi signal sucks... I had a room right next to the elevator and could only connect if I was standing at the door.I'm a pretty loyal Marriott Rewards traveler. So why on Earth would I stay at this Hyatt place (multiple times for business) when there are two Marriott options within a stone's throw of this location? Simple - reasonable price and unbelievable service.The rooms and overall facility are clean and well-kept, but the competitive advantage lies in the un-paralleled service. I've stayed several times now, eliminating the ""fluke"" possibility. There's not a single staff member I've encountered that hasn't convinced me that they truly care about each guest's experience and comfort. I could offer many examples of how each of the staff I've encountered has made a positive impact on my travel. Judging from my observations while at the hotel, it's clear they have many regular guests who I can only imagine have had the same great experiences - greeted by name and expeditiously attended to. The staff seems to truly understand the business traveler; the need for convenience and efficiency,  the exhaustion of navigating a non-home atmosphere, the need for familiarity and a warm smile (not to mention a warm breakfast). What sets this hotel apart is that they address each one - they've focused on nailing each of these key factors in the business traveler's world, and I appreciate the heck out of it.So I now have a Hyatt Rewards card, and I plan to use it whenever I visit Charlotte.I have never stayed at a Hyatt Place hotel before, but I will make it a regular chain from now on. on this same trip I stayed at the Hyatt Place in Nashville and both hotels were what every hotel should be. great customer service,  clean room, and a great overall experience!Like all Hyatt places, the rooms there are large with a living and a bedroom space, large flat screen and the regular amenities. Although I found the lobby space a little crammed, what took this to 4 stars was the customer service and the breakfast sandwiches! The lady at the front office was extremely nice, very welcoming, it almost felt like she was welcoming you home!Now for the breakfast, that was my big surprise, see I usually skip breakfast bcs I don't care for stale pastries and runny eggs, but I was starving that morning and had a long day ahead of me, so I swung by to grab something on the way to the car: breakfast sandwiches! They were warm, fresh, ready to grab... just perfect! Egg, cheese and bacon on a warm ciabatta bread!  I couldn't have been more surprised or happier!Stayed overnight yesterday between flights at this Hyatt, it was okay. Airport shuttle only comes every half hour so my pick up wasn't speedy, but it was included at least. I stayed at a few nicer hotels during the previous week which probably influences my review a bit, but no major complaints. WiFi could be better and the business center computers are extremely slow, it took me 20 minutes to print my boarding pass, but my room was comfortable and clean. I was supposed to have a King sized bed, but apparently the hotel was full and they gave my room away so I had a double. I ordered a delicious spinach salad from the 24/7 menu at 11 pm  and was pretty impressed with it for hotel food. I didn't like that my room was connected to another through a locked door, I wasn't forewarned about that. This Hyatt got the job done, but I would probably stay elsewhere in the future if I was visiting for more than a layover.@hyattPlace in 25 years of business trips I have never had to leave my hotel room to buy cleaning products to clean my own bathroom. I was checked in to two rooms both with disgusting dirty bathtubs. Told that it was unable to be cleaned and given 4 cookies. I got in my car, drove 4 minutes to a CVS for $3.98 I purchased a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and in 10 minutes in front of a staff member, after having driven 8 hours, I cleaned my own hotel bathroom. Unbelievable. Unbelievably embarrassed for this brand. Hyatt Place is my hotel of choice for business and personal trips and I choose this brand above all else. But having to clean my own bathroom that in addition to being covered with grime and dirt also had human hair is just beyond any bad experience I've ever had. I can not believe that this housekeeping staff could not put 10 min worth if effort into cleaning all these bathrooms. As I understand it all these rooms have the same issue. Someone needs to address this issue. There is no excuse. Hyatt Place Charlotte/Arrowood7900 Forest Point BoulevardCharlotte, NC 28273, USI work out of Indian Land which has 0 hotels at the moment..my next choice would be to stay in Ballantyne which is almost always booked and most of the hotels exceed my daily hotel allowance. The Hyatt is clean, has a bar, good food, fun staff, and most important the rooms are quiet.Not one of the better Hyatt's, staff really wasn't interested in customers and the room had a very strange odor.Worst experience ever.we made a reservation after they wanted name,phone number,address,email then when we arrived they said both rooms were not available.i asked y didn't they call or use the email they requested they couldn't give a answer.then the wifi wouldn't work called the front desk they said to bring my computer down to the front desk I laughed n told them I just drove 10 hours n I'm not brining my computer to the desk n that they should send someone up here..I mean come on man for $160 a night you deserve better service than this..smh. Never again .next time well stay at a $50 hotel and probably get better service and save money","Very nice.  Friendly staff all around.  Nice outdoor pool.  Price is about what you would expect.  Great free breakfast.  Has  business and workout rooms.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.Stayed here on a road trip from NY,  the staff was so friendly, didn't stay long but it was goodNice decor. Wonderful hot breakfast bar. Found it interesting that there weren't enough electrical outlets...out of all the outlets only one socket wasn't used by in-room amenities (i.e. lamps, alarm clock, radio, tv). The only complaint is that there was a very small bathroom - the bathroom door barely brushed the toilet when closed.Stayed here for business.  This is one of the older Hyatts, so it's not as updated as the newer hotels but I have to say it was clean, clean, clean! And, the staff were the best group of people I've met who worked at a hotel.  Super friendly.  They actually care that your stay is comfortable.  When you arrive, you get a free drink coupon.  The have a great, free breakfast every morning.  Eggs, sausage, french toast, fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, pastries, etc.  And, the best part.......it's quiet.  You can't hear your neighbors!!  I would stay here if I had to go back.Love it here! Staff so friendlyWe are staying here for four nights with our three young children. This hotel has been one of our best experiences! There is plenty of room for everyone to spread out to sleep, the beds are comfortable, the staff at the front desk are extremely helpful and friendly, and they even have discount carowinds tickets available. I wish there were a few more choices for breakfast but you are definitely getting great value for what you pay for a night here.I just wrote this on Tripadvisor too. I did not love the area and felt it was even a bit far from the airport, which is why I stayed there. ($33 cab ride). Even with all that I am so happy I experienced this place. It could use some renovations, rug cleaning and fix that loud refrigerator, but even with that I'm happy I stayed here. The small fitness room worked well if you only want to do cardio (no weights). The free breakfast I found easy and worked well with my healthy eating with raison bran, non fat milk, oatmeal, and fruit. The coffee was nothing special. So why such a great experience? The staff. I felt so cared for, I got advice on anything I needed from a staff who really gave a damn. That was so refreshing. Whoever does the hiring at this place needs a raise! Job well done. The staff here were a joy to be around, made it all so easy that I didn't have to think or work hard at anything with this stay. For a stranger to this city, I found this to make my business trip simple.I actually end up spending more time here than I do at my actual apartment. I travel to Charlotte almost weekly for work, and the staff at this hotel is amazing. They are very personable, and extremely accommodating. This is nice to have, since I am rarely home.The rooms are so nice at this place that I am really surprised this hotel is only a 3 star.  It's clean an modern, spacious, and high tech.  50"" flat screen in the room, the regular guest room is like a suite, and the internet is free.  Even the check in girl with her obnoxious long painted nails who wouldn't give us a late check out couldn't bring down the experience.",,,,"['business', 'fantastic', 'staff', 'wonderful', 'kind',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-charlotte-ballantyne-charlotte,Aloft Charlotte Ballantyne,4.0,$$,21,"I absolutely love this hotel! As I write this, at 11:11 pm, there is a major party going on at the bar. There was a pretty nice gathering last night down there as well! It's St. Pat's Day weekend, a group is having a party, and I saw the bartender whip up some sort of green martini. There is a band with a bagpipe, and they are rockin' the place! Being from NOLA, I'm very comfortable when locals use the hotel bar. I feel like I'm in the middle of the action.The rooms are very nice. It's all minimalist modern, but still very cozy. Nice shower, scrupulously clean, and delightfully accommodating staff. We wanted a different pillow type, and we have it tonight. I'm glad we're staying at this Aloft rather than Epicenter, as we're a bit more comfortable being removed from Downtown. Although it is more appealing than many downtown areas, it's still a bit more noisy and crowded than we'd like. We are enjoying the space around the Ballantyne area. It's beautiful.Honestly, I couldn't ask for more for the price from this place. It has exceeded our expectations. I only wish they had a hot tub. Although, the indoor pool is very charming...Cool decor, attentive staff here. They offer a shuttle service that is almost always available. The resident XYZ Bar pours strong adult beverages, the lobby/lounge is a chill spot to sit, converse, drink, and even shoot pool or play a board game.This is a very relaxing and hip spot that I will put into rotation.The hotel itself is actually quite pretty.  The neighborhood nearby is mostly office buildings and such, and they're pet-friendly.One of the things I liked best about the Aloft Charlotte Ballantyne Hotel is the cozy atmosphere you can see the second you walk in.  Couches to lounge on near the fireplace and a pool table with a shelf full of lots of board games, makes it a fun option to stay at in the area. They also have a news ticker that's a nice touch too.Complimentary coffee and on-the-go dining with Re:Fuel were great for a quick breakfast in the morning.  And if you're craving a snack in the middle of the night, Re:Fuel is open 24 hours so you can get your snack on at anytime.I also visited the gym while staying at the Aloft Charlotte Ballantyne.  Easy access and a nice selection of machines and weights made getting a workout in a breeze.The rooms were, much like the rest of the hotel, very modern - which I liked.  This hotel also considers itself a ""green"" hotel  with lots of eco-friendly features.A few things I didn't like:* There are no drawers at this hotel.  Just a curtain with organization boxes.  Guess that's where you could put your clothes.* While you can grab a quick bite at Re:Fuel anytime, there are no other options for room service so you'll have to venture out for food.* If your room is near the elevator, you will hear it.  You can also hear people's conversations out in the hall.  If you're traveling with kids, it's likely the entire floor will hear you.* The A/C is a wall unit that is kinda loud.Overall though, I enjoyed the Aloft Charlotte Ballantyne hotel and would definitely stay again if I was in the area.  Next time, I'll be sure to bring my swimsuit to enjoy their gorgeous pool!Upon arrival  the from desk employee  (Amy) welcomed us with a smile. She was very pleasant and made sure we loved our room. I loved the fact that we were given FREE Disani  water, and Sunday newspaper,  unlike any other hotel you would have to pay for it. If I needed anything one call and it was at my room. The food was very reasonable,  and great. My first stay there and it was really nice.I wanted to give more than 3 stars however due to the firm mattress/ uncomfortably hard and left both me and my husband with aches and pains the Aloft left us feeling disappointing or just sleepless in Ballantyne. I will say the hotel is nice, clean, and the staff were friendly.Great service from a friendly staff. Clean, modern &amp; very green. Comfortable bed, pillows &amp; comforter. Coffee pot &amp; bottled water in room. Flatscreen TV on the wall directly across from bed. Heated pool. Full bar. Great for couples &amp; single not really a family hotel. I definitely enjoyed our stay here &amp; will return.Only problem was housekeeping. Didn't bother picking up things on floor. Only remade bed and replaced towels each day here. Oh and the ""heated pool"" is not so heated. Very chilly but does stay open until 1am. Otherwise, stay was fine.I LOVE this hotel!!! My hubby and I just left after a one night stay and I must say I was very impressed with our accommodations. The bed was amazing, the room was very modern, simple and clean. The tv was directly in front of us on the wall and at eye level. The shower has body wash and shampoo/conditioner in dispensers attached to the wall, very convenient because I forgot mine at home. The whole green initiative was cool too, your room card key controls the electricity use. When you enter the room, you sit the card in a slot and when you leave, you take the card with you and it turns everything off. After a night out, we were able to come back and get snacks from the snack bar that were reasonably priced. From what I've read all Aloft hotels are made the same and because of that I'm gonna make them my preferred hotel when we travel to a big city.Stayed for a business trip.. Rooms were clean, had space, beds were comfortable, water pressure good.. The xyz bar had good prices and live music. Breakfast downstairs was delicious. Skip your room cleaning and you pretty much get free breakfast. All the employees were super nice and friendly... And patient! My coworkers and I were a fun bunch! Thanks a loft! :)This hotel is AWSOMENESS at it's best. The facility is amazing and the staff is 5-STARS. My company, The Aperture Lab utilizes their conference room, which is called ""Tactic"", on a regular basis and everything is always PERFECT for us. Alex and Amanda are super great to work with and I couldn't be happier with the Aloft Ballantyne ! ! !Great place to stay. (And I've stayed here a lot; +30 nights). Hotel staff is fantastic and usually even remembers your name when you come back. Having the bar is convenient over a few other local places and they also offer free shuttle trips to a good but limited area.Great customer service. Very clean. Nice decoration. The bar looked great but I didn't actualy try it out. Lots of buildings around but that wasn't an issue for me. The only detail I did't like its that there is no drawers in the room. There is only a small box/room to hang your clothes. So make sure not to bring too much clothes.Ultra modern but reasonably priced with amazing customer service.All in all, I liked the place, and the ""green"" feel that it has.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by smiling faces at an island.  I was in a hurry so we got right down to business.  I was quickly checked in and on my way to my room.The rooms are modern/trendy/chic.  Kinda see through silhouette showers and bath on the right as soon as you walk in, with the bed taking up most of the main room.  VERY COZY BED!There isn't much to look at out the window, so I can't really comment on the view.  And you have to know to put your key in the special key hole to turn on the lights in the bathroom.  There really should be some kind of small LED lighting up this sign, since you can't see it without the lights being on.The XYZ bar is pretty chill with multiple hangout areas and a pool table.  The pool area had a great open feel to it and is open relatively late.I liked it, don't know when I would recommend someone stay in Ballantyne when visiting Charlotte though.Great hotel.   I love the green initiative.   ""The design is very thoughtful.     Tip: there is an ironing board behind the clock.Aloft offers A1 customer service. The rooms are roomy and the beds are comfy. I love their ""green"" program, too. The lobby is a vibrant, happening place complete with a good bar, pool table, and a boy and his guitar on certain nights. I was previously a die-hard Marriott girl but I've happily switched to SPG and am thrilled with the change.I come to the XYZ bar on occasion to catch the local talent singing. On Thursday nights they offer half price glasses or bottles of wine. Who could resist? Great place on a warm night since they also have a nice outdoor seating area. I've had a few of their apps and they are very good as well. No complaints!I was impressed with my first Aloft experience this past week. I knew this was W's crack at competing with Courtyard and Hampton Inn, but wasn't really expecting it to completely blow away the cheaper Marriott and Hilton brands.It did - the lobby, the rooms and the fitness area (which rivaled what I've seen at the average Marriott) were exceptional when compared to the competitive set. The bed however was about on par with the Courtyard/Hampton Inn set. The internet speed was ridiculous: 7.82 Mb/s down <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F878972301.png&amp;s=790e361660a473b810dcebdd45f490bc42e8f018f46c8da9325935306c1c5f07"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/878...</a>. Highly recommended.Insanely hot wasabi covered bar snacks.Hubs and I were in desperate need of a staycation and Aloft fit the bill. Surprisingly affordable considering the upscale and modern asthetic. Think Sweden, think mid-century modern, think streamlined and funky. All fit the bill. The hotel is well located for walking to various restaurants and shops, easily accessible to other areas, such as Stonecrest and the Arboretum for more shopping and dining. The hotel itself if small but well planned. Nice bar w/a kinda retro-mod vibe. Lots of places to plug-in to get work done or waste time. Small indoor pool is clean and situated beside a welcoming courtyard. Pool table in the lobby for your enjoyment. Self-serve kitchen/cafe open 24hours w/prices as expected (ie: yogurt parfait roughly $5.)I loved our room as I am very big on 'every place has it's thing and everything in it's place'. I snagged some mini bath products because who doesn't love Bliss products? The shower actually had great pressure and the towels, though typical small hotel towels, were not scratchy. The only two nit-picks I have are the height of the sink (super low, which is odd considering the room is not actually handicap accessible) and the bed, oy, the bed. The linens were crisp, clean and pillow soft but the mattress was god-awful. Neither of us slept well b/c both of our lumbar region was in agony. I mentioned this to the very helpful and friendly front desk staff and suggested they offer some rooms w/Tempurpedic mattresses. I previously had a firm Posturepedic and loved it, so I am assuming this bed was perhaps too soft? I don't know but we both agreed, the bed was the only drawback to this hotel.OH! Word to the wise, if you ask for a late check-in, be sure to ask for a room upstairs. Otherwise you risk ending up off the main lobby and might here some not-so-quiet guests heading to their rooms.This hotel is quite nice, it is ultra moderns and has quite a few modern conveniences. The on site bar, coffee/snack area and complimentary breakfast are all very nice features to have in this hotel. My only complaint about my stay is that the windows, walls, and doors were thin and I could hear many noises around me from my neighbors and people outside or in the hallway.","Aloft are independent hotels loosely affiliated with starwood. They are modern styled, boutique influenced hotels that while often cut corners in the build out, attempt to offer the boutique experience at a holiday inn price. My second experience there, and so far, both Alofts (Charlotte and Richmond were friendly and attentive.",,,,"['absolutely', 'love', 'hotel', 'write', 'major', 'party', 'going', 'bar', 'pretty',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-charlotte-downtown-charlotte-2,Hyatt Place Charlotte Downtown,3.5,$$,30,"As far as hotels go in the uptown Charlotte area, this seems to be one of the better ones for the money. It's in a decent location, very central and close to everything.Free breakfast, free Wi-Fi, and a mini bar and small coffee shop at the lobby desk. The lobby is on the 10th floor, which is not as weird as that sounds. You walk into the building you get onto the elevator and you press the button that says L, just like any other hotel, but people seem to really get wrapped around the axle on this one!The room had a nice layout, with a couch, a desk, a dresser and armoire combo, and satellite TV.  The couch wasn't overly comfortable, but at least it offered some relaxing space without having to sit on the bed.The bathroom is decent sized and nice.There are great amenities at this place. Natalie can you get espressos and lattes at the front desk, they also have lots of different items to purchase. They have a rooftop bar which I did not use. They have a fitness room that has multiple cardio machines and some dumbbells. The parking costs $20 for valet. You can spend eight dollars for every 12 hours on one of the nearby surface lots, but I don't think that's worth it. I would rather have my car in the garage out of the sun and away from the cold.The staff is friendly.We stayed here for a weekend.  We got a great deal online.  The customer service was great.  They even contacted us before our stay and gave us a partial refund because the heated pool was going to be out-of-service during our stay!  How sweet is that?!  We didn't take advantage of the complimentary breakfast, but it was nice to know we had that option.We were supposed to have two beds, but ended up with one queen-sized bed (which looked more like a full-sized bed) plus a couch.  Our stay was comfortable nonetheless.Booked a room online, and had to cancel (3 months in advance). When I checked my account, they charged me AGAIN instead of refunding.... This was about 10 days ago. After multiple talks with Mark, (I assume the manager) , &amp; <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> who was the middleman. I gave up and went to my bank so they could process my fraud claim. Over $400 has been tied up. I had to explain to my landlord and now have late rent fees. It was a hard lesson to learn. At least my bank and Visa are dealing with the hotel now. I made this reservation before Thanksgiving, hopefully Hyatt will give me my funds by Christmas. My favorite part was when I was told by Hyatt via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> ""it was just a human error"". - No urgency on their part whatsoever. Maybe if it were their money, I would have received my 2 credits faster. Lesson Learned.This hotel has an interesting lay out with having the lobby on the 10th floor but the rooms have great views. They have good customer service. I called to get more coffee for my room and they brought me a bag full! They must know I'm a coffee lover but it was great. The rooms are big and roomy so it makes the stay feel more like home. The only downfall is my room was handicap and didn't have a tub and I work long hours in heels so I would love a tub to soak my feet in. This hotel is a great location near the epicenter and a few of the sporting venues. Definitely worth the price and the stay!I booked this hotel by mistake thinking I was booking the Hyatt House on Trade street. Who knew little Uptown Charlotte had two Hyatt's within walking distance.  Besides the friendly and helpful staff, everything about this hotel was standard... but not amazing. girlfriend's local bachorlette party, I booked this hotel for a little 'staycation' Based on customer service and staff alone, I would give this place 5 stars. Everyone from the valet, front desk and cleaning team were very friendly and went out of their way to say hello. Everything else in the hotel left me wanting/ expecting more. For 180.00 dollars a night, I was left a little disappointed.  The room was large with a little seating area, but the sofa, beds etc. were very bare. The whole room felt empty. It didn't feel very welcoming. The vibe of the hotel is modern, but it just came across as cold. Our view of the city was pretty and our walk to center city was easy a quick 5 minute stroll. Half of the building are condos, so the lobby and elevator set up is a little odd. I didn't make it to breakfast, but the coffee was really bad, leaving me only to assume the continental breakfast was similar, but you can't expect much from a free breakfast. I think the hotel, decor, amenities and overall feel should be updated to make the overall stay at Hyatt Place feel 100 percent enjoyable.The staff is amazing. They alone would get 5 stars.  The rooms are great. Free breakfast good.  Theres a living area and bed area. Both can view the tv. Spacious and modern.  Bathroom has nice shower stall instead of tub.  We asked about a pool in February only to find out it was outdoors and not heated.  To get to the pool you have to take the kids through the bar.  The bar was very popular with the youth which sadly meant the parties sometimes came down to the rooms.  Please avoid getting a room near the ice machine. I spent the night counting ice buckets instead of sheep.  I'd say that this hotel is more geared toward the party crowd.Simply put, the best hotel I've ever stayed in!!First of all, $140 a night for a room with two full-size beds AND a pull out couch?  Absolutely.  The hotel is smack dab downtown and one block from the Hornets arena, and only two blocks from EpiCentre.  The room was HUGE and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooftop bar, Fahrenheit, was pricey but had the most amazing view of the city.One of the reasons I always try to stay at Hyatt's is how friendly the staff is, and this hotel was no different. Service: Super friendly, as to be expected at a Hyatt. It's nice that they have the WSJ lying around for guests to grab a copy. Room: My room was huge, clean, and had a sitting area with an L-shaped couch and ottoman to relax on. I loved that I had more than just a bed in the room, and found myself sitting on the couch more than I thought I would. Free wifi is nice perk, too!!Food: So few hotels include breakfast in the price of a room so it was nice to see the Hyatt Place still does. The food wasn't anything spectacular, but there was a wide assortment of cereal, bread, and hot items like egg sandwiches, biscuits, and waffles as well as juices. Location: Just a few minutes walk to downtown restaurants and businessesI would not stay here again. While my room was fairly clean and comfortable, especially with the ""L"" shaped sofa to lounge on, I found the layout of the hotel, lack of basic amenities, overcharges and poor support from hotel staff to be unacceptable. Firstly, the lobby is on the 10th floor, which is very inconvenient, not only because you have to ride the elevator from 2 through 9 to check in, you also have to go only to 10 for any snacks, ice, etc.  there are NO vending machines in any part of the hotel, so you have to pay $2.75 for a bottle of soda.  Only Pepsi products are sold.  They are on display where you check in, inside an open refrigerator, so none of the drinks are cold.  I followed the signs for ""ice and vending"", which appear near the elevator on every floor, but which don't exist. There is an ice machine on the 10th floor and the eighth floor. But you can only find that out by asking the staff member, or by going floor to floor, as I did.  I don't know why they have the signs, if they don't have the ice or the vending.Other issues include no free airport shuttle.  I arrived by taxi, yet incurred an automatic $20 valet parking fee on my bill.  Because the hotel screwed up my reservation and gave me a bill a day earlier than I was to leave, I was able to see these charges and have them removed.  Had I not had the extra day to check, I may not have noticed until I checked out.  They were 'kind' enough to let me stay in my room for the last night of my stay instead of making me move due to the error in the reservation, which error was made with all the members of my party staying in that hotel.I have them impression that are really pinching pennies.The morning breakfast staff were very friendly and accommodating.  True southern hospitality there, at least.The housekeepers threw away items that were not trash which were left out on the desk.  I don't recall ever having had that experience ever in a hotel.  There are some stains on the sofa upholstery and pink soap scum 'mold' in the shower.Overall I was very happy with my stay at this hotel and would stay here again in the future. The staff was very friendly and was helpful. The rooms were spacious, modern, and comfortable. The only problem I had was I called concierge a few times and they did not bring me what I needed. When I did ask at the desk I got the items that I wanted. Breakfast was pretty good. My breakfast on Saturday was better than my breakfast on Sunday based on the choices. I like how they have Seattles best coffee but the station is only around till 3 o'clock. The location of this hotel is awesome. You can walk to several attractions and restaurants. I enjoyed hanging out in the lobby and using the workout room. One evening I wanted coffee but I did not realize the station had been broken down already. The man on duty made me a latte for free and was really kind about it. If you stay here check out the rooftop restaurant Fahrenheit. You don't have to order anything but the view is well worth hanging out and enjoying.Staff extremely kind and helpful however We stood 3 days and our sheets were never changed even after a request. They said it is not their process to change linens....not good.  Other hotels we have stood at do it everyday. The concierge during the week in the day is an amazing gentleman.  They have a coffee and Danish area on the 10th floor.  Danish must have been there for days , twice I purchased and both times disgusting.     Room was nice , people great ....Just because it was reasonably priced does not make it shitty.  Loved this hotel.  Booked it on expedia but next time will try booking directly with the hotel because expedia took like 20%.  I asked for a room with a view and they hooked it up.  We had an awesome view of the Charlotte skyline and our room was a good size.  Their hotel bar on the roof has amazing views and well dressed crowd. Breakfast in the morning was decent.  $20 parking kinda sucks but it's walking distance to everything downtown so consider not taking a car.Extra bonus:  free wifi in the room.  Fuck yeah.  That's how it should be.Went here for a wedding and while too expensive it is a very nice cosmopolitan hotel. More like you would find in a bigger city. The lobby was on the 10th floor and parking was expensive but other than that no complaints. You can try to find free street parking around easily for a weekend when the panthers aren't paying. You are also nearby all kinds of things so a good location. The room itself was very large and nice. In fact a better use of space could have it be a full suite. The hotel pool and bar are amazing and a good time on weekends on the roof. Definitely a place to stay.I went to a few cities in this area and in the end this hotel turned out to be the best one I stayed in, but not necessarily for the right reasons. I arrived in my room to find the beds unmade, sugar all over the TV counter, and worst of all, a full un-flushed shit in the toilet. As I was leaving to report this to the front desk, the housekeeping lady came and said she hadn't cleaned this room and was scheduled to now, there shouldn't be anyone in there yet. Luckily the people working there were very nice and gave me a much larger room for the night for no extra cost. Hotel itself is nice and very convenient location 1 block from Nascar hall of fame, breakfast was good and everybody was friendly, but that shit in the toilet takes 2 stars away from my otherwise great visit.Great hotel with huge rooms and within walking distance to everything uptown has to offer. Everyone we encountered were friendly and accommodating. The rooftop restaurant is expensive, but has a great view and atmosphere. Skip the food and get a couple drinks at the bar. Valet parking is expensive ($20 daily), but you can park in the lot right in front of the building for $7 every 12 hours.I really wanted to give this Hyatt location 4 stars but we ran into a few issues here and there and Hyatt is expensive and should therefore take better care of their guests.  Phew, that was a run-on sentence!This location is smack in the middle of city center.  The Chiquita building is right outside, as well as the Nascar hall of fame.  As far as food, there are some sit-down restaurants but if you want something quick, there aren't too many options.  The Hyatt offers 24/7 food with a basic menu consisting of appetizers, flatbreads, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and drinks.  They don't deliver to your room, though.  You have to place an order from your room then go to the 10th floor (where the lobby is) and get it yourself.  The front desk staff could be a little more pleasant, too.  I placed my order from my room, came down 20 minutes later, and the woman working at the time snapped that she would call when it was ready.  I went to board the elevator to return to my room before she suddenly wanted to be my friend and said to just wait.  Regardless, the flatbread I ordered was pretty damn good and hit the spot.  They also offer cupcakes and other pastries in the lobby.  In the morning, there is a free breakfast buffet which is nice in theory but when you're sitting, you're also watching guests come and go.The elevator requires your key card to get to the room floors.  Only ground level and lobby don't require it.  While I understand that, it's a pain in the ass when you have to get new key cards 4 times during your 3 night visit.  No, it wasn't near my phone.  No, it wasn't near my other cards.  And this happened to several other guests, as well.  They were nice each time we needed to get new ones but they seriously need to figure out the issue here.  The rooms are spacious!  The heat works well (it was in the 40s outside when I arrived).  There is a TV that pivots to either face the pullout couch or the bed.  There is also a mini-fridge, a desk, and a wardrobe.  The bathroom is tiny, though.  Sliding doors are cool but there is zero counter space.  The shower is only a shower, no tub, which is fine plus it wasn't cheap with the hot water.  The bathroom is also well-lit.  Valet parking is $20 a day (ouch!) but there is a public lot next door that is $7 per day.  They also offer car service to and from the airport for $35.  Overall, this location could be much better considering the name attached to it.  But it's not bad.  It's clean, has what you need, and the location can't get much better.  They just need to provide more counter space in the bathroom and have their daytime staff be much nicer.  The night auditor, however, was charming.For only having been open 28 (or was it 25?) days, this place is pretty awesome.This hotel is located in a muli-use high-rise in downtown Charlotte.  When my cab dropped me off here from the airport ($25 flat fare + tip, in case you were wondering), I thought he had made a mistake.   I checked the GPS on my phone to confirm we were at the right place.  A nice gentlemen at the door told me to take the first set of elevators to the lobby on the 10th floor.  The lobby is on th 10th floor?  Alright....  Reluctantly I do as I'm told and go up to the 10th floor, where I was greeted by a very nice young man in what is in fact the lobby.  I asked him about the hotel and he told me the first 5 floor are valet parking, floors 7 through 14 belong to the hotel, and floors 15 and above are privately owned condos.  Interesting, right?  He proceeded to check me in for 2 nights at a crazy low (corproate) rate.  He also let me know that thanks to my Hyatt Rewards status I had been given a complimentary upgrade to a suite.  FTW!I proceed to my room and it is indeed huge.  Way more space than I need, but I kind of like it. The room is nicely appointed, but I can't help but feel like I am in a converted office space.  Probably something about those big square colums around the room.  What are those called?  Bulkheads?  But, I digress.I asked about room service, but I was informed that they are a ""select services"" hotel and they don't have room service.  I'm not sure which services they've selected, but so far that's the only thing I've noticed that's missing.  Not to worry though, there are a bunch of places that Yelp says deliver in the area.  I ordered dinner from Fujo Bistro (sushi) and they delivered right to my hotel room door.   They do have a complimentary breakfast in the morning though, on the same floor as the lobby (10th).   Breakfast was pretty good.  I noticed fresh fruit, oatmeal with fixings, bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches, toast, ceral, milk, coffee and juice.  My oatmeal and breakfast sandwich were quite tasty!The bed is comfortable and the towls in the bathroom are of a decent quality (not rough, but definitely not soft).  Also the shower pressure was good (a big pet peeve of mine), and there are lots of power outlets all over the room.  They offer free wi-fi, which is nice.  They gave me the password at check-in which worked fine the first day but it didn't work the next day.  When I contacted the front desk I was informed the password changes every week.It's not all rainbow and unicorns though.  There are a few serious drawbacks with staying here.   The first is the lack of soundproofing.  I can hear someone listening to music in the next room, and I can hear loud, albeit muffled, conversation in the hall.  I had no problem sleeping though, which was a relief.  Second, the hotel is not in a great part of town.  There are some areas I would not feel comfortable walking at night by myself within just a couple of blocks in different directions.  Finally, the building lobby (not the hotel lobby)  has two exits, but only one entrance.  I tried to get in the way I went out, and it was locked so I had to walk all the way around the building to get in.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay.  And since I didn't have to wander far for work I would definitely stay here again.Really liked my room and everything. The staff was very nice.I didn't like the sheer curtains. They need to be denser so the sun doesn't come through as strongly. The breakfast wasn't that good either. it had very little to offer, and the fruit was from a can. Also, the $20 parking is ridiculous considering how parking is $6 a few steps from the hotel.We loved this place. The room was HUGE but not even a suite or anything. The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. We took advantage of the FREE BREAKFAST every morning. It was within walking distance of the convention center and the Epicenter (a big mall with bars, restaurants, a movie theater and a drug store). My only complaint (I seem to always have at least one) was that the pool was tiny. I mean TINY. If you needed to cool off after sunbathing, I guess it would be better than nothing, but it really could have fit in our giant room. We liked to sit out there at night - it had a great rooftop view of the Charlotte skyline. I totally recommend the Hyatt Place Downtown Charlotte!The Hotel itself is Brand new and the rooms are huge!  The customer service is great and they have eh-breakfast buffet. Downfall, hard to access and elevators are extremely slow. Beware about occasionally sharing the elevator with drunk kids from Fahrenheit (the rooftop bar)","Okay, so I do believe that they opened a little earlier than they should of, and yeah, I had a few bumps in the road while staying here, but all in all, I had a good experience.We got a nice corner room (it was a handi-capable room, since I was traveling with my family, and my brother is special-needs). It was very open and bright with tons of window. Def made the room seem bigger and the natural light was amazing. I wish we could have had a room that overlooked the Uptown Charlotte skyline, but our room was on the other side of the hotel.Since they opened a little before they should have, some amenities weren't available yet. For example, their pool wasn't open yet, the water machine in the gym wasn't set up the first half of my stay, and they still were doing some construction in the hotel.Speaking on construction, they were working up on the roof, and for some reason, they kept triggering the fire alarm. It did go off at least once a day for a few days, but luckily most of the time we weren't in our room. When we were in our room, it did get a bit annoying bc the alarm was loud, the lights were bright, and it took them a long time to get them turned off. But that is probably my only bad complaint. Oh, actually, a few times, we got loud knocks on our door early in the morning, and when we opened the door, they were wanting to do construction? I'm not sure if the staff didn't alert the construction workers which rooms were vacant and which were taken? That was a little annoying, especially because we were trying to adjust to the time frame (we were visiting from California). But those are the only things that really did kinda suck.They have great customer service though. In fact, during our stay, my brother got really sick, and we had to take him to the emergency room. I think he had picked up a virus in the airplane? Anyways, my dad went to the lobby on the 10th floor, and inquired about making sure that the construction workers didn't knock loudly on our door anymore, and he explained that my brother was battling an illness and the doctors wanted him to rest up as much as possible. Later that day, we had gone to Target to get medicine, and when we came back, they had left a note giving my brother well wishes, and also gave him a little care package. How sweet is that?!The gym is really nice, especially because of the beautiful view of the Uptown Charlotte skyline. The gym itself isn't too big. There was about 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bicycles, and a rack of weights. It's enough to get a decent workout in. And again, the view is amazing.They also have a free continental breakfast every morning, and it usually ends around 10ish I think. They have lots of different options - eggs, breakfast meats, toast, breakfast sandwiches, fruit, breakfast sides, cereal, toast, juice, coffee, etc. It was poppin' in the morning. So many people came to fuel up with yummy breakfast to start their day.All in all, despite the two cons, there were alot more pros, and I did enjoy my stay here. My family and I were def satisfied. And I feel like if we ever visited the area again, we would stay here again.I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it to family and friends and will stay there again when visiting Charlotte. The entire hotel is spotless, staff are all friendly and helpful and the room was very spacious and comfortable. The rooftop pool area has an amazing view of the city.  Parking is pricey at $20 a day but that seemed to be the standard at all the uptown hotels.I had a bad experience with customer service.Very nice new hotel.  Rooms are clean and large.  The hotel staff I've encountered have been friendly and helpful.  The rooftop bar is nice and has a great view  but it does get very busy in the weekends.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Place hotel this weekend and had great service, especially from Mark at the front desk (working Saturday and Sunday morning). Normally, I would rate this hotel 4 stars (it was a great stay, no complaints, but I usually reserve 5 stars for exceptional experiences). We were supposed to arrive Friday evening and had issues with our air travel so we weren't able to make it in until Saturday morning. I called the hotel to notify them and Zach checked me in over the phone so we wouldn't lose our room (it was a race weekend, so we knew space would be limited). We had a really long travel day and Mark was so friendly and helpful when we arrived, and though we had just missed the breakfast service by a couple minutes he went into the back and fixed us plates. He really went above and beyond and I cannot tell you how grateful and thankful we were for his generosity! It was very clear he wanted to help, and that he was in the right line of work. His hospitality made a huge difference after a day of dealing with nightmare travel, which is why I am rating this with 5 stars. The room was spacious, the wedding block rate was very affordable, and the location was great. I loved that you were able to borrow a steamer and other amenities for free, and that I could walk to the best nightlife in Charlotte in just a few minutes. We had a great experience, and I would highly recommend staying here.Horriffic experience - should not have opened before they were ready.Checked us in to a room that was already occupied, checked us out early incorrectly twice, so our room never got serviced, air conditioning unit not working, phone systems to call front desk not working, lights that have no outlets within reaching distance and fire alarms that have tripped 3 times during our stay.  One star is for most of the staff that is very friendly, but the manager on duty, who I understand is having to deal with a rough situation, needs more experience to be dealing with a new hotel that has so many issues.  Give them plenty of time to get their act together.CAUTION: When booking your room don't give them your ""official"" email address.  Give them your junk mail email address.  Since my stay I've been getting Hyatt spam like crazy.  My review is still 4 stars for a very nice stay.Booked us in a  room with one bed instead of two as requested. Apparently this happens when you book with Expedia. Hotel was clean. Close to town  Seemed disorganized however. 4 separate times knocked on door for cleaning. We left room after fourth time. Came back 2 hours later and room was  not clean. Biggest complaint was a very loud heater. It was very difficult to stay asleep when heater kicked on. Tried to see if we could change rooms but front desk not very helpful.  I would have given 3 stars but lack of sleep caused me to lower ratingWe had a very nice one night stay. Deluxe king room, large, clean, comfortable, with a great view of uptown Charlotte. Cool looking glass sliding bathroom door would not close and the sitting area lights were switched so that all are either on or off, these were the negatives of our room. Overall though a positive experience. A very reasonable rate for a room within easy walking distance to downtown and both major sports venues. We would for sure stay here again.",,,,"['far', 'hotels', 'uptown', 'area', 'seems', 'better', 'ones', 'money', 'decent', 'location', 'central', 'close', 'everything', 'free', 'breakfast', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-charlotte-airport-charlotte,Doubletree Charlotte Airport,2.0,$$,34,"This Doubletree near CLT is reasonably priced and perfectly fine if you're not expecting fancy. Standard DT set up - cookies, breakfast, free wifi for premium HHonors members. The rooms have not been updated in who knows how long, but they are clean.Location relative to CLT and downtown Charlotte is about 20 minutes for both. I'd stay here again for the convenience factor but if there was something newer within the same price range, I'd probably go with the newer hotel.The AC unit was incredibly loud and turned on often, despite setting it to 74 degrees. This made it very very difficult to sleep. I would have simply opened the window, as it was quite cool out, but the windows seemed to be bolted shut. Housekeeping knocked loudly on our door at 8:30 am, despite check out being at noon. The front desk staff was also very rude. When I was checking in, the person at the front desk halted the transaction to have a cell phone conversation for 5 minutes. Then simply handed us our keys and kept talking. I wanted to voice some of these concerns in the morning, but there was no one at the front desk. The difficulty sleeping along with the uncaring staff make it hard for me to recommend this hotel to anyone.I spent three weeks at this hotel while in training for work. They recently started renovations and there is constant jack hammering and noise from the hours of 9-7. The van driver in the morning is by far the most rude person I have ever met. Fire alarms went off multiple times during my stay. Once at 6am and once at 9pm. Not even once did anyone apologize about the noise or offer anything for the inconvenience. I will never stay at this hotel again and recommend you just stay at the Hyatt Place next door.I would have left this feedback with the front desk but no one was stationed there when I left this morning.No hot water this morning, that is fully unacceptable for a hotel. The toilet in my room, and I believe it was the same during my last stay, has so little water pressure that one has to hold the handle down fully and continue to do so for it to actually remove waste. Even then it still did not do a proper job.It has been quite a long time since I have been as disappointed with a hotel as I am todayI guess I should have checked the reviews for this place here before bookingStay anywhere else, like a motel6 would be a better choiceWent there for a meeting.  Services were adequate.  The smell of chlorine in the bathroom burned my eyes, but I guess that just means it is sanitary??  lolFood was average, it had its good points and bad points.  Would stay there if I had no where else to go.This hotel needs an update for sure. Rooms smell musty and are showing their wear. Upgraded to a suite (2 rooms) and no desk. They don't offer, so don't upgrade if you want to work form a desk.The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. Best part of the stay for sure.Met a friend here for breakfast so I can't tell you anything about the rooms. What I did experience was a friendly check-in clerk and a large roomy parking lot that is right around the corner from the airport.For the breakfast, at 8:15 on a weekday it was very well picked over. White bread, gone. Scrambled eggs, gone. Bacon, nearly gone. Sausages, nearly gone. They were probably cooking up more in the back, but what I saw was disappointing.It's probably a really nice hotel (my friend said good things about his room) but the breakfast let them down.This seems to be indicative of the Doubletree brand in a down spiral.  The hotel is old and appears to be converted from another chain. I only stayed one night due to other hotels being sold out.  The room was spacious, but the wallpaper was peeling, the fixtures in the bathroom were heavily rusted.   To make matters worse, the heating did not work.  The walls were paper thin and every noise from inside walls was as if I was in the same room. If you can stay somewhere else, do.Had  four days of training at this facility. Our meeting room was an absolute sauna. This was a very long technical week.  I spoke with the person at the front counter regarding the climate. He may have cared but his facial expression did not convey that.  The food was of good quality but sparing quantity. Wouldn't recommend this spot except for convenient access to airport.My husband and I stayed here recently. The room was nice, but you could hear everything in the room next door because the walls are so thin. It's close to the airport, so you could also hear the planes. Just too noisy. Breakfast was overpriced!The worst thing about this hotel is that the maid stole my watch and cross necklace. The hotel clerk would not let us speak to a manger, so we had to file a report with the police. I'll probably never see those cherished items again, and we will NEVER stay here!I have nothing much to say.. This is a good place. The only drawback is that there are nothing to do around here, unless yoir staying before flying out from CLT airport.Food is anothet issue, only few restaurant within walkin distance. But there is always room service.Overall... This is a nice place.The hotel is pretty new, and the room was fine. The only issue with our room was the paper-thin wall separating it from the next room. At 11:30 p.m., we could hear our neighbor's TV way too well.We were planning on using the free airport shuttle. And then we stood outside waiting for 25 minutes before giving up and renting a car from Hertz. We had taken a red-eye in and were really hoping to check in early and shower/nap, but there were no rooms available even at noon, which is not their fault but it was disappointing. Yelp's ""Meh. I've experienced better."" perfectly describes our experience here.Get something in the restaurant that goes with their Salsa. The Salsa is exceptional. Very pleasant and courteous waitstaff.Ewwww!  Really disappointing for a Doubletree or any Hilton property.  Just gave me the heebee-geebees.  I stayed there to be close to the airport for an early flight.  Got the ""upgrade"" for the suite.  Definitely an old place that could use an upgrade itself!  I'm thinking that it hasn't always been a Doubletree though I don't have proof.  Anyhow, the grossness occurred went I went in the bathroom.  The wall next to the switch had some kind of weird stain.  Was it blood?  A booger?  Something else from the body?  Cosmetics?  Who knows but it totally grossed me out.  The wallpaper surrounding the light switch was dirty too.  I used a kleenex to turn the light on and off.  Also, the lamp and clock radio in the bedroom had a nice little layer of dust.  When was the last time that room was cleaned?So since the wallpaper, lamp and radio had visible grossness on it, it really made me wonder what I couldn't see that would gross me out. Wow, I don't think I've used the word ""gross"" so much since junior high!I stay here on business while visiting a customer right down the street. Rather far from decent restaurants but not a bad stay and very comfortable. Hilton honors club members have our own floor.They gave me an occupied room to start. No free Internet access like most Hilton brands I use. No free breakfast with nerve to ask $13 for the buffet. Bathtub drain was broke. It's a nice clean comfy place to sleep. But today's markets demand key amenities like Internet and breakfast.Only giving two stars for the staff because they were MOSTLY great- basically just a two night stay, no biggie, but I'm a hilton honors member and I really expected more: whn I got into my room I noticed the hallway was VERY warm leading up to my rm. great, since it was chilly outside, EXCEPT my room was FREEZING. Why? The heater was broken. PLUS- the door was broken: meaning whn I opened the door the deadlock popped out and prevented it from closing. The first night I was in the room I got WAY too comfortable before realizing my door had not truly closed behind me. NOT cool. This made me a bit paranoid throughout my stay: had to physically hold the lock n the door to allow the door to close. I arrived late Friday (10/11) night after driving all the way from Smithfield (3hrs away), and after having a late dinner with friends in concord I arrived at abt 1/2am. After getting to my rm and realizing the heat was busted naturally I went downstairs- unfortunately there was only one gentleman at the from who was sweeping the floors. Although he was nice enough listening to my issue he unfortunately was dumbfounded as to what to do. I was honestly too wiped out from my travels to care, not wanting to wait for the lady attendant and go gather the rest of my things. I'm truly glad I brought a sweater w sweatpants and socks up. Also, after hanging out at the bar and talking to a friendly English gentleman who stays frequently and extensively at this hotel (he mentioned abt 6mos out of the year, name is Jim) and with the barkeep, Rob, overhearing, apparently the lock issue is an ongoing recurring issue. c'mon, Doubletree!!!! What happened to ur standards?!?!!! Well, I'm leaving today (10/13) And Fortunately my stay was not in vain as the redeeming factors at this hotel were accessibility to The city and the company I kept while here: staff w a good attitude, and great friends, old and new.Don't usually stay at Doubletree's, but I was at the mercy of my coworker so I booked it.  We just stayed one night since we had a flight out the next morning.  Check in was easy and the warm chocolate chip cookie was a nice surprise.  Room was average, but I do have to say the bed and pillows were super comfy.  There was no fridge or microwave in the room.  The rooms are older, but I felt were pretty clean.  Also, unless you are elite level (which I'm not yet) you don't get free breakfast or Internet.  Limited TV stations as well.  Which with no Internet, and limited TV I was glad I had packed some magazines for entertainment!But if you are only in town for a night, it's not a bad place, I guess I just expected more from a Doubletree.If you stay at hotels long enough.. every 50 or so times you will hit a real stinker where the place is so poorly managed that you need to get up - leave and stay elsewhere.  This is the place to avoid.Try to contact the management and you won't get anywhere.  I am thinking of contacting the Hilton group about Karen Sullivan the general manager of this zoo and getting some answers as to why we were treated so badly.  No fridge, Microwave or working shower.  The rooms smell of smoke and were so noisy from the construction that we had to leave to get some sleep.  This was a real rip off.This is the first time i have ever been here.It is not too bad at all.             The van picked us up at the airport within about 10 min of us waiting at the curb. So that was good.  The hotel had our rooms ready right away.    Rooms were nice, and the heat worked,which was good because, it was 40 degrees outside!       Beds are good.  Bathroom nice and clean, could of used more towels though. I called for a sewing kit and a face cloth.      They brought it up right away.                                                             The only thing that was not so good,was the strange smell in the hotel. Like that Florida smell.  You know how warm places that are damp have an odd smell.You have to pay for internet but, you do get the famous Doubletree cookie.","I used to like the doubletree but now the only good thing seems to be the cookies. The tv remote doesn't work. The restaurant is awful (too much salt). Business center has broken printer and staff seems unconcerned. The satellite reception is crappy and they don't provide a single bottle of water in room. Supposed clean towel when opened was dirty (pink fingernail polish.. no it wasn't mine)This was 3 days of minor but frustratingly irritating events. To top it all of the night shift was just unpleasant and hardly acknowledged you as you passed by. The one person who did a great job, was our van driver Micheal. Do yourself a favor stay elsewhere this hotel doesn't seem to want the business.Good service, clean rooms, ok restaurant...nothing special about this place.  Good place for a short layover.We booked with a nice rate for this place, and the best thing aside from that was that the bed was very comfortable!  The staff was also very gracious providing us with free warm cookies upon check in, and two bottles of complementary water in our room with a small wrapped chocolate graham cracker.Both hubby and I enjoyed 2 nights of sweet sleep. Worst part is that you can hear the planes overhead since it is near the airport, and I didn't like that at all.Our room was clean, but upon using the bathtub I did notice a stain behind the toilet that I should have reported. We didn't eat in the dining room, or use the pool which looked lovely outside of our window, so  I can't comment on that.We did notice no refrigerator or microwave- but since we didn't need one it wasn't a concern to us.Basically we only stayed to sleep there. Given what we paid, I would stay again without question.Otherwise, not.I usually stay at Hampton Inns but thought I would give Doubletree a try since its in the Hilton Family. Myth busted. The Hilton name means nothing!  I was extremely disappointed. Besides the fact that the layout is terribly inconvenient getting from the lobby to the rooms, there is a very musty, mildewy odor that is hard to get over. I heard it used to be a Wyndam Garden Hotel, but I looked it up on Google Earth and I am pretty sure it was a La Quinta Inn at one time. I suppose if they charged La Quinta prices, I might expect the bad experience I had, but I left $230 poorer for two nights stay, and was expected to pay $9.95 if I wanted to use the Internet. Are you serious? Even that is complimentary at Hampton Inn. At least I got a $25 gas card to ease the blow. Upon arrival, ""Mr. Bubbles"" greeted me in monotone, processed my credit card, and said ""here are your cookies and your gas card."" That was awkward - it was as if I had asked for or even knew I was getting the cookies. Just ""here's your cookies"" Not - we see you've traveled a long way - here are some warm cookies to brighten your day. So, I try to remain positive, I think, maybe its me, maybe I'm just tired....I go to my room. I enter the 2nd floor hallway and notice a blood stain, a large blood stain on the carpet in the hall just before I get to the room that completely weirded me out. I stayed in room 218. The room appears to be well-appointed but upon further inspection I notice the back of the flat painted hollow-core bathroom door was filthy, and the wallpapered light switch cover was equally filthy. Yuck! I was so grossed out! The caulking around the tub looked like a 6 year old did it. After close inspection, I crawl in bed. The bed was the most ridiculously uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in, unless you count the pull out couch I stayed on once as a kid. I locate the remote and discover that there is no Food Network or HGTV or any of the other basic cable channels you might expect...are you serious! There is so much hallway noise in this property, its just retarded; the kids running up and down the halls could be remedied if there was security present. This is not the hotels fault but there were people talking in the hallway at all hours like they live in a barn. There are huge gaps under the doors - maybe when they tore out the old 1972 shag carpet, it left a space and they never did anything about it. Hey, Doubletree, here's a clue: replace the doors with ones that fit for the sake of your guests. IMPORTANT TIP: The first night I forgot to set the thermostat fan to ON and heard planes coming in till all hours. Three thirty in the morning, I'm screaming BE QUIET!!! as my neighbors on the second floor apparently leaving to catch early flights forget some people are still sleeping. I recommend you DO NOT choose this hotel unless your only other choice is sleeping on the streets of Charlotte. If you do stay here, set the fan to the permanently ON position and leave your TV on low volume for white noise. Adding insult to injury, I woke up the first morning with a bite mark in my right forehead hairline -- do not have a clue what THEE HECK that was all about. My skin crawls to think about it. I still havent ruled out that I have hitchhikers.As I was leaving, I encountered several of the housekeeping staff cluttering the walkway near the elevators. They stared and commented to each other that ""everybody is trying to get outta here"" I said good morning, and they replied and stared as my daughter and I struggled with our belongings. Not one staff person ever offered a hand. I passed my ""parting thoughts"" survey across the counter to the man at the front desk - and told him he was the first person to have smiled since I checked in two days ago. He said ""oh no"" and I said ""oh yes"" and out the door we went. I come to Charlotte about once a month, but I will never stay there again! BEWARE!!!! Doubletree Charlotte Airport is DoubleGross! Zero stars!GOT BED BUGS IN ROOM 242 OR 250 !Free internet in lobby only...really - Hilton get a clue!The first room that I got had a funny smell. They called me and asked me how my room was and I let them know that I wasn't fond of the funny smell so they asked me to come down so that I can switch rooms. The second  room was really clean and no funny smell.  the only issue that I had was that the walls are paper thin and I can hear every phone conversation from the room next door. The person next door was on the phone all night laughing. I had to sleep with the TV on. You can also hear every door close in the hallway through the night.As I waited curbside for the airport shuttle, little did I know what I was about to walk into.  As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, ""This must be a popular place."" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that ""old"" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.So I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.This hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel's food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.The next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper. If this was not a metaphor for my whole experience, I do not know what would be. This place does not live up to the Double Tree standard. Not Going Back.I conducted a last-minute small meeting at this location and without a doubt will not be conducting anymore meetings here.1) The meeting rooms are on the 3rd floor &amp; the bathrooms are on the 1st... do the math.2) Nobody checked on us the entire day to make sure everything was acceptable. I guess they knew it wasn't!3) The AC unit in the meeting room was so loud that we had to turn it off and suffer through a hot meeting.The Sales Manager followed up with me and really didn't have anything to say, except for she wished that I would have found her to tell her about the AC unit. She couldn't say anything else and my guess is that she knew that the meeting rooms were substandard.I am having another meeting (larger) next month at the Doubletree, but at the one in South Park. Hopefully it will be A LOT better, then again, can't get much worse!Update: the meeting at the Southpark location was great. They exceeded expectations and will be booking with them again.Okay,  this is gonna sound paranoid, but I'm beginning to think that I'm being followed.  Every time I stay in a middle of the road hotel,  there's a long black hair in my bathtub.  Should I be worried?The visit from my raven haired stalker aside, most everything about this place sucks.  I had to crash here because I missed a connection, and didn't want to sleep at the airport.  It was super that the guy at the front desk was so exceptionally surly when I checked in.  Oh, and the location?  Primo.  It's a .5 mile walk to the nearest gas station... without a sidewalk.  Of course, the reason I was out foraging is because the hotel restaurant closes at 11pm, has a shitty menu, and there is no restaurant alternative within walking distance after 10pm.My favorite part was the shuttle ride back to the airport in the morning.  We left at 0600 sharp, just as promised. We got 4 or 5 minutes down the road, and the driver gets a phone call.  He swings the bus around and goes BACK to the Doubletree to pick up a flight crew that was late for the shuttle.  In case you need reminding, I landed in this godforsaken hellhole because my flight crew didn't see fit to turn around the plane and come pick ME up when I was delayed.  I know the impulse to compare the two situations may not be the most mature, but I hope you'll understand why I was on the verge of filling that shuttle van to the brim with expletives.This place isn't worth the $66 bucks I paid.  If you're standing in the airport trying to figure out where you're going to stay, keep looking.  If you're my hair-leaving stalker and you're reading this, quit it.  That's gross.This hotel I used to love...It has proceeded to get worse and worse with each visit. The last time I came in on a redeye, the rooms were not even ready. The pilot on our flight, as less than enthuised when the cheerful manager offered us a breakfast voucher. Advising her that after flying all night none of us were truly hungry for some buffet breakfast, but we just wanted our beds and a hot shower. She then ante'd up a dinner voucher. Nonetheless, we waited almost 45 minutes for our rooms. There are always, ALWAYS, issues with the hotel shuttle..its late..too full... something.. Always! I found the hotel clerks to be rude when we tried to use our vouchers that nite, as the cafe questioned it. THEN took more than 40 minutes to get a sandwiche and soup ready. It started to feel like a joke on the flight crew. I can't really ever get the internet to work in the rooms. But I do like the gym. I have to say something positive.Details.....details. Little things bug me, like a missing ironing board (just as I'm ready to press a wrinkled shirt...had to use a towel on top of a desk), like a shower nozzle that's situated for 5 footers, like a TV remote that doesn't work unless it's three feet in front of the TV... All in all, a clean room, good rate, a comfortable bed, and a decently appointed fitness room, but it was the details that killed this trip.To get to the point... Not worth the money. Lamp buzzed when it was on, only got about 15-20 channels, no mini-fridge, no internet, no complementary breakfast. Breakfast was $10 for 2 eggs, side of meat and a drink... On top of it, after a long road trip, i tried to make small talk with the receptionist, and she was extremely rude. Last thing I want to deal with after driving 10 hours. The place is a big circle, so it is a hassle to get around, and on top of it, it seemed damp and smelly. If I had to say anything nice to say about it, it had a comfortable bed, and a nice bathroom. That's it. Save your money, and find a different place to stay at.Very nice staff, hotel and room nice enough but either I was put in a smoking room or a non-smoking room where someone had been smoking.  Very musty and smoky and damp - made it difficult to sleep.My wife and I stayed here for a two-day getaway.  We were interested in a relaxing getaway about an hour from home that we could use as a base for exploring some of the restaurants and sights in Charlotte.Check-in was a breeze.  We arrived about 4 pm on a Thursday afternoon and was waited on immediately, and my reservations were retrieved with only a couple of pieces of information.  Probably two minutes later we had our roomkeys and complimentary warm cookies and we were on our way.The room was very nice with nice furnishings and a comfortable King-sized bed.  The bed was not as comfortable as the Sleep-number bed at a Radisson I stayd at recently, but comfortable nonetheless.  There was ample lighting for reading in bed, at the desk, or in the side chair.The desk was very nice, along with an ergonomic mesh-back chair.  I'm not sure if I am just too big for this chair or if the chair was broken, but I could not get the chair to do anything but recline.  I didn't complain because I was there to be with my wife and even left my laptop at home (egads!).The desk had wired internet and there was wireless available as well, but for a fee.  Why the more expensive hotels require you to pay for WiFi while the cheap hotels give it away I'll never know.The bathroom was very nicely appointed with a beautiful countertop, a standard size bathtub/shower combination.  A blow dryer was provided as well.  The towels and washcloths were nice -- not the nicest hotel towels I've encountered, but a nice grade of towel.They provide a coffee maker than makes one or two-cups of coffee at a time.  This is the style of maker that makes it directly into the cup, and they provide Woflgang Puck coffee pods.  The coffee was very good.The television was a good-sized flatscreen with excellent sound.  They have music channels you can listen to, but beware:  when the 5-minute trial ends, they automatically charge you the $14.95 for two hours of listening (which is ridiculous for radio).  We realized that only after the time went down to zero and the voice said that we were being charged.  We called the desk immediately to say we thought the thing would pop up a prompt when our trial was over, and they immediately and graciously took that off our folio.We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it is a two-lane lap pool that looks like it is junior-olympic length (not width).  The seating in the pool area as well as in the courtyard just outisde the pool area was ample and inviting.  The seating in the lobby appeared very comfortable and well-apppointed, too.Overall, this was a good room at a decent price.  There are restaurants nearby, although  it's not a pedestrian-friendly area.  If you arrive via airport shuttle and don't have a rental you're best advised to try the restaurant on site (which we didn't try) or take a cab to some of the areas where there are other options, such as the South park neighborhood or Uptown.",,,,"['near', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'expecting', 'fancy', 'standard', 'set', 'cookies', 'breakfast', 'free', 'premium', 'members',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-charlotte-airport-tyvola-road-charlotte,Hyatt Place Charlotte Airport/Tyvola Road,4.0,$$,39,"Great customer service, very clean and new, bar, snack bar, rooms are spacious. Would highly recommend.Nice roomSpaciousSofa and two double bedsSeveral outlets and computer connection access portsExtended stay room concept: sofa separated from two beds by a half wallClean bathroomFree toiletriesThick earplugs!!!!!Matt (Guest services) was polite, smile on his face, thorough but fast check-inContinental Breakfast comes with the roomFree airport shuttleAll for just over $150This is a Hyatt Place.  Rooms look like all the other Hyatt Place rooms.  My door didn't close properly, a malfunction of the locking mechanism, so that I had to use my room key to open the door handle then shut the door from the outside.  The staff couldn't have cared less.Returned late after an event to discover that the 'bar' is closed at midnight... on a Saturday night.  By closed I understood to mean the lazy creature working the night shift didn't feel like serving anything cold from the beer locker.I stay at Hyatt Places in other parts of the country, but this one is staffed by lazy a-holes who work minimum-wage and aren't paid enough to care about customer service.  Either go to another part of the country or stay at a Hilton property.  I regret that there is a Doubletree next door that I should have stayed at.Fancy Continental breakfast! Staff was friendly! Great rates! Clean rooms! Very spacious and enough for 6 adults! Free and strong WiFi! Nice lounge area!  Overall this was a great experience! I'm staying here every time I travel to Charlotte!I travel a lot on business for a family run company (Air General) and Hyatt always makes me feel like home. Thank you very much Yousri for making my stay this time even better than my last!I recommend highly,-Brad LeffIt is okay.  The carpet in the elevator and the ground floor could use an update.  But the rooms are clean and ample.  Worth staying here.Stayed here for three nights and had no problems at all. The room was clean and love the set-up with the couch and kitchen area. The breakfast is probably the best I've had at a hotel for free. There is a little strip mall in the adjacent parking lot that has a convenience store and a few places to eat if needed. My only complaint is the free Wi-Fi could have been better. It is only a 10 minute ride to Uptown so I would for sure stay here again to save some money.Service was friendly although a man in housekeeping did make a comment to my 3 year old when he touched the glass door about him being the one to make the prints all over his clean doors. :-/ The room was clean, in fact they had just finished shampooing the carpets. The complimentary breakfast was where I had to take away a star. My son wanted a bagel, when I went to move the bagel with the provided tongs, bugs flew out from under the bagels. I was revolted and we had cereal.This hotel was great. Lobby hosts were super sweet. My phones weren't hooked up in the room when I got in, but maintenance came and fixed it up in a flash, and with a smile. The design is nice, and there's plenty of room in the king room. Best part was the strong wifi signal. I was able to do work, surf the internet, catch up on my Netflix and play some video games. Anytime my free wifi is that good I'm a happy bunny.The hotel has free shuttle service to the airport, but be sure to schedule 1 drop off prior to the one you need...I ended up waiting 20 minutes for the driver to come out to the van at the hotel. He was apologetic and sweet when he was there, but it's still rough when you're trying to catch a flight or manage your itinerary. Tip: they will drive you anywhere within their radius, so check out what's around and don't be shy to ask for a ride somewhere nearby!Speaking of nearby, it's only about 15 minutes anywhere (Southpark Mall, Target, restaurants, etc) by car, so if you have a rental this is still a good option!All in all, I would absolutely stay again if I ever find myself in the Charlotte airport area overnight again.I've stayed at many Hyatt's from the Place to Parks. First off, I know I'm a bit late on this review. but I was there 6/17-6/20 and 6/26/14So here it goes. Hyatt Place are mostly for business travelers and or families about to head out for vacation because most to almost all Hyatt Places are located in a 10 mile radius of an airport (especially International airports). So the location of this proprety was of course only 10- 15 mins away. HOWEVER!! This shouldn't have excused them of being late picking me up or rushing me ( I'll explain)So my plane didn't land until 1130pm - I just had to wait another 10 mins for my luggage. Yes, I know their shuttle service ends at Midnight. YES! I get that! But don't call me and ask if I still needed the room and if I was ever going to come because they would have ""released"" it to resale... Wait what?!First off you don't say that, second audit usually doesn't run their end of day system until 2am anyways so... Imma need ya to calm down. Good note, the staff are laid back... a little too laid back, but it's okay it was 1am, and  I was too tired to care really plus  I just got done working out in their VERY little ""gym"" and just needed to have a sit before I ran the stairs to my room. Sidenote - probably the smallest stay fit gym out of all the Hyatt Places that I've stayed at. Also a good note: They were in the middle of upgrading the property from a category 1 to what looks like a 2 or 3? (Now if you all stay at Hyatt Place Charlotte Uptown, now that is a Category 3-4 Hyatt Place and it is VERY nice!)The rooms were great! Like any other HP's, you have the ""living"" area, desk, wet bar, mini frig, and then you have a little wall where the bed is located and the vanity and sink in front of it, with a stand in shower. The carpet and furniture was def new. One bad thing- the 24/7 market case was very messy, and none of the sandwiches or salads look fresh. Also in their cafe area, they had their personals cups all over the place. How does that pass with health code?HEADS UP: Shuttle is horrible.  Its airport priority which is fine. But it took them an hour to pick me up (The second time I stayed there 6/26/14)... and almost 2 hours to pick me up from a restaurant.  They dont give an estimated time.Really nice size suites at a very reasonable rate. Beds were comfortable and the bedding was clean. The headboard however  had a few missed spots. There was a very large stain in the carpet in front of the sleeper. I immediately went back down and showed the front desk a picture and was told someone was being sent right up to clean it. Never happened, that day or the next. The breakfast was ok. The lobby area is beautiful and comfy.  The flatbread is great. They don't have room service, you have to pick up in the bar area. They have a small bakery case and self serve sandwich snack case. If the cleaning crew was on top of their game this would be a four star review.This hotel was wonderful! The first look at the lobby is great - up to date decorations, granite countertops, friendly staff. Nothing but impressed by the room - there is a spacious living room with a sectional sofa in the area closest to the door, which shares a tv with the bedroom area in the double rooms. Two sinks, full bath, nice workspace. Remember to bring your HDMI cable to hook up your laptop to the TV - they make it really convenient by building and input strip into the tv stand. Our group used the fitness center (emphasis on free weights and treadmills, which I prefer), as well as the outdoor pool. The breakfast in the morning was really fresh and cute! They were putting out sausage biscuits a few at a time, as they were made and eaten. If you're looking for bites within walking distance, try Nana's Soulfood - it's just across the parking lot!Solid 4 stars! Friendly, accommodating staff, great complimentary breakfast, strong coffee and convenient noon checkout. I booked through Hotwire and, for less than $80, got a very nice 1.5 room suite with a comfy bed, L couch and nice local channel selection. The free Internet connection was consistent enough for me to watch Netflix on my computer without interruption - impressive! My stay at the Hyatt Place really helped me make the most of an unfortunate cancelled flight situation. I would definitely stay here again.I wasn't impressed. The internet was so slow that it was unusable, and the elevator smelled like someone had vomited in it. Not an ideal place.I have never stayed in a Hyatt Place. However, I had no choice after my flight was cancelled again by U.S. Airways ( that is another story). So they provided a voucher to the Hyatt Place. I was very impressed with the decor but especially with the great customer service. The young lady name Beverly (I think)mans Shuttle driver/cook/room service guy was awesome. The room was very nice and clean. I always love a room that has a mini refrigerator and microwave. They don't have a restaurant per say, but the do have a limited menu of salads and desserts. Additionally, they freshly  make them per order. I love building my points with Hilton, but I will strongly consider Hyatt palace in my future travel plans.I chose this hotel for one night because of its' great value and space for a large group of us (3 adults and 3 children). I was completely wowed by this hotel. The room we had had 2 beds and the sofa sectional was a sofa bed. There was a divider to separate the living area from the beds. The beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was one TV that could be tilted and viewed from each room. There was also a fridge and small bar sink. Continental breakfast was free but it was better than your typical continental. They had a good variety of hot breakfast sandwiches with the typical fixings. There was also a bar where you could have beer and wine and espresso drinks!Decor in the rooms and hotel is very modern and just how I like it. They also do a free shuttle to the airport and is across the parking lot from some eateries (Nana's Soul Food was a personal favorite). I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel.One word -- Amazing!We stayed here for a night and arrived past midnight. The check-in personnel was gracious. The hotel amenities were fantastic and the staff helpful. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The room also has a coffeemaker and a mini-fridge. Breakfast was included - there were two variations of french toasts that were worth trying, with different variations of coffee and tea provided. Wifi was also free. The toiletries were also of good quality. Personal items were also offered for free at the front desk such as sunblock, nail clippers, shaving cream, nail polish, make up remover, etc. The hotel atmosphere was quaint, trendy and modern. The toiletries and personal items might seem like a small thing, but for travelers like us, the small things make a difference.I stayed here last week with a coworker and had a great experience.  I love that all Hyatt Place hotels are consistent...you always know what you are going to get!  That is a huge compliment for a large brand as I know how hard that is to do.The rooms are great - comfortable beds, large TV's with separate sleeping and sitting areas.  The staff was great - so friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations and getting us a cab.This hotel is very convenient to the airport and reasonably priced - check it out!I just stayed here for 4 days/3 nights for work.  I've been going through Charlotte a lot recently and trying some different places.  I really like the location for my business and travel needs.  Close to the airport, close to the highway.  Easy to get to.They recently did a complete remodel of the place and the rooms are GREAT!  Some of the best I've stayed in for this price.  It was VERY comfortable for business.  Great bed, nice work and dressing area, and the breakfast is among the best I've had at any business hotel.Why only four stars?  The local restaurant selection...within a VERY short walk, is really limited to chain fast-food type establishments.  There just isn't ANYTHING nearby that is quality, or uniquely GOOD local food.  So, if you are staying for a while, plan on having to drive at least 15 minutes to the south side of Charlotte for truly good food and dining experience....same goes for night life....nothing here.That said, I was here for work.  I will definitely come here again.Only a few things matter to me in a hotel while on business trips;1. Bed2. TV3. Bathroom4. General SpaceThis Hyatt nailed them all. The bed was nice, the TV was huge, the bathroom was pretty good, and the room was basically a suite. I had a very comfortable stay there and would definitely go back the next time I'm conned into going to Charlotte.","Friendly desk staff.  Rooms clean and modern.Breakfast was not bad.TV was unhooked but easy to remedy.Living area was great with multiple stools.Not good!Stayed there on 4/3 for business Nice staff at check in, but that is where the good experience ended.Must have been there during the ""rude, obnoxious good old boys convention"".  From 2 am to 4 am, loud, drunk, obnoxious idiots slamming doors and taking over the 6th floor hallways"". When I was leaving there were broken wine glasses and trash in the hallway.Upon checkout I indicated how disappointed I was and that there was glass in the hallway.  Staff could have cared less. Maybe was just my bad timing, but I wouldn't stay here ever again if you want to sleep and it is certainly run worse then any other high end business hotel I have been in.The way all hotels should be.If staying near the Charlotte Airport this is a must stay.  The place seems brand new, and the rooms are top notch.  The room you will get is bigger than most apartments in NYC.  Each room has a staging area with a built in L shaped couch.  Rooms come equipped with 46 inch flat screens, wet bar, fridge, and desk.  It is basically two rooms in one.  They also have a free breakfast in the morning and the staff is very helpful.  Will be staying here again.Wow, this place is amazing!  The suite was HUGE!!  There was even a sectional living room area.  The bed was incredibly comfortable, shower HOT, and friendly staff.  The breakfast was yummy too!  I will definitely be staying at the Hyatt again!! :)When ever I travel I try to stay at a Hyatt place!Love there huge LG flat screens in allThe rooms Love the rooms set upsLove the menu of food that's always available in the lobbyAND DEf Love that now as a member of there frequent stay'ers club every stay builds points that you can earn and use towards a free stay.Love this placeI've stayed here many times over the past couple of months.  These guys do a great job with customer service.  When I arrive, I'm greeted warmly by the front desk staff.  The rooms are nice and roomy, and come with a small kitchen sink and mini-fridge.  The flat-screen TV is set up to allow input from a variety of devices, including laptops, dvd players or video game systems.  The bed is pretty decent.  The only downside to the bed situation is that if you're in a room with two doubles, one of the doubles is less than six inches from the air-conditioner.In the mornings, they offer a cold continental breakfast that includes fruit, yogurt, instant oatmeal, bagels, english muffins, cereal and juices.  While your eating breakfast, you can peruse your complimentary Wall Street Journal.  They also offer a hot breakfast option ($$) in their cafe, along with lunch and dinner options throughout the day.If you don't choose to eat in, there's a Salsarita's across the parking lot, next to Yu Yu's and Jersey Mike's.  Toppers Pizza delivers to the hotel, as does a local Indian restaurant.Fitness room is decent, but only contains four pieces of cardio equipment (elliptical, two treadmills, and a stationary bike).  They have a bigger gym at their sister facility and they'll be happy to give you a ride over if you want to do any weight work.If you're looking for a place to stay and you need something close to the airport, I'd recommend the Hyatt Place CLT Airport/Tyvola Road.The accommodation served us well. The decor is simple but elegant as we expect from Hyatt. The highlight was their happy hour. Dominique pours wine and beer to the guests with friendliness and aplomb. The appetizers range from sausage sandwiches ( ok) to apple salads (mmm mmm!) with a few small yet tasty desserts. The crowd all mingle  well during the two hours and Dominique supplies the smiles and drinks. A lovely way to end a long business or travel day!  Easy access on and off  from route 85,so it works in all departments!My family &amp; I stayed here earlier this week for three nights.The rooms were nice and very spacious, although the bathroom was very small; should have been designed with a pocket door instead of a regular door. The hotel food (room service) really has a variety of items and very reasonably priced and the service was always friendly. Overall very pleased and would highly recommend for anyone.I switched employers a few months back and the new company's preferred hotel group is Hyatt. I was a bit disappointed because the previous employer preferred Marriott and that's where all my points are accumulated. But after several stays in Hyatt properties I'm happy to say ""adios"" to the Marriott gang. I was expecting a Courtyard equivalent when I booked this hotel near Charlotte's airport and was pleasantly surprised that it's a notch above. Modern appointments including a sofa sectional with a cool leather ottoman, huge flat panel HDTV, mini-fridge, granite and tile, free WIFI, comfortable beds, etc. Downstairs there's a nice bar/lobby area with lots of comfy seats, a workout facility (to make me feel guilty as I walk by it) and a pool outside. There's not a lot nearby as its located in an office park area. But I had no problems finding somewhere to eat fairly close (thanks Yelp and google maps). This is my second stay here and all in all, a good experience.Spent one Saturday night here on our way to our anniversary vacation. Needed something classy close enough to the airport as we had a very early and international flight.The hotel was recently remodeled. It looks very modern, airy and with vibrant colors. We got a king size bedroom / suite. You can tell the hotel caters to the business traveler:* High speed Wi-Fi, computer desk, mini fridge.* Large comfortable bed and sofa; spacious shower, big shower head.* 42"" flat screen TV that you can very well see from both the bed and the sofa.What we liked:* 24 hours self checking kiosk. Saved us time especially at check-out at 5 AM. Watch-out there is an automatic charge for newspaper (you can ask the attendant to write it off). Of course you can still check in / out the old fashion way* Location, comfortable bed, modern furniture, very high-tech.* Starbucks on site. The hotels offers 24 hour ordering option (coffee, deli items, bakery, pizza). My problem was there was no one to MAKE the coffee at 5 AM.What we didn't like:* Limited dinning out options: a sports bar (where we got dinner, pretty good) and a Mexican restaurant, however it was closed that Saturday night.* We were ""blessed"" to have a teenagers group close to our room. They were loud for a while luckily it didn't last too long. We could have asked to change the room but decided not to. In the end it was OK.Bottom line I do recommend this hotel if you need quality lodging close to the airport.I travel for a living and staying in places like this always makes my stay away from home a little more tolerable. Most rooms come equipped with a large HD TV. mini fridge and big couch to put your feet up and relax. Get up early for the free breakfast and fresh coffee. The only downside is the variety of dinning choices in the area. The tex-mex cantina across the parking lot is all that is available.Rooms are large and spacious.First time at a Hyatt.  Loved it.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  They gave me a great suite far from the elevators and ice machine where I was not disturbed by noise other than an occasional muffled door slam.  The room was great and had the first actually good quality in-room coffee maker and coffee that I've encountered.  The single king-sized bed was comfortable with great pillows.  Huge flat panel TV swiveled so you could watch in the living room or on the bed.  The suite came with free wifi and connections to the TV for cam and laptop inputs, etc.  Plenty of hot water, modern fixtures and even a kitchenette with fridge and an office area.  The only thing missing was a closet with hangers, but you can make do with a chair back for hanging clothes over.Staff was great in helping me locate several restaurants and tourist attractions and went out of their way to make me feel welcome there.I'm adding this place to my short list of preferred hotels.It was perfect. The service was unreal for a hotel of this price. The rooms were great, everything was clean, and it was very quiet for an airport hotel. The bed slept fairly well (I am spoiled by a tempurpedic), and the business center had everything I needed, free of charge. Internet and parking were free. Starbucks 24/7!Warm and welcoming. Modern and very comfortable. Clean. Great bed. Big TV. Very nice staff. Will stay again.During a three night business trip to Charlotte, I stayed at the Hyatt Place by the Charlotte Airport. I recommend the stay. Everything was just fine... rooms and facilities were clean, the hotel was very convenient and, considering it's distance to the airport, it was quiet. Breakfast was good and so was the staff.

First experience at the Hyatt Place brand and was instantly impressed with the room appointments, decor and overall comfort. Perfect for business travelers or people needed something near the airport. There are few late night services in the area so have your food prior to arrival. The continental breakfast was better than most and there were always apples available in the lobby for a healthy snack.Was looking for something nicer than a Motel 6.  I saw this hotel on line with a good price and wanted to try it out.  Very nice room and great price.  Wifi actually has a strong signal and flat screen TV is great.  Check in was also easy.  There is a kiosk available for check in and check out, if front desk is busy.  I've been to many hotels around the world and this one is very nice for the price.The aesthetics of the hotel is great! Though if you are booking the meeting space you may think twice. After contracting for 10 plus dates for the year, plus staying at the hotel for the same amount of days and bringing revenue from attendees through rooms and lunch, the hotel canceled my last 2 meetings because a corporation wanted those dates, which would bring a higher revenue for the hotel. It is beyond poor business.",,,,"['great', 'customer', 'service', 'clean', 'new', 'bar', 'snack', 'bar', 'rooms', 'spacious', 'highly', 'recommend', 'nice', 'double', 'outlets', 'computer',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-by-marriott-charlotte-city-center-charlotte,Courtyard By Marriott Charlotte City Center,3.0,$$,38,"Staff is friendly, especially the nice young lady at the Bistro.  This hotel is loudLet me start with the positives - the staff and the location. You are close to everything and can walk a few blocks to get to resturants, the game, entertainment, etc. The Staff is wonderful - helpful, smiling, happy. The problems I have are 1) parking - conveniently located in the lot attached to the hotel yet no speficied hotel parking so you can spend 20 mins looking for a spot. 2) the room - was old, dated and needed an face-lift. Stains on the carpet, shower curtain that didn't fit and, worst of all, a bed that felt like 10,000 people had slept on it. Also, no cell coverage in the room - at all. This hotel might work for some, but I'm going to look for an alternative next time I'm in CLT.This is such a nice hotel &amp; the staff is so friendly &amp; helpful every time I stay here. The front desk staff is exceptionally nice to the frequent guests &amp; they really go out of their way to remember your name &amp; your special requests or needs that you've had in the past when you've stayed there. They really go the extra mile!!! 5 Stars were earned not just given!!!A terrible stay. The sheets were scratchy. The towels were crappy. The room was old. All the furniture was falling apart had scratches and doors were falling off. It was noisy even being on the 8th floor. The windows were Cloudy due to broken thermal seals, you could barely see out. Our ""black-out"" curtain wouldn't pull all the way closed due to broken hooks.  We paid a premium for this room because of the Monday night football game. The breakfast was only served until 10 which after a Monday night game should have been extended. The hotel touts themselves as the Official Hotel of the NFL, they certainly did not live up to the expectation. Except for a few balloons in the lobby it was not welcoming. No valet parking and the signage from the parking deck to the lobby was absent. The bar was slow pre-game and called last call well before we were finishing our celebration and well ahead of 100am.  I would never stay in this hotel again even if it was free!?Great location, right in the middle of all that is good in downtown Charlotte! I didn't actually stay at the hotel, I had a meeting there. The meeting rooms wee nice,Seats were very comfortable.When I was on one of my many trips to Charlotte to help my sister get her new house situated.  Low and behold we had issues with getting the water set up.  To make a long story short, we weren't going to spend the night in a house without any water, so we needed a place to stay.  Since it was the middle of the week and not the weekend, I was looking for something decent that was under $175 a night.  With AAA, I was able to score a room for $158 (before tax) a night.It was nice, because we got there around 10PM, and were able to get a room no problem (did NOT make reservations).  The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and got us situated immediately.  I liked the fact how there is 10 stories of parking, and then the hotel (which explains how/why the elevator ride was longer than expected).  We were on H1, the main floor.  They even had a pool (didn't bring the trunks though)!  Sis brought her son (6mos) and we asked for a crib. They brought it up immediately, and were very friendly.  We had 2 queen beds, a 30ish inch TV, and plenty of space. The room itself was immaculate, and I was impressed.  The bathroom was also very clean, but you could tell it was dated (compared to the sleeping area).All in all, I got plenty of sleep (but apparently I snored enough sis wanted to smother me- I told her thats what happens when my sinuses are dried!) and it was a great time.We didn't utilize any services/bar/fitness- but WiFi was included with the room.  We parked there- which was $10/night, and all you needed was your room key to get in and out.AAA rates this place 3diamond, and I give it 4 stars while being in that category (as I have unfortunately given 4diamond hotels a 2 star rating, if that makes sense).  So for the type of hotel this is and the location, it is def a great choice.  Good job Marriott!This hotel is perfectly located in the middle of all the action in Charlotte. Everything is walking distance and the area is extremely safe. The hotel was clean, modern, friendly, and there really are no complaints. There are 2 wifi services; one free and a high speed paid. The free one was more than sufficient for my iPad and using videos. I didn't drive so I can't speak to parking and I am the type who puts the 'do not disturb' sign on my door and don't use the cleaning service. I highly recommend this place and other than a minor billing issue that was resolved at checkout, I have no complaints.This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I stay at this hotel during The Taste of Charlotte and the location was perfect for the event. Too bad that was the only benefit. I was awaken Saturday and Monday morning at 8:00 am by a work crew banging on the roof. When I called to complain I was told they would send someone up. I didn't know if they ment to my room or the roof, but I do know they ment business because the banging was over in another hour and a half. I never heard from the management even when I expressed my displeasure and since my business was so unappreciated I won't stay there again.Way overpriced. Damn, it was 287 bucks for a tiny, non suite room, it made me sad. The staff was very professional and pretty, they made me a little happier. The parking and location was convenient, so I would really give this place 2.5 stars. I'll trying staying at the renaissance next time I think. It was around the same price for that same night! What ?!?It's so disappointing to write a negative hotel review, especially one that you had good expectations for and were looking forward to for a one night getaway. From the beginning... The hotel and the parking garage were easy to find, (note: once you park, you must leave the parking garage and enter hotel from street.) We didn't receive any greeting whatsoever when we arrived...and I mean when we walked to the front desk. It felt like we were interrupting the conversation going on between staff. It didn't really bother us until after our minute long check in. The lady (who I noticed was wearing a manager tag) didn't look up at us once. But we had our keys and were up to our room. Apparently although the courtyard has an excellent location in downtown Charlotte, it only has a few floors. We were on the third. Room was dated, but still thematically ""Courtyard."" Unfortunately, a lot of small details made the place seem dirty and cheap. A few examples: no soap, trash or towels in the bathroom. There were a few in the sink area outside of the bathroom but just one soap so we had to move/share between the two areas. It's worth noting they also may want to consider getting soap holders for the sink area. (and yes there's still carpet in this area...) You have to leave the wet soap bar on the edge of the counter. There are no plugs to charge your phone by the night stands. The hotel information book was sticky/water smudged and we couldn't read half of it. The tv was so slow, no channel guide whatsoever and forget about an e-folio or menu. It left a lot to be desired and was far short of the average yet clean/efficient standard Courtyards Hotels stand for. I spoke to another overnight employee during our stay at one point and she was equally cold, unhelpful and made me so ready to get out of this hotel. 0 stars for service. I didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant but the staff seemed really nice and like mentioned earlier, location of this hotel is fantastic. I literally couldn't think of any other reason for staying here when there are so many other great ones in the area.This hotel is just meh.  Nothing to write home about except for the fabulous location.  Didn't do anything more than sleep there, so I can't comment on the bistro or anything else.  A good place to stay if you can get a great rate.I stayed here in April 2013 while attending a convention at the Convention center. PROs:--Great location. Many good restaurants and shops nearby. Easy walk to the convention center.--My room with a king size bed was comfortable and spacious.--Staff, with one notable exception, were friendly, helpful, and efficient. The notable exception was a young man who worked the morning shift. He seemed to not really enjoy being there, and customers were a bother to him.--You can get room service from a couple of great restaurants nearby. I tried a meal from Mimosa, which was wonderful, and from Ruth's Chris steakhouse, which was  just okay.--Wireless was free, and connections were not a problem.Apparently, Marriott must have read the previous reviews and make some improvements.--Starbucks downstairsCONS--Would have been nice to have a restaurant and/or in-house room service for breakfast. They do have a breakfast bistro, but I felt like it was drive-in type food for  four-star hotel prices. Also a bar or lounge or ore options for a late night snack or drink.The Courtyard chain typically is above average and this one WOULD except that as a businessman their internet connection is horrible.   For two days I could not get online with their wireless.    Other than that this is a fine hotel and well run.Pretty nice hotel.  Good location downtown.  Not much to say about it, if you have stayed at a Courtyard before it will meet expectations.  I remember the bartender being incredibly slow when I was there.  And there is a good breakfast place close by on 3rd St.Stayed here several times, logging in more than 50 nights with the Marriott per year. What good can I say about this somewhat dated 1970's style Marrriott? Full service for sure, rooms nothing special. Ok accommodation. Club concierge lounge, tired, intrusive host, tired food and scene altogether. A Hooter's across the street. Convention center next door. A ""mafia"" town car operation with kickbacks to the front desk staff. Not possible to get a regular taxi, instead the private town cars and SUVs charging twice the taxi rate. You have to insist at the front desk to have them call a taxi, who by the way is not allowed to park at the hotel property. Annoying. Does not always honor corporate rates. I would stay at the Ritz Carlton if I could. A fresh breath of air in Charlotte.I stay here often for work trips, and it's in a great location. The front desk is extremely friendly and helpful. I would normally rate this place with a 4.Not this time.This review is for an issue I have with housekeeping. I recently traveled to Charlotte, and left two items in my room: an umbrella That I didn't want and a pair of glass, which I do still want.I called the hotel, and got back a message that the housekeeping manager looked in the room and didn't see them. Nor did anyone turn in anything from lost and found. This, she assumed, would close the issue. I called back and asked if she had checked the bathroom sink, which is where I left them and which is the same color as my eyeglass case. She hadn't, but said that the housekeeping staff would have checked there, and since no one had turned them in, the items obviously we're not there.I intentionally left my umbrella in the room, because I didn't want it. So i asked if anyone had turned that in...she said no, that no one had turned anything in from my room. she said that if the housekeeper had found the umbrella, it could still be on the housekeeper's cart. So I asked if she would look on the cart for the glasses, and she said no one had turned them in...it went on and on and on. I also asked to speak with the hotel manager, of course, and the guy said he couldn't do anything. Basically, it's obvious the housekeeping manager was not interested in helping me, or really looking into it. She just kept repeating that no one would take my glasses. But really, I just think they're on a cart somewhere. And, in the meantime, I'm  out a $1200 pair of glasses that I had just bought. What also sucks, is that I left a pretty nice tip, too. Yeah, thanks for nothing.Moral: don't leave anything in your room. Don't forget anything, ever. Because you'll never get it back.I will never stay here again.Courtyard Marriott is fantastic choice in terms of location &amp; convenience Traveling for work brings me to Charlotte &amp; this Marriott is literally right across the street from my office Comfy bed w/ good pillows - score! Quiet!! Couldn't hear neighbors Bathroom was big &amp; shower rocked! FREE Wifi! LOTS of restaurants close by to take care of any &amp; all cravings No fridge.... :-(( And through no fault of their own, it doesn't directly connect to the overground tunnels that connect all the other buildings in Uptown ... you gotta go all the way downstairs &amp; then over to the Parking Garage to gain access But with the office right across the street, I *guess* I can make the sacrifice &amp; walk outdoors. Lots of love for Courtyard!Great Hotel. Amazing Staff. Clean Rooms. Comfortable Beds. Great Cafe. What more can you say...overall a great experience! I do have to elaborate on how great the cafe inside the hotel is. Normally most hotel cafes are average - I typically don't like to get food from them, however when in a rush to grab a quick breakfast before my show on Wednesday, I stopped and got the healthy breakfast sandwich. It was AMAZING. I would have gotten it again the second day if I didn't run out of time getting ready. I don't know how their lunch/dinner is - but I do highly recommend getting their breakfast. Good tasting food and not overly expensive.Was here for four nights and thought it was a pleasant stay. The front desk may not be the most professional but that is OK. The hotel seems pretty new and has a starbucks in the lobby which is very convenient. It is a great location, right next to a bunch of great restaurants.  Beds were comfy and the room was pretty clean except for one or two minor stains on the carpet. The gym was small but had a plenty of equipment. I would definitely stay here again if my first choice hotel was not available.The staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The breakfast is meh, but that's not the problem. I'm guessing their HVAC intake unit is next to restaurants' exhaust, because the place reeks of frying oil. Also walls are paper thin. Otherwise, the location is great. Wish they would look into this smell issue.","Purpose: for work, stayed here frequently (20+ nights)Pros:- Front-desk staff: extremely friendly and professional. - Location: good location, walking distance to all the places I need to go to.- Security: requires key card to use elevator.- Wifi: free for everyone and decent speed. - Price: always pretty competitive Cons:- Hotel/Rooms: for my first couple of stays, there was always this strange smell that lurked the hallways. Also, the rooms have very noisy AC/Heaters. - Restaurant: highly do not recommend this due to lack of quality and service. Quality: tastes like a bunch of things tossed together and stuck into the oven... not really much thought in taste/presentation. Service: took 30+ minutes for 1 servicing of dumplings... Also, I always get ignored when I try to get their attention to order. There was only 1 lady who actually gave some quality service (though food was still lacking). - No concierge lounge or free breakfast [for rewards members - generally we're given breakfast vouchers or something...]- Key Cards: seem to never work on their first try at the elevator...Overall: I only stay at this hotel when Marriott City Center and Hilton City Center are sold out... The cons I've noted had the most impact on my stays at this hotel, which is why I've rated them 2 stars.This was a really decent hotel in the heart of Charlotte. It was in walking distance to everything downtown. If you stay at the hotel, parking is only $10/day. I thought that price was pretty good knowing that I've paid $28 in the past. The room was very clean. The only thing that threw me off was the fact that I've slept in more comfortable beds when staying in Marriott Hotels. Anyways, this is a good place to stay if you get a good deal on the room.No free WiFi even for Rewards members at my level. Parking is difficult to access, dark, cramped and expensive. Room is decent, but VERY used. My room on the 10 th floor had a chair with frayed fabric that had seen better days?Classic business traveler hotel. Has seen better days, although I must say thatIs is in a good,  location however.I will go back to the Hyatt, City Center again next time. Cool, loft like feel and vibe, plus much easier to get in and out of. Where the hip traveller stays. Marriott feels like a formula ( that needs an update )i paid   $ 160 for this room and the bed was awful!!  i will never stay at this hotel again and honestly cannot recommend it to anyone the beds are awful , hard and will hurt your back!! cant sleep on it.I absolutely LOVED the Courtyard Marriott, perfect location, service, and room amenities. The parking garages above the building is a fantastic idea. I love that they connect so that you don't have to wheel your stuff all over the place. The overall place just feels warm, cozy, and safe. Nothing like Cleveland. Although it was pricey, (about $200) it was absolutely worth our king room. The bathroom was a good size, our bed was very comfortable, and the huge flat screen was awesome. Now location: You are literally right in the middle of EVERYTHING! The mimosa restaurant is about 30 ft away, so are lots of tourist-y things too. I loved being right in the heart of downtown Charlotte. It was really a sight I won't ever forget!I checked in here for 3 nights. The location is great...right in the center of downtown. The hotel is not your typical suburban courtyard. It has a fantastic updated lobby allowing people to eat, check email, watch the large flat screen and just mingle! Great social feel! The hotel is about 2 blocks from the light rail and convention center. 4 blocks from the arena and NASCAR; and 6 blocks from the stadium. The gym is sufficient, and there is a coin laundry facility. The internal courtyard (10 stories up) contains a pool.Downs: I did have a security issue my last night. I was awakened at about 1:00 am by a man banging on the door. He had the wrong room but was clearly too drunk to understand. When I refused to answer he banked harder and eventually started breaking property. I called the lobby and they said they would take care of it. I never heard any security, nor did i receive a call back from the desk. The next morning there was a shattered coffee mug outside my door. The desk never seemed to hrasp how freightening the whole affair was. This needs to be addressed. Definitely a great hotel that offers far more than expected!!No complimentary breakfast - very expensive ""Bistro.""  And there seemed to be few breakfast areas in the surrounding blocks.  Noisy with the AC units running outside, but the curtains kept the lights out, which was great.  Pool was tiny, and shallow - only 4'6"" deep, I think.  Bigger fitness facility - one weight machine, along with cardio machines.  Bathroom showed some use - water stains in corners and joints of bathtub/shower.We stayed for a Panthers game &amp; were pleased.  Great location. Could walk everywhere &amp; were able to leave the car until after the game at no extra charge.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was comfy and clean.Great Staff +  Great Location = Great FUN! I stayed at this location  twice once to go to a Carolina Panthers game and recently while helping a friend move to Uptown Charlotte. All I can say is WOW. From this time from the last , this Courtyard has had renovations. Flat screens, wireless internet, new decor, totally new. This hotel is very clean. Rooms are a really nice size.  We had a ball here. They have a really cute bar too.Nice and modern. Bed and pillows could've been more comfortable. Room had a let out couch, which we didn't need but nice to have. Free wi-fi, $10 parking. Overall it was a good stay.,A step down from most courtyards.  The overall hotel - lobby area and hallways - absolutely reeked of stale frying oil.  If you keep your fan on then the smell isn't in the room.  But the fan/air conditioner is pretty noisy.  The walls were paper thin.  I was awakened by the cell-phone alarm of the person in the next room.  The next night I heard more than I really wanted to of a conversation between the woman staying in the room next door and her husband at home.  The room itself was clean and comfortable, but the overall experience was not good.Was just in Charlotte to visit my sister and stayed here with the hubby. It is nice. The lobby is hidden in the main level below a 11 story parking garage and then the four actual floors of the hotel are above that. They have an outdoor roof top pool with plenty of tables and chairs. It gets some sun but can be hidden at times as three sides of the pool are surrounded by the four floors of rooms. With that said it can be chilly (not a heated pool) but granted we were here in may......thought there was a hot tub but no such luck......nice workout room with tv's on each machine. Also has a guest laundry. THe room we had was nice. Comfy. Pillows were way to soft for my taste. But nice firm mattress. we had a room that was level with the pool which was nice and didn't really hear any noise from guests out there. Nice location for the downtown area (well I guess they call it uptown). Lots of restaurants and if you are in the area doing business a great spot. not much going on weekend wise in May (other than JWU graduation this weekend). would stay here again for the price and location if I ever find myself there again.Great location.  Easy walk to ""center"" of town (2 blocks).  Plenty of places to eat near-by.Rooms are typical Courtyard fare, but the difference here is that it is located in an office tower.  Lobby is separated nicely on the ground floor with the guest rooms (4 floors worth) starting on about the 10th floor.  I was fortunate enough to be on the top floor with great views North.Free internet and a very nice breakfast service make it a great choice....I just can't pay $15 for internet access when hotels that are just as nice are offering it for free...at a cheaper rate!!...and sometimes with free breakfast!!this was a really nice hotel and located in the thick of things in charlotte.  of course, it was made even better by the fact that it seems kt m. can stay at any marriott for free:).  convenient parking garage, clean rooms, good coffee.  what more could you want in a hotel you stay in for a quick one night stay?  nada.  not the restaurant.  nada as in ""nothing.""  nevermind.The hotel was nice and clean, the staff was courteous and it is in a great location but for the cost of $500 for 2 nights I was quite disappointed.  There was no lounge (however they were in the process of remodeling during my stay), the pillows were less than great (so I suggest you bring your own), there was no fridge or microwave in the room and the bathroom was rather small.  Look around before you book and good luck!Good location-- there are enough dining places within walking distance.Nice lobby. Rooms are big and clean. Bathroom a little tight.Free Internet access.Disappointed from the moment I walked in.Lazy staff makes you consider how Marriott can lend its name to such a place.   Check in staff spoke so quietly and had little interest in speaking up, I had to ask questions multiple times. I checked in at 11pm...After traveling, I shouldn't feel more awake than the hotel staff. At 7:35am I wake up to pounding on my door and the door opening. I slam it shut out of reflex. Whoever it was didn't announce who they were. I tried to call down to the front desk - the phone didn't work.  When I questioned the concierge they said it was too early for the maid and knew nothing about it. I had my room changed. As I'm walking to change rooms I see the maid knocking and entering rooms with no announcement. People were not happy.  When I told the concierge this, he rolled his eyes and said, yea I believe it.  When I returned to my room after a long day, the only thing the maid did was make my bed. Towels weren't replaced or even rehung! The trash was still in the trash can, sink wasn't cleaned, and wash cloths weren't replaced or even folded!!  The price is too high for this service and Marriott name association. There are many hotels in this area, don't choose this one!This hotel was on top of a garage and the hotel makes a U and in the middle of the U you have the pool. It has a small gym which as nice.",,,,"['staff', 'friendly', 'especially', 'nice', 'young', 'lady', 'bistro', 'hotel', 'start', 'positives', 'staff', 'location', 'close', 'everything', 'walk',

Quite a few restaurants to choose from that are easily walkable. The bartender Jeff remembers everyone!  I was here just once before and he remembered me. Such a nice feeling in the road to be so welcome.1 star off for dirty room - bed was full of hair! Yuck. We had to change rooms. Even our 2nd room had lots of hair on the floor and towels in the washroom. As we arrived around midnight, we were too tired to call and ask clean towels (luckily I always travel with my own towel and pillow!)1 star off for breakfast at the Concierge Lounge. One of the smallest selections, even Residence Inn hotel have bigger selection. They had scrambled eggs that I didn't like (really hard and strange), sausage (that I don't eat) and white bagels (no whole grain). No potatoes or veggies. I chose berries and strange porridge that tasted like some grains, not sure if it was even oatmeal.Other than that the room was nice, great location and friendly staff. Right next to the famous mall.It was a very interesting experience at this hotel. My wife and I arrived very late and were given a room that had dirty bed. We asked for another room as it looked like the bed sheets were not completely washed, had lots of hair under the covers. The girl at the reception was very nice and apologized. Our second room had similar problem - the floor in the washrooms was dirty and the towels too.The breakfast was very basic, only few items to choose from. Little disappointed here again.However, over all the hotel looks really nice, they have tiny gym and tiny outside pool. Right next to the shops and free parking.Reserved a room with option for king or two queens. Arrived early at 11 AM and was told no rooms with two queens available. Apparently others had booked all the doubles. I could understand this had there been an option on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMarriot.com&amp;s=b1db2d5045659e334c90c16a63ac1146bef6a60dbd2c9b65f1c49730ffd70753"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Marriot.com</a> to do just that but there is not. So, as a gold member, I got to sleep on a roll away bed. Apparently you have to call the hotel to get two beds. What a pain!  Nobody got time for that!What a lovely experience while traveling on business! Bimonthly stays on concierge level, what wonderful service in concierge and tasty breakfast and dessert. Complimentary wine and sweet treats in lobby a welcome amenity arriving after long day at office. Rooms are clean, well fitted for business travel with abundant toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, shower cap and even separate hand wash). Offer to opt out of housekeeping for bonus Marriott points is excellent, especially for just a two night stay. Excellent location in lovely South Park neighborhood with decadent shopping center just steps from door. Valet even accompanied me within walking distance from hotel with umbrella during a downpour.Great service at check-in.  Spacious clean room.  Fun pool.  Great poolside f&amp;b service.  We really enjoyed our stay, and we will definitely come back when traveling to Charlotte.  Added perks... Wine at check-in and complimentary Starbucks in the lobby in the AM.We are loyal Marriott customers and were disappointed. Letters to management went unreturned.Not the Marriott I knew. Rollaway bed was not made up. We found this out at 11.00 pm and had to call to find out there was a shortage of bedding.Loud, disruptive behavior in the halls after 11pm. Calls to front desk did not stop the noise.Clearly, a security guard is needed during sporting events. We felt unsafe and uncared for at this property.I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past few years. The location is very convenient, the mall is a short drive over and there are a lot of really good restaurants nearby. One thing that I have noticed is their cleanliness, it is certainly one of the cleanest Marriotts that I have stayed at. The service both friendly and attentive. The only thing I do not like about this hotel is the renovations that they recently did to their dining area. I hate the way they remodeled because it just feels like an awkward layout. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel if you are going to be in the Charlotte area anytime soon.It's in a strange location next to a coke corporate building.  But it is near tons of shopping.  Plenty of self parking.  The room has nice touches such as padded hangers and lighted closet.  Amenity extras include bathrobe,toothbrush and toothpaste kit, and mouthwash.  Bed had really soft linens and excellent down Duvet.  Air con is not next to desk for more pleasant set up.  The defunct Minibar in room can use as fridge.  Comfortable stay.Exceptional customer service! Front desk goes above and beyond!  Hotel is in walking distance to fine dining and shopping. Hotel rooms are clean.  The cons: No free breakfast, and wifi is only in common areas. I would stay here again.I am a big fan of Marriott and this one did not disappoint.  The concierge lounge was nice as usual.  The room was in good order and clean and relatively new.  I used to live in Charlotte so this is new for me staying here.  This hotel is convenient to many restaurants in the SouthPark area.Ok, some updates throughout. Overpriced considering condition of hotel and compared to other places.spending the night here in Charlotte.  Great lobby bar and nice rooms,  Not close to downtown, but a 15 minute drive away.I'd stay here again.I was in Charlotte on a business trip with my boyfriend, and his company put him in this Marriott.  Overall, it was a good stay.  The room was clean, housekeeping service was good, nice location (across the street from SouthPark Mall), and fantastic staff.  We had free wifi and free breakfast using my Marriott Club card.  Will stay here again if coming to Charlotte.Solid by Marriott standards.  Concierge loung was open for breakfast on weekends.  Fitness ctr good.  Walkable to south park mall and restaurants.Marriotts generally seem to be awesome on the surface, but lose their luster the closer you look (no free internet. no in-room coffee maker?!). I still had a good experience, though, in the short time I stayed here. Plenty of parking, and a friendly front-desk, made for a nice welcome after an annoying drive. My room was clean, very spacious, and I love the varying-density pillows on the bed. Bath &amp; Body Works in the bathroom. Restaurant is open til midnight, which is convenient; though I didn't have a chance to check it out. Elevator was reasonably quick. And the decor -- heavy curtains, red and gilt accents -- feels ritzy. Very convenient to SouthPark, and you could even walk to most of the shopping if you wanted to!Very nice Marriott, room amenities very good.  Unfortunately I was not happy with finding feather pillows when I had requested foam.  The did manage to find some.  I got the impression they were not well staffed as the gentleman who brought room service looked like a manager and said he was helping out.  And when sitting outside the bar, the poor bartender had to run back/forth instead of them having a dedicated server.  I hope that changes as the weather starts staying nice.  I liked that water bottles in the room were free YAY.  Will definitely stay again!Great location.. Staff was super friendly.. Didnt have time to explore but everything we encountered was excellent.. Bed is extra cozy.Very nice hotel. Excellent service.  Caters well to business traveller. Good location near the upscale Southpark Mall.  Lots of good restaurants nearby for variety.  And i did have an in- room coffee maker.Extremely friendly staff, excellent customer service. The hotel is right next to the mall so close to lots of great shopping and amazing restaurants. Great location! Clean, upscale rooms, 32in flat screen TVs, granite countertops in bathrooms. And I don't mean to be girly, but in the bathrooms there is a 7x magnifying mirror with an LED light...perfect for plucking your eyebrows! YAY!","My impressions:Where IS this place?!  So glad to have GPS navigation.Seriously? It's located in a Coca Cola headquarters parking lot?  Valet parking? Ridiculous.  There's a gob of close-in parking.This lobby ... don't tell me ... the decorator was inspired by the traditional red-velvet draped brothels of yore, yes?Wow, the staff at the front desk are great - friendly and helpful!Oooohh - a compact expanse of hardwood flooring just inside the door to my room.  I love it!  Why do I like this so much?The light in the closet - such a simple thing, such a luxury.This in-every-room drink chiller isn't as cold or capacious as a standard mini-fridge, but it's an acceptable substitute.  I can use it.  (Nice, seeing as how the Marriott ran out of portable refrigerators to lend to guests.)Odd curved bar suspending the shower curtain.  I'm not feeling it. The room is comfortable, and the lounge chair by the bed is a favorite.Fitness center, check. Thanks for the public-access internet-equipped computer in the lobby - especially since I'm not interested in paying the daily fee for internet access.The bar downstairs may not always be optimally stocked with in-demand spirits, but it's a favorite of at least some visiting professionals and academics who enjoy a well-lubricated, late evening congress.Mental note:  a large mall with upscale big-box anchor stores is very close.No shuttle to the airport?  Sigh.Marriott in a business park.  Hard to find..not thrilled with the location.  Interior was up to par.  Nice accomindations.  Pillows sucked.  Seriously...hard, too big, could not sleep.No free Wifi..give me a break.  I have never had to pay for computer access at other hotels.  Why here? Exterior is very misleading.  Drab.  Valet parking is a joke.  Had better at the hotels at Hartsfield Airport.Would not stay there again.  Friendly staff must of been off for the evening.  Got an excellent rate so for the price...it  was acceptable.  For the area,  could not comprehend the lackings.Very nice and clean!! They have an excellent bar and the beds in the rooms are very comfortable.  There was a wedding going on too and it looked like they had a separate area just for the wedding. The people who works the front are not as nice as they should be.  Kind of short with their words and not very hospitable.I've only stayed here once, however, I was extremely pleased with the whole experience.  The hotel itself is very extremely clean, shiny, and new, and the staff were quite pleasant, though formal.The hotel is in great walking distance to Southpark mall and restaurants and has an outdoor pool with a nice outdoor seating area.  I ate the breakfast buffet at their onsite restaurant and was pretty impressed --it had a wonderful variety of foods.If you're looking for a place that is slightly cheaper, and more kid-friendly, I'd look at the Renaissance across the street; however, if you don't have children and want something a bit more formal, this is a great spot.Typical Marriott experience.  Personable staff and it was GREAT to be next to high-end shopping area.  The hotel decor was a bit dated...Upon Check-In I was advised that they had to over book (it was about midnight) and they had made arrangements for a suite at the Renaissance around the corner.  However, I would have to come back after the first night for the rest of my stay.  Both hotel's were great about the transfer, but I would have given a higher rating, had they not shuffled me around a bit.This was The Park Hotel before it was The Marriott, I have stayed there under both brands. Very nice. Good location. Great meeting spaces, and food and banquet services are excellent for meetings. The rooms are large and comfortable and they offer all the usual ammenities. The restaurant that they have in the hotel, forget the name, is very nice and the lounge offers live music and comfortable seating. It is adjacent to Manzetti's as well, so a lot of people dine there when staying at The Marriot. Please note if you stay there, Toscana Italian Grill is located steps away in the same plaza and is delightful!Yeah for mediocrity! This is your average Marriott hotel; there is nothing wrong, but nothing just right with the Marriott SP. Quite frankly, it's just another nondescript hotel for a comfortable night's rest during business travel.From a business travel perspective, this hotel is in a  great location. They also have a very nice pool, steam and jacuzzi. Above average workout area with lots of equipment and free weights. Food service is very good overall. But you can walk out the back to three really good restaurants. A large mall with additional restaurants is within walking distance.. I find the hotel to be quiet and comfortable. The staff is friendly and accomodating.  Pros; location, comfortable, amenities. Cons; Can be hard to get a reservation, so plan ahead, rates have gone up considerably (to pay for the renovation of course), overpriced breakfast buffet.The location is great. Near great mall and awesome restaurants. I have stayed here 4x now and it's the only place I will stay. The rates can be pricey.If you're ever in Charlotte, NC the Charlotte Marriott South Park is the place to stay.. The rooms are super plush for the low price. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable, the audio system was impressive, and all the amenities were fantastic.. The next morning we had breakfast in the downstairs dining room. It took the waitress about 30 minutes to take our order. Now I would normally deduct a star for this type of behavior but I don't want to take away from the decadence of the room. The food was pretty good so can't knock it too much .Thank you Marriot for the 5 star experience.Dont let the older building design fool you.  The rooms are up to date and have all the small things that make a hotel a superior stay.This is a great hotel for the price and the location.  Comfortable, aesthetically appealing rooms featuring LCD TVs and one of those clock radios that can play songs from iPod Nano.  Right across the street from the South Park mall if you like to shop.  We did have to ask three times before we got all the perks we paid for (a South Park mall gift card and vouchers for breakfast).  4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up today.",,,,"['fantastic', 'hotel',

The staff was super pleasant and exited about the holiday.  And the lobby was gorgeous and very festive.  The front desk was great about helping us get sone different things that we needed.  The parking was a bit high but in uptown Charlotte that is what you will find at many of the places.  The valet was only 5 bucks more so I just opted for that.  I would definitely stay here again!I don't expect much from hotels but these guys missed out on the basics. Check in was smooth but parking is $20/night. The room was clean and the view was awesome but the heat didn't work so sleeping next to a giant window was not great. I thought it would take a while to warm up but it didn't move past 65. I woke up chilly and went to the coffeemaker but all they had was decaf. So, I decided to go warm up at the gym. They have an indoor pool but there was no water in it when I was there. I stopped by the desk to get some regular coffee but when I got back to my room I noticed the two I got were also both decaf. Palm to forehead...Wow.   If this were a Motel 6, it would've received a ""two star"".  I'm not a complainer, but this is disappointing - to say the least.No heater the first night. Worse, they didn't say the boiler was out until the next morning when I asked what I was doing wrong to not have heat.Toilet paper rack fell off the wallNon-functioning Ice machine.Debris on the veranda falling off of the building next door.Not even considering the cost/quality ration, including the absurd $20/night for the car, I was sorely disappointed and won't stay here again.This hotel was fair. Definitely not what I expected. I know what this hotel used to be before the Sheraton got here, so the newness and renovations of the Sheraton were nice to see.Parking, $20/day to self park. Not too fond of that. Parking is less expensive some places in the middle of downtown. The parking garage was ""ok"" but I believe it is shared with the hotel right next door, Le Meridien. Once you park, you somewhat have a ways to walk to the Sheraton's front desk. Guest services associates were really nice, friendly, helpful, check in was no problem.The room... You have to take a card out of a white box on the wall and then insert your room key in order to have power in the room. Not quite sure what the purpose of this feature was, but I figured it was to save power maybe? I really don't know. It was confusing trying to figure out what to do, even after given instructions. Outside of the window, I saw nothing except the building next to the Sheraton (Le Meridien), so don't expect a good view from one side of the hotel. The walls are paper thin too. If you're expecting to get a peaceful, good night's sleep, pray the hotel doesn't have many people. My room was on the corner, but I heard people in both rooms next door and I heard people in the hallway. ALL NIGHT. Which was extremely inconvenient and unfortunate.I'm not sure I would want to stay here again. It isn't too-too bad but still...Sheratons are usually pretty good. This one has lots of conference spaces which fortunately was not being used during my stay. Very upscale lobby area. Friendly staff, I was greeted every time I came and went thru the lobby.There was a mini store as well. More of a selection of travel necessities than a store.There was also a pool and restaurant/bar.I don't like hotels, but I don't have friends in every city. I stayed here for a conference. Getting into the hotel parking lot is not that easy. Also, the parking for the hotel is costly and there is no garage. That's always annoying. The hotel was recently renovated. It's connected with the Le Meridian via the lobby. Overall, the rooms were hotel standard clean. Plenty of elevators. They have a nice bar and restaurant inside. The rooms were spacious too. Staff was nice and very accommodating. All of the meeting spaces were nice. The event staff for our conference gala were very nice. I'd possibly stay again. The hotel is very close to Uptown Charlotte and a few shopping venues and restaurants.This is a hard review....For the front desk I had Wayne.  Solid 5star rating.Room solid 4 starEvent space and event management 2 stars.The air walls are useless they are so thin and do not close tightly.  Event staff  just OK.   Oh.... No heat and the AC blowing so hard that out guest were wearing coats.  Some hotel employees even had on hoodies.Harold in the back of the house is 10 stars.  He kept the restrooms and lobby awesome.  He loved his job and it shows.The rooms have been updated nicely. Two restaurants/bars to choose from. They keep the temperature on the chilly side, but I would definitely stay here again.The Decour is weird there is no shower curtains they use half glass door so water goes all over the floor. The maid service was terrible. They came at the most odd hours. They charged guests for parking. Basically I would never stay here again.Not sure what all the complaints were as out. I never encountered anything negative during my Sheraton experience. Staff (especially Ms. Renee) was VERY accommodating and friendly. Rooms were huge and very clean. The only reason why I didn't rate 5 stars were due to breakfast. The food is kind of horrible, so I'd maybe work on that.Hotel itself was okay. The room was clean and when I needed assistance with charging station in desk, they corrected it right away. The bathroom was a little small and the bathtub had this awkward halfway partition of glass requiring one to lean in to turn on and adjust water settings and it still let a lot of water get on the floor.I'd avoid the hotel's restaurant as it's pricey and slow.Wouldn't do it again- really friendly service,  but not quite my style. They have great conference space,  but it was tremendously expensive and the food was somewhat underwhelming.  The decor is trying very hard to be modern, yet somehow ended up stuck in the 70s. Again,  lovely staff, not great venue.I must add that when I advised the mgt of the situation they comped one night for me and provided transportation to airportCame here for a convention that I've been working for three years. Larry from catering for the Sheraton stopped my girlfriend ""trash"" because of her tattoos. He actually stood there waiting. Tapped her on the shoulder to make a rude comment. Completely uncalled for. Upon complaining to the manager Brittany she claimed she would handle it and call us. I have yet to receive a call. Shame on you. We will be furthering this with corporate. Awful awful awful. Don't stay here.This hotel has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced! I was looking forward to lounging by the pool all day, but when I get here they have closed off the pool due to a private party. No one mentioned that the pool would be closed when I booked the room and was told upon check-in that the pool was open. I will never stay here again and wish I could leave. None of the customer service reps offered to help or even try to make my stay more pleasurable. Extremely disappointed!We came here for a conference, the water is BROWN And it smells like chlorine....that frightens me, the bathroom is tiny, no fridge or microwave, no breakfast unless you want to pay for it. The parking lot is ridiculous... You need a code to get into the gate and then you have to lug your things through a rocky lot. Room service charges a 22% gratuity charge plus a $5 charge and there is still a line for tip on the slip. Our room was dirty upon arrival, it seemed as if someone came in, had a shower and left bobby pins and wet rags - so gross! When I called the front desk they told me housekeeping must not have done a good job and offered more towels...blah. I cannot believe we paid so much money to stay here, extremely disappointed.Stayed July 12-13 for JT concert , there's also a Sorority conference . What an awful hotel , definitely not worth $205 for one night .1. Leaking room at 325 , water coming from 4th floor and looked like it's been there a long time 2. Poor elevator service . 4 elevators and only one working . I used the stairs 90% of the time coz of the lonngggg wait 3. No security bar on door 4. Noisy AC5. Horrible food at the bar / restaurant .6. If cost was $75 per night , this is at best a 3 star but at $205.... This is at best a 1 star hotel .Stay Away from this hotel !!!!!!If you are looking to start your day with a cold shower (in a super small bathroom) and a dark room, this is the place to stay. The staff actually was very nice, the property is just a total disappointment.What can I say... First, you're charged somewhere around $150/night and then an additional $25 for parking. Second, they're undergoing renovations/construction. Fine, whatever. The lobby looks nice. They warn you the elevators might be slow. Slow is fine. Slow is workable. What isn't acceptable is the elevator trapping you and having to pry the doors open.  What isn't acceptable is when the elevators stop working on a Sunday morning for over 4.5 hours. What isn't acceptable is the front desk's solution to the elevator problem: 1. ""free late check out""; 2. not even attempting to remedy the situation by offering free parking or free breakfast; 3. walking down double-number flights of stairs without an offer to assist with luggage only to be greeted at the bottom by ""we hope you enjoyed your stay, come back and see us again.""Oh, and it's 2014. There's no reason in the world we should be paying for wifi. Nope. Nope. Nope. Ballroom facilities were nice though. Pillows were amazing!This review is only for the wonderful valet staff at teh Sheraton. I did not stay at the Sheraton. I am a vendor that was working the CBJ Women in Business event. I have  worked events at the Sheraton before, but the customer service I received from Zack, Alex, and Tom was so awesome! Without even asking, these 3 gladly unloaded our van and wheeled in our equipment. They didnt even ask, they just took care of us. On the way out, we received the same service AND they even opened the car doors for us. They were funny, kind, and warm. Both myself and my partner drove away talking about how rare that service was and how nice it was to be treated so great. Thank you guys for making 2 woman smile so unexpectedly.","Get excited... There is now an authentic Medieval Hotel in Downtown Charlotte!  I stayed at the Charlotte Sheraton on a business trip for two days and it was the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the work week. No cell reception? Check. Wifi that doesn't work due to rain? Check. Rooms with thatched walls? Check. They even went through the expense of putting holes in the walls in the lobby and dropping pieces of roof on you as you walk in for that real Yugoslavian tenement feel. But wait! There's more! You get to have dinner in a room with no heating or air conditioning! Only downside was the hour and twenty minute wait for a pulled pork sandwich. It is locally rumored however they slaughter live pigs in the kitchen so I guess I can excuse the wait. Best $149 a night medieval experience in the South East!Just to give a little background, I've been a business traveler and an SPG members for at least 4 years now. To be transparent and direct this hotel experience undoubtedly goes down in my Top 3 worst business trip experiences ever. The hotel was under renovation, which set the tone for what the rest of the hotel experience was going to be like. Personnel - First off, to be fair I think the personnel that worked there were as nice as they could be given the conditions (maybe even more than I would have been), as they almost always have been at Westin, though I could only imagine they must dislike working there as much as I disliked staying there. The only issue with hotel personnel I had was not being verbally told that my the self-parking option would cost me $20, which I assumed was free since I didn't opt for the valet option. After checking-in I was handed the yellow parking slip to keep in my dashboard and I noticed the hotel counter person wrote down ""$20"" on my carbon copy of the parking slip, which upset me since I expected it was free (I wasn't told otherwise). Also, the morning of checkout there wasn't an invoice slipped under my room door, which usually happens in at least 90% of my hotel stays, so I couldn't verify whether I was really charged for the hotel parking or not. I'll have to call the hotel back to review that invoice.Elevators - After checking in I began heading toward the room. The elevator buttons and indicator lights for each elevator (the ones that tell you which elevator is available) looked very old, like they were from the 1980s. All 4 elevator indicator lights had their coverings missing, which exposed the light bulbs and internal wiring, along with everything else that was inside the sheet rock. While the elevator buttons were convenient in that it only took a slight touch to select the right floor, I felt the urge to wash my hands after touching them because they looked so worn and there was no telling what might have touched them before. Regardless, I decided to keep my booking only because I was staying here 1 night, otherwise there's no way I would have stayed longer than that. Sheraton - As an SPG member of several years, after staying at this Sheraton (and a Sheraton Suites in another state) I will never stay in a Sheraton ever again. I typically target at least Westin/Aloft hotels if not better, but those hotels (in the same area) were both sold out for the night I was staying. From my Sheraton experience, Sheraton as a brand is the furthest thing from what a hotel experience should be, Westin is the bare minimum of what it should be. Hotel room 1- In the hotel room the very first bad experience happened even before I got inside the room. After arriving at the door of Room 302 the door wasn't fully closed because the door frame was preventing the door from closing all the way. Therefore the hotel room was unlocked and opened with a simple push upon the very first arrival. After entering and making sure the coast was clear in the room, I wanted to see if I could do anything about the door being stuck. A very hard kick of the door into the door frame was enough (luckily) to finally close and lock the door. Hotel room 2 - The hotel room carpet felt extremely dirty and disgusting to walk on. The tall mirror in the room was leaning against the wall on the floor instead of being mounted on the wall. The bathroom light was difficult to turn on/off because the light switch wasn't flush with the switch panel but pushed into the wall instead. It either wasn't installed correctly or was never fixed, either way it didn't make for a pleasant stay. I felt disgusted to walk on the room carpet which I'm typically conscious about in hotels but even more so in this one. I walked around the entire room with my shoes on to avoid whatever might have been here before I came. While I've stayed in numerous hotels in Manhattan that had very little space, the bathroom in this Sheraton hotel was tight, really really tight. If I weighed more than 200 pounds this would have been a squeeze. Also, the toilet rim size was circular and small, which I've never ever been a big fan of. I was dreading taking a shower the next morning only because of what my bathroom experience so far had been like. Noise - At night there was so much noise from police cars, ambulances, and the window insulation was so bad you could hear everything. Doesn't make for a good night's rest. After all this the morning of checkout the bathtub was backing up and wasn't draining water properly, but there wasn't a point in telling management because I was leaving after this anyways (thankfully).All reviews are based on price point...Getting tired so a bullet point review:-- renovations don't bother me-- not having hot water one morning was unacceptable-- telling the front staff and being dismissed...unacceptable-- no coffee pot in rooms...I enjoy coffee in the morning and tea in evening-- beds are very soft...tough on the back-- for towels the first day, two thereafter...one towel needed to soak up the shower water that splashes out of the glass enclosure--  there are better places to stayThe staff is the only reason I gave this a high score of three stars. The staffing was wonderful, polite and ms. Wanda was so friendly. Even the bellhops and matenance men were helpful and polite. The beds were great and comfy. The furniture was nice and modern. I wish they had a dresser with 6 drawers instead of 3. It is a room for two not one person. The bathroom was a little small and I hate it didn't have a fan in there. The sink was nice but a little too big. I hated the wall color it look like a poopy brown. They should have gone blue or orange. The art was awful on the walls. They didn't have have a fridge or microwave in the room. I mean I was there for a week would have been nice to have those things. When I first arrived the phone didn't work, there was no welcoming book or information to let me know what was in the area. The only reason I would stay again is because of the staff.The staff were friendly (housekeeping and bellhop staff) but the service was consistently slow.  The service was obscenely slow in the restaurant (20 min for a muffin in the restaurant). The meeting spaces were unbearably cold and were not fixed despite numerous requests (so bad they offered blankets). One morning I tried to call down and order breakfast, but despite trying multiple extensions, no one ever picked up. I requested a 4 pm checkout (as approved by my Starwood status) and was told ""No, I can only give you until 3"". Not a well run property, my worst Starwood stay to date (and I was there for 6 days!).I am pleasantly surprised.  It is like I am staying in a totally different hotel than the one that is referenced in all the reviews.  I am writing this review from the 17th floor of the tower that is on the northeast side of the property.  I can only surmise that I am staying in a recently renovated room and all I can say is I am pleasantly surprised!The staff has been universally friendly, even doting.  The maid offered to ""freshen"" my room, even though I had hung out the GreenChoice hanger (and had already received my bonus points).  The doorman asked if I needed any directions.  Every staff member that I passed said hello and/or wished me a good day.  The room I am in looks north towards the Nascar and Duke buildings and offers a spectacular skyline view.  The decor is all new and the bed is wonderful.  Some said the pillowtop mattress was too soft, it was just fine for me.The bathroom could use a little more water pressure and I concur with the reviews about the puddle that forms from the ""walk in 'rain' shower"".  It is basically impossible to take a shower without a small puddle forming outside the entryway.  Nothing major, but every time I showered I had to first dry off and then drop the towel into the puddle to absorb the water.  I feel sorry for housekeeping having to pick up all those soaking wet towels...Their SPG club lounge is closed, but they have a little nook setup in the bar/pool area (inside) that serves the same purpose.  Again, the service in the area was doting, something you'd expect in a 4-star restaurant, not an SPG lounge.  Food was typical club lounge fare - edible and not bad for free, but I wouldn't go out of my way to skip a meal elsewhere and eat ""dinner"" in the lounge.  My only complaint here is the limited hours (breakfast and cocktail hours only); I like being able to raid the fridge for free soda/water 24x7.  They said there will be a new lounge once renovations are complete.I did not notice any construction noise in my room *at all*.  I did notice some noise when exiting the elevators towards the lobby; it sounded like they might be doing some heavy work on floors 2 and/or 3.Parking was free for me - I parked in the surface lot on the SW side of the building.  Didn't even know there was a garage until day 2 of my 3-day stay.In summary - This was a good value stay at under $125/night (when all of the other nearby business hotels were charging $220+/night).  I will definitely consider staying here again.  I do, however, wish they'd figure out a way to fix the showers...I'm rating this 4 stars based on my stay....not a '4-star' hotel per say.  I had already booked before I read the reviews on here but I have to say I was surprised and pleased by the hotel.  The reviews made me a little nervous but I didn't have any bad experiences really.  There is still some minor construction going on with the elevators which caused 2 of the 4 elevators to be down, but this didn't really cause any problems and was clearly disclosed on the hotels website.  Check in was a breeze, my room was clean and nice enough.  I'll say the price was higher than I like to pay, but it's typical market rate for uptown Charlotte on a weekday.  Overall it was a good stay.  I would stay here again.I won a certificate for the Sheraton Charlotte at a charity silent auction. I called the 800 number and was told they had plenty of rooms available. I was then directed to use my certificate by calling the Charlotte location. The Charlotte front desk refused to take my certificate even though my day is not on the black out list. I was told the hotel was totally booked! I called the 800 number again and was told  there were plenty of rooms available. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She back tracked and told me since the room rate had gone up to $409 they would not honor their gift certificate until the rates were lower!!!  I was also told the hotel is undergoing construction at this time even with the high rates! I would give zero stars if allowed. Doesn't seem like such a great certificate to win now.Booked a hotel here thinking it would be a nice hotel , read one of the booking sites that there was complimentary WiFi in room. They allowed us to check in an hour early which was perfect because we had to drive out to saluda before 4. We left amd came back later that night to a leaking toilet, had difficult time flushing it.  Called room service, front desk, guest services and the other options on the hotel phone and no answer on any of the lines. Had to go downstairs to get help. There is also a $20 parking fee.Comfortable bed is the only good thing I can say. They said the rooms were recently renovated but they need to call the show catch a contractor because they didn't finish the job. 2 elevators were out so I could have either walked 4 flights up and down the stairs or wait 10 minutes for the elevator. Cold showers. Water is too hot then too cold. Something was wrong with my heating unit. Every 10 minutes it would start up and make an annoying loud sound for about 15 seconds. I refused to have my room cleaned because I felt the floor maids were unprofessional. As I was waiting for the elevator about 3 of them were cleaning rooms and talking loud about the guest who recently stayed in the room using vulgar language and so on. Coming in from a night at the bar you are hungry. They have no small store or anything to grab a quick snack and the 24hr room service is just sandwiches. The people st the font desk were hit or miss. Some people were friendly and helpful others acted as if you were bothering them. It was about 1 AM and a group of front desk people were standing around and I asked them about room service and they looked at me like I said something crazy. And didn't ask if I needed a menu for anything else or my options in the area. At the end of the day. I would NEVER stay here again.. I would rather stay in a Red Roof inn to be honest with you.Nice looking hotel inside, but several problems. - name of the hotel is vague (is advertised online as Center City Hotel, but is advertised on the street as a Sheraton?) so I drove past it and ended up back on the interstate.- parking is very confusing and not located close enough to an entrance. None of the staff could give a clear explanation of where to park. The first time, we walked through the weird ballroom area that went on forever before finding the lobby. When we went back out to move our car and get our luggage, we actually had to walk through a tollbooth gate on a very uneven road and walk around a corner to get into the hotel. No side entrance. Also, parking is $20 a day!!!- wi fi is $10.95/day... seriously? I haven't had to pay for internet access in ANY hotel for years now.- Pros:- the bed sheets and cover were crisp and clean, and the bed/pillows were very comfortable.- staff was very friendly.- good location if you are doing things downtown.- starbucks coffee and coffee maker in the room.- sleek, modern decor.Under renovation, maybe they should just close temporarily. They are redoing the lobby and the elevators as well as the hotel. Lobby is a total mess, they don't answer the phone if you call in from outside or your room. Bellman was rude. Only one elevator barely working. Charged $20 to bring a small refrigerator to the room and it didn't work at all and ruined our food. Parking was $25 for the night. Room service was good but I had to go downstairs and ask someone to get them on the phone. And whats up with their hot water? It was impossible to regulate, either scalding or freezing - UGG! Also the Wifi didn't work.Currently sitting in one of the 16th floor rooms. Pros:  Nice view of the city and new, modern decor.  Beds are fine in regard to comfort. The downstairs area has cool sitting areas. Property misses:  Parking in sketchy garage costs $20 a day and requires walking through a maze of creepy ballrooms reminiscent of ""The Shining"" in order to find the lobby.  Poorly labeled exterior and inner corridors.  Internet access costs additional $11/day.  The few staff members we spoke with were just okay. Upon arrival, we were told the hotel was ""out of king sized beds"" [as booked]. Room misses:  Not enough outlets; specifically, outlets adjacent to desk are occupied with TV and refrigerator plugs.  Due to ""Green Initiative"" refrigerator in room takes some time to cool since it shuts off completely when room is empty.  No coffee maker!?! Bedding is white with black coverlet at foot, shows hair left on bed by housekeeping or prior occupants--yuck! Bathroom reeks of cocoa butter. Room service:  Husband enjoyed hamburger last night but fries were cold, undercooked and inedible. My soup was very bland and warm, not hot.  Cheese platter was gross--1 of 3 pieces of cheese was moldy (passed for aging), other 2 would've been okay if not dry around the edges from air contact/sitting out. Put tray outside of room after dinner, and it was still outside room at 9am.  Left door hanger outside with breakfast order at 11pm and was never picked up. Called in breakfast order--was told they were out of soy milk; I told the girl it was for my coffee, so if the [large pot of] coffee I ordered came with cream, that would be a good substitute. She said it did... my breakfast came with no cream or any dairy product for coffee. Only sweeteners, 1 mug, silverware and my food. No glass of water. Unacceptable for $35.  Additionally, I feel it's rude to include a line on the receipt for a tip when menu clearly states 22% gratuity AND $5 additional will be added to your bill for that purpose. I let it slide that my salmon bagel came with no cream cheese or capers, but the fact that I paid about $12-$15 for coffee (since there was no other way to get it without being a Sheraton Club member or leaving the hotel) and was expected to drink it black, is really upsetting! For $160 a night, I expected better amenities and service. Will not stay here again, and will dissuade others to stay here.the property is undergoing construction.   You may want to select another location until they are done.   then you should let a few months pass and check the reviews again.How about ZERO stars?  Maybe 1 star for free non-valet parking.Booked for the Sheraton ( over a month in advance) during the ACC Championship, check-in was 3pm we got there a little after 3 and were told that our room wasn't clean yet and they'd call my cell when it was ready. Albeit frustrating they comped our parking and the lobby was full of ppl in the same boat so we sat down at the bar for a beer. An hour later we went back to the front desk and were very rudely told that there were no available rooms and no estimation for when a room would be available, but they'd gladly take our number. After 30 mins. I  watched two groups of ppl walk in the door, check-in and immediately receive room keys. After waiting in line for 15-20 mins while other patrons argued with the staff and received keys, I plead my case and was rewarded with a room on the Le Meridian side of the hotel (much newer and nicer). Bathroom was small and the air conditioner a little slow to work but otherwise once we actually got a room it was nice!Upon entering the hotel you'll notice the appearance of an abandoned building. Before giving your credit card when checking in make sure you're not being charged for anything u did not authorize because once you make it home they'll be no answer when making that call to find out about it. Substandard elevators. There was hair on pillow case. Notice what appeared to be a clipping of toe nail on carpet. One day no hot water. Housekeeping left bed sheets unchanged. Called room service for housekeeping and was told that housekeeping wasn't available and they'll send sheets which never came. Half of shower door missing- weird right, same thing I thought. No refrigerator in room. Security breach in hotel. The excuse of renovating is not valid because I had reservations for a hotel in MIA that was renovating and service and appearance was 100 fold better. I'm not advising not to go there, just speaking of my experience.As I walked into this hotel I was floored by the funky, cool lobby. They achieved the look of a boutique hotel, but as I walked up to check in the good impression started to fade and never recovered. The front desk attendant (Kathleen) looked at me with a robot like blank stare and said ""what was your name again""....keep in mind these were the first words of the conversation. No ""welcome to Sheraton""...nothing. It the took her and two others 15 mins to check me in. I was then informed that I had to pay $20 a day to park, I asked if I had to go put the receipt in my window and she responded ""no, but the other night they towed a bunch of people""....hmmm, ok. As I walked up to the elevator I felt like I was entering the elevators of a building that had been abandoned for 10 years and inhabited by hobos.the buttons were covered in white paint, the doors that covered the wiring were hanging open and broken and the filthy walls had the big Sheraton stickers slapped on the walls that were peeling off. Sometimes the elevator never came, other it went the wrong way. Everyone in the hotel was complaining. Whenever I was in the elevator with another person, the conversation centered around the unsafe feeling shabby elevAtors. I might add that only two of the four worked and this is a 14 story building. As I walked down the hall to my room it seemed as though the hall hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. Bags for dirty linens sat in the hall for two days. I really couldn't believe the condition of the hotel I paid $169 a night to stay in. The shower walls has soap dried on them and the mirror has toothpaste on it, the carpet was stained. If I had not been sick and needing rest I'd have left. Both nights I requested a wake up call for the morning. The wake up call was a hang up call both mornings. How hard would it be to merely say ""good morning, this is your wake up call"". Instead I woke up first thing with a rude reminder of the shabby management of the hotel I just overpaid for. It really is a rough start to the day to have someone hang up on you as soon as you gain consciousness. The bar looked nice, and the bartender was friendly. I went for breakfast and received the same cold, robotic personalities from the restaurant staff and ordered a $10 bowl of oatmeal. Upon checkout I was asked ""did you enjoy your stay"", I politely responded ""unfortunately I did not"". They didn't bother to inquire as to the problems I encountered. I realize they are doing some renovations however this is unlikely to effect the lousy staff attitudes and minimal effort. Save your money for a hotel that appreciates their customers. The slightest bit of effort would have been noticed but it was non existent. Seriously, this was awful..but perhaps you might just be looking for a cool lobby, if this is the case then this is the perfect hotel for you.Do not stay here if you can help it. There are ants in the bathroom. The outlet on one side of the bed doesn't work so neither does the lamp or alarm clock work. There are two of us staying but there was only one set of towels. I asked for a second set which I got but was missing the wash cloth. We had to park on the side of the hotel. The nearest entrance took us into an empty part of the hotel with no signs directing you to the lobby so we wandered around until we found our way there.",,,,"['heard', 'read', 'previous', 'reviews',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-hotel-charlotte-charlotte,DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Charlotte,3.5,$$,28,"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel last night. I am very impressed by the cleanliness of the room and the friendliness of the staff.About 5 hours into my stay I had had my fill of a screaming infant in the room next door. It had gone on non stop and wasn't drowned out with earplugs. It was so bad that even his mother left him in the room by himself and say in the hallway with headphones on.Obviously, it's not the baby's fault and it certainly isn't the hotel's fault. However, I called the Careline to see if there were any other rooms available. Jacqueline was so professional about the situation. She apologized for my inconvenience and got me a new room immediately. She insisted on being the key to me in my room, to which I obliged. She brought my key and apologized again.I have a lot of respect for that level of professionalism. This obviously had nothing to do with the hotel, but they still went above and beyond to ensure my comfort! Great hotel, wonderful location, and you can't beat the suites!Overall it's a lovely hotel, with a pretty solid staff. We had a room with two queen sized beds and a full kitchen.  The room is very well decorated, pleasant smelling, and very spacious.  The beds are comfortable, bathrooms are modern, and the balcony was nice. It has matching 42"" lcds in the bedroom and living room, which was good for letting the kids get their Disney fix while I watched the game.  Where I knocked two stars is finish. The room has some really easy fixes that were overlooked. There's one tile on the bathroom floor that doesn't match the rest. The grout around the base of the shower is filthy. The sliding glass door to go on the patio gets stuck easily, and the trim piece was hanging off. The dishwasher is mounted wrong, sitting flush at the top, but sticking out about 1.5"" at the bottom. The previously mentioned issues, would have only made me take off one star, byt the floors made me take another. The floors on the entire third floor are squeaky and have very noticeable dips in many places. Someone walking at anything other than a casual stroll makes it sound as though a herd of Elephants have invaded the Charlotte metropolitan area. I found a spot of floor in the hallway where I could rock back and forth, and the floor would play me the song of its people. None of these are deal breakers, but when all noticed, it makes you curious as to if they actually employ a maintenance person, if so, does he do anything other than change lightbulbs.  Overall though, really pretty hotel. The patio area with all the tables with gas logs was an awesome spot to plop down with a book, cigar, and beer and unwind. Despite the issues with the finish, I would stay again, but preferably on the top floor.While I loved how spacious the suites are, and thought the layout of the room and the wet bar was done well, there is definitely room for improvement.The bathroom is lacking towel racks, it's small, and it needs an upgrade. The room I was in had noticeable crumbling around the tiles in the bathroom. Night font desk service wasn't very welcoming. I stopped by front desk for plates and instead of being acknowledged I had to make my presence known. Also one day in the morning I called the ""Care Line"" for an extra blanket and never received one until I came back to my room at night and called again to inquire about the blanket I requested. I also called the ""Care Line"" for additional Splenda for the wet bar and it took more than 30 minutes for it to be brought up, and that was with an additional call being placed. Other than that, the location is ideal with several shops and restaurants in walking distance.I have to say I loved this hotel. It was placed perfectly 4 miles from Bank Of America Stadium. It was away from the city and located in a great area where there were walkable restaurants a mall and a small park where they hold concerts during nice weather. The pool area was nice and the lobby was gorgeous. The only issue was my room seemed to be almost a mile away from the parking garage. But it was OK bc the weather was so nice it was worth the walk.It is great that all rooms are suites, however this place needs a good scrub down and fresh paint as well as new carpet.  We were in a 2 bed suite which was ample room for my husband and I as well as our 2 teenagers. The first room we had a plumbing issue and had to change rooms. They were prompt to take care of us.  The next room had a bed bug and so we moved again.  They gave us free breakfast vouchers which we never used.  They were very apologetic and gave us lots of cookies as well as helped us move from room to room.  In the end they comp comp us 2 nights.   I would check your room before staying here and hope they do a better in the futureThis is a pretty nice hotel located right next to the South Park mall in Charlotte.  Great location... It doesn't get better actually for those without cars during their visit!The hotel is close to everything... Shopping, dining, etc.  Everything is right at the hotel doorstep.  Beds were pretty comfortable (that, or I'm just enjoying not being at the last hotel I was at). The rooms are like apartments.  Ample size, living rooms, kitchenettes and nice sized bedrooms.  I would definitely recommend giving this hotel a shot.This is a great pet friendly hotel option if you dont feel like staying in a crappy side of the highway motel. Super big nice suites,  beautiful pool area, and a nice little bar inside the hotel. Plus you cant beat double tree cookies!I have had friends and family come into town and this is where they stay. I am writing this review by what they have told me. They love that they have so many options when it come to food, shopping and  parks needs. My friend and his wife love the fact they feel like they are in a small home. They do not have to go out and eat because they can cook, My other friend and his girlfriend enjoy all the options with food and good wine. And that is really close to the DoubleTree. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to call home their time here.My family stayed here for our family reunion. There were about 135 of us. The hotel was great at servicing us all. I especially loved the fresh baked cookies. I had stayed at a DoubleTree a few years ago, but I was not this impressed. The rooms were clean, nicely decorated and quite spacious.We visited the pool everyday we were there. It was a little two small for the size of the hotel. I also think they need a baby pool.My mother and I, we decided to go to Charlotte for Thanksgiving, to see my sister, and her infant son.  We also had her 2 dogs coming back with us.  I also have 2 dogs of my own.  Because of their age and need(s), we do not take them to the vet anymore, unless under extreme circumstance.  So we decided to do a road trip with all four dogs!  This was a first for us, and believe it or not, my 2 dogs as well.So the first things first- finding a place that allows pets (that weigh about 40lbs a piece).  Then trying to find a place near my sister.  We had to choose between the courtyard and the doubletree.  Same location, but the doubletree was only $89 a night compared to the Courtyard's $132 a night!  Mind you, this is during the holidays as well!  We only had to pay a $50 non-refundable pet fee too!My dogs are sweet, but can get grumpy.  We let them loose in the backyard, so we don't take them on walks often.  With that being said, they like barking at children and women (OK, only one of them does that, the other just burrows her head in your crotch).  So bringing them through the lobby was out of the question...Thankfully parking is around back, (mind you, this place is literally across the street from South Park Mall, I mean by like 100 feet from Macy's entrance) and we were able to get them in and out with minimal damage.  The parking spots were somewhat slim (I kept my car at my sister's house, while we traveled around in my mom's Escape), which was pretty much the only downside to the stay.It was weird being in the elevator with my dogs for the first time. I mean they are each 11 and they are just now experiencing this!  Thankfully, they did well. When we got to the room, I was amazed at how large the room was.  It was a 1BR suite (which was actually previously 2 rooms combined into one)- with 2 queens, and a sofa bed.  I took the sofa bed and the kitchen area, one dog took one bed, the other shared with mom.  Space here was perfect.  I still couldn't believe it was only $89 a night!!!Everything was clean in the room, and as you would expect from around a 3 diamond hotel.  But the staff all around and the cleanliness really set it apart from other hotels of that type.They also have a pool, and a Hertz rental center as well.  Overall in general, this place has a lot of space.  So I never felt cluttered.This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at for the price, and location, and what they have to offer.  I will def come back here if I bring my pets, and hell, maybe for that fact, even if I don't!!!Stayed here on business in late August 2012. FREE COOKIE UPON ARRIVAL! Yes, I can be bought as long as the currency is cookies. For real though, the place was clean and the beds were extra comfy. The rooms wound around like a big labyrinth and I got lost more than once. I was glad to find HBO on channel 14 so I could watch the season finale of True Blood - don't judge me! I totally had intentions of using the gym - packed my sports bra and everything - but never made it there. If I had time or money to spare, I would have walked across the street to the massive South Park mall. I was a bit peeved that I was misled to believe that they had a free continental breakfast and ended up paying $11 the first morning. I got late checkout on the last day so I was able to hang out in my room until 2 PM, although the maid kept knocking and entering several times before then - once when I was in the shower. There was also no airport shuttle, as I had hoped for and when I requested a cab, they called a Towncar that cost me $45, but made me feel kind of important. BOTTOM LINE: Nice place, no perks - with the exception of FREE COOKIES!My family and I stayed here recently when we were attending a family Bar Mitzvah in the Charlotte area.  We stayed in a suite which had two double beds, a pull out couch and small wet bar with fridge.  The size of this place was bigger than most apartments in midtown Manhattan.  It was clean, spacious and had a balcony (which we did not venture out on) -- the room was basically at street level (just up a hill from street level), and although we felt space, it was a bit unsettling having a balcony accessible from someone walking by on the street.The swimming pool was really very nice, but it was quite COLD -- even though we had 80's weather all weekend long.   Apparently the pool is NOT heated and did not benefit from the warm atmospheric temperatures either.  We were told that the pool would have been closed for the season, but they had a stretch of nice weather so they decided to keep it open, which is all well and fine, but if it's not warm enough to enjoy the water, what's the point?!The only other gripe is the parking, or lack there of when there is an event going on in the hotel.  The hotel blocked off areas where we could not park while a wedding was taking place.  We found parking, but the fact is other hotel guests may not have.  I understand the need for saving parking for event guests, but it would have been nice if they had sufficient parking for all without having to trade off between giving event goers and guests of the hotel a choice.Otherwise, the hotel is convenient to the South Park Mall, the Symphony Shell next door, Shalom Park and Downtown Charlotte.  And there is a Hertz rental car on-site at the hotel.Great location but in need of refurbishment.  The two room suites are spacious and the furnishings are good.  The bath seems very small given the size of the rooms. A full kitchen is nice if you need it.  The room seemed gloomy with poor lighting.  There were lots of outlets in inconvenient locations.  The windows and patio door were damaged and hard to open. The HVAC did not seem to do anything but blow air.  The electronic door lock always required two or three tries to operate.  Elevators made grinding noises but worked.  Parking is the big problem.  There are some surface spaces and a small garage with spaces marked like they were for motorcycles.  The Wifi was very problematic.  I am not sure if is is included.  We were given a promotion code but had to revalidate every time I opened my iPad.  US hotels need to learn that Wifi should be included and easy to use.Let me start off with all the good things about this hotel. The room was spacious. living room, kitchenette with bar and microwave. Bedroom and bath. The balcony overlooked the pool. Everything was spotless and in it's place. The breakfast was served just off of the bar and it had a cold side, which came with the room. The hot side of the buffet was an extra $3 dollars? Why bother. The place was pretty big, as our room was, (no kidding) a block from the elevator! When we went to our room with our luggage. There was a tray at someone's door. It stayed there for more than 24 hours! We had housekeeping come to replace a burnt out bulb and he had to pass it twice as he had to come back. It was still there after out room was looked at the next day. When I say looked at. We had the door open and pollen was all over the carpet. Still there. The bed was made, but they left us only one towel and no toiletries. We didn't steel the one's that were there. But we had taken two showers each and there was no more shampoo. I called house keeping for more towels and I had to leave a message. When we came back I called the front desk and they were more than happy to bring some up. Now the pool was gorgeous. When I saw it. I jumped into my suit and ran the block and half to get there. Until I realized it was 40 degrees in the water and 80 outside. So much for that. The property couldn't be in a better local. Next to two great malls and you have the pavilion next door. I would definitely come back here as you get a lot for your money. Housekeeping just needs to pay more attention to what they are doing.I enjoyed my stay at the Doubletree hotel. It wasn't absolutely amazing, but it was nice, the location was decent, and I was comfortable. The Good:1) The beds- They were soooo comfortable! I don't usually sleep well in new places, but I had no problem at this hotel. I'm sure part of it was that I was so worn out from being out all day, but the rest was because the beds were great. I like a soft mattress and fluffy pillow, and that's exactly what I got. The sheets were soft and comfortable, also.2) The gym- The machines weren't the absolute newest models, but they worked well and served  their purpose. They had TV screens, and there is another large TV in the gym with a remote. There were 3 treadmills, 2 ellipticals (not quite ellipticals, but I don't remember the name of the machine), 1 bike. There are also numerous weights and 2 cable machines. There's also a water machine and free earphones. I was the only person in the gym each time I went, around 8 am.3) Rooms- Overall I liked my room. The bathrooms were a good size, as was the living room and kitchen. I don't have any real complaints except that my patio wasn't clean. But there was so much pollen I wasn't going to sit outside anyway.4) Safety- I walked through my patio to get to the gym. The patio door doesn't have a lock so I left it unlocked, and never had any issue with anything being taken from my room (thankfully). 5) Breakfast- Good! Loved the French toast and the omelets were great. The So-So:1) Location- It really depends on what you're looking for. We were right beside Southpark mall, which was great. If you're looking for shopping, this is the place. Other than the mall, there was a DSW, Barnes &amp; Noble, and countless other stores and shopping centers. There were also many restaurants and sidewalks for walking instead of driving. The houses are nice, so it was great to look at the different styles and some of the really nice yards.2) The pool- It's nice there was one, but it wasn't open when I went. 3) The outdoor area is beautiful. The tables are nice (but I didn't sit outside) and the landscaping is pretty. There was just soooooo much pollen, I wasn't ready!4) Service- The man I dealt with (his name started with an S, I don't remember. But he was dark-skinned and a little older) was really nice and always helpful. I had my own room one night, then was going to stay with my parents the next night. They weren't arriving until the evening, but the hotel allowed me to check in to my parents' room. I really appreciated it. 5) Cleanliness- There was a lot of dog hair in my parents room, and I saw it all over my sisters when they woke up. They called housekeeping to vacuum it but no one ever came. The first room  I stayed in was fine.The Bad:1) Layout- I know that layout of a hotel isn't really a consideration when choosing a hotel, but it made a difference here. I came in with a lot of luggage, so it was awful having to make the long walk from the lobby to my room. When I say it was a long walk, I mean it was really long for being in a hotel.2) Luggage carts- Only the wheels on one end of  the luggage cart will spin, so it was really hard to navigate the halls and get from place to place with the carts.3) Housekeeping staff- They were in the halls before 9 am just carrying on like it was the middle of the day. They were really loud, so I'm glad I was already up or they surely would have woken me up. I'm sure that people in the nearby rooms weren't pleased. They also knocked on  the door at 830. I know they do cleaning in the morning, but that early? That's just never happened to me before, nobody's ever come to my room before 10 in other hotels. 4) Parking- There wasn't much parking. Well, there was some parking, just not enough. During the middle of the day there wasn't a problem, but if you come back to the hotel after 9 expect to have to search for an adequate spot. I say adequate  because while you'll find about 5 spots on the lower levels, there will be a double-parked large SUV that prohibits anyone from getting those spots.5) Not all the service was good. There is a younger woman (I don't remember her name, but she was (appeared) white with straight dark hair and likes to sit outside and smoke) who works at the counter who wasn't really that interested in helping me, and didn't really help my parents. First, my parents reserved a 2 room suite with one king bed and 2 queen beds, and ended up with 2 king beds and ended up stuck with it because there were no 2 room suites left. Second, my parents reserved the room with breakfast included and the woman didn't believe them. They got their breakfast passes, but still. 6) Location (again)- If you want to do  things downtown/uptown/whatever, don't stay here because it's about a 15-20 min drive.I've stayed in a lot of hotels over the years. I've stayed in some Doubletrees and usually come away much less than impressed. Then I stayed here.The rooms, the suite we had, was enormous. Large living room with a small wet bar and fridge. Huge L shaped desk. Large television and a nice little balcony with two chairs and a table. The bedroom was just as large as the living room. The bed was comfortable but not outstanding, the linens and pillows however were wonderful. The only somewhat critical comment I would make about the room is that I think, given the large proportions of the other rooms, the bathroom was small. With that much space they should have built stand up showers. That said, the generous sized tub made showering simple and pleasant. The low water flush toilet sounds like a jet taking off but unless one spent all the time flushing toilet I can't see how that matters. During our stay we never heard noise from other rooms of the hall.The real surprise was the staff. The staff was much better than I ever would have expected from a Doubletree. From the desk staff to housekeeping they were all friendly, pleasant and very helpful. The staff in the bar and restaurant were also delightful. All of these people helped make my stay in Charlotte very pleasant.The next time I am in Charlotte I would definitely stay at the Doubletree Suites again.Nice renovated Doubletree property.  Lobby is fairly spacious, and check-in was without incident (though I always wonder why it can't be faster, since I had a reservation and they are expecting my arrival.) Suite rooms are huge, with a living room and wet bar/ kitchenette area (microwave and fridge in mine, though I know there are rooms with stoves too, which I declined).  Room smelled a bit of smoke...this is the 2nd ""non-smoking"" hotel room in the past month i've been in to have the lingering smoke smell that ravaged my throat.  Hotels need to improve their ventilation systems so that smoking rooms and areas do not contaminate non-smoking rooms and areas.  Other yelp reviews say this hotel has no perks...untrue, as I got a cookie upon check-in, free wifi, and a voucher for free breakfast.  Breakfast is buffet-style, though they did cook eggs for me upon order, since I don't like scrambled eggs that have been sitting on a buffet.Parking...could be improved, as the options were to park in tiny spaces parallel to the building but far from the door, or in a creepy dark parking deck.  I opted to squeeze into a spot and walk awhile to get to the door (unsecured before 11pm, which made me uneasy) and another few minutes hiking to my room down several long hallways.  The layout of this place is a bit confusing, there are elevators that only access some floors, and the hallways are long and have lots of turns.Convenient for me since my company has an office right across the street, and I also had meetings nearby.Probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  The only way it could've been worse was if there were bed bugs.A bunch of us stayed here for a conference, and I wish we had done a little more research and opted to stay at the numerous better options nearby (Renaissance, Marriott).  The lobby is relatively nice and doesn't really represent the rest of the hotel.  Upon arrival at my room, I noted how large it was - bigger than most NY apartments.  However, that was the most positive part about it.  The kitchen was so old; the fridge smelled and the wall socket barely worked.  When I went to plug in the fridge, the socket went into the wall.  The beds were okay, but I couldn't sleep my first night due to the incessant flushing of the toilet.  I just ended up shutting off the water to the toilet, then having to turn it on in the morning.  How had this not been fixed or noticed by housekeeping?Worst of all was the fire alarms being set off by a storm.  Granted it was a strong storm, but it should not cause alarms to go off.  This required all guests to leave their room and the fire department to come and shut it off.  After speaking to some staff, this has apparently been a consistent problem; a problem no other hotels in the area have.I know Yelp! has the rule where you aren't supposed to review based on second-hand experiences, but my other colleagues who stayed here reported roaches in the bathroom and other non-paying bugs in the room.1 star for being the worst hotel in recent memory.  Stay elsewhere, especially at these rates.  I did notice that they are attempting to refresh rooms, so maybe this may change, but as of right nowUnsubstantiated note:  There may or may not have been a prostitution ring busted here a few years ago.This review is not  to rate the hotel for an overnight stay, but a group dinner event that I attended there.  First of all, the parking deck of the hotel is terrible. It is dark and creepy and not well designed at all.  While it may be difficult/expensive to tear down and re-build the deck, at a minimum, the hotel could at least put excellent lighting in there to help improve the situation.Second, the overall layout of the hotel is very odd and it is not easy to find the ballrooms in the crazy maze of the building's footprint. It is one of the worst hotel designs I have ever seen. Again, this would be difficult to correct without great expense, but at a minimum the hotel could do a better job with providing signage and having staff posted at various points  throughout the hotel. Thirdly,  while we were in the ballroom for our dinner meeting , the lights kept flickering and the room itself felt dingy and old. Dinner was not great, we were served a pasta dish with chicken, which is ok as long as you are not allergic to gluten.  When the person who cannot eat wheat/gluten asked the server for a dish without pasta,  she was brought a ""naked"" chicken breast - just a plain piece of chicken on a plate with nothing else - no salad, no vegetables, no nothing.  We found this to be bizarre and totally unprofessional.  A ""full service kitchen"" with ""professional chefs"" should be well equipped and completely prepared to handle special food requests as food allergies and other dietary restrictions are very common these days. When we were leaving the event and going back to the parking deck, as soon as we exited the rear of the building, we were actually accosted by a ""pan-handler"" looking for money.  Definitely not what one expects to encounter in the Southpark area.  I do realize that crime happens everywhere, but the way this hotel is laid out and the weird deck situation seems to attract this sort of  unsavory occurance. Overall, I would not recommend hosting any special events here, and based on the creepy parking deck alone, I would not recommend this place to out-of-town guests. I think that if I am invited to any future events here, I will decline to attend.Friendly and helpful staff; answered all my questions and took good care of me. Nice room with mini-kitchen and pet friendly. This is my second stay here in Charlotte and Id recommend this place!","My Dad and Stepmom came into town and decided to stay in a hotel that was nearby our house.  The Doubletree behind SouthPark Mall was the closest and it seemed like a safer area than some hotel choices on Independence.  Plus, they offered very reasonable rates (I think it might have been $89/night) compared to other similar hotels and for the more upscale SouthPark area.   After checking in, they were even more surprised and excited to be staying there.  The hotel only has suites!  For that great price, they were given a one-bedroom suite, so it was like a small apartment for them rather than a hotel room.  They had a living room area, a mini kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.  The decor was nice and everything seemed very clean.  Plus, they were within walking distance of SouthPark Mall, so we could enjoy The Cheesecake Factory without even moving the car (parking is a bit limited in their small parking deck that's near the hotel entrance).  They'll definitely be staying there the next time they're in town, and the proximity to the SouthPark area and our house is very convenient!Big fan.Overall it is just a hotel, after all, but what you get for the rates is pretty dang good.So it is average on the whole sleep, shower, etc ... aspect.Decent on the grounds and lobby.Maybe a little sub-par on the food/bar aspect.However, every room is a full suite with a large living area, and a FULL kitchen!  If you are going to be staying for a few days, there is no better way to stay.Plus, since I am a HUGE coffee snob, I can make my own on the stove and not have to trust any nearby Starbucks or (heaven forbid) the Hotel coffee.Yay.An older property in the South Park area of Charlotte, which has been updated somewhat(bedding, etc) but could use some more. Staff is always nice and friendly...although breakfast in the cafe can be an exception. A little chaotic sometimes...Good price/value for the area of town it's in. I look forward to my next visit.I really didn't have any complaints.  The room very nice as well as the hotel in general.  Plenty of parking was available.  The bar was cozy and the restaurant had a nice breakfast in the morning.It's ok.  I found my room service to be kind of inconsistent.  Sometimes I had an awesome maid who folded my towels really nicely, and other times I couldnt find the shower floor mat that is usually provided.I like that they only have suites though! It's nice to have a kitchen and a living room.  I stayed here for almost 5 weeks for work.  I found that some of the rooms were nicer than others.  I love my warm cookie everytime I go, and plus a lot of people get the free breakfast buffet.  The location is really nice since it's right next to a mall, and you can walk to macys in 2 minutes.We stayed there as a group of ""girls"" on a weekend to South Park Mall.  You can not beat that location as the parking lot backs up to Macy's and you can walk to the mall and a variety of restaurants.  The hotel itself is all suites which is perfect for a group of people on a weekend excursion.  2 large bedrooms and baths and full kitchen and living room.  It's been updates somewhat since my last visit 3 years ago and was very clean.  The staff is very friendly.  My only complaint was that they should warn you if your room is above the ballrooms; there was a wedding going on and it was so noisy we could hear them announce the bride and groom.  Yes it stopped by 11pm like they said at front desk but there was no rooms avail to move us to.  Oh well got free breakfast thrown in cause of it so at least they cared.I really enjoyed this hotel.  I had a king one bedroom suite so the living room was seperate from the bedroom with a full kitchen as well.  (I am only docking one star as the walls were a little thin and I could hear my neighbors.)  I also had a generous-sized private patio area.  It was nice to be able to leave the door open and enjoy some fresh air for once in a hotel room.  However, I did spy a little field mouse outside so if you are on the bottom level you might want to monitor how long you leave to door open!  I will be back for work in a couple of months and I plan to stay here again!It's ok.",,,,"['pleasure', 'staying', 'hotel', 'last', 'night', 'impressed', 'cleanliness', 'room', 'friendliness', 'staff',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-charlotte-airport-hotel-charlotte-2,Sheraton Charlotte Airport Hotel,3.0,$$,35,"Great Hotel-actually probably the best for the ""airport"" area...location is about 2 miles from the airport. 1) Shuttle driver shout out to SEAN-he's the man-that's all 2) Rooms are always clean and beds are o comfy! 3) Stay on the Club Level for the extra but breakfast and nightly apps are worth it. 4) Never used it but, inside pool is really nice! 5) Water in room/1 free to SPG members, join if you haven't. I stay here often, one time a problem, it was fixed/handled and they have earned my repeat business. Every room I have stayed in since 2014 have been well above average.This hotel was very accommodating. I made our reservation via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> but it did not show up at the hotel so when I arrived, the front desk matched the price I received from the third-party website -very nice. The location is about a mile from the Charlotte-Douglas airport so you can't beat it for convenience. The inside pool is great for swimming with kids in the cooler months. The room was comfortable and the staff was very friendly.The hotel itself is OK.  The bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean.  It looks like they don't vacuum very often.  I really wouldn't stay here again, the customer service was OK at the front desk, but the restaurant was terrible.  If you have a rental car and the ability to leave then this probably wouldn't be an issue but there is literally nothing around this hotel.Four stars for the service, and one star for room comfort. Rule No. 1 of running a hotel in the south: make SURE the A/C functions properly. I asked to switch rooms and both of them could not be cooled by the units. I can only imagine what the upper floors were like.BUT... we had a lovely exchange with our check-in gal, who wanted to meet Triscuit (my rat terrier) and find out all about her. smart move to do that.Also, other negatives: this joint wanted $2.50 for a cup of Starschmux coffee, which on its own takes like a**. Hello, Sheraton, you need to be offering at least free coffee to your patrons if you're going to be taken seriously.This two-tier system of fast-lane, slow-lane internet is ridiculous.This place is clean and generous while prices excellent. Only here for an hour and very happy. Hope to continue so well.This hotel is really dated, and the rooms smell funny. The staff is very nice and the hotel is near the airport. I stayed here due to a flight being cancelled.Room was clean. Staff was very kind.breakfast was nice, but nothing special.The coffee was HORRIBLE. They serve starbucks, which isn't usually bad coffee, but they serve Pike's place, which is the worst coffee starbucks has ever had.The pool area was clean and well maintained.My only complain is that the hottub/whirlpool has not worked in the 3+ times that we've stayed there.  It's boarded over, and looks ridiculous. Fix it, or tear it out.Impressed with the clean room, soft pillows. Great gym and pool. Friendly staff. Perfect for airport drop-off.This Sheraton is a great pick for an airport hotel. The hotel is very modern with a pool that goes from outside to inside, very neat. The rooms look like they were just renovated. I have came to always expect a great bad at Sheridan hotels and this is what I found at this location, you will sleep like a baby. The wifi in my room is fast. The AC worked great and you have a setting to turn it on nonstop (I like the sound while I sleep and you don't find this at all hotels.) Fridge, Starbucks coffee, iron, and hair dryer all in your room already. The man helping at the desk was very glad to explain breakfast etc and was very helpful. I would defiantly return to this hotel.Everyone from the shuttle driver, front desk, waitress, etc were absolutely wonderful! The rooms comfortable and clean and the hotel itself pleasing to the eye! I was very happy with my stay!Night manager tried to enter my room at 1 am while I was sleeping. Terrifying.  The only thing that stopped him from entering my dark room was the top security loop above the lock. My sleep and stay was ruined. I've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her. No hotel, regardless of star rating, should deem accidental night room entry as acceptable hospitality service.Pretty lobby, but had problems with the hotel staff.  We held a meeting there and had no problems with the room, the AV or the catering.  However, as a guest, I would not go back.  The lobby is pretty, but the room did have a smell to it.  The internet connection in my room was intermittent and when I called, I was told, ""I don't know what you want me to do about it . . ""  She didn't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly, rude.  I had the same problem on my laptop, iPad and iPhone.  It wasn't me.  I asked to take a muffin from the restaurant into the meeting room and, at first, they didn't want to let me - at all.  When they did, they charged me for the full buffet.  Others in our group had problems as well.The good:  The staff in the evening at check-in were friendly and helpful.  After getting stuck in Charlotte due to weather in Chicago, we were able to book this hotel for our unexpected stay.  As a nursing mother I was hoping for a fridge in my room, however a pageant taking place at the hotel meant all were taken.  The staff were nice enough to let me keep some things in the employee fridge which I really appreciated.The beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night's sleep.The food at the main restaurant/bar was decent with very large portions.  In typical southern style, it was covered in sauce(s) but good enough.The not so good:  The main picture posted on Yelp (and on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FSPG.com&amp;s=033508007932c52fa289452a68229ecac74c20abe8fe53b8d6fb1c9ebe0027ce"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">SPG.com</a>) leads you to believe the hotel is nicer than it actually is.  The hotel is very average and does not appear to have been significantly updated in the last 10-15 years (except for the beds which were quite nice).The website advertising a 24-hour on-demand shuttle, however the on-demand part is only when being picked up from the airport not to be dropped off (which would have been helpful for them to mention at check-in).  There were 3-5 of us that were ready to go at 5:45am (because our flight departed at 6:50am) but were told that we had to wait until 6am because it only leaves on the half hour.  They also would not let us ride with an earlier van that carried crew members and informed us that a taxi would take 15-20 minutes to call.  Overall, seemed frustrating as to why they could not have a van make a trip to the airport when there are 5 people waiting to go.I'm not sure if this is an SPG systematic problem or not, but the hotel charged me for internet on my bill and I had to ask to have it taken off (since I'm a platinum member).  This has happened at several hotels, and I feel they are trying to pass through charges and hoping that guests don't notice.Nice hotel but inconsistent staff night crew is great morning/day crew  not so great and shuttle is inconsistent sometimes they leave early sometimes on the dot and sometimes late... :/This airport hotel is very nice but doesn't serve breakfast before 6 am:  in the club room, main restaurant or even room service. Not convenient for an early flight. Really?Clean and welcoming... For cheaper rates, book through Hotwire. Only thing I didn't like is whatever they cleaned with -- it was a bit much and had an overwhelming smell when I would walked into the hotel.Stuck in Charlotte due to a cancelled flight, I was searching for a hotel with a free shuttle. So glad I picked this one!  The bed (and plows) were super comfy. HD tv channels, nice towels...  Dinner was excellent. I chose a grilled chicken dish with roasted vegetables, apricots, and a Madeira sauce. All in all you can't go wrong here, I'd stay again in a heartbeat. AND the shuttle runs every half hour 24 hours.This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms, furnished in the 1970s faux wood motel style, carry the unpleasantly musty stink of the unconcealed carpet stains. My room overlooked a dreary parking lot but on the bright side, the Internet was relatively quick and the hotel is minutes from the airport and the interstate. There are no decent food options within walking distance. Charlotte is such a nice town, this hotel and its environs won't do your trip justice. Surprised that this meets the Starwood standard.Overpriced attempt at 4-star hotel. Employees are friendly but the room is no better than a La Quinta. Smelled like smoke no matter how much air neutralizing febreze I sprayed. Go elsewhere but be warned that the whole area is horrible so this may---gulp---be the best choice if you absolutely cannot leave the area. The lobby is awesome but no one sleeps in a lobby, right? The pool is right next to the lobby and restaurant bar so if you want to be the show for the customers having dinner, this is perfect for you. The hallways needed vaccuming, the wallpaper is old and crusty, the tub was clogged----oh yeah, also, if you ever wondered if you'll ever get a chance in life to experience washing your clothes at a mexican laundromat, use the washer and dryer provided---you won't wonder any longer.Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!This is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.From a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling.","The lobby is nice and the pool, fitness room are good. Some floors look a bit dated although rooms are just like other Sheratons.Staff are great - friendly and helpful. Beds are hit or miss. Some beds are noticeably  older and squeak horribly. Some are as comfy as could be. As usual, Sheraton pillows are amongst the best. Restaurant, bar, pool, and lobby are nice as well.Starwood Hotels, you really let us down. We booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in Charlotte. We arrived at the hotel via the courtesy van. While the front desk girl and shuttle guy were pleasant, that's pretty much the only thing I can say were positives of this experience. First, our room reeked of incense (FYI, non-smoking also includes pot smoke). Next, we went down to the lobby area to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were ""out"" of both items we requested. Then, the items we did order tasted like the equivalent of a Stouffer's microwave dinner and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money.Next, in the morning, when we went to get ready, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the tub with shower water that didn't go down all the way until we were almost ready to check out. That's just nasty!When we got downstairs my husband asked an employee if they had a kiosk to check in for our flight (many hotels have this now). He said they didn't but directed us to the business center to print our passes via their computer. He failed to mention that the printer wasn't working. So I went through the whole thing for nothing. I typically don't pay for or book hotels through full-price sites (in this case spg. com) but we wanted to make sure we were super close to the airport and up until this experience I had always had all positives to say about Starwood Hotels (owners of Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Points, etc.).  We paid about $200 for the room before taxes and fees and I won't ever do that again. I had a better stay at a Holiday Inn off Hotwire for $85! Also, once again, no free WiFi...which pretty much puts this on the no-go list!I get really annoyed with these ""fancy"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  Also, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.There's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.The room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in.This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.I'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!Updated:  12/17/12The Good:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was very friendly (Lindsay at the front desk has been particularly friendly and helpful) at check-in and the restaurant staff were also very nice.  The room was clean and well kept with a ~24"" flat TV and decent furniture.  The breakfast  has been improved since the last time.  The potatoes were much better than before and the eggs were done on a per order basis when it wasn't busy.  The bacon and was quite a bit better.The Not So Good:  Dinner was decent but still left a bit to be desired as far as seasoning and interesting flavors to their dishes.  They would do well to get a little more variety of beers on tap as well.  Yes it is a hotel by the airport but I've stayed at several hotels this lose to airports and they generally have better windows to isolate some of the noise.Overall, this was a good hotel.  I think the room is among the better quality ones in the area and, provided you're a sound sleeper when it comes to noise, it is pretty comfortable.Just had to yelp out because the manager was so nice and helpful to me and my mother not just one but two times today.  The staff is obviously making an effort in the area of customer service.  Hotel is up to date, clean and very close to airport.  Oh, yes, must say though that the air freshener issue broached by others is a valid issue.  Yuck!Not bad.  Large and tasteful lobby, small but fun indoor/outdoor pool and seating area.  Rooms were nicely appointed and everything seemed clean and in order.  The staff was very friendly and the free airport shuttle kept to its schedule (every 30 mins).  However, there is nothing around except a Shell gas station.  No restaurants or bars except the hotel ones (which close at 12am).I arrived late-ish, tired from a grueling trip and emotionally bruised from an encounter with a rental car company, and immediately I was in good hands. Kind and friendly front desk people took care of me, going the extra mile. Beautiful lobby, excellent room (impeccably clean), great wings at the bar (open late!), patient servers, and just an overall feeling of comfort and wellbeing.  Lovely bed, hot shower, in-room coffee pot, freshly renovated...go stay there. I would. Highly recommend. Only faint issue:  would have loved free wi-fi. Not a deal-breaker, though. I like Starwood Hotels, of which this is one.Absolute worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The rooms are disgusting - was shocked to see that Starwood would actually claim a property this awful.Perfect airport hotel.  Decent rooms, starting to age but still not bad.  Not easy to get to or find so look for the large gas sign. But if you do, they have a small pool and a large lobby.  Perfect place to hang out if your tired of your small room.  Food is okay but nothing fantastic in my three stays there.This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem.Nice hotel, clean rooms, OK food. I would visit again.The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking, how bad can a Sheraton be? Answer: pretty bad! A huge number of kids were staying here for a soccer tournament. No one appeared to be supervising these children who ran screaming through the lobby and restaurant/bar area for entire evening. Actually they were also running and yelling in and out of elevators and hallways, too! It was a tired person's worst nightmare. The room was clean, but the carpeting was terribly stained and the furniture scratched. The bed was, thankfully, comfortable. Just to finish things off, the bill slipped under the door that night was totally wrong. I'd say, skip this one. You can surely do better!After a long day at work, flying in from Boston, only to have my connecting flight canceled in Charlotte, I was tired, hungry, and frustrated. Needing someplace to spend the night, I called the airport Sheraton. They said the shuttle bus will pick me up right away. Waited for about 45 minutes, meanwhile other hotel shuttles actually came by two or three times.  By the time I finally got to the hotel, it was about 1 AM. There was only one overworked person at the reception.  It took about 30 minutes to check in. The bar/restaurant was closed. The only room service was cold sandwiches. Come on Sheraton! You can do better than that. I had a delicious meal of vending machine snacks (pork rinds and trail mix, the soda machine would not accept my quarters and I was all out of $1 bills) and went to bed. The bed was quite comfy, the room was clean and quiet, and when I got up five hours later to continue my trip, I felt reasonably rested. Overall, three stars. The room was acceptable, but the amenities were lacking.",,,,"['great', 'hotel', 'actually', 'probably', 'best', 'airport', 'area', 'location', 'miles', 'airport', 'shuttle', 'driver', 'shout', 'man',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-charlotte-university-charlotte,Hilton Charlotte University,3.5,$$$$,40,"The dollar signs for pricing don't really apply here as the dollar tiers are for restaurants.I'd stay here again for sure next time in town for work.  That's the bottom line, but for more details, I specifically enjoyed/recommend this place because:-Clean, comfortable rooms that are modern.-Terrific breakfast buffet.-Friendly front desk staff.My room didn't have great water pressure and other guests were loud from time to time, but the first thing is luck of the draw and the second...as long as it doesn't last isn't a shocker.I attended an event this past weekend in the Lakeview Room.  Due to the weather we booked a room and checked in around 5:00.  Check-in was easy, but upon arriving in our room it was nice, but one disappointing thing, they did not provide a blow dryer. I used to bring mine to every hotel, but most hotels I stay in recently provide one. The one time I decide not to, they don't provide.  I was able to call the lobby and have one brought up to me.The event started at 7:00 and upon entering the Lakeview room, it was very outdated.  Although it has a great view of the lake outside, the carpet, seating and overall look of the room could definitely use a makeover.  A buffet was set up along one wall and unfortunately the food was SO disappointing I could not eat too much.  The serving dishes did not seem to remain hot so everything served, from stuffed mushrooms, chicken, to pasta was all cold. And, everything didn't have any flavor.  There was, however, a chicken and waffle station set up in one corner, which was cooked to order so that was at least warm, but was okay.After the event we went to the hotel bar, which had a good crowd.  However, they seemed to run out of several wines we requested and the service was slow.I did however sleep very well and enjoyed the breakfast brunch that was set up in the lobby Sunday morning and was ony $12.99.Overall, it was a nice stay, but definitely outdated and the food could definitely use some work.This is supposedly the most upscale hotel in the University area.  It's right off WT Harris Blvd which is always busy.  It is the most distinguishable hotel in the area too at 12+ floors.  It looks a bit outdated on the outside but has been remodeled nicely on the inside . I stayed here twice in the past 3 months for business travel.  My first experience in January 2015 was 5 stars all around.  I was on the Hilton Honors floor in which you need your room key to access from the elevators.  Our room was spacious and overlooked the man-made lake.  We had a fridge and microwave and a large bathroom. There were electrical outlets next to the beds and on all the lamp fixtures.  However my  stay last week was not as great as the first.  I ended up in a handicap-enabled room which wasn't too bad but definitely a downgraded experience from the last.  The electrical outlets at the desk did not work so I had to work on the nightstand next to my bed. Our door didn't shut all the way unless we slammed it shut.Breakfast is generally not complimentary but my work had negotiated free breakfast in our rate.  I really like the breakfast here.  Hot breakfast options include eggs, country potatoes, pancakes, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and bacon.  There's also an omelet station in which the chef will cook whatever omelet you wanted. There was also bagels and muffins if you wanted something quick.  There is also a cafe in the lobby area that serves Starbucks coffee and to-go pastries/drinks. This hotel is close to everything.  Bars, restaurants, banks, shopping, Walgreens, everything. There is no parking fee per night with plenty of parking.  Valet service is also offered. I would definitely consider this hotel again when I'm back in Charlotte for work.I came here due to my poor experience at Comfort Inn Suites down the street. It was a much better experience. The room was clean, nice, and comfortable, the staff was friendly, they had great amenities including a coffee shop. Didn't eat here so I can't say anything about that.Family went to Charlotte, NC, for the weekend for a childhood friend's wedding. None of us have ever been there nor have family close by. My parents stayed at Courtyard by Marriott and my brother stayed at Hilton. Since I've stayed in Courtyard by Marriott before, I was curious about Hilton. The only thing I know about Hilton is that it's own by Paris Hilton's great grandfather lol. The staff is friendly. Check in is by 3 pm but we wanted to check in earlier and was able to at noon. After checking in the Hilton, we walked around the hotel. It's really nice. The hotel is located across The Boardwalk (shopping, restaurant, lake). Enterprise and Starbucks are inside the hotel too. The lower level has many  rooms for parties and meetings. I would definitely come back again.I attended a conference here for work, so I can't comment on the rooms themselves. The lobby area is nicely renovated, and I appreciated the seating areas overlooking the lake and boardwalk. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, but heads up that they do not take Starbucks gift cards. The conference room space was okay. Not enough restrooms for ladies for the space capacity. Buffet breakfast, lunch, and snacks were provided as part of the conference rate, but the layout of the space does not leave much room for buffet setup. The servers were accommodating, but it was pretty chaotic and crowded. The food itself was typical hotel/hall-style and just okay.Stayed here for the Thanksgiving Holiday 2015 as the house was overfilled with family and children.First of all, I will stay here again when visiting the Charlotte area!This Holiday Inn and the Holiday Day Inn Downtown(uptown) Charlotte have redefined what a Holiday Inn is to me.Super friendly staff, clean rooms, very comfortable king bed, modern bathroom and modern room. Everything was nice.The breakfast buffet was great.Gym was enough the do some damage.All in all great experience and I'd stay here again.Older Hilton property but seemed nice. Got a nice upgrade with a nice view of the lake outside. Executive lounge is nice and service good. Got a good rate so would stay here again.The rooms are decent, quiet.  oh you stay on 10,11,12 you have executive lounge access.  They do a decent job, caprese etc instead of just the normal frozen/fried nibbles.The courtesy shuttle is great and also within very short walking distance there is plenty of shopping.This is not the place to stay for a weekend get away. They are often way too booked on events which of course doesn't cater to resident guests. This evening there are 2 weddings 2 family reunions and on sweet 15 party. It felt like a made house. Please I employ you to find a better place to stay on your weekend get away.Very clean and comfortable room with a great team here. Walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops as well. Beautiful views at night and easy access to the highway. This was a great stay in the middle of a long trip.Nice place to stay by mans made lake with good walking area and stores &amp; restaurants. Nice room, comfy bed. Nice bathroom except the tub has a really slow drain. Restaurant being remodeled at the time of my visit so breakfast buffet is congested. Traffic in this area is pretty bad at rush hour.Currently staying here.House keeping comes seriously early and only knocks once before coming in. Im checking out today and waiting for my group, after working 20 hours and the front desk guy came up to me and rudely said I can't sleep in the lobby... Im nicely dressed sitting upright and I dozed off for a few minutes from being so exhausted. When I explained I'm a guest he didn't care and was adamant i can't doze off again because ""people are asking questions"" from that unkindness I won't stay here ever again. If I was an 80 year old woman would he have said the same thing? No, he wouldn't have.I have to comment on the customer service at this hotel. We always stay here when visiting our boys who attend UNCC &amp; they just keep getting better at what they do. This is a large chain hotel that handles each guest with the grace &amp; personal service of a first class B&amp;B. Marieta Bryan, their Guest Loyalty Manager, is amazing. I'll never stay anywhere else when I come to Charlotte.The best part of this hotel is the Boardwalk area behind it.  In the Boardwalk, you'll find some restaurant. Not all great, but you can get out and roam around a little. The rooms are standard. No biggie.The concierge lounge is ok. Evening reception is ok, some samosas and cheese. No free booze.  Breakfast is so-so.. no eggs and bacon. Coffee is so so.  Kinda dissapointed with the concierge lounge.  I think I'll go somewhere else next week.Back to to Boardwalk area, great place for kids. They have a play ground. There is a lake and you can rent a paddle boat.Look, it's certainly not the worst hotel you can stay at, there were a couple of things that were annoying. One, the parking was a hassle, too few spots, and even when they covered up a bunch of them with garage pods, they kept the valet spots roped off. Also the front staff could use a bit of sensitivity training, their reaction to my boyfriend and I asking for a single king wasn't necessarily homophobic, but it definitely lacked tact. All this would've been forgiven if the bed weren't so stiff and the pillows so crappy.I had my family reunion here recently and was very pleased with the hotel. The banquet staff as well as the sales and catering staff were very helpful and my family reunion was a success. The hotel was extremely busy that weekend so I was very surprised that they were able to a meet our specific request. I did not stay in a room , but my family didn't have any complaints about the room or facilities. They also enjoyed the free parking as well as the close proximity of restaurants and shops.  This hotel is a good alternative to the pricey ones uptown .. you are a short 15 min drive away from most of the major areas of Charlotte.The room was very clean and the staff was friendly. My only complaint was that the AC in the room must not have been working properly b/c I set it as low as it could go but the room never really cooled off. It was the middle of the night before I noticed so I didn't bring it to anyones attention to have fixed. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would return.Recently, I came here for a conference.  The hosting organization did a superb job by selecting this awesome hotel!This hotel is conveniently located in the midst of restaurants, stores, and whatnots.  There's an awesome pond in the back with even more restaurants.The hotel itself is spacious with ample space for exhibits, registration, and socialization.  The rooms for workshops were impressive, allowing a large number of participants to attend.  The room was nice and decent.  Nothing fancy.  The beds were a little too soft for my liking.  Throughout the night, I just could not sleep.  Tossed and turned.  Folded pillows in half.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  I'll be back next summer as another hosting organization will have a conference there!","Clean rooms and comfortable beds.  Sometimes parking can a bit of a hassle.   Front desk staff always friendly.  My room was recently redone.  Great location.The rooms are clean, but a little worn out.  Free self parking (a big plus).  Breakfast buffet is very nice, but expensive.  The staff is friendly.stayed here for 3 nights, and is our company preferred hotel. the interior was modern, and the employees were very friendly and helpful. i checked in during the late night, and immediately asked for a refrigerator. it was brought up promptly (i could hear her asking him as i was walking back to my floor through a walkie-talkie). room service food here is bleh. i ordered the tomato basil soup (he gave me a large side since i didn't get the grilled cheese that it normally comes with) and it wasn't even WARM! waste of $7. the pesto chicken panini would've been good (it was a bit odd since it also had asparagus) but the bread was totally burned. the fries were good, and they forgot my ranch, but he came up with 2 right away after i called.my favorite part of this hotel is that it faces the man made lake, which is a great view for me to enjoy while on the terrace in front of their bar/restaurant. weather was great this week, and enjoyed a lot of nights with the breeze with some bubbly &amp; wine. its also within walking distance to some shops and restaurants, and was able to burn off that southern food walking laps around the lake. also nice to see ducks, swans, etc.the room - it was standard size, although i was at the very end around a corner. the ice machine didnt work on our floor, but i was tired of asking for things. :) the bed was comfy, but not as comfy as i thought it would be considering it was ""pillowtop"". the worst were the pillows. they were all goose/feather down, and even with 2, i was so uncomfortable as my head sunk into them. i also couldnt turn off the fan, and im such a light sleeper that i could not sleep well the first 2 days because it was so incredibly loud.their basic tv channels are all fuzzy, i am not sure why, so that was annoying. their alarm clock, you can't change the hour, so i always used the wakeup call service, which never failed.we also received a free full breakfast buffet, and there was a variety of things (same everyday). biscuits/gravy (delicious!), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, grits, cereal, yogurt, and we always opted for the make your own omelette station. it was great, except for the 2nd day when i asked for egg whites and got the regular eggs. oh well. great service other than that.would stay again for the convenience factor, as they have a shuttle service to our office (5 minute ride).I don't usually have the opportunity to meet clients in the university area, but was greatly delighted with this Hilton. The atrium/ lobby areas are wonderful, comfortable, worthy of the Hilton name and a delight for my clients. Their suite was second to none, almost had me forget that I wasn't the guest, and ready to kick off my shoes.  I will readily recommend this location to any visiting clients in the future.Hotel rooms were average, bathrooms were tiny.Lobby coffee has a $2 charge...we opted to run to Starbucks every day and get great coffee for an extra quarter.Breakfast buffet was good but with parties of 6 being charged a 20% gratuity for a buffet seemed absurd and ridiculous for someone pouring coffee.Seemed to nickel and dime their guests at every opportunity and also appeared to be understaffed. We will not bother to stay here again in Charlotte, we could get better service with amenities we are accustomed to at a Hampton or Holiday Inn...disappointed.PROS:_____- Up to par and friendly, professional staffs at front desk, executive lounge, and parking attendants. They do their very best to accommodate your needs all the time.- Convenient location and easy access to many restaurants and stores.- Most rooms are clean and up to basic standards.- Fully equipped with wifi, fitness center, business center, bar, car rental, etc on site.CONS:----------- Ventilation and temperature in the small fitness center is always musky and warm to too warm.- Not so professional housekeeping staff. They are always loud and chatty during mornings in the hallways thru the very thin walls. One time they even knocked when I had a 'Do no disturb' sign out on the door.- No AC nor air ventilation in the elevators.- Slower wifi and VERY poor signal strength in certain rooms. It's free though. It would better if there is alternative pay wifi with better performance or just upgrade the existing wifi.- Cannot fax in business center. Only via front desk staff. Not so convenient with sensitive or confidential documents.Another great Hilton experience. Staff is great.  Free Wi-fi and a fitness center open 24 hours.  Precor equipment, weights, benches, four treadmills and three ellipicals.  For some reason it seems extra-humid in the fitness center, but since most people are there to sweat, I guess it's okay.Outlets in the room exactly where I need them and I love the little coffee and tea maker. Classy bar/restaurant on site with good food! The bathrooms here are a little small compared to the newer locations that I have stayed at, but they are still a decent size. Great view of the lake, easy to get to and walk around the shops and restaurants. The executive lounge is great and I hope to get upgraded next time I stay! =) I will continue to stay here any time I am back in Charlotte for work.Recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly.    The lounge is nice touch but not enough to overcome the staffs lack of detail and follow through.    Will give this place one last shot but not holding me breathLovely stay, but the downside of leaving on Sunday morning is the lack of luggage carts and more than two people can lug by themselves.  Doesn't checking out happen every day?Hilton Charlotte delivers on Southern Hospitality!  From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with smiles and charm.  Quick rundown:-Rooms are nice and mine was up on 7 overlooking the lake...I found this to be comforting since my body clock is all screwed up.  Waking up at 5am that's really 2am isnt so bad when you get to see the sun come up from the spectacular view.-Restaurant &amp; Room Service---top notch.  Oh how I heart sweet tea.  The pizza, NY steak, salads and most of all desserts were out-of-this-world.  Creme Brulee Cheesecake and Granny Smith Apple Pie with shortbread crust and toffee sauce....come on now.Only complaints and minus a star...they should make it so people don't line up right outside the front doors smoking.  Oh the rooms have a 2 inch gap under the door?  What do you do  (A-hit it just a lil bit softer lol jk)I'll be back next month....will most likey stay here again.Stayed on 8 floor, for 4 nights, had to call down every single night at 12:30am-1am and ask them to shut the music off outside.  Seriously?  They were playing some drum and bass that would slightly rattle the windows.Expensive in comparison to the other hotels around the area.Friendly staff, but having to call down 4 nights in a rowFree wirelessNice staff, my room seemed a little run down with a broken desk but it was all clean.One of my favorite hotels in the university area.  Not only is the staff very friendly - but also adept (these are often mutually exclusive).  Although I'm not a Hilton Honors Gold Club Member, I was upgraded on my recent visit to an executive suite, which had the advantage of free continental breakfasts and managers receptions in the evening (hor d'ouvres every night, wine and beer on Wednesdays).  The view on over the lake is beautiful, and the hotel is located close to many restaurant options.  You don't have to venture out to get a good meal though, the room-service and sit-down restaurant are both excellent - any of their steaks are great with the Bearnaise sauce!  Heck, even if your not having steak try the Bearnaise sauce!As usual, with Hilton, the rooms themselves are nice quality, efficient units.... and although this might not be everyone's priority when searching for a hotel I love the Hilton sheets and towels.Very NICE hotel!  I have stayed here twice and all  things wanted in a great hotel they have!!!Fine Hilton. Updated interior, good staff. Nothing special otherwise except a reasonable rate.Accomindations nice.  Staff very friendly.  Very service oriented.  Neg....there is NOT ""cute"" shops nearby.  They are empty....TV..not HD.or digital...looks lie your typical antenna.  Service makes up for it.  Great folks.  Free Wifi..Marriott charges $13/night.I was at this hotel for a convention and it was fine.  The meeting rooms were fine.  My hotel room was fine. The restaurant was fine.  The staff was fine. Everything was fine, and I had no real complaints, but for a full service hotel it seemed uninspired.  There was nothing that stood our and impressed me, but I guess that's fine.My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later, here we are in our room with a bath tub that the paint is chipping off of and the tv doesn't work. We were charged for a movie that we can't even watch. Highly dissapointed. You would think that with a big name like Hilton, the room and service would be superior. Very lackluster.Recently updated, this hotel is my choice for putting up guests in the University area of Charlotte. Great staff and cool surroundings.a beautiful hotel that was just renovated. The best service i have had at a hotel..... A great pleace to have our wedding, we got married overlooking the lake the restaurnat has the best crab cake i have ever had and that includes ones i have had in Baltimore just a great

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-charlotte-airport-charlotte,Courtyard Charlotte Airport,2.5,$$,28,"A clean, stereotypical Marriott Courtyard. We chose this place because it is so close to the airport. They offer a shuttle that will pick you up, or drop you off from the airport at no charge. The shuttle goes every half hour. They were prompt in picking us up, and the service was warm and helpful. Since this place is so close to the airport, right on the other side of the street from the landing strips, it's loud. Planes constantly buzz the roof of this building, and you hear jet engines roaring by every minute until very late at night. The windows rattle each time a flight screams by on its way to land. The internet here is slow. Don't even try to Netflix it here, 'cause it ain't happening. At least they offer a television with a large selection of channels. They offer complimentary copies of USA Today and the WSJ, which is much appreciated! They even have a kiosk where you can check in on your flight, and print out boarding passes. It's a large touchscreen television with a printer, which is supposed to be convenient. I was trying to print out my boarding passes with this helpful display, and the whole thing came crashing down from the wall almost crushing me. The computer monitor fell with a loud crash and immediately glitched out. Nobody was around to notice, or help. I tried my best to hang it back on the wall, and managed to get it up at a crooked angle, but without a boarding pass. Sorry, Marriott. I was happy that the a/c worked properly, and there was plenty of parking. They do have an on-site restaurant, and a Starbucks.Not the best Courtyard I've stayed at, but you can not beat it for location and convenience. It is just outside the airport perimeter and while they do have a shuttle, I didn't use it for this stay.I was checked in close to midnight by a friendly clerk who efficiently recognized my Platinum status, swiped my credit card, prepared two room keys and gave me directions to my room. All good.There were only two problems with cleanliness of the room. After lying down in bed, I noticed something crunchy under the sheet. Some previous guest's luggage tag had attached itself and been laundered with the sheet. Yes, the sheet was clean and so was the luggage tag. I decided that this was no big deal and moved on. In the morning, a previous guest (likely not the same one) had left a bar of soap in the shower and this had not been removed by the people who cleaned the room. A little icky - what else did they forget? - but I moved on for this too. Accidents happen, they can't be perfect every time, right?The room was comfortable and other than one loud group of guests who arrived shortly after I did, it was very quiet. In the morning, I was out and gone well before the vacuum cleaners started.Note that the Courtyard brand of properties does not offer a free breakfast. Head over to Fairfield or SpringHill if that's what you need. I like Courtyard because it generally indicates more business travelers and fewer families (i.e., no screaming kids running down the hallways).Would I stay here again? You can't beat the location near the airport (and right off I-85). Yeah, I think so.Rating 4 stars in comparison to all hotels in this class of hotels. (Was almost a five star but cost of food &amp; drink brought it down)The Good: friendly staff at check in; room is clean and roomy; full service bistro with great menu selection; service from Mark was exceptional; very attentive and friendly person!The Bad: price of drinks ($6.75 for a bottle of beer) total bill was $43 after tip with just two beers; a sandwich; and pot stickers.The Rest: overall a great hotel with great staff. I am headed to a Fairfield tomorrow but wouldn't mind staying here longer!Disgusting. I couldn't even take a shower here. This is what the tub looked like. That isn't a bath pad. The bottom of the bathtub has some gray stuff stuck to the bottom. I generally really like Marriott.There's nothing wrong with the Courtyard. There's also nothing exciting about it.It's an airport hotel. They expect people there for one night, so facilities are limited. But the bed was comfy, the wifi was free. One qualm I has was with the breakfast. You're eating in the lobby (yes, the actual lobby, not a restaurant off the side), and all food is served on paper plates with plastic cutlery. Considering how much the nightly rate is, I would have expected better.This place is awful. The internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email. I am writing this via my cell phone because I cant even get this page to load from my laptop.They also overbook and did care about you.  My first time here they sold my room despite the fact that I am a platinum member.This trip has no internet.  NEVER STAY HERE.Room was clean. Bathroom could be cleaner, especially the shower. Nice new fluffy towels!Common areas needed to be vacuumed! Early in the morning staff gave someone a key to our room which didn't work. But their repeated attempts to enter woke us up. Then staff tried to get in!! When my husband opened the door he said ""oh sorry didn't know the room was occupied""!!!!Coffee pot in our room was broken.So we went down stairs to get complimentary coffee (per guest services book). We were told by staff ""oh we don't do that anymore!""All this in the same morning !!!! 2 stars might be too generous!Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.I had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me ""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you."" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.Funny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.Also, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. For those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer.It's an older building. Not the nicest Marriott and my room came with an almost empty bottle of lotion and someone's wine glass out on the balcony. After two nights the lotion is still empty;although the empty bottle was put back with the shampoo and conditioner, and the dirty glass is still on the balcony. Oh, they also have the toilet paper coming off the back of the roll- Get it together man!I stayed here for two days in which it's okay, but not great. The staff are very friendly and the inside restaurant is nice. The food there is decent and inexpensive. The internet is slow and the beds are not very firm. The rooms are laid out okay and if you can get this place cheap enough then stay here. Otherwise, I would look at other places to stay.This is not the Courtyard I was expecting. What a let down, being a  platinum elite for life I was very disappointed with this property. The Internet was totally unusable and when I called downstairs to inquire about it the front desk person says "" oh yeah we have been getting complaints about it"" how about fixing it then?? If you plan to you do any kind of email sending forget about that even. The other problem is that you might as well plan on waking up when the maid service gets there in the morning. 7 AM rolls around you better be up or you will get woken up by them even if you have the don't disturb sign out. What is really frustrating is that when they clean the rooms on your floor they leave the door clasps out so the door slams on it and shakes the whole floor and makes a huge noise. JW Marriott where are you when I need you???I would give this place a 0 star if I could! KYRA, the front desk customer service agent was very rude and not friendly at all!!I told her that I was a Platinum Marriott (1,100,000 points!) rewards member and she seemed to get very Argumentative  and defensive saying no I wasn't, I was only a silver member. I showed her my credit card, license and platinum rewards card and she never entered the number Or my credit card information apparently. (Which I found out after as you'll read below) I went to the room only to find a filthy carpet, lint balls in the bed,  a completely clogged bathroom sink and no extra towels soaps or shampoos in the tub area . They give you one small soap at this hotel! I called downstairs to let them know and the woman that answered the phone said that my name wasn't even listed for this room!!  Apparently KYRA DIDN'T DO HER JOB and not only did not put my platinum rewards card into the computer, she also didn't even put my name or credit card on the room. What she did put in however it was my other  flight crew members credit card paying for both rooms. This cannot happen!!  I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN nor will my other crew members!  Unfortunately I was on only a nine hour layover and could not, or did not have the energy to argue with these people. I will make sure to get the word out to have no airline or corporate crews stay at this DUMP OF A HOTEL. I've stayed at some pretty shabby Motels better than this. But you know, with all the hundreds of Marriotts that I've stayed at, there always has to be one bad apple I suppose and Charlotte Courtyard Marriott,, you should be proud of earning the title of being that one bad apple. Between the rudeness. the inaccurate information entered into the computer, the filthiness of the room and the lack of routine maintenance I give this place a zero!! 00000We felt our room was clean and nice. Pool area looked nice and we liked the mini mart area. The front desk lady was very helpful with delivery places. Please check yelp for delivery places. The Pizza Hut was horrible and none of the other restaurants got great ratings either.Real close to the airport. Modern rooms, comfortable beds, nice bistro downstairs in the lobby with a mini bar. All the staff we encountered was friendly. It was nice to have a porch outside on the upper floors. There are chairs and tables out there. Bathrooms are average.Things I liked: the patio outside my room. This would bump it up to four or five stars. Things I didn't like: this place is located right next to the highway AND underneath flight paths. It can get loud at night until the planes stop landing and taking off at CLT. The place is also always hopping because of all the traveling business people like me who may land late and don't want to travel all over heck and creation to a hotel. So it's got that going for them. Unfortunately, this means the bistro is packed at all times and so you may have to budget a few extra minutes in the morning to get your breakfast before going off to work.So my toilet won't flush, the shower has a bent pipe and the water wouldn't drain, and the shelve in the closet is coming off the wall so I was worried about hanging up my clothes.I gave it a two star because I like the people in the cafe and the food was decent.Scary awful. I needed a room by the airport for an early morning flight. I've always had good experiences in the past so I booked a room.The first thing I see when I walk in the door is an angry woman named ""Chrystal"" (refuses to give a last name) with a look on her face you only see on a bad day at the DMV or on a prison inmate. I think maybe she's having a bad day (or a bad life) so I smile anyway rather than doing what I should have done and headed straight out the door. The angry ""Chrystal"" just continues to look like she found a turd in her lunchbox. I let angry Crystal know we are Rewards Members thinking this might soften her belligerent glare. No luck. After an agonizing minute of talking with her, I inform her I'm not happy with my interaction with her and ask for her manager. She denies a manager is available and then gives me the card of someone else who works there but is also not available. I later learn the person who's name she gave me is not the real manager at all. So angry Crystal is a liar on top of dedicating herself to creating misery in others through her toxic attitude. Employees like Crystal are no doubt the reason this Marriott has the lowest yelp rating of any Marriott in the State. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel desperately needs basic training. They are asleep at the switch. In short, there's a good reason this Marriott location has an extremely low rating.Disgusting and a complete customer service letdown. Our flight into Charlotte was delayed several hours, so we arrived about 3:30 am to check in for our reservation. This had been booked for over a month, and I'm certain there were better Trip Advisor reviews when I chose this hotel. Upon checkin, we were told that they had gotten busy and given away our king bed room but we had 2 double beds. This was not our preference and I voiced my displeasure and asked for a discount which she gave me (very minimal). Upon immediate opening of the door, the most disgusting, rancid smell of cigarette smoke just about took my breath. I immediately went back to the front desk where I was told that was the ONLY room open in the whole hotel, and we could try going somewhere else (it's now 4 am and we were exhausted!). I noted that she didn't seem the least bit shocked that this room (154) smelled this way. We were told checkout was 12 pm but at 10 am the housekeeper was BANGING on doors, including ours.  The pillows were standard couch throw pillow size. All I can say is the bed was comfortable for the 6 hours we stayed. We will NEVER return. (When I checked out and again mentioned the smoke smell to the morning worker, she was told there was a ""note"" on my account and maybe they would be adding points. I won't hold my breath).We love Marriott's and this Courtyard was good.  Yes, it has ZERO curb appeal, so if you're staying for long and hanging at the hotel, this may not be the place for you. It is convenient to the highway, with one way being a u-turn situation.  But you can't walk anywhere from this location.The staff was exceptionally helpful and accomodating.  Everything was clean and fresh.  Disappointing that they now are using ""The Bistro"" format and don't offer any type of breakfast included.  There aren't any quick coffee/doughnut shops anywhere like there seem to be in the northeast.Definitely a short-term, airport convenient type of place.  They have a pool and hot tub, but the outside fire put was never on while we were there.  Also, I wouldn't recommend for families.  The kids would be bored.Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there...","There's a freakin weird flying beetle in my room and I called the front desk several times to have someone remove it or give me a vacuum to do it. Unfortunately it's past midnight, the maintenance person is also the shuttle driver so after I was told if have to wait 20 mins while it is flying and creeping around-I call and find out person isn't retuning anytime soon Bc another airport pick up. No one else working downstairs so they can't come over and drop off a vacuum hose. My shuttle to the airport is at 6 am and I've travelled hours today. I don't know how much longer I will have to stay awake and try to track the weird insect from afar.It is now 1239 am and I'm still waiting/can't sleep....1243 am maintenance finally came back but knocks even though I've expressively told the front desk to have her come in Bc I do not want to walk by it. Front desk claims she has no way to communicate with her (hello radio walkie talkie) and that she's not allowed to. BS I'm a seasoned business traveller and know they have communication and have had staff come in while I'm in and while I'm not in the room. Sure enough I had to make a quick dash to the door and there she was with the walkie talkie and said that the front desk didn't tell her.Avoid this hotel since it isn't clean, they didn't offer to move me, took an hour to try to resolve it and then lie about communication. Really?!?! I stay at various brands of hotels and at major and minor locations. I'm really upset about this!!!!I got stuck overnight in Charlotte and was placed here on a voucher from the airline. As a 20-something girl traveling solo at the time I was really afraid that this place would be sketchy, because I've had horrible luck in the same situation in Atlanta in the past. This hotel is extremely nice, clean, and up to date. The treadmills in their fitness center are awesome! The hotel staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The hotel restaurant was pretty good too. All in all a fantastic experience!Nice room and staff but the point of staying here is its proximity to the airport and that was the flaw in my stay. I had a 7:30 am flight so I wanted to get to the airport around 6:30. They had a 6:00 and 6:30 shuttle and they said it was a five minute drive. So I chose 6:30. I chose poorly. It would have been ok if they did not wait 5 minutes for a guy who was late, drop him at Hertz and then drop another guy at Budget. Plus the airport traffic was horrible and the precheck line was long and slow. Extra stress that no one needs.Nice hotel, will stay here again.  Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Breakfast is not included.They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they ""were already at the airport"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clownsWe had an overnight layover in Charlotte and wanted something to hold us over. This place went above and beyond. First, the customer service is some of the best (if not THE best) I've ever experienced at a hotel. Everyone was kind and really put forth an effort. The gentleman at the front desk as well as the shuttle driver were super nice and helpful. I would certainly stay here again! :)Plus** They have a great drink selection in the lobby. From a wide variety of beers to Starbuck coffee, I'm happy :)My flight got in late at night and I didn't want to drive down to Greensboro and wake my brother up late at night upon my arrival. So I got a hotel here in Charlotte for the night. Good hotel, very close to the airport and check in was a breeze. Nothing overly fancy, just an overall decent hotel. They have a bistro with Starbucks which is GREAT for a coffee addict from New England. And free wifi!Not bad if you're stuck on the out skirts of town, the breakfast in the am IS NOT free, it's around $10 if you'd like eggs and sausage buffet,  $6 if you just want continental. They are doing some construction outside, seem to be expanding, so that's always a good sign :). Not many dining options in the area, McDonalds, Bojangles, Waffle House, etc., but getting back to City center is pretty easy. They have a shuttle that will pick you up from the airport, if you call when you land. The exercise room was pretty standard, 1 out of 3 treadmills worked, but a decent dumbbell selectionThe only bad about the experience, was the house keeper, who behaved as if we were holding her up from something. As I walk out of my room she  yells down the hallway ""What time do you want service!?"" I told her that I don't know, maybe around one, and she freaks out, and storms off.",,,,"['clean', 'stereotypical', 'courtyard', 'chose', 'place', 'close', 'airport', 'offer', 'shuttle', 'pick',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inns-charlotte,Drury Inns,4.5,$$,23,"Very nice place to stay. Kickback at 5pm (or is it 6?), laundry, pet options, clean bathrooms, a fitness center, the list goes on and on. Staff worked with us to give us the upgrade that the system somehow lost. One of the front desk ladies did have a little bit of an attitude, but I didn't deal with her that much.Extremely close to shopping and about a 15 minute drive to the airport. I have enjoyed every Drury I have stayed at. This one is no exception.I had the worst experience ever a week ago.  A female by the name of Mia Gentry was very rude and obnoxious.  She was very profane of the mouth and her customer service was horrible.  She needs to be trained better because I don't know what her problem is.  For future reference, if anyone goes there to stay avoid her because you will not like what you see and hear.It's the Drury, nothing overly special but nothing terrible. A reliable hotel that's always clean and the staff are polite. It's neither the nicest nor the worst. The two free beers and pseudo hot dinner and kinda of nice as is the free internet. The breakfast is cafeteria quality fine. Some real size coffee take away cups would be better.We have stayed here multiple times, and have had the BEST experiences each time! Location is so conveniently located, with a great mall and shopping centers in walking distance, and the hotel features many amenities. The rooms and lobby are bright, fresh and and clean, and very spacious! One of the top reasons we choose to stay here is their pet friendly policy, and the staff is always so professional and welcoming. There is a great indoor-outdoor pool, and a great full breakfast bar, and even a complementary cocktail hour with snacks in the evening that are included with your stay! Drury Inn &amp; Suites is a great value and we look forward to staying when we are in the Charlotte area!So this place is pretty awesome if you are stopping by when moving cross country. My husband, dog, and I stopped here from a long drive from Albany, GA and it was not bad at all. They tend to have happy hr where they feed you (mainly  meat balls, mac and cheese, baked potato... nothing too fancy) and two alcoholic drinks. So that was a great way to finish up our long day of driving. They also allow pets, which was a BIG plus for us! Their pet fee was only $10, which was something I was gladly willing to part with. Their parking lot was very safe, oh and did I mention they have free breakfast?Their rooms were roomy, clean, and had free internet, Oh and if you are bored, the movie theater is less than a mile away and it is located right at the foot of a pretty nice mall. If for some reason I am back in that neck of the woods, you can bet that I will be staying here again! Five stars!!!I've stayed here a total of 7 times now, and am always impressed with how clean the hotel is, friendly the staff is, and how cheap it is.  I will definitely continue to stay here on my trips to charlotte and definitely recommend it.Awesomeness at its best! I mean where else are you going to stay and get free breakfast and dinner plus two drinks per day! Also free cookies and soda until ten pm. After that free coffee and hot chocolate! I was going to try the pool out but left my Speedo at home!Excellent place to stay. The staff was helpful and friendly. Gave us military discount. HBO, popcorn and soda included. Indoor pool and  free breakfast. Wifi included.I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and in fact, my husband and I are owners on a resort property that is considered a luxury property in Northern Ontario.This Drury Inn is BY FAR the best place I have ever stayed in. I am writing my review sitting in my very well appointed room after a long, hot shower which features H2O bath products  (so, yay there!) and after having finished with our complimentary ""5:30 Kickback"" dinner. We were even provided with two complimentary alcoholic beverages each to relax and enjoy with our meal.  This entire hotel is spotless and immaculate. Greetings at the front desk were warm and inviting, staff at dinner were attentive and friendly and everyone is the epitome of Southern hospitality. Wish I had had the sense to stay in a Drury Inn on my way TO Florida, instead of just on the way home. In fact, wish I could rate this place again just to be able to give it 10 stars. This is a great hotel, managed and run like a dream. Do yourself a favor and stay here even as a little treat for yourself, if not passing through on your way somewhere else. This company cares about making your stay a great and incredibly relaxing one. Great job, Drury!The staff at this hotel is excellent. The hospitality and the rooms are perfect! I took my sons to this hotel just for a weekend getaway and never had to leave the hotel, not once. They provide you with free breakfast, popcorn, and a kickback. They also have an indoor pool along with a fitness room. Thank you Drury staff! We will return soon!This was our first time ever staying at Drury Inn and Suites, we will be back!! Found a hidden gem through a online hotel booking site. Room was very nice, beds were comfortable, free wifi, and the meals included helped us save money on the trip. The Kick back was at 5:30-7pm and actually was enough for us for dinner. Mac and cheese, chili, hot dogs, baked potatoes, chips, salad, and soda, coffee and 2 free adult beverages per person at check in. Breakfast was good too with eggs, waffles, bagels, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, yogurt and coffee, tea, juice and soda.Loved it so much we are joining the rewards club. Will definitely look for a Drury on our next travel outing.This is a truly fabulous hotel! For the money it must be the best deal out there. For our $150 we got a beautiful, spacious, and clean room. Also, Free breakfast and cocktail reception. They also give you free popcorn and sodas for your movie night in your room. The place has an indoor/outdoor pool and a hot tub. And their pet fee is only $10 per night. I honestly don't know how this place stays in business based on what it must cost to provide all of these services and amenities for free. Even the Wi-Fi is super fast and free. The staff was very nice and friendly to us and our bulldog. Oh, and the bed is deliciously comfortable. It's like you're staying in Ritz Carlton for a third of the price.southern hospitality at it's best.  staff was friendly and helpful. room was clean, quiet and well maintained.spent a week here on business.  all the free amenities!This is our second time staying here. Customer service is as good as it gets here. All the staff have been fantastic. We stayed in one of the suites. It is very large with a kitchenette and two queen beds. The room was very clean with to larger flat screen TV's that have a fairly good channel selection (including HBO). Good wifi reception. Dinner comes included with two alcoholic beverages per adult. The meal is nothing fancy but hits the spot without leaving the hotel. I really like this place and highly recommend it!This is my new favorite place to stay!!  ALL of the staff are awesome! So friendly and helpful !  Making reservations for next year!!This is perhaps the easiest five-star review I've written on Yelp yet. The Drury Inn at Northlake was the nicest hotel I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. For the service and quality of comfort I received, I feel like I should have paid twice what my actual bill was. The rooms are spot-on clean and tidy. The king size bed was very comfortable. My suite had TWO televisions, a microwave and refrigerator. As to the bathroom - it was phenomenal. I can't tell you enough how CLEAN and UPSCALE this hotel was. As to the service, it was well worth beyond anything I've ever received at any other hotel. I took advantage of their 5:30 Kickback, which affords you dinner and two adult beverages as part of your stay. The dinner was simple, tasty and filling. Just eating dinner on site at the hotel saved me money. The next morning, their Quickstart Continental Breakfast was perfect. They had practically every type of breakfast food imaginable available for you. This is also included in your stay at no extra charge. BAM! That's another meal I didn't have to go out and pay for.  I was just shocked (in a good way) at how well the Drury Inn caters to its guests. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Charlotte. I won't even consider staying anywhere else.This was a tough one...  it probably is one of the nicer Drury Inns, but for me, that does not warrant its current 5 star rating.My suite was roomy, yes - but I couldn't get past the circa-1970s decor - especially the heinous bedspread.  The mattress itself was of poor quality, and way too soft.  There is a fine line between value and cheap, and IMO this place leans toward the cheap side.The exercise equipment was very limited, with a single treadmill and elliptical trainer - no free weights.It is located right outside the Northlake Mall complex, so there are a number of shopping and chain eating spots available.I'm torn to give this a 4.5 star rating but Yelp does not allow me to do so, so I will just give them the 5 and be done with it. I was here for a week long business trip and definitely enjoyed my stay here. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were well kept. The rooms they offer are spacious and provide more then enough room to walk around, stretch your legs and get comfortable. They provide you with a generously sized flat screen TV and offer free WIFI to all patrons, with no password. They also have a small business office which you can use as well. The one thing I did like was that they also offered a ""kick-back"" between 5:30-7 which provids you with a 3 free alcoholic drinks and food (usually salads, chicken of a sort, taco meat/nachos, hotdogs, and mac n cheese. They also provide a breakfast which is decent as well. The work out center is strictly cardio but the machines were pretty new and well kept, and they had a nice pool and hot tub as well. I did not like the fact that they didn't have room service, but I guess I can't complain too much cause they do offer a lot of things that are included. The staff were very helpful when asked what there is to do around the area, and also can provide you a printed list of things.The laundry room consisted of a single washing and drying unit, which I thought was lacking considering it was the only one offered to all the guests of the building. The one thing I really appreciated though was that after I did my laundry, the staff offered me a recipt on a printed piece of paper so I could submit it on my expense report.The hotel is also in a great location because it is right next to a boatload of businesses including a shopping mall, and 2-4 other strip malls in a very short vicinity (one is walkable).  Very well kept, and very nice staff and in a great location. I would highly recommend the stay here if you are in the Charlotte area.Stayed at Drury Inn at Northlake Mall on April 12th. First time at a Drury Inn and was very impressed with this location. Staff very friendly and helpful, of particular note with Lola at check in and Amanda in the bar. Very busy location on April 12 with lots of kids for a dancing competition, but room was well appointed and quiet. Will return.We chose this hotel based on the reviews and we were not disappointed. This is not a resort, it's a very nice hotel situated between the highway and a mall. I wouldn't recommend it for a weeklong family getaway, unless you had plans to do a lot of things outside of the hotel. This is a great place to explore Charlotte and the surrounding areas from and to have a nice place to come ""home"" to at the end of the day. We missed the ""happy hour,"" so  can't say whether it is good or bad. We arrived after 7, tired from a long day on the road. Check in was very fast and we proceeded to our room. When we arrived upstairs, our room smelled of cigarette smoke. These are supposed to be no smoking rooms, so my husband went downstairs and got us a new room on the same floor, no problem.  We had trouble with the key time and my husband returned downstairs. The receptionist returned with him and opened the door for us, very pleasant and smiling the entire time. My husband had said to me, after he initially checked in  that these are the nicest people and that was my impression as well. Our room was beautiful and very clean, my first impression was that they had been recently renovated. Ends up the hotel was built in 2008, so nothing has had a chance to get dated. The bathroom was large and clean. The beds were very comfortable and I loved the pillows. We had the breakfast the next day and it was what you would expect from a free hotel breakfast. Good food, with both hot and cold options. We were very impressed with our stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Charlotte area. The great price is a bonus!","This is the best value in a hotel. You get a really comfortable well appointed room, full HOT breakfast, 3 complementary alcoholic drinks, a nice little spread in the evening, (hotdogs and such), a nice indoor pool and hot tub, a workout area, free wifi, access to washer and dryer and a really great staff. The elevators well maintained and clean, the entire building esthetically pleasing and there's also a business center with all the tools you need. You can also lounge in a large living room area and have some free fresh popcorn. I think I covered everything. I love this place.Great hotel for the price.  Good free breakfast. Free parking.  Free WiFi and free happy hour.  Good place for pets as well...lots of grass to take care of the business.  Great location as it is directly across from the Northlake Mall...For the money you know you're not staying at a 1st class hotel, but at that price point they give you more than any place I have ever stayed.  Happy Hour with food and cocktails?  At $300- per night hotels you do not get that.  I will never stay anywhere else in Charlotte.  The rooms were clean, staff was friendly we loved the pool, the happy hour and breakfast.  Dollar for dollar you will not find a place that good.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-charlotte-executive-park-charlotte,Hilton Charlotte Executive Park,3.0,$$,29,"Really not able to rate my stay here at the hotel for I only attended a conference in one of their meeting rooms.Chairs were comfortable, Hilton Note pad and pen at each seating area. Pretty basic meeting room with chair and rows of tables with burgundy table cloth.In the back was a table with glasses and water.Unfortunately this location is not the newest..don't be fooled by the nicely updated lobby.  The rooms are not up to par. I have stayed here multiple times and it is convenient but the the rooms need some updating. This last visit, the wallpaper was coming off in the bathroom and there was a random motion sensor looking thing hanging down.You would think they would start updating the rooms  since they did already with the lobby or maybe I've been just unlucky, about 4-5 times in the past 2 years, that I keep on getting put into a crappy room.Food is decent, staff is nice, I wish I could give it more stars for that but I can't get over the sad state of the rooms.Overpriced, old, outdatedBar food is terrible microwaved garbage, priced like gourmetSewer smell all week, overnight lady at front desk was very rude to everyone I spoke with.I made a reservation for this property in early February for a 5 day stay beginning on 2/14/2017...received a confirmation number and the whole nine yards. then 2 days later I receive an email from Scott the Manager stating he canceled my reservation because that particular week the NBA is having their All Star game and they cater to them rather than the long time honors members. I contacted Hilton Corporate and no response! If this is how they treat the people who keep the lights on they are a sad bunch! I have other reservations throughout the year with other Hilton locations but they are going to be canceled because they have lost me as a customer! Stay away from this brand! They are all about the Big $$$ not for the average traveler! They deserve zero stars!At 1st glance this is a nice hotel. Then we checked in. The nasty smell in our room was overwhelming.  The staff was kind enough to move  us to another room. Yeah.... our room did not smell. On the other hand our safe did not work and the water pressure in the bathroom was less then impressive . The staff did compensate for the inconvenience of Changing rooms by offering us vouchers for there less then impressive breakfast buffet.  Just to add another family member checked into the hotel the next day and they were given our old room. That lasted less then one day due to the smell. They also moved them. I did want to add that the lobby and lobby restrooms are 2nd to none. So if you plan on staying in the lobby you will have it made.Our two day stay at this Hilton was average but below standard for being a Hilton. When we walked in there was some kind of funny smell to it. They also had very few amenities. No free breakfast . No free cookies like their sister hotel The Hampton always has. In fact I feel like The Hampton hotels are better than this Hilton. My husband was taking a bath and reached for the handicap bar to help him out of bathtub and it fell right off the tiled wall. Also there was a large wooden square behind the tv that just fell hanging from the wall which revealed old wallpaper behind it. Other than that it was just an average hotel. Nothing special for being called a Hilton.If it is available get a suite. Wonderful size, great space including a meeting table. Great ""L"" shaped desk and awesome bathroom size with double entry. The tv size is good, however the channels are disappointing. The channel guide is located in one of the books, which took a while to locate. Also, the channel guide is not accurate as the analog channels listed do not work. I only stayed one night and cannot provide more in depth info, except check out the South Park area. Beautiful, great dinning and shopping.If you haven't seen the pictures I have added, just imaging that you go into the bathroom of the Hilton, and there is brown sludge dripping from the ceiling.  They obviously know there was leakage, as they had plastered the ceiling to hide the problem.Not sure how hard it would have been to wipe the crap off the ceiling, but they just left it.  I could have gone down to complain, but I would have just changed to another crappy room.  Instead, I thought I would share my experience with you.Trust me, this place is not worth the money.  There are other hotels in the area that are cheaper in price that have better quality than this.Despite how nice a business is, if it's unethical then it deserves 1 star no matter what.  Not as if this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at, the bed is very comfy though.The unethical part is when I ordered a double bourbon on the rocks at the bar, and walked away with a $30 bill.  I inquired the next day about the price of the drink with the Restaurant Manager, and her response is ""That sounds about right.""  I said the menu upstairs has a cocktail with the same bourbon listed at $14, but I didn't receive a cocktail, just a double bourbon ($14 per shot).  Her response?  ""Oh that's because the cocktail only gets a half-pour.""WHAT!!  You mean to tell me this hotel not only exorbitantly over charges for alcohol that already has a high profit margin, but you are selling cocktails for $14 that don't even have a full ounce of spirit in it?  That is called shady and wrong.  Good job Hilton.  I hope this review makes you lose the money you are trying to save by ripping people off.This was a great hotel! We booked it at 12am the night before check in on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and got a rate of $67 after taxes/fees. Just a few miles from the airport, and so local to so many places- that we actually could have just walked. Pool was a nice temperature and it was pretty quiet. Beds were comfy, rooms were clean, and SHOWER HEADS WERE AMAZING!!! I ordered one online :) Great stay/great service :)This is a beautiful hilton in a great location pricey but the room was huge bathroom was clean, but at the price you pay you don't get free breakfast which is crazy !!!! You can find a place just as nice with more amenities !New-ish or at least very well maintained Hilton property that is well staffed and situated. It's not far from Charlotte Douglass Airport and is at the far end of the Executive Park which is a small inclusive commercial enclave. They not only have a BBQ joint, Japanese resto, Maserati Dealership, and a McDonalds, but they even have a strip club across the parking lot! Truly the spot to be if you value easy access by foot to a variety of places and are only in the area a short time. Hotel is average, but it's placement in the Executive Park raises it to above average.We arrived and was amazed to have a suite.  We paid a very reasonable rate and was astonished at the room.   Large bedroom with 2 large flat screen TV's.  An updated bathroom with luxury toiletries.  The living room had a large sofa, refrigerator &amp; microwave.  A door between the bedroom and the living area.  We were very pleased.  Quiet street with a few restaurants on it.  Very close to the Airport.  The bed was extremely comfortable with many pillows.  Could not ask for more!The hotel was nice, with clean, well appointed rooms. The real standout was the customer service. I was scheduled to fly out of CLT and my flight was cancelled, so I wasn't exactly in the best of spirits when I arrived. Ashely at reception was friendly, personable, and really went out of her way for me (e.g., she offered to let me use her phone charger to charge my phone, assisted me with troubleshooting the internet). I was really impressed. I would definitely come back!Room was large, bathroom was nice. Very clean from what I could tell. But, we were placed on the bottom floor (one floor below the lobby) with ZERO view out the window (which was ooookay) HOWEVER it felt like I'd entered the dungeon! It was just weird feeling and smelled like chlorine. Walls insane thin as every time someone walked past the room, I could hear what they were saying. Not likely to ever stay at this hotel again. ALSO there was some kind of water damage to the ceiling and let's just say that's not so nice to look at. (I just kept thinking, is it going to cave in??)Nice hotel, very clean and hospitable.This is my second stay at this hotel. I was pretty impressed the first time with the overall product but what really stands out to me this time is the staff. I have experienced nothing but awesome customer service in the three days that I have been here. Brian at the front desk is super friendly and full of great advice of things to do in the area and places to visit, I wish I could remember the bellman's name that helped get me to a store to get supplies at midnight when the airlines lost my luggage because he was so personable and great, and I am really impressed with Miguel in the restaurant who somehow always remembers my name and is so friendly whenever I see him. This hotel is great, you should stay here!Absolutely awful customer service. Found what appear to be bed bugs in my rooms and had to switch rooms TWICE in the middle of the night. The night manager did not apologize and did not offer to comp anything--even after I gave them a tissue that had the dead bug in it. They just keep saying they're investigating. Switched hotels.Good service...but it's an old hotel.   Lots of renovation going on.Gym is in the basement, kinda dismal. Rooms are ok, nothing great compared to newer Hiltons.Restaurant is good.There's a great sushi/hibachi place next door.I would stay here again.  The staff was receptive and the food in the restaurant was really good.  I recommend the pasta with the artichokes and sundried tomatoes over the ravioli.","My second choice next to the Marriott next door.  Nice rooms good service and tepid customer service.This is absolutely the worst hotel experience I have ever encountered!!  They did not honor the pre-determined rate....the ac was broken the entire 5 nite stay...our children's room, next door, had a leaking toilet &amp; sink throughout our stay....the trash cans were the most rediculous I have ever seen.....did not hold anything!!....some of our group were granted a $5.00 continental breakfast, while everyone else had to pay $15.00 per person for a sub-standard breakfast.....i will NEVER intend to patronize another Hilton, particularly in Charlotte, again!!!!!!!!!!!!!Excellent hotel....had to stay here due to canceled flight..newly renovated hotel..excellent service and the jumbo chicken wings at the bar were awesomeI reserved a King Room and the front desk confirmed this upon check in.  However, they did not give me a king room and said no more were available.  Also, I requested a room on a higher floor away from elevators (I am a really light sleeper.  I travel with ear plugs, etc) and at first they tried to put me on the first floor off of the lobby.  I asked to be moved and they accommodated me.  Still no King bed though.  The heating/cooling was really terrible.  It was  hot in there all the time and the temp in the room did not reflect the temp on the thermostat.  Also, there was an extremely loud guest a few doors down from me.  He talked and yelled and went in and out of his room until 3am.  There is a HUGE Mens Club next door do this hotel so it's no surprise really.  I liked that there were restaurants within walking distance.  This was nice as I did not have a rental car on this trip.I have Platinum Elite status at Marriott and wanted to try Hilton out for a change and work up my status with them so I'm staying here. For a Hilton this one is average. I bit worn on the edges if you get my meaning. Not run down or anything. Stuff like cobwebs in the exercise room, drywall patch to the bathroom ceiling, my desk is a bit loose, the vent in the bathroom is quite fuzzy from years of dust etc. This is stuff most 1 nighters or weekenders won't notice but spending 150+ nights a year in a hotel and you start to notice the little things. The staff are great so I give Hilton and A for customer service. My biggest gripe is their internet connection. The speed is capped at about 50kps which is fine for normal surfing but the connections have been timing out randomly for the last 3 days. I tried to write this review yesterday but I couldn't due to the crappy connection. Ironically, the other time I had connection issues was in a Hampton Inn (also Hilton property). No fridges or couches/chaise in the rooms is a minus for me as well.It's ok.  I'm not really impressed with the rooms on the executive floor but I like the lounge and the food that they always provide.  It's still bewildering that they haven't upgraded to plasma tv's.  The gym is nice, i like that all the treadmills have personal tv's you can plug into.  The service is great. The food.... not so good. Then again hilton doesn't have the greatest rep for food.  I'd prefer the doubletree hotel at southpark ANY day for food.  Get a new chef hilton!Very nicely decorated. The staff is pretty nice, but you definitely have to keep tabs on them. I had some unknown charges to my room, while the staff was very nice its not very detail oriented. The rooms have awesome furniture and nice layouts. I had a great stay overall.Decent hotel near the Charlotte airport. The hotel is right off the freeway and easy to find (there is a Marriott next door).The interior decor in the lobby and the rooms is very modern. I was surprised that they haven't replaced the massive in room tv's with plasmas. The TV in my bedroom wasn't working, but the TV in the sitting room was working. With that said, I'd be happy to stay here again. I'm a Hilton Diamond member and I will assume the room I was given was a mini-suite and not a regular room. Everything was clean and seemed newish.The executive lounge didn't have much of a breakfast spread, but it did have an impressive selection of newspapers and magazines.Parking is free. There is a costco and a Chili's next door to the hotel.Comfortable beds, down filled blankets make for a very cozy night.  Nice lobby and friendly staff.  The breakfast buffet had tasty sausage and fresh fruit galore.  The outdoor pool was so beautiful looking through the window - but once outside laying on the lounge chairs - the traffic noise was unbearable and constant - not relaxing at all - as were the noisy family with three kids and a drunken father and mother - who lets their kids throw lawn chairs into a pool?  After the family left - we actually had some fun and forgot about all the traffic noise.  The only complaint here was the noisy traffic area by the pool - otherwise a great place to stay.  Lots of places to eat around hotel and shopping mall just down the road a few miles.",,,,"['really', 'able', 'rate', 'hotel', 'attended', 'conference', 'meeting', 'rooms', 'chairs', 'comfortable',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baymont-inn-and-suites-charlotte-airport-charlotte,Baymont Inn And Suites Charlotte-Airport,1.0,$,27,"would get one star if it wasn't for Tim, the most enthusiastic and positively minded  shuttle driver in America. The front desk (yes, you robert) was terse, rude, and eye-stabbingly slow during a checkin of several stranded flyers. It was like he was deliberately moving slow just to punish us. check in with 4 people in line took over 35 minutes even though we all had the same airline voucher for our stay. I slept on top of the comforter at night after reading other reviews.My flight had mechanical problems so the airline gave me a voucher to stay here. It was pretty miserable overall. First the airline told me to call a number to get a shuttle, and no one answered. Finally got through to someone who said 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes later, I found a group of others who had just called and been told the same thing. Finally a shuttle shows up, and it's a minivan. Not everyone fits, so the guy says I'll be right back, and gets back 20 minutes later (side note: the ONLY saving grace at all is actually this shuttle driver. He takes us to the McDonald's drive-thru on the way because we're all starving and EVERYTHING in Charlotte is closed.) No issues checking in, but the hallways smell like, I don't know, a dingy apartment building, maybe? Not how a hotel is supposed to smell. Then I get to the room and the light switch right inside the door doesn't work. So I have to leave the door wide open to see and run across the room to turn on the light near the bed, which is creepy, because I'm alone and there seem to be a lot of older men million around even at 1am. The time on the alarm clock is wrong - thank god I checked. The wiring of the room is just terrible and there's a power strip hanging mid-air under the desk. There's flecks of paint all over the bathroom floor (one more ok thing: the water pressure in the shower was decent and the soap smelled great). I sleep for a couple hours and get downstairs at 7:35, just missed the 7:30 shuttle, and she says, there's not another one for an hour. I'm like what, my flight is at 9:25! She says she'll call the guy to come get me early. In the meantime, I check out the continental breakfast. There's what smells like bad milk in the mini fridge, only styrofoam cups for the juice in addition to the coffee (that sounds nit-picky, I know, but it's bad for the environment and unnecessary if the beverage isn't hot), and there still seem to be more than the average number of creepy middle-aged-to-older men. I think maybe they are long-term guests or something.Anyway, the shuttle guy (different driver than last night) shows up to get me ""early"" at 8:18am. Luckily I make my flight so we're all good. I'd definitely not go back there, especially not alone. I don't think the airline should send people there either.Do not stay here.  All the bad reviews are true.  Do not stay here.  Sleep in a rental car.  Sleep at the airport.Do not stay here.  Stains EVERYWHERE.  The smell was god-awful.  Do not stay here.  Nothing works.  The AC wouldn't stay on.  Do not stay here.  The refrigerator sounded like a freight train and had to be unplugged.  Do not stay here.  Furniture? Hairdryer?  Coffee machine?  Toilet seat? Broken.The good news... sign in the lobby said that they no longer accept cash and only accept payment with credit cards now.  I guess the strip joint next door wasn't turning out clientele that was aligned to their brand.I had reservations for 5 rooms for one night due to an over-night layover at the Charlotte airport.  My group of 9 people got stuck stuck in Port Au Prince, Haiti and were delayed and missed their connection in Miami to get to Charlotte.  The second I learned they wouldn't make it to Charlotte for the night I called the hotel to cancel the reservation.  I realize it puts the hotel in a tough spot but it was something we had no control of.  I would have been happy if they had reduced the charge just a little bit but no, $115.00 x 5 = $575.00 straight to them for no services rendered.  Will not use them again.  I did, however find a hotel near the Charlotte airport that has great services, prices, and are more helpful - It's the Comfort Suites Airport.  Their address and phone number are: 3425 Mulberry Church Rd, Charlotte, NC 28208  Phone:(704) 971-4400.  They charged less by $15 a night and had nicer rooms.Sadly I did not know any of these reviews before getting my so called discounted rate. I thought AA would set me up with something a little nicer; and please note I payed the same as I would have if I went online. There was no real discount. If I knew this or any other review I would have gladly payed and took my business elsewhere.   Room is pretty dirty and since reading other reviews I'm sleeping clothed on top of the bed.  I will not make this mistake again.  I have stayed in better hostels overseas then this place. Staff was friendly but I will never stay at this hotel chan again and will gladly pay another $40 elsewhere so I can at least live comfortably and not worry about bed bugs or cockroaches. I wish I could be refunded and I would gladly go somewhere worth while even if I'm only in my hotel room for 6-7 hrsThis is about as gross as you can get.... it smells horrible and utterly  flithy. AVOID THIS HOTEL!  But seriously,  it smells disgusting and it's nauseating. Another tragic feature or lack of feature is that there are no curtains to close when you want to sleep or undress. The entire parking lot can see into your room.  Sadly,  there was a street light right outside of my window that was shining in my room and it was really hard to sleep (see pic).The worst hotel i have stayed in period.  I made the mistake of thinking that USAirways/AA would have put their customers in a decent place due to a flight issue that was caused by a personal issue.  After waiting over 45 mins for shuttle, there wasn't enough room so i grabbed a cab.  Thankfully beat the full shuttle there, I was almost checked in before they got there.  I was told to be down at 415 to leave for airport next morning.  Hotel room was plain, old, gross and has definitely seen much better days about 30 years ago.  Had an issue getting on shuttle in the morning, was told that because i didnt sign some clipboard that was to determine who and what seats were available for each shuttle.  However the woman who checked me in was the one that took care of it for me...how the heck would i know to be downstairs at 415a?  Just a mess all around, thankfully backseat riders squeezed over so all could fit.  If you absolutely have to stay here, know you have been warned.  I personally will never do it again, I will stay at another hotel on my dime.Oh and don't say my room number out loud in front of others...talk about a security risk and think about the safety of your hotel guests!!This place SUCKS and I HIGHLY recommend not staying here no matter what the situation. I typically would not write such a negative review unless it was completely warranted. I contracted BED BUGS (see posted photo for proof)!!!!My husband and I stayed here this past weekend. We were supposed to drive back to Atlanta Saturday night but decided against it because it was late at night, so we looked for a decently priced hotel where we could just crash and wake up early to drive back. WRONG DECISION ON EVERY LEVEL. Do not let any photos deceive you. This place is disgusting, bug infested, probably a trucker/prostitute hotel without air conditioning. We ended up changing rooms at 1 am because the first room had no A/C and it was 90 degrees in our room. They initially said there was no availability but would send a maintenance guy to fix it. Over an hour later and sweating profusely, we had to call back down to reception and inquire since no one showed up to fix the A/C. She completely DID NOT care about the situation, but ALL OF A SUDDEN *magically* there was another room available. To make a long story short, we left the hotel at 5 am and upon returning to Atlanta I  noticed I had a minor rash. FLASH forward to Monday morning and I had a full-blown bed bug bites/massacre all across my stomach, chest and full back. DISGUSTING to say the very least. With all costs included: $100/night for the WORST hotel room of all-time, $100 in doctors bills/medication, this was absolutely the WORST experience ever. DO NOT gamble your health on staying at this place, its not worth it. This place needs to be shut down.Sucky to the Max!  Hooker hotel, bed bugs, got electrocuted- lamp chord shredded in half and almost caused a fire. I slept fully clothed. On a positive note- the front desk staff was very attentive!Place was disgusting! Room was dirty and the maid forgot to clean it before I got in. This made me so uncomfortable!!! Not recommendedI am commenting regarding this hotel's denial to provide a room to a US military serviceman. WTF are you people thinking? To deny service for a person who may, god forbid, put his LIFE in peril for our country! The sacrifices that this young person has made to ensure that our way of life continues, and yet to turn him out into the streets? The apology emails were, although seemingly sincere, are too late. Your establishment had committed a foul and I hope others will spread the word of your company's position regarding service members. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! .......Sgt. USMCThe worst experience I have ever had was staying here. After missing a connecting flight on US Airway due to an engine problem they had offered us to stay at this place. All the reviews here are so true. If only I had read the reviews before I would have preferred to stay in the airport floor or book a hotel and pay for it instead. The carbon monoxide alarm went off and the flash strobe light went off for the rest of the night. There was no phone to even call the front desk and tell them of the incident. We were so tired but didn't sleep all night. In the morning we told the person at the front desk and he didn't even seem to care..just asked what room number we were in.. Didn't say sorry or anything. If I could leave a -5 rating I would.Worst hotel ever!!! Completely disgusting and the staff was rude!!! The hotel reeked of cigarettes and our room looked like a homeless person was living in it. Also, It appeared that there were ""transactions"" being made in the lobby. I would rather sleep on the floor of the airport then ever return to this repulsive hotel.US Air bungled my connection at Charlotte international airport and put me up at this motel for the night. + only 1.8 miles away from airport+ front desk checked me in under two minutes - I found the alarm clock unplugged, the phone doesn't work at all and the TV remote control can mute but it doesn't change channels - The shuttle only goes to the airport once an hour- the parking lot is partially flooded when it rains. There appears to be drainage issues- The hotel decor is outdated by 25 or 30 years and looks very rundown, dirty- hallway lighting is insufficient- The electricity outlets are so beat up that my chargers for my phone and Mac won't even stay in them so I can't even get any work done- $59/night (paid by US air) seems expensive for the quality of this property. On a side note, U.S. Air should be embarrassed for putting passengers in this motel to suffer.I wish I could give a zero. The airline gave my family a voucher to stay here. I wish they hadn't. I would have rather slept on the airport's floor. The hotel reeks of smoke which is conducive to the fact my sheets had cigarette burns in them. Speaking of the bed, sheets are all they have. No blankets. The comforter usually folded at the end of the bed was in fact a table runner. And the heater didn't work! The front desk insisted we wait outside in the snow for the shuttle which was an hour late. They said we would miss it if not. Upon arrival, they gave us keys to an occupied room and we scared the day lights out of the poor girl inside. Just don't.The best part about this hotel is that I get to rate it one star, which helps even out my Yelp profile as I had way too many four and five star reviews and was starting to look like a nice person.This is the worst hotel I've seen in the past fifteen years... And that counts inner city gems in New Delhi, Kabul and Cusco. US Airways (another one star review) made me miss my connection by exactly two minutes (I was running up as they were closing the door) and then informed me I couldn't stay in the airport and gave me a number to call to get a discounted room. Two hours on hold and seventy dollars later, I take the shuttle to the Baymont and experience the horrors. After receiving several of those looks that make my 'woman traveling alone' spidey senses fire off, I rode the Guantanamo Bay hotbox of an elevator up to the second floor, musing how the hallway carpet had the same tack to it as a theater floor after several matinee showings of a children's movie. Things got better as I opened my door and was greeting by a wall of endocrine system altering air 'freshener.' The carpet here appeared to have the consistency of the AstroTurf lining a South Jersey motel pool and black marks and dents covered the walls.  Turning to shut the door, I issued a bitter laugh after noting the door chain and no receiver to slide it in to. Rather than deal with a room reassignment, I wedged a chair under the door handle and removed the stained comforter with the alacrity of a stage performer pulling a tablecloth from under Steuben crystal. Inspecting the sheets, I elected to sleep on top of the fitted sheet and under the large scarf I travel with for such instances. The ultimate affront occurred after I plugged my phone charger into the wall and turned to set the phone down on the night stand, pausing in a stomach churning frozen stance after seeing the wasteland that was not one, but both bedside tables. What appeared to be greasy, sticky, smeared handprints covered both... as well as the headboard. I winced, put the phone on the bed next to me and stretched out crosswise, trying to split the difference between the foot of the bed and the headboard of horrors. The night continued. At approximately 3:30 AM, someone slid a key into my door lock, and opened the door as far as it would go against my chair barrier. ""Who are you and what are you doing?!"" I yelled (with more expletives) as I sprung to the floor, contemplating using a lamp as a shillelagh. ""Oh... Sorry... My bad...""  The interloper left, neglecting, of course, to shut the door fully.At 5 AM, my phone rang. ""Hello?"" I asked, groggily.""Who is this?"" Came a thickly accented voice from the other side.""No, who am I talking to? You tell me first.""""This is the front desk. I must know who is in this room."" ""I filled out your information sheet at check in, you can look at that and find out."" I hung up.Breakfast featured powdered dairy creamer and stale corn flakes and fruit loops. Despite the subsidization of this hotel by the airport and US Airways, I still believe in the power of the free market and feverishly hope against hope that this place will implode back into the gaping maw from whence it emerged. Until then, don't stay there, folks!After my  flight was cancelled, this is the hotel that I was provided with by the airline. After a 50 minute wait for a shuttle to the hotel, I arrived at the front desk and then waited 20 minutes because the computer was down. Finally got to the room, and the TV had no remote and would not turn on at the switch.  Then I noticed a piece of what looked like a broken grounding post off of a cord to a hair dryer stuck in the bathroom outlet.  This is the worst hotel that I've ever stayed in,  negative star rating.If I could give it ZERO stars I would. DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION. Rooms are filthy and the managers make you feel slightly uncomfortable. We saw the room and left. Kind of the scene for a thriller movie.Was put here after I missed my connection.  Clearly, as my mom always reminds me, you get what you pay for.  After sitting at the airport last night for about half an hour waiting for the shuttle, now told that the shuttle will be 10 minutes late this morning.  That was 20 minutes ago.  Not a surprise given other comments on this place.Unpleasant stale odor?  Check.Seedy feel?  Check.Owner clearly milking this place for every dime. The only partially redeeming quality?  Front desk associate was friendly and courteous.Thankfully, I don't plan on missing a lot of flights at CLT...I booked this hotel on price line it was rated a 2 star I don't know how? The pictures looked good so I gave it a shot what a nightmare! I booked a nonsmoking king size bed and. And when I got there they said they didn't have any.  So it was late I missed my flight I was tired I noticed the security monitor on the front desk with and cameras ever where. It made me feel it was unsafe. The Indian guy at the counter was nice. So I took the elevator that was very old and missing buttons to the second floor and the second floor was scary no lights only a couple very dim. They had old furniture from other rooms in the hallway! So I finally get to my room and same thing only 2 small lights very dim the ceiling was chipping away carpet has tons of stains and the pillows were a joke. I couldn't sleep because the bugs in the bed were itching me. I checked in at midnight checked out at 6 am went to the airport hours early. I don't get why the Indian hotel owners are so cheap and dirty. The room cost me $70.00 was not worth $20 this place should be a motel. I will never ever stay at a bay mont inn again. Oh I almost forgot the shower smelled like bo (body odor)","This hotel is gross. There is a sign in the lobby that states they have a 94 sanitation rating, but my husband and I would never have believed that. The hotel looked run down, unkempt, dirty, and like the kind of place that could be reserved by the hour. We were on the first floor and had to walk by the laundry room to get to our room. The door to the laundry room was always open and unpleasant smells were wafting all over. There were  multiple stains in the carpet and the door across the hall from us looked like it had been kicked in - there were paint shards all over the floor from where it had obviously been kicked off the door. The lobby was very unkempt, with chunks of wall and ceiling missing and an overall dirty feeling. It also took a ridiculously long time to check in and out.The room felt dirty, there were cigarette burns in the nightstands of our nonsmoking room, there was no comforter on the bed, and I was afraid of what I'd find on the sheets if I looked closely. There was no remote when we got there and after requesting one, it still didn't work. We had to have a maintenance guy come to our room. The bathroom looked clean enough, but we didn't spend a lot of time in there. Husband went to find an ice machine, the sole of which is located on the 3rd floor, and was so sketched out by the elevator that he took the stairs down, which were no better. He said he felt as though he'd turn come down a flight and find someone peeing in the corner.There were lots of loud noises while we were there: banging, yelling, door slamming, etc. We were planning to partake in the free continental breakfast, but after experiencing the overall ""ickiness"" of the hotel, we decided to pass. As we were checking out, another guest came to the front desk to inform the staff that the orange juice was coming out as water. We ate breakfast at Mattie's Diner instead and it it was delicious. I will never stay at a Baymont hotel again.I was placed at this property because of a missed flight connection and had to stay in Charlotte overnight.  I had stayed at this property two years previously due to a similar flight issue and was pleased to be sent to this location again - until I arrived!The property has clearly undergone a change in management since my last ""visit.""  The quality of the property has seriously deteriorated.  The property is warn and unclean.  After checking in, I requested a wake-up call and was told that the telephone and email service of the property were down ""because of the flood.""  It was suggested I use the alarm clock in the room - which turned out to be broken.  The next morning when I asked what time the shuttle to the airport would be leaving, I was told that it would be delayed because ""You know how the airport traffic is!""  How am I supposed to know Charlotte airport traffic when I live in Los Angeles?!Called ahead off the North Carolina Travel coupons 1-4 people $55 night . Manager on midnight duty on the night of 3/10/14 said come in and we will work it out when we questioned the type of beds . Once there he was incompetent enough to say he had to call his manager to verify the price in the add I had handed him . I was floored when he said it was for a single room and if we wanted 2 beds it would be $79 . When I questioned the add and the common sense when it stated 1-4 people , he unbelievably said it was one bed and I said it didn't make sense 1 bed 4 people . "" you can fit 4 people in a king bed "" is what he said. At first wasn't sure if he was serious or joking . Very unprofessional and it was obvious it was a shake down . As I waited I notice how dirty and run down the lobby looked . It  looked more like a hooker/ drug motel . As I walked out upset I realize how a blessing it was not to stay in that place with my kids . They need to have a no star option .... Stay away don't waste your breath or time with this place.We waited for an hour for the shuttle and ended up taking a cab because it never showed up, even when we called the front desk and she said it was ""on it's way.""  The hotel is run down and has a funny smell.  Room was not very clean, bed was made with new sheets but it was tough falling asleep on 30 thread count sheet.  Would not recommend it.Hotel was like others said old and ran down feeling.  Smelled like an old building that hadn't been used in a long time.  Wall socket had a short in it, had to wiggle the cords in the socket to get it to work.  Fire Hazard?  I think so!   On a very positive note, the bed was exceptionally good.Avoid this hotel.  The rooms and hallways felt somewhere between cheap dormitory and prison.  Walls are not very soundproof, I heard yelling in the next room until 4 am.  The overall feel is dirty, in spite of the sanitation score listed in the lobby.  Did not feel safe trying the free breakfast, so I have no idea how it was.I really don't understand why people would expect some grandiose experience from a place like this. No false advertising on their part! The place is gross. No doubt. I'm talking stains: Chocolate syrup? Blood? Food? Definitely. Mystery stains? Definitely. You'll find some burn holes on your ""non-smoking room"" blankets, not that you'll be touching those anyway. Seriously, don't. I slept on top of everything in full garb. Still didn't feel safe. Don't touch the floor either. Nonetheless, you totally get what you pay for at this place. As for the guy at the front office, he had a very pleasant disposition. He boasted at length about the shuttle service they offered, which is completely free. Derrick, the gentleman who does a kick ass job with the shuttle, is rarely informed about people who have scheduled a ride through the hotel, until roughly 30 minutes to an hour before. (He runs at every quarter past the hour.)  Mind you, he totally bucks up and does it, but come on amicable dude at the hotel, give this poor guy more than a 9 minute (!!!) heads up at 5am. So, to conclude my lengthy ramble, hotel is repulsive. Shuttle is fantastic.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-meridien-charlotte-charlotte-2,Le Meridien Charlotte,2.0,$$$,30,"My family and I stayed at this hotel this past week for the belk bowl. I had some reservations about staying here given the really poor reviews on Yelp. But I can honestly say the negative reviews were not warranted. We had an excellent experience. The staff was extremely helpful and the service was outstanding. Rooms were clean and comfortable; locations was great to all downtown locations. I would recommend this hotel for sure.I tried to give this hotel so many chances. But alas - you can put a lipstick on a pig and it is still a pig. It has a fancy lobby and kind of reminiscent of a Real World House. So it strikes you as cool and hip and perhaps new. But I believe it was just an old facade slapped with some new (wobbly) IKEA furniture. To begin - they don't have enough people staffed at ANY part of the hotel. My service for meals at the restaurant never took any less than an hour and ordering was always a sit and wait game. The front desk was always struggling to keep up. Calling down for valet service would just ring and ring and rings. And then the actual valet - woof. It didn't matter what time of day it was. It would take approx 20 minutes to get a vehicle. From a lot a mere 50 yards away. It just seemed like there was no level of dedication or work ethic to hell please guests. The room - well my clock was missing the hands, the wallpaper was peeling, the air conditioner had a very obnoxious clicking sound, the shower pressure was a drizzle, and the mini bar was an empty fridge. The bed was somewhat comfortable I suppose. I always hate leaving bad reviews - but maybe it will help them in the long run.Not really sure what all the complaints are about.The staff has been very nice. Tina at the front desk was other worldly with her patience and friendliness over an issue that was caused by our group not being able to count heads correctly. The rooms are clean. The suite is expansive. I'm sure I could point out little things if I wanted to be unreasonable.We valeted and that worked great for us.Would stay here again in a heartbeat.Went to Charlotte for a concert with friends, wanted to stay at a nice hotel and not feel like I was on a business trip. Found this hotel, read reviews, weren't so great but thought it looked better than what was posted. Gotta say glad we stayed here. Exactly what I was hoping. Nice rooms, great view, great service. It's literally connected to another hotel, which did seem to cater to the biz trip people. Definitely go again....I met an out-of-town client at the restaurant in Le Meridian and we had their breakfast buffet not only was the booth about fall apart the food was awful I cannot recommend eating here and won't be backWorst of all SPG' and here are the reasons :1. Inefficient front desk management and poor staff utilization - you could spend hours waiting for your need because they didn't listen to what you want - the first time.  I wanted a room with a very good view of the city and I repeatedly made this clear at the front desk. They assured me the same and gave me a room which was facing the opposite side. Eventually I had to spend an hour to get a better room.2. The television in my room was disconnected3. The internet did not work on the first night and I had to spend an hour with their IT team when they later admitted next day that the problem was generic and not just for me.4. The internet on the later days of no better - they dragged from one page to the other.I would definitely recommend Westin you are a hardcore SPG fanI have been to a lot of hotels in my time. Some are great, some not so great, but Le Meridien Charlotte has won the distinction of being the WORST HOTEL I have ever stayed at. This is suppose to be part of the Startwood Luxury Portfollio.  In realty it is not. Although the hotel itself has a nice decor if you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig! I had to wait 15 minutes because there was 1 check in clerk.  Finally the Manager stepped up and checked people in. So far not a good first impression. The room itself was nice, and offered a great view of Uptown Charlotte (in the distance). This hotel is not really located in the walkable section of Uptown which I liked because I was looking for a nice quite weekend away.  The bathroom offers only a shower (no tub) and is quite small. After checking in I was going to order room service but no one answered on my 3 attempts to call them. I finally just walked down to the bar and ordered a drink and a hamburger.  Both were good. Not as good as the staff made them out to me, and I was taken aback by the fact it came with no fries or sides.   The Butterscotch Budino was different than I had it before and was quite enjoyable.  It was a little saltier and a little sweeter than in past times so the shortbread cookies served with it really help cut the flavoring so it wasn't over powering. Retiring to my room to read a book I was bothered by the LOUD noises coming from the room ACROSS THE HALL.... Not next door to me.. ACROSS THE HALL. I called the front desk to have them send the manager up so he can hear how loud it was. 10 minutes later the noise is still going on and no manager so I walked down to the front desk where the manager more or less told me that the hotel has a noise policy starting at 11pm so until then enjoy your room! I immediately called Starwood Preferred Guest services requesting a new hotel. They were very helpful and accommodating and as they were finding me another hotel the Manager moved me to another room. Again, the room was nice, but the Bathroom was the size of a closet. The only reason this hotel is getting one star is because the bed is really comfortable. I was able to get a restful night sleep but their was no Valet to take my car when I returned, yet I was charged for Valet Parking. The next morning hoping to get a nice rest in I was awoken by a screaming child running up the hall and a screaming parent running after them.  That is the class of people that go to this hotel. People with no manners or common sense. Why I can't figure out as it is not within walking distance to Uptown Bars and Clubs. I always laugh when I see someone write as a tip pick another hotel.  However reading the other reviews of this property I see that statement more times than not.   So head everyones advice.  Pick another hotel. My two night stay was cut short and I moved to the Hyat House to try to salvage my weekend get-a-way.I was dismayed when I booked a room here and then checked Yelp. It's not quite as bad as the reviews suggest, but they have quite a ways to go at Charlotte Center City.First of all, if you get lost, the hotel is located at the Sheraton. There is no signage. There are two buildings, two ""hotels"" under one name. The taller building is the Center City hotel. It makes you wonder what kind of corporate mumbo jumbo is going on here, Starwood. After driving around Uptown Charlotte for 15 minutes trying to find the hotel, I was greeted and checked in by one of the more awkward dudes ever. I'm uncertain he should have that position, given that he just made me feel...weird, but whatever. I had also reserved a king-sized bed and apparently it was taken. My parking was comped, but still, not cool.When I got into my room, I saw that it hadn't been cleaned very well. There was a water bottle that had some sort of red Kool-Aid liquid still in it on the floor under the baggage table. My window, which had a lovely view of Uptown, was besmirched with no less than a dozen smudges, as if a bunch of tweens pressed their greasy foreheads against the glass. I asked the cleaning lady to windex the windows the next day and she did.Wallpaper was coming off the wall (perhaps the fidgety tweens pulled it off). After reading the horror stories on Yelp, I was dismayed that I booked here, but I gave it a chance.The customer service here was pretty good. Lots of greeting and the door and wake up calls with ACTUAL PEOPLE CALLING YOU. That was a nice touch. The amenities weren't bad, but if you like Starwood Hotels, I would go the extra mile and just pay for the Westin. You are kinda close to Uptown, but not really. Anything you actually want to go visit via walking is about 15-25 minutes away.This hotel has a lot of work to do still. I can see they are trying. I would just keep at it, keep getting good people to work here. The management has a tough job ahead of them. A super clean room upon arrival would have made my review more kind, but as it was, it was kind of gross and unacceptable.Some of the lights did not work in the room.  The shower was a trickle of water.  Coffee station didn't work.  Ordered breakfast and it showed up a half hour late.  Their explanation was that there was no one to run it so they just left it in the kitchen.  Honestly from the outside this place looks great.  Nice lobby and pleasant staff but they don't deliver.  If you have other choices stay elsewhere.  Plus---the bed was comfy.This place is HORRIBLE! 1) The front desk is clueless and incompetent. We asked 4-5 times for a fan in our room because the AC in this crappy, old building sucks. They kept promising that it would be taken care of...NOPE. 2) The room blows. We upgraded to a suite which is directly next to the elevator. The neighbor has been blasting TV for the past 24 hours straight...we asked for something to be done about it. They said of course. Guess what?? NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. 3) Turn down service and housekeeping was bad as well. 4) The vents have been cleaned maybe once in the past decade. I woke up and couldn't breathe out of my nose.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T COME NEAR THIS HORRID HOTEL. It's awful and not worth any amount of money or trouble. Honestly, you couldn't pay me to stay here again. Kill me now!!!This place has been a consistently terrible experience. Like many at the SEVC, I stayed here and have been sorely disappointed - terrible choice!!!  The hotel is over 40 years old and the ""multi-million dollar transformation"" is just paint and duct tape. ""Ghetto"" is the best description of this hotel. The staff are not trained and, frankly, just plain rude.No AC for several days.  Did not seem to care.  One night asked for an update and the best she could give was 5 hours old.Only warm and cold water.For a newly renovated (lipstick cover ups). Will never stay here again.If I could give zero stars I would. Abismal  customer service, extensive call rerouting, the disjointed reservation system, and supervisors who do not make call backs. This expereice shows how little the cusotmer is valued and how unwilling, after several requests to do so, for this company to recieve feedback from customers (apparently the Utah headquaters does not ""take calls"").  A lot of improvement needed here and I will not be utilizing them again.Upon check in the staff was extremely professional and customer friendly. We stayed overnight on the 16th floor. I added the floor number because not sure how updated the other floors are. Our room was completely renovated and clean. I have allergies and can tell immediately if a room is dusty and this room was very clean. Staff was friendly and responsive. We ate in the restaurant the staff was professional. I ordered the scallops. They were good but a little too salty. We went to the pool. It's your standard pool. The sauna was not working and the pool water was cold. The area needed some updating but it was clean. I past by the gym. It was a nice size with newer equipment and several options. I would stay here again.We stayed at this hotel last night and it was great. The construction that previous reviews mentioned is complete and the hotel is modern and very beautiful inside. The front desk staff was very helpful and quick to get us checked in and made sure to give us a room with a nice view since we are from out of town. The room was nice and modern, very clean with complementary water bottles and an espresso machine. The bathroom floor was heated - was great not having cold toes in the morning! Don't know if all rooms have that as we were in a handicap accessible room. Checkout was easy and it was very easy to hail a cab to downtown charlotte from the Sheraton directly next door. Bed was so comfortable!As previous reviews mentioned the signage is bad. We drove around the block once before I ran in to double check we were at the right spot. The sign says le meridian, it is directly next to the Sheraton the taller of the two towers. Only downside was that we could hear people in the hallway in the morning, not super insulated. But it wasn't horrible eitherWe would stay here again, especially at their current rates. Cheapest place in downtown we could find!Yes, the hotel is newly renovated, but it's all just a facade.  The heat crapped out in the middle of the night.  The wall clock in my room had no hands.  There was no lock on the door connecting the adjoining room, just a chain that would stop much.  Cleanliness is also a major concern.Very soft mattress, too soft, but nice bedding. Check in smooth but I could see how too small if they were busy. Very contemporary lobby and decor in rooms. Bathrooms are too small. Thinnest door in a nice hotel I have ever experienced. I could hear the lady in her room talking across the hall from me.Was going to give this a 1 star review but the hotel does have some redeeming qualities. I am traveling with my spouse. The first thing we encountered was that there are signs in the parking garage to the Hotel Entrance door so you don't have to walk through the 99 degree heat to get to the front desk. It was locked in the middle of the day. The signs said it would be locked after 10pm. So trudge through the heat we did. They did unlock it after we brought it to their attention and we were able to get through it later.  We had no trouble with the front desk and got a room on the 17th floor. I like the room - modern decor and a nice bed. My beef is completely about the bathroom. It is an adequate size but I don't think they had any women test it out before they landed on their fixtures. There is a single sink with a wide, square/ rectangular bowl, which looks great but the sides of the sink are about 2 inches wide and angled down toward the indentation for the sink. There is no flat place to place a curling iron without having it fall into the sink. You could put it on the toilet tank but then your cord stretches across the sink and it might not reach. I ended up putting toiletries and plug ins on the top of the toilet tank (also not flat) and on the flat shelf of the vanity under the sink which is literally 4 inches off the floor. The stall shower has no door - there is a glass wall that covers about 60% of the opening to the bathroom, which means there is always water on the floor and the tile is slippery. There is room in the bathroom for another small vanity with a mirror that would be a great addition. This is NOT a bathroom to share with anyone and it is merely adequate for one. On the other hand, the in-house restaurant, Evoke, and the in-house bar, Longitudes, are fantastic. We both had the best and freshest tasting pasta sauces we have had in a year at least. And Xavier, the bar tender, is an award winning magician and fantastic mixologist. We told him our favorite cocktails and he made us something similar but different and very tasty. We will go back to the bar and restaurant even if we don't stay here again.You simply cannot put lipstick on this pig. This hotel is a blight on Charlotte and the general institution of hospitality.  The ""multimillion-dollar transformation"" of this dilapidated building has done nothing other than put a thin veneer of paint on the 42 year old black mold spores and metric tons of dust and decay of the hotel built in 1972 . You can literally see the cob webs and dust balls in the HVAC vents. If you can't see them, just breath the air for 8 hours and you'll feel the detritus. The only ""transformation"" that would make this facility worth staying is to level it and build it per modern standards. The deplorable state of the facility is only eclipsed by the poor level of service and total lack of training by the staff.  It's obvious the staff that work here have not been properly equipped to handle the demands of the type of hotel this facility holds itself out to be. The Southeastern Venture Conference  (SEVC) held its event here this year versus the Ritz-Carlton of years back (a hotel and level of service well worth praise). I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest platinum level and big SEVC supporter. I will never attend another event at this decrepit old building full of under appreciated and undertrained staff.DO NOT STAY HEREApparently it's two hotels, one property - Sheraton Charlotte and Charlotte Center City Hotel (formerly the Blake).1. Crime scene - Saturday March 1 there was a shooting during the CIAA event here. Two people shot, one trampled. You can google it.2. No liquor license - As a result of #1, they have no liquor license. One of the staff told me it turns out they have been without a liquor license for months prior. 3. Under construction - not just renovation, but full bore drilling and demolition. ""Pardon our mess"" does not cover drilling during daylight hours. My first use (and last) of Hotwire landed me here. Trust me, nothing in the Hotwire description said anything about renovations. I had to put up a royal fit to (1) actually speak with someone in guest services because the front desk apparently doesn't handle and (2) make them move me to the Sheraton side where they aren't drilling for oil. The bait-and-switch, fraudulent act is so egregious, yet I had to argue about it.4. Local area shuttle - Extremely limited. Mon-Fri, 7:00 am to 9:00 am, and only runs in a loop around the Uptown area. I'm in town for business. I don't know the ""Uptown loop."" The office I'm trying to get to is 1.2 miles away. I asked the front desk guy if the office address was in the loop. I thought he was looking it up on the internet, but it turns out he was simply dismissing me and looking away.5. Car service - So I asked the bellman about a cab. He calls over the car service. I know about car services. I didn't think it would cost me $25 to go 1.2 miles. The driver kept telling me a sob story, possibly to milk a tip out of me. I used Uber another day and it was $10.6. Poor service - Front desk acts like they're doing me a favor. Even calls to the front desk ring and ring and ring. Housekeeping is uneven (I've been here 5 nights so far and I tip the housekeeper). I've received one or two towels from day to day. The one nice person was the guy who was inspecting my second room; this came after I nearly had a breakdown in the hallway.7. No coffee pot - If you're in the non-Sheraton side, there is no coffee pot. When I asked the front desk about this, they sent one up. However, supplies aren't consistently replenished. I went to the restaurant to get cups, sugar, and h&amp;h. 8. The room - The original room was newly renovated and looks nice at first glance. But then you notice thing like duct tape holding up the art, the clock on the wall doesn't work, no towel racks, etc. The new room in the Sheraton tower is much smaller, old, and looks more like a well-worn Holiday Inn Express (BTW I like HIEs and you get coffee and breakfast). I would have expected someone along the way to say, ""Gosh we're really sorry we've disappointed you. Let me treat you to breakfast tomorrow morning"" or some other conciliatory gesture. But no. Just a general attitude that I'm crazy for expecting better.","This hotel is very nice. The staff is extremely friendly and the bartender are excellent. The checkin process was quick and seamless. I stayed at this location for a conference weekend which meant Charolette was extremely busy. The hotel is in uptown however, far walk from the time warner or epic centre on a cold day. The location is not   walking distance like they say. However, the hotel was great to provide a car service to anywhere you want to go downtown for 10. Since traffic was so bad the car service could not come pick us up for return trip. The rooms are nice it was clean. The beds are comfortable to sleep in. The room has poor lightning and random light switches that do not work any they must have forgot to take them out from remodeling. The lights switches that did work were hard to turn on and off. The bathroom in the room was small, since shower doesn't have full slide door the floor got wet. Overall the hotel is a great stay except location. I would stay there again if I'm in charolette on a warmer weekend because of the rooftop bar.Hotel experience was the worst! They started extremely loud construction at 10am on a Sunday. When we called the front desk to complain, they told us that's just the way it is. They wouldn't let us check in an hour early, which is understandable, but that was a first for me. They should discount the rooms during construction!I came in town for a conference and had no choice but to book here. First of all it was a bit clunky checking in. Because it is directly connected to the Sheraton, it is easy to get confused as to where to check in. The rooms look nice, bed is comfortable but the bathroom sucks!!! Very tiny. Hard to move around much and a low flow shower. I mean really low flow! There is only about 50-60% door covering the shower but it's okay because there is virtually no pressure to worry about. We found old water bottles and trash left in the room and the walls are paper thin! At 5:00am we were awaken by the detailed sexual encounter next door! The worst part is they really weren't that loud! We just could hear everything!!!! Very embarrassing! One elevator in the hotel cancels the ride and sends you back to the first floor this happened repeatedly. Kinda scary. I am giving this hotel the number of stars because in spite of Everything the staff was great and the stay was not terrible. Definitely could have been better. I would not have paid full price. Not worth the $200+ nightly rate.I'm a frequent  traveler and this is the worst room service experience I've ever had. No one answers the phone at room service. The front desk has to walk over the order. Then they have go over and check on it. 1.5 hours and counting- to make a salad.Had two cockroaches on the floor, sink and shower were nasty, old sheets, remote control to tv didn't work. All for $90! Way overpriced, spend the extra $20-30 and get a nicer hotel, trust me it is definitely worth it over staying at this run down hotel. Oh yea and to top it over we had a homeless guy come knock on our door at 3 am asking for money! Sounds safe right?The people were nice enough but the process and the property are very lacking.  Upon arrival what I had booked (directly with them) was not available.  Staff upgraded my room at no charge, after they tried to get me to pay the difference, and did get us into a room that worked out for the number of people staying.  Next..small but on par, the Espresso machine in the room did not work.  Instead of just replacing we had a couple of people in and out of the room trying to ""fix"" it while we were trying to prepare and leave for the night.  They finally brought in a new machine.  Worst of all, the room reeked of cigarette smoke.  It took a bit to notice (air freshener covered it for a while) but it was really bad.  They could not put us in another room since this was all they had to accommodate us.  They did leave us a spray bottle of air freshener in the room.  Upon check out more apologies for the issues and some points added to our account but I can't imagine trusting this brand / ownership again and ever using them.i chose this hotel based upon the online pictures and a presumed quality of standard that would be expected  in a four star Starwood Hotels property.   What a mistake.  $300 a night for a room in a hastily remodeled shoddy excuse for an upscale hotel.  At check in, we were told that the hotel had been over booked and there were  no rooms available with king beds even though this was what I had reserved.  ""I can give you a room on a higher floor, is this okay"" I was asked....well NO it's not when you are offering me a room with two double beds.  We ended up being placed in a handicap accessible room with a king bed.  Fine.  Until we got to the room.  The desk chair was broken, the air conditioned sounded like a freight train and the bathroom was still covered in left over grout residue from the remodel.  We were then back at the front desk, and given another room.  The next room still had a broken desk chair and the grout in this bathroom was worse.  It looked like toddlers had been hired to finish the bathroom.  A ridiculous standard of quality for a four star hotel.  In addition the bathroom door and wall of the bathroom were splattered with something black.  Oh yeah, and there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling and drywall mud dried and dripping off of the light fixture over the bed. I do not understand how any hotel owner or manager could find these rooms acceptable.   Charlotte has better options for this kind of money.  Do not be fooled by the great marketing photos, this place is a dump. I wish I could post photos to accompany this review.Can't believe how bad the service has been at this particular Sheraton!!! Nickel and dining you for everything!!!! We'll never stay here again!!!Don't stay here. I'll sum it up like this: They tried to force me to take a double queen instead of the king I paid for, I insisted and got the king room. In the room it had dirty towels( had stains ), then there was mold on the tile in the bathroom along with freshly spattered BLOOD, the coffee maker  set up was on a cubby shelf with no outlet so I made coffee on the floor, I called before making the reservation and asked if they were still renovating- they said no, two days later when I arrived the entire place was being worked on and sharing elevators with the workers and tools not appealing, I can go on... Oh and the drunk hooker with a dog in her purse and spilling out 100 dollar bills walking by added to the experience!We recently stayed here and had a fabulous stay. There is still some work going on-- but it is all during the day and there was a note in the room from the manager offering to move your room to the sheraton if your stay is unpleasant. The rooms are recently updated and very nice!! The lobby is gorgeous and has free wi-fi. Also in the AM coffee is provided in the lobby. Overall we had a great stay and would stay again",,,,"['family', 'hotel', 'past', 'week', 'bowl', 'reservations', 'staying', 'given', 'really', 'poor', 'reviews', 'yelp', 'honestly', 'say',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charlotte-airport-conf-ctr-charlotte-2,Holiday Inn Charlotte-Airport Conf Ctr,3.0,$$$,25,"I have stayed here 3 or 4 times  within the past year, and always find the staff and employees to be extremely friendly!   Recently on 01/27/15, I had a problem in my room &amp; immediately the housekeeper left what she was doing and came to take care of it.  the employees make you feel that they truly enjoy their jobs &amp; everyone here shows that Southern Hospitality!    this makes a BIG difference when we have a stressful day!Wow!  I couldn't believe this was a Holiday Inn, it seemed more like a luxury brand.  It was recently renovated and looks amazing.  The rooms were very nicely designed and provided a ton of space.  Room service was fast and delicious, and there is also a restaurant and bar onsite.The hotel provides great quality for the price and is less than a mile away from the airport.The hotel was newly renovated recently so the rooms weren't bad. Nothing smelled muggy and the room was clean. The wifi didn't work so that was unfortunate. Not somewhere I would stay if I had the choice but we stayed here because our flight was cancelled last night. So I'm not sure about the pricing since it was complimentary for us. The elevators are about a mile away from the entrance since they are under construction for the closer ones so that was inconvenient. It was quite a workout finding the elevator, and it was almost like Finding Waldo since the elevator was in the place of what would be a room. Guess it made our trip that much more adventurous. :)Clean, comfortable, and the staff was great.  We called at the last minute when we missed our holiday connection home.   They gave us early check in.  Had business center to print our new boarding passes.  Great shuttle to and from airport. All we could have asked for.You pay $$$ for a room and then they refuse to give you french vanilla creamer unless you buy breakfast! Pure utter disappointment, We spent $71 + a nice tip at the bar last night and the expense of the room but you can't provide creamer... I won't be staying here again miss Lashonta! Thanks for your lack of hospitality.Staff is rally nice and the hotel is really close to the airport. Very clean but the construction is a total eyesore. Some of the elevators are down as well and that's when you realize how big this hotel is walking from one wing to the next.I had my stuff taken out of my drowers I called that same day I left and they didn't return my call. I called back 3 days later and the house Keeping didn't receive the memo from the front dest. She sed nothing gets past out to others around here. That explains way I've been waiting for a call that is not really being looked for. When you loose your stuff you expect them to call you or email you they have that information but not her. There modow should me IF YOU LEAVE YOUR STUFF DONT EXPECT THEM TO GET THEM BACK WILL GIVE YOU THE RUNAROUND.Great value - a truly upscale hotel for a mid-level price. Friendly &amp; professional staff. Recently renovated, tasteful appointments. Nice bed &amp; bedding. Super quiet AC. Healthy dining options and ~8 beers on draft. Decent exercise room.Had to stay here due to a flight cancelation. Not the worst place I could have ended up! Bed was super comfy, room was very clean and newly redone. Beautiful room. Hotel was going through renovation but that didn't stop me from sleeping peacefully. Glad I stayed here instead of the other surrounding hotels.Really nice hotel, location near airport. They should have better lunch options in Restaurant.Louisheta (spelling, ugh, I think I was close!) and The Holiday Inn manager, Nico, were AMAZING.  All the way from the airport to The Holiday Inn, we talked about teachers, how they should be higher on the pay scale, their lack of recognition of being the real heroes behind the future of tomorrow, and she was amazing and wonderful - and very accommodating.  Holiday Inn was better thanks to their help in obtaining a cab as well as offering anything needed - they made the trip and overnight experience better than 100% - thank you so much for putting yourself out not only to pick me up, as she also worked the front desk to check me in, but again, making the name as far as service for Holiday Inn appear better than the name of Hilton and Sheraton for a night.yes the decor is older, and yes the fashion is not in competition with newer facilities, yet, the desk clerk and staff make an effort to equal that in service.  No problems with cleanliness at all.  Worth the 50.00 and unless you are living in the hotel half the time, or have issues with cleanliness, (I did not) this was a great option, only 1 mile from the airport and a taxi easy to get to to the main center).First time staying here. Usually I stay next store at the Hampton Inn. The hotel just went through a complete remodel.   This is my go to hotel in Charlotte now.  The rooms are big, quiet and clean. The restaurant is basic but that's all I need.  I've stay at a Hilton garden inn and Hyatt place this well and the Holiday Inn was nicer than both of them.  Highly recommendedThey're currently undergoing massive renovations throughout the entire hotel. I specifically asked for a room on the fourth floor which is the top floor and I always ask for the top floor. Lucky for me, the construction was on the second floor and only the second floor (they had just finished construction on the fourth floor), yet the room is a bit cramped and I would hear noise from both neighbors all through the night. Thank goodness for headphones! That's the only thing that was keeping me from rating this place four stars.  I would say that the room was clean and the front desk person handling my room was extremely nice. She could tell that I was stressed out about making the 12 PM check out so I told her why and she gave me an extra hour to get my affairs in order. If only every customer service agent was this intuitive!Delay after delay with USAirways and I ended up missing my connecting flight back to Florida. The airline put me up in this hotel for the night.The keys weren't working so I had to be escorted up to my room. Anytime I wanted to leave and go back in my room, I'd have to go downstairs and have someone open the door. The hotel itself seems pretty old, mildew smells down the halls, and not even close to being a '3-star'. The room was somewhat large and the bathroom was decent (bumped up to a two star review). The bed was a king and decent. A/C unit was very loud. The airline told me breakfast was free so in the morning I went down to the restaurant. I sat, read the paper and a waitress asked if I wanted a drink. Just water. I then go up and there's a couple old pastries, fruit, and yogurt. That was it. I take a couple things since I'm hungry and don't want to pay airport prices. The waitress comes and puts a bill on my table for $7!!! For old looking sad food I didn't even want to eat. I mentioned that the airline said breakfast was free, and she said, 'oh, that's in room ___'. So I go to the room, which isn't even near the lobby, and find.....the same old pastries, fruit and yogurt.There are a couple nicer options nearby that probably don't cost much more.The staff are extremely friendly and courteous. The hotel is still going through massive renovations. Room on third floor was nice.The place reminds me a lot of my freshman dorm. Peeling walls, fluorescent lighting flickering in the elevator and strange humid smells. Although my bed and bathroom were pretty clean, and the staff were really great, the hotel itself is pretty old and resembles a trucker motel. Way overpriced for what it is.This hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere. The restaurant staff is relatively friendly, but the space/decor is ""budget"" at best.We had several problems with the Receptionists. Problems include: not being able to book a taxi, problems over room check-in/double booking a our room, and being rude over the phone.Also, our Damn Room Key would never work!?! I had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again..My best advice, pay a little extra money and book a hotel in Uptown Charlotte. This place doesn't deserve the business.Their shuttle picked me up in the middle of the nightand saved me from a rental car fright.A discount I got for arriving so darn late-the desk guy was nice, it seemed he could relate.I got free breakfast for having a priority member number.If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I'll stay here for hotel slumber!Pretty crappy hotel. Undergoing renovations so there's no main entrance and the setup is inconvenient. I took a shower in cold water after ten minutes of waiting for warm water. Most of all, our car was broken into. Not just some teenage break-in. They disabled the alarm and drilled into the door.... they took all our valuable items. Even my full suitcase of clothes. The hotel management hasn't been of any help through this process.Nice staff.Dirty. There was fecal matter on my shower curtin. Cleanliness is not a priority here.  Hotwire is the reason for all my problems. I will never do name your own price.","DRAT.  I booked this three star hotel via hotwire Im not an expert on the 5 star rating scale, but I thought too highly of a three star rating. Not clean, all kinds of shiz on the hallway floors, Ex. sunflower seeds, paper, in the corners you can see dirt &amp; debre build up.  The main lobby is promising, to suck you in, but the plaster in the walls is cracked, room doors have been painted over 755778738688796 times.  My big window looks like someone stuck their big nasty greesy forehead and smeared it throughly.  Their was a big private hair atop my toilet paper roll.  On Hotwire I got this room for $68 if you were to walk in the rate is $99.  So thank goodness I got it for the cheaper price!  Better than my last hotel stay @ La Quinta but still grossWe stayed a week for a conference.  The hotel is under renovation.  The rooms are really nice.  The bathrooms are a little small.  We were told on check in that there was free continental breakfast on Tuesday  through Fridays.  That was weird in itself shouldn't it be everyday?  The front desk person went on to say that we needed vouchers but we would need to wait until the next day to get it.  Red flag!!! The next day around noon we go down stairs only to be told that we didn't need vouchers.  So my mom goes down on wed. To eat only to be told afterwards that there was a $9.99 fee.  She was able to eat without being charged...but management needs to get it together.  For the record...its not worth $9.99.  I hate having to beg for towels....and please dont give me a towel with someone else's make up.  You can see it just like i can when you are replacing them.  The Holiday Inn Brand shouldn't be abused just because there is a conference in town.  I forgot to mention that we were also charged for a suite when there are no suites in the hotel.  They did take care of that after a day of run around...my advice stay at another holiday inn until they get it together!!!!!I recently stayed here through Priceline. I was pretty disappointed. It was overall not nearly as clean as you'd expect it and furthermore what appeared to be the manager at the front desk was berating a woman who appeared to be a new hire in front of the customers. I felt terrible for this woman. Just a terrible presentation overall and if I had a choice, I wouldn't go back.This place is a zero-star dive. In particular, do not eat dinner in the depressing restaurant.This place is promoted as a 3-star hotel.  All hotels are not the same.  All cities are not the same.  When traveling from one region of the country into another adjust your expectations accordingly.  If you are coming from the NY or SF/LA area into Charlotte then your expectations for a 3 star hotel according to the ratings need to be adjusted.  This hotel is billed on-line as a 3 star hotel.  It is a 2 star hotel at best.The staff is friendly, helpful and very accommodating.  The hotel itself is in need of a serious upgrade to make it to 3 stars.  The walls in the room show signs of serious water damage with cracks in the plaster and peeling paint and wallpaper.  The TV is outdated and old.  The number of channels is limited.  The plumbing system needs some serious attention.  There were two temperatures...freezing cold or scalding hot.  The medium temperature selection resulted in a water flow akin to a trickle.  With other hotels in the same 3-star category such as the Hilton, Hyatt and other top names downtown, don't get suckered into this location by the airport.",,,,"['times', 'within', 'past', 'year',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-charlotte-suites-hotel-charlotte,Renaissance Charlotte Suites Hotel,3.5,$$,39,"The room itself was very nice - you have an office/living room space separated from the bathroom (via foyer) which is also separated from the bedroom the next room over.  Feels like a nice 1BR apt in NYC to tell you the truth.  Gym amenities were nice (not as nice as a gym out in Southern California; but definitely better than the ones you would see at a Courtyard property).  The breakfast buffet was ok.  You have a chef who will cook you an omelet or something made-to-order or you can go to the buffet line and take whatever is there.  It's in line with what you would expect from a Marriott property.Location-wise, you are pretty much in the middle of nowhere.  No food, no shops, nothing for at least a good 10+ minute drive off the highways/parkway/thruway.  It is possible I didn't explore the area closely enough, but honestly, nothing in the local surrounding area really seemed appealing.  Just corporate park after corporate park.I've held several meetings, the staff is quick and efficient. Cori &amp; Sarah are wonderful planners when it comes to meetings, conferences and room reservations. Ken in AV is truly helpful even for the smallest requests. The food in the restaurant is pretty delish too!This hotel has the same layout as an Embassy Suites.  Nice and well kept. I really liked it.  It has plenty of parking.  No free breakfast tough like the Embassy and the AC unit on my room was not as powerful.Surprisingly this was a great lunch find! I came with my co-workers for a birthday celebration. We had the choice of either the buffet or menu options. The buffet comes with your choice of salad, choice of two meats, veggies and desserts. The menu options included salads, wings and sandwiches. I went with the Cobb salad. It came with blue cheese, crumbled bacon, egg, tomatoes, avocado and chicken with blue cheese dressing. When it arrived I was blown away by the size. That thing was huge! I was very impressed that they were not skimpy with the toppings either! They piled on all my favorites and the homemade blue cheese dressing brought it all together!I can see this being in my regular lunch rotation especially since there are several other salads I'm looking forward to trying...and let's not forget about giving that buffet a try!Nice hotel and super helpful staff. Drinks are good and food is delicious. Super convenient to the airport. Excellent for meeting and corporate events. Reminds me of Embassy Suites, but nicer and brighter. Monday through Friday they do a drink of the day where they mix some good stuff up and serve it to willing guests for free. This starts at 5:00. Worth a try. Rooms are clean and nice.I'm giving them 2 Star but you my feel I should have given them 1 Star. Checked in after a long flight and my girlfriend is a platinum member. She stays at Marriott 98.5 % of the time. We checked in at 11:05PM and once we got to the room we noticed a Do Not Disturb sign on the door but we thought maybe it was never removed by house keeping. To our surprise there was someone in the bathroom!!!We asked Orlando the person that checked us in, ""please explain how is this possible?"". He offered a couple of options but none of them made since and he didn't seem that concerned. So if Orlando is checking you in you may ask him or who ever checks you in to call the room first to make sure no is there!Picked up this great deal from Travelocity. We had no idea we were getting a penthouse suite. It was an awesome weekend.  Jacuzzi and an indoor pool. Didn't do the room service thing but the food looked good and it has a service bar with a great open area. London look.Shuttle drivers are all great guys. Front desk is always quick and very helpful and the crew in the rewards lounge and the restaurant do an amazing job. I stayed here several times over the last 7 years. Great staff and a nice hotel.""Well why don't you go upstairs and book a conference room. Maybe you can talk him to death."" -- The Bourne Identity (2002)I recently came here for a business meeting - my client reserved once of the business center rooms for a business meeting for the morning for 5 of us.We were very comfortable in the room since there were only 5 of us - but if we had all 10 that it could fit, I'm not sure we would have been as comfortable.  We had pitchers of water (with huge pieces of orange and mint), bowls of mints, pens and pads of paper at every chair.  We had free wi-fi, but it was a little spotty and would randomly drop each of us throughout the morning.  The chairs were comfy, adjustable and I wasn't stiff after 3-plus hours in them.  The most uncomfortable piece about these rooms, is while they have an in-room bathroom, almost every sound that happens in that bathroom can be heard in the meeting space - AWKWARD. That's not something you want to hear when someone from your group excuses themselves to go to the bathroom - it is distracting and uncomfortable. Those rooms need to be insulated - Seriously!We then stepped out to grab some lunch in the restaurant.  I ordered the Turkey BLT with a side salad - it was perfectly prepared, delicious and great for the price.  They were speedy with the service, getting the food to us and the service was good.  However, my iced tea tasted like it was from a can.  Next time, I'll get ice water.Overall, I would recommend this as good office space for meetings, I just don't think I'll use the bathroom in the meeting rooms.Love this place. I've been coming here for 7 years for business conferences. The staff is helpful and the rooms are always nice &amp; clean, not to mention spacious. I definitely recommend this hotel.I might give a slightly higher rating for convenience if you're a business traveler visiting offices in the business park. Convenient airport shuttle.  Nice interior atrium.  Good room layout with small living room separated from bed, ala Embassy Suites.  Great rate on the weekend (clearly a business hotel).  But on with the not so good.  You're stranded.  Hotel is not near anything;  Taxi or drive to any restaurants, shopping, etc.  Bed is not particularly comfortable and pillows are very uncomfortable.  Put out breakfast order on door for early delivery before catching a flight.  Nothing was ever delivered  Perhaps some other guest took the order card thinking they were funny, we were near the elevator.  Maybe the hotel just messed up.  Either way, not good.  Got a shrug at the front desk when we mentioned at checkout.Great hotel for the price! Big spacious rooms were clean and comfortable! Having a refrigerator and microwave in the room is always a plus.The breakfast buffet was tasty and had an ample amount of options. I always enjoy an omelette made fresh to order! (You can also order eggs any style, pancakes, waffles, and french toast!).The highlight of my stay was absolutely Tempest. She was courteous, friendly, helpful and had the kind of personality that puts a smile in your face for the entire day. Tempest definitely pushed my review from four stars to five!All I asked for was a comfortable room, nice staff, and room service that didn't break my bank.  I got all three here.  I was pleased with my stay.  Room service food was good enough, and it wasn't too overpriced.  The bathroom somehow managed to be a little cramped even though it was big.  Maybe it was the wall separating the sink from the commode.  Pretty unnecessary.  The bed was comfy enough, and the AC worked well.  I'd stay here again for sure.The people here were so friendly and the food was so good that I had to write a review.  I checked in early, but they still got me into a room and offered everything I needed for a quiet stay.  The free airport shuttle was a plus, with a very nice driver. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Exercise room and pool were small, but well maintained.  I have to say that the people in this hotel made all the difference.  Quiet, polite, helpful, and looking for ways to delight customers. Thanks for a great stay.The only con is the fact that they charge for WiFi.Booked through Priceline due to a 10 hour layover, and got a great deal.  It's close to the airport, and the room was clean and comfortable.  Check-in and check-out was quick and painless.There was a separate living area/kitchenette, so when I couldn't sleep after having 2-3 Mountain Dews in the restaurant downstairs, I could watch TV without disturbing my husband.The restaurant on site was fairly priced for a hotel.  We both ordered burgers and hush puppies, and we were satisfied with our meal.  Our waitress was friendly and refilled our drinks constantly.I think we departed too early in the morning to determine if there was a continental breakfast.  I really don't have any complaints about this hotel and would definitely stay here again.Booked a King Suite online from Feb 8-10 @ $87.99/night (AAA Membership Rate) after being delayed at Charlotte (CLT) due to Winter Storm Nemo. The hotel is about 10-15 minutes from CLT. I arrived by shuttle and checked into Room 705. The room was very clean, with no issues throught my trip.This is a great place for catching up on sleep. Unfortunately there's nothing to do within the immediate, remote area, which will leave with few options beyond fast food delivery and the hotel's restaurant. A cab Uptown (Time Warner Arena, The Epicenter, Bobcats, Panthers, bars, restaurants, etc) will cost $25. The hotel concierge hooked me up with an 8pm shuttle ride to the Woodlawn LYNX (Light Rail) station (approx. 15-20 minutes away), which only costs $2.00 to head Uptown.The only drawbacks are the remote location, and the lack of free WiFi outside of the hotel lobby and lounge/restaurant ($9.99 per day). If you want to get a good night's sleep, then this is the place. If you want to enjoy Charlotte, I recommend choosing a hotel closer to Uptown and Center City.Upscale hotel with fancy lobby and spacious rooms. Free on-site parking and free Airport shuttle service between. 5 a.m. and midnight. The hotel is not in a bustling area so you'll need a car or taxi if you want to go out.  Breakfast was not included in my rate. I stayed one night in the 1BR suite.  The room offered a microwave, college-dorm sized refrigerator and a separate bedroom.  The decor is modern and the room was spotless.  The biggest gripe I have with this place is that I didn't think the bed was as comfortable as most Marriott beds.  That's a big deal to me - I often choose Marriott over other hotels because of their comfortable bed!A 1st here. A bit of a drive to everything BUT worth the inconvenience for the price is unbelievably cheap for a comfortable suite. Two TVs...1 in sitting room, 1 in bedroom. Pillows galore. Inner court reminds me of Inter-Continental Hotels Singapore. Free parking tho ""pay"" signs posted I suppose to ward off the unwelcome? Hotel guest free parking card for dashboard at check-in. Front desk is very accommodating when asked for free complimentary tickets to try their continental breakfast. In-room WiFi is free if you go to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMarriott.com&amp;s=8c83c9d5e71fa87dbf4b87871c809cfc3263274a1766ec9e3897364473a65455"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Marriott.com</a> and register as a member. Business Center is free 24/7 where u can register online to get the free membership then return to front desk for them to enter your member number. When signing in on WiFi, it is your room number and last name to log on. Housekeeping generously leaves ample supply maybe due to the amount of tip left for them? Service is quick, knowledgeable and accommodating. Rooms comfortable and clean. Highly recommendable to everyone...singles, couples, families, on business... I would definitely stay here again. You'll hv a little kitchenette with frig, microwave, sink, coffee maker w/coffee. Showtime is free too. Iron and board. All this for so little...I can't imagine anyone going home unhappy. Got this great deal from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCheapTickets.com&amp;s=005bca9539f44d8624f4dd3a93d7359321b4b623ad6c04b8a43c7361aacb114e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">CheapTickets.com</a> as an air, car &amp; hotel package. Thank you, Renaissance Marriott in Charlotte.This property is in need of a facelift. I was in Charlotte for a week. I had stayed here years ago  and thought it was great. This time not so much. Lucky for me this property only had availability for one night so I had to move to south park property. Rooms are suites do there is lots of room if you need it.  The customer service was well below par for a higher end Marriott property. I forgot my deodorant and I was told that there was some in the shop ( $200 room but no complimentary toiletries?)Hostess at breakfast buffet had an attitude that made me pass on the meal. She seemed put off by the fact that I wanted to look at the spread before I committed to eating there.This property should send employees to South Park location to observe good service.Great Hotel. Tucked away just outside the city - only 14 minutes from Downtown Charlotte. Very nice rooms &amp; great place to catch up on work. Close to the airport as well.","Nice hotel.. but it's way too much for what you get... In that area, there are a TON of hotels... you can find another.Next time I think I'll stay at that Hilton Homes place off Tyvolia. At least they had a sports bar right next to it! ;)Like other posters, I too had flight issues at CLT and spent the night here (voucher courtesy of the airline). My first impression was frustation - - as it seemed to take longer than expected for the hotel shuttle to arrive at the airport, to pick up all of us stranded passengers from various flights. The hotel itself was fairly close to the airport, a short drive -- definitely not walkable. But upon entering, the interior looked clean and had a large open atrium area and warm colors througout (think reds, oranges, etc). Check-in was alright, however no ""perks"" here for Marriott Reward Silver  -- was what I was originally quoted. They do have a Club Lounge I learned later. Breakfast weekdays (i believe) at 6am. The room was definitely larger than I was expecting. It was a 2-room suite with small refrigerator and microwave. Beds were comfortable for my 4-hr sleep. Shuttle brought me back to CLT with fast and friendly service. The first shuttle in the morning leaves at 6am. It was alright -- but room service closes at 11pm. And of course, I would've rather been at my destination than being stuck in a hotel. **Oh and the large atrium area made me think that this property may have been previously an Embassy Suites or something. So I asked the shuttle driver, and he said that they've been open for 11 years. And that it has always been a Renaissance Suites.CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT! As I mentioned before I paid for my room via Priceline. When I checked out my account balance was 0.....however when I checked my credit card statement a few days later there was a $9 charge on it from the hotel.  I called and supposedly I was on a long distance phone call for 3 mins.  Ummm. No ma'am! I always check out at the front desk in an effort to avoid foolishness like this.  Once they pulled the phone long and the activity log from the front desk they realized that someone placed the call from my room 45 mins after I checked out. I always question who still uses a land line to call long distance (domestically) most of the time this service is included in cell phone plans. If I had to guess Im going to say it was a person in Housekeeping calling his/her long distance lover because most hotels don't turn over rooms 45 mins after a person checks out.A MONTH LATER the charges have yet to be reversed.  I still have not received a refund from this bogus long distance call!What can I say? It's a Marriott - one of my faves!  I was stuck in CLT due to flight cancellations &amp; this Marriott was the only one not sold out!  When I finally got out of the mess of the airport &amp; checked into the Renaissance Suites I instantly felt at home! The suite was HUGE, too bad I only had a few hours to enjoy it.  Nice comfortable bed and pillows.  The desk space was perfect for both of my laptops when I started working the next morning.  The concierge lounge had a pretty good selection of healthy to not so healthy food.  Again I'll say it's Marriott, one of my faves and they rarely ever let me down!My connecting flight at the airport was cancelled, so I checked Yelp for a decent nearby hotel, and quickly booked a room here. I recommend it highly. The facility is lovely, the prices wholly reasonable, the rooms clean and spacious. As others have mentioned, the lobby is quite striking. Admittedly, I arrived at 11:00 PM and departed at 7:30 AM, so I didn't get especially familiar with the place. I ate no meals here, and used no facilities other than my room. But within that limited experience, I do recommend it, and would definitely stay here again if I needed a hotel near the airport.Fantastic hotel with an excellent staff. Close to the airport, Carowinds and Downtown Charlotte. Marriott Rewards Gold members receive free premium wifi access and breakfast buffet.great room, quiet, clean, really nice bed, enjoyed having living room to work in, club level food is same as every other marriott, dinner at restaurant was below average as was service, front desk was great, nice pool, atrium makes the lobby, folgers coffee (seriously, pony up).Not as nice as Renaissance South Park but would absolutely stay here again.From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the Renaissance Charlotte Suites. I have stayed at this hotel on at least two or three occasions in the last several months and I have yet to be disappointed. The lobby and main areas of the hotel are immaculately clean and well decorated - the hotel commands an elegant presence even from outside. The guest rooms are the real treat. Every room at this Renaissance is a suite and has at least a living room/sitting area with separate bedroom. The rooms are thus spacious and comfortable, and they are well-appointed and upscale. The hotel's fitness center was sufficient - it was nothing spectacular but it was slightly better than the average hotel gym. While I didn't use the pool, the Renaissance had a beautiful one. This hotel does charge $10 per night for internet service, something I find obnoxious and an instant ""ding"" for any hotel. Parking, however, was free and not very easy to navigate. I found the staff professional and courteous - while I did not have any negative encounters, they never did anything to go that extra mile or do anything particularly impressive either. The location of the hotel could, perhaps, be somewhat of a con - it did seem everywhere we needed to go was a bit of a drive compared to times we stayed at other Charlotte hotels. An elegant, pleasant place to stay and a true value for weekends spent in Charlotte - this hotel is consistently $99-$119 per night from Friday to Sunday night. You simply can't beat the price with what the hotel is offers. Superb!Honestly disappointed with the service.  They require additional deposit on cash or debit card (?!) payments, $50 per night!  The hallways are noisy, you can hear everything from adjoining rooms.  Breakfast is $14 per person, kind of ridiculous because there are virtually no restaurants in the area.  Go elsewhere in a cooler neighborhood if you're staying here for fun.had a lovely time here! the rooms are HUGE and clean! the little kitchenette area proved very useful and i love the idea of a separate living and bed area. very cute! the atrium area is also nice.The rooms are beautiful and staff was nice. However they have a policy if you are using a debit card/checkcard they authorize $25 per night . I however wasnt using either but they thought my credit card was bank card and put a hold on my card which wasnt disclosed, needless to say I wasnt pleased with that. Everything else was very great though the room was well cleaned every day and they had a free business area because they charge for in room wifi . I would stay here again .Very large rooms with living room?  Friendly staff.Reason for Stay: Stranded at Airport. Booked through PricelineAirport Shuttle: Came within a few minutes. Hotel is about 5 minutes from the airportCheck In: Quick and staff was notably friendlyRoom: Huge! And very clean, which is standard for most Marriotts. Each room has a bedroom, bathroom and fairly large living room. 2 flat screen TVs.Bar: Despite what I read in other reviews, the bartender was quite friendly but I'm sure there is fairly high turnoverCheck Out: Quick, easy. Overall: I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. If I were in the area again, I'd skip priceline and book hereGreat rooms and amenities. Restaurant is the worst I've ever seen in a Renaissance. Terrible bartender who thinks extra dry is half vermouth, terrible steak, and soup and crab carabiners was so salty I couldn't eat it. Ambiance is a burgundy Embassy Suites with no free drinks.The hotel itself is fantastic. The rooms are huge, and the building is nice. The staff on the other hand, not so much. Group sales dropped the ball big on my trip. The front desk was not easy to work with. Will stay here again, but will have to make sure everything is as it should be.Clean, spacious and a very good value for the money. Not too much more to add here. The menu was a little bit limited and the bar was not very spacious but all things considered, I would stay here again for sure.I am only reviewing the staff at this hotel. The hotel is a great place to stay, but the staff is not very helpful or nice. I arrived at 8:00 AM so I went to the front desk where I was stood for 10 minutes while the two ladies working the front desk were talking. Once they finished talking they offered to help me. She told me that my room was not read6y yet come back about 11:00 AM. So when I return at 11:00 AM another desk clerk made sure I felt stupid for even asking if my room was ready, she also told me to come back about 12:30 PM. When I returned at 1:00 PM I was told that no room yet, come back about 3:00 PM, in the meantime others in my group checked in before us with the same rooms, our reservation was made 6 months ago. I came back at 3:30 PM; the desk clerk told me that it would be at least 6:00 PM to get a room. I then asked her to cancel my reservation that I would stay at another hotel, I called Holiday inn which offered me a room at the same rate and aid it is ready now. Since the desk clerk hear this she to me that my room is ready, 1 bed King, She took my card and started the check-in. When she told me that it was 1 bed I showed her the reservation was for a 2 double beds, she said that she had the wrong room. So she then had my room ready for me after waiting 8 hours. The front desk staff is not very nice, as my wife noticed very rude. I checked out on Sunday and the night desk clerk said they would e-mail my bill. I called to ask about my bill and the front desk clerk told me I would have to wait 3 to 5 days to get my bill. I guess that Marriot does not care about their guest. I will change hotel brands, since no one at Marriot cares. The story goes one for the week from the bell man, wait staff and the maids. I will not bore you with all of the details.Like other postings, I had a flight issue.  My flight the next day was at 7:05 am and the hotel bus does not run from 12 am - 6 am, so I kept my rental car.  We were there from 9pm - 5:15am, by the time we checked in we wanted to stay at the hotel for something to eat.  We tried room service and it was fine.  The suite was large but we did not get to enjoy it much.Mixed feelings about this. The hotel looks quite nice inside (the inner lobby borders on remarkable) and the rooms are very spacious and clean. The staff were reasonably friendly. However, I am a stickler for the cleanliness of hotel beds, and I felt that the hotel really fell short in that important aspect. There was a weird stain on the sheet under the pillow the first night. Gross! Worse yet, it is still there now that I am on my second night! Obviously, the bed was made without changing the sheets, and that is a big problem for me. Other issue - if you are a vegetarian like me, there are very limited choices in the hotel restaurant for you, and if you are a vegan plan on just eating a side salad. The next night (tonight) we ate at the hotel bar which had a different (very limited) menu, and I was quite happy with the tomato flatbread and homemade-style potato chips. Warning- guests are charged $12 for wifi access, which I found steep. I would probably want to try a different hotel next time.",,,,"['room', 'nice', 'office', 'living', 'room', 'space', 'separated', 'bathroom', 'via', 'foyer', 'also', 'separated', 'bedroom', 'next',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-by-hilton-charlotte-charlotte,Embassy Suites by Hilton Charlotte,3.5,$$,50,"Love this hotel! Excellent 24 hr gym with ellipticals, treadmills, weights, body balls. Breakfast buffet includes made to order eggs/omelettes, full hot buffet along with oatmeal, cold cereals, fruit and pastries. Evening time is managers welcome with appetizers and free alcoholic beverages ( ticket required, you get when check in). Rooms are very nice - spacious, comfy beds, fresh bedding and clean. Mini fridge, micro, sink separate from bath. Staff is friendly, helpfulTruly enjoyed my stayReally great room and location. Room price was spot on too. Manager's reception had great drinks, but the snacks were a bit basic. Okay though, when you factor the cost of the room with the reception and a free, hot, made-to-order breakfast.Breakfast was very good. Kitchen staff were super friendly.This experience really made me change my focus as to which Hilton brand to continue to patronize.I don't think I've ever given one star to a place I've never stayed at before. My fiance and I missed our connecting flight in Charlotte and were stuck there overnight. The airline gave us a voucher to stay at Embassy Suites for the night. We were a little disappointed not to be going home that night but were at least happy they put us up in a nice hotel....... or so we thought. Fast forward to our 30 minute wait time outside by the hotel shuttles. We saw other hotel shuttles come by twice and still no Embassy Suites, so I called to find out where the were. We were assured that they were ""en route"" and they finally showed up ten minutes later.We finally got to Embassy Suites and were not greeted by anyone. There were two employees standing at the front casually chatting with each other and not bothering to acknowledge our presence. Finally, someone came from the back and I gave her my voucher. She then told me that all of their airline rooms were full for the night. I clarified with her that they had rooms available, just not one that the airline had paid for. I expressed my confusion since I was holding a voucher for the Embassy Suites and she told me there was nothing she could do and proceeded to just stare at me. I asked her what we were supposed to do and she went in the back for a few minutes.When she came back, she instructed me that she called the hotel down the street and they had vacancy, and that we would need to stay at the Ramada Inn down the street instead (see separate review.) We had to ask for a ride from the shuttle driver there and luckily he hadn't left for the airport yet. We were stressed, exhausted from travel, and just wanted to stay in a nice hotel. Embassy Suites did nothing to help our situation and I suspect that a simple phone call to the airline would have allowed us to stay there. If I ever find myself in Charlotte again, I will most definitely steer clear of their terrible service.Stayed here for one night. This is your standard Embassy Suites with the beautiful water fountain which is part of their brand. The guy at the Front desk on Sunday was friendly and asked if we enjoyed our stay. Told him Embassy known for their water fall/fountain. He informed there will be renovations and the waterfall will be taken down. Wonder since it is part of Hilton chain that's why they making these changes. So here is my review of this hotel.Check in on Saturday only one person working at front desk. She asked for name, an id and credit card, got keys to room and directed where to get the elevators. Informed what time Manager reception and time frame for breakfast. I have stayed in many Embassy for business travel in the past, so I know the protocol, but imagine if this was your first visit to this hotel and did not know where everything was. Guess, customer service has changed a lot these days. When you approach the front desk is it not standard nor customary these days to say hello or how can I help you. Realize it not the Westin, Mandarin Hotel nor Omni.As for Manager reception, it's great there is no charge for patrons but stale chips and nacho chips- what is up with that?  Breakfast was good their omelettes was made to order.I didn't like the service I received and the place was so tired and gross. My room wasn't ready so I waited in the center space. The tables smelled sour and the wifi was spotty and the music was so loud and obnoxious it sounded like they were preparing for a dance party. I asked the front desk if they would turn down the music (I was the only person in the whole place) and she said ""I wouldn't even know how to do that so no."" Unacceptable. My room was tucked away in a back corner so it was quiet (except for road noise). The bed was comfortable but the rest of the furniture was so tired and gross i didn't want to sit on it. Not up to the Hilton standards for sure.Embassy Suites are usually good.  This location is nice because it is close to the airport and near several dining establishments and bars.  The complimentary breakfast was great.  Had a basic hot bar and also a station where custom orders can be placed, to include: pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, eggs and omelettes.  The reason for the three stars was the rooms.  They were old and not the cleanest.  The rooms surround a center courtyard which was a nice view.  Would stay again, but would not be my first choice.  Free Wall Street Journal or USA Today.  Plenty of free parking.I'd say this is an average Embassy Suites.  Hot Breakfast, big rooms and fairly clean.Only issue I have here is the customer service.  When we were at the airport, they did not care very much that we were outside freezing.  They were unable to give us a time for the shuttle and when we pushed them, they said the driver's phone is down so he will be there when he gets there.  When he finally arrived an hour later, which is absurd as the hotel is 10 minutes away, we asked about his phone without telling him the situation and he said the phone was fine.Second issue was that we requested a 7am wake up call so we do not miss our early morning flight, and one was never given to us.  And while this isn't the hotel's fault, we had kids either next to us or above us that were jumping up and down off the bed and laughing at full strength around midnight for about 2 hours.  My girlfriend got very poor sleep.Again, is this place a resort? no...it is a warm bed and a roof for the night and that is it.In general, the hotel was unremarkable. Room sofa was extraordinarily worn and uncomfortable. Chair was also dirty and worn. Hotel food, from Omaha Steakhouse, was heavy and outdated for my taste and there weren't other options within walking distance.However, what made my entire stay worthwhile was the staff who made breakfast every day. Wanda and Debra were fantastic. They were happy and friendly and made yummy omelets. I might have to return to the same hotel and, when that happens, I sure hope Wanda and Debra are there.Clean but dated rooms.  The breakfast was one of the worst I have ever had from an Embassy Suits.  All the hot buffet food items were cold.  Bacon remained as bacon bits submerged in their own grease.  There was only two staff members at the omelette station, so the line was 15 people deep.I really liked this hotel and would stay here again. We stayed in room 434 which was on the corner and set back a little from the main hallway, so we don't have any noise complaints like I've read here. The room/suite itself is great for a family or for someone travelling on business. There is a microwave/fridge, an office area (with a TV and couch), the bedroom, and the bathroom. If someone in your party wants to sleep and someone else wants to play on the laptop or watch TV, it's perfect for that. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn brand shampoo and conditioner. The hotel is decorated quite nicely. The garden in the lobby is pretty amazing, it makes you feel like you're somewhere other than near the Charlotte airport! There are fountains, statues, and lots of places to sit and chill. In the evenings between 5:30-7:30 there is a manager's reception with free drinks and a few snacks like pimento cheese, pub mix, etc. If you really like breakfast, this hotel is your place. The eggs and omelets are cooked to order on the buffet each morning. On weekends, breakfast is 7-10, weekdays it starts at 6. Along with eggs and omelets, there's grits, pancakes, French Toast, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and your traditional cereal and pastries. You can go through the line to get the made-to-order or just eat at the little buffet they put out. The made to order line was long but moved quickly. Our omelets were great. The hotel is convenient to the interstates and airport, however, you will need a car to drive to get something to eat. There's an Omaha steakhouse on site and a few places deliver, but no restaurants within walking distance except a seedy little sports bar. We had a car with us so we drove to places to eat downtown and at South Park (the hotel is convenient to both). Also, the wi-fi is not free so be prepared to pay around $10 per day. That was the only negative part about this hotel.Not the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at but not the worst either.  Maybe the second worst?  The employees were super friendly and answered the few questions I had without pause.  The breakfast was on par with their other properties.  The guest room I was given is where they lost the stars.The place is in need of some serious updating.  The room I stayed in had definitely seen better days.  The carpet, the light switches, the paint - everything looked tired and just about worn out.  Also, the smell of too-much carpet freshener seriously overpowered the senses.  I thought it would dissipate if I switched the fan selector to ""on"" instead of ""auto"" but I was mistaken.  I'm not sure what odor they were trying to cover up but I don't really want to know at this point.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I will stay somewhere else...and hopefully get a better night's sleep.Place was so clean and FANCY!!!  The staff was great and breakfast was way more then other embassy suites. There was no fan in the bathroom and the room was laid out kinda odd with multiple entrances. It was very nice though and like the bar in the beautiful lobby. Parking sucked bc of 3 other hotels in the area but great stay!!!I have stayed at many Embassy Suites in the past, so I was expecting the same quality from the one in Charlotte. After been stuck in traffic, I was so glad that my companion already checked into the room. When I walked into the lobby, I noticed that it was extremely beautiful and there was foliage everywhere. I felt like I was in a peaceful rain forest. I adore the glass elevators because it was nice to see the nice atrium as I was going to the sixth floor. I was welcomed with a spacious area with a table for work, sofa/bed, tv, refrigerator, and coffeemaker. The bathroom was spacious and clean, but the bedroom was everything. The bed was so comfortable (thankfully) because I spent a lot of time resting. The morning buffet was simply ok. No real complaints because it was free. My companion ordered an omelette, but the center was cold. Yuck! At least there were other items to choose from. The hotel is far out, so if you aren't driving, the options are limited for food and entertainment.I wasn't pleased about the fact that there wasn't free wi-fi. I was pissed because I had so much work to do. Because of the proximity from the rest of Charlotte, I am not sure if I would stay here again.Very nice hotel with super spacious, clean and nicely decorated rooms.  Very pretty atrium. Complimentary breakfast was good.. Coffee only ok.  Staff was pleasant and professional.  What was very unsatisfactory was the shuttle from airport to hotel. I waited over 30 minutes and when driver finally came, she whined about working for Embassy and said she'd be calling in sick tomorrow because there was going to be snow.  No apology for the long wait in 25 degree weather at 10pThe customer service at this hotel is stupendous, especially the cooks at the breakfast area. Wanda is great. She's so friendly and welcoming and having to wake up on a weekday at 6 in the morning, it was a pleasure for her to be the first person that I interacted with. I loved my room as well. Clean, updated, nice. The only critique I have is that the air conditioning was out in the common area. You can only imagine no air conditioning on the hottest week of the year thus far in SC! I still give it five stars, though, based on all of the other pluses.The good.  It was a nice looking hotel with a nice waterfall thing near the dining area.  Food was good, your typical eggs, sausage, bacon, and grits.The bad.  Our room had an AC leak. The wood floor looked bowed and the carpet was wet.  Not a great feeling when you are barefooted.We told the front desk and she said, thanks for letting us know.  Okay than, thanks for asking about how my stay was in the wet room.I spend more time in Hilton Hotels than my own home which usually leads me to selecting an Embassy, Homewood or Home2 property.  I like the multiple room layout, living and sleeping areas accompanied by a kitchen or bar.Location: Not very familiar with Charlotte I had no idea what the location of this property was like.  Had I know I probably wouldn't have given it a chance.  Morning and Evening the streets surrounding the property are beyond capacity.  The traffic is enough to raise your blood pressure and need a drink from the Managers Reception.  The neighborhood is not much better, it's pretty much ""The Hood"".  Other than the onsite Steak house, which is great, your options for dinning and shopping reflect the economical make-up of the locale.Interior:  Like all Embassy's the interior Public area is light and airy.  The rooms are outdated and dark but at least they're clean.  The staff is extremely attentive and courteous.This place is so nice.  It opened only a month ago and me and my friends family were the first to stay in room 205, ever.  The breakfast was great, delicious!  Lots of choices and the people are so polite, don't take advantage of that.  Even if you are richer, or higher on the social scale, treat the people here with respect no matter what.  They do that with you, so return the favor and smile back.  Anyway, this place is clean, the people are nice, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice hotel.Stayed here for two nights with my family. The rooms are spacious and the staff is very friendly. The hotel can use a good scrub on the floors (bathrooms and main foyer area in lobby) other than that was clean. Nice pool with plenty of towels and the fitness area is really nice. The location is ok but doesn't have anything in walking distance, except for a run down shopping center across the street. I would stay again because overall it was a pleasant experience.Lots of good things at this hotel. My wife and I enjoyed our king bed, and the way the room was segmented like a mini apartment.Breakfast was awesome, they have a station that allows you to get cooked to order food. Managers reception was a nice addition, get a few drinks while snacking on some chips and enjoying the amazing atrium.My one complaint is how wifi was advertised as free on our booking website, however its a 24 hour charge. Luckily the service was excellent and I got a coupon for the night.","Happy hour which is 2 and a half hours with free drinks and appetizers, jacuzzi and pool, complimentary breakfast with made to order omelet! Plus the room is 2 rooms with 2 tvs a fridge and a microwave. Best deal on a hotel I've seen in years! Got a rental car from Alamo through them for being a guest for 21 bucks a day. I am elated. I hesitate to post this review for fear the deals won't continue for my next journey here. We just drove 14 hours from Chicago overnight, and this is just what the doctor ordered. What's that? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the jacuzzi bubbles 8)Worst Embassy Suites Ive been to in my life. They need to remodel the rooms, it doesnt feel like a hotel at all it feels like im in a cheap motel. Shuttle was 30 mins late and the breakfast opened so late. It says they open at 6am and we waited till 6:45 but they havent served the food yet, so we just left to catch up for our flight after wasting almost an hour of waiting for the food... Worst hotel ever! Dont be fooled by the name, my family and i love Embassy suites  but this one is just awfully bad.  Not worth staying at all, id rather go to hyatt or renaissance just next door next time Im here.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. After reading the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptic, but everything was really nice. The front staff was wonderful. The manager's reception was pleasant. Great breakfast, clean rooms, etc. I was a little annoyed I had to pay for WiFi, but fortunately I was traveling for work. The only downside here is the area of town it is in. I walked to the convenience store down the block and that was a mistake. Creepy, creepy.Clean rooms. free drinks and appetizers before 7, a waterfall, and a jacuzzi what more could you ask for?I don't know where to begin. This was the absolute worst Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in.  I'm kicking myself for not reading the reviews before checking in. I've never had a bad experience with Embassy Suites and trusted the name... Never again. As soon as we drove up I felt uneasy...the local area was not very inviting. The hotel was dirty/dusty and not well maintained.  It was obvious all cleaning was on the surface level... The furniture,  elevators, hallways, etc was just ugh... The blanket in our room had not been washed and had a really bad odor. We asked for a new blanket and the girl that delivered it to us had a nasty attitude and asked ""what's wrong with the one you got"" . My husband told her to SMELL IT... She responded ""no I won't be doing that""  then handed him the new blanket and walked away. The breakfast was not good.... At all. They didn't keep the dining area clean. Food was everywhere on the floor. This place is ghetto. There's a club across the street and apparently this is the place the locals choose to stay after a night of partying... Trust me,  it was some very unsavory characters roaming around this place. Oh,  I forgot to mention the gunshots we heard overnight in the area. Never ever ever again will I stay here when I come to Charlotte.  And never again will I stay in another hotel blindly due to the name alone. As a hilton honors member,  I was extremely disappointed.I have to start out by saying this hotel is very nice, the rooms were nice, location was awesome but....Yes there is a but, the Breakfast Buffy is Terribly handled and you have this huge line only to find out I waited in line for pancakes and did not have too, could have slithered up and asked for them instead of waiting in the omlet lines for 20 mins and the wife ordered an omlet and it was wrong.LAME LAME LAME setup.Other than that the Front Desk to the Room were very good..Stayed here over Labor Day Weekend and had a great stay.  The room was terrific, breakfast was incredible - I stay at plenty of hotels with a continental breakfast, but not too many that will cook to order complimentary.  I didn't get to take advantage of it this time, but they also have a Manager's Reception every afternoon where you can get free drinks.  I read about people complaining about noise, but I didn't hear any.  Then again, I was on the 8th floor and was adjacent to one of the corner rooms.  You might want to request the top floor if you're sensitive to noise based on what others have said, but again I didn't have any issues.  The atrium is beautiful and there is a huge area if you wanted to get together with some friends and hang out.  There is also an Omaha Steakhouse on site that is really good!  Highly recommend!I like this hotel.  I've been here a lot in the past few months and they have never left me disappointed.  Every single time the van has either been waiting or is pulling up as we are walking out of the airport.  Maybe that's just lucky timing but in my line of work, it's one of the tiniest things that I actually appreciate the most.The staff here is pretty nice overall.  I've gotten attitude from the front desk in the morning while trying to sort out a last minute schedule change but oh well, maybe she was having a bad day.  The rooms are cozy and the beds are one of my favorites, I never fail to sleep well here.  I love that they are suite-type rooms so I can close a door if the atrium area is being noisy (which it generally never is).  The wifi is fast, the breakfast is fresh and delicious.  This is a big business traveler spot so beware, the gym is packed first thing in the morning.   Overall, not a bad place to stay for the night!We actually booked a room here the day of because we wanted a hotel closer to the airport so we kind of got the room for a steal at $50 with a few Hilton Points.  The outside might not be super impressive to look at, but the inside was beautiful (as per usual for the embassy suites).  The lobby has a huge atrium with a fountain and nice meeting area. We stayed on the top floor and our room was really nice! I like the quality details like having a sink in the bedroom area and living room furniture was really comfortable.The manager's special is always a nice touch that Embassy offers (though I haven't been to many that limit your drinks with tickets).  The breakfast was great with tons of options, fresh from the grill or the quick buffet line.  The kitchen ladies were super nice and cheerful.  We didn't eat at the restaurant located in the hotel, but it looked tasty and its a good option for travelers who don't want to go far but also don't want fast food.This was our first time staying here and were very pleased. The staff was really friendly and our room was spacious and very clean. The AM complimentary breakfast was also very good and once again a super friendly staff.The rooms are nice but the included breakfast sucks.  We stayed here twice.  Once on our way down to Florida and on our way back. We counted in the breakfast the first time and we're disappointed.  The second time we didn't even bother.  We skipped it and went to IHOP.  They would be much better off to just lower the price of the room and not even offer the breakfast.I travel for business 40 weeks out of the year. This hotel is by far the worst experience I have ever had. About 25 minutes after getting into my room there was a knock on the door, the manager wanted to inspect my room for someone complained about smelling smoke. I figured this was some whacky routine of theirs, I let him in and he cleared the room. Ten minutes later he was back asking me, no telling me that I have to leave. Am I a smoker? Yes. Did I even have a pack of smokes with me? No!  There was no talking to him, he was on a mission to have me leave. By far the worst travel experience I have ever had.Don't let the fancy-shmancy atrium distract you!Room had ROACHES!!!Flat screen in the room was _tiny_!In door pool was also _small_, and always crammed full of kids.  Seeing that many kids in there, I opted not even to dip my toe in--you know how kids are in swimming pools!On-site steakhouse was disappointing.Location was in the middle of a seedy-looking area!Great hotel. When u first walk in you know the hotel is above average.  Complimentary happy hour. Enough said. Rooms are very nice very comfortable. Nice flat screen TVs   The staff is very friendly and helpful. And there is a steakhouse on the first floor. This is a great place to stay.What a wonderful place! I can't say enough about the fine staff, decor and rooms. Hubby said the location is convenient to downtown and the airport. We had a suite that was bigger then my first apartment with a separate living room with tv and desk and couch. Our room had 2 large screen flat tv that did have movies to rent. Only downside for me was no tub, but only a large shower. Breakfast was a real fully cooked to order breakfast with made to order omelets, and everything else you could want. All free!! A gracious staff in the atrium setting for breakfast that moves quickly along and restaurant quality omelets to boot! I was greeted with a warm ""good morning"" from the cooks to the staffers who clean tables. A nicely appointed exercise room and pool area. Three quick elevators so no waiting. This is my new favorite place to stay in charlotte and stays on our favorites list!An excellent place to stay if you're in the Charlotte area. I spent a couple of nights there and the room was always perfectly cleaned. The suite arrangement is very nice. You have space to work / relax in one room and sleep in another.The layout is impressive with an open atrium that runs all the way up and looks down into a central area that they use for the morning buffet, fountain, etc. And the morning buffet (included with your room) is tasty with lots to choose from. Even a chef to make custom orders.I was also at an event held on the patio and exterior rear of the hotel that was catered by the hotel's restaurant. Everything was fabulous, even for a crowd of several hundred people. I'd definitely return and highly recommend staying here.My room was super big for one person! Must have been a suite. Here's the scoop:+ Friendly front desk staff+ Super huge corner suite (separate living room area with small kitchenette and dishwasher!)+ Good smellin' bathroom soaps+ Super comfy bed+Plentiful parking + Beautiful +Close to major freeway+Tasty breakfast (free!) Not that cheap continental stuff either. A full on omelet area, a couple cereal choices, sausage, eggs, juice coffee, grits (forreal haha)Overall a good choice!Stayed there the other night. Priceline express purchase.   Great attitudes from front desk to omelette cook! Rooms clean,tidyGreat experience. ValueI am a hardcore Hilton lover.  This time she cheated on me.  Staying at Hilton's over 165 nights a year I am use to receiving exceptional value.  But today April 26 I have see it all! First there was construction all over the place and it was not listed on their website.  I find that extremely disturbing.  Next was the room.  Some Hilton's show there age, this one hit the wall.  What made me sick to my stomach was I came in from work and the sofa seemed damp.  There was nothing dripping and I had a water bottle laying there so I thought it was that.  The next morning the sofa was soaked.  I looked up at a small maintenance hatch and drip drip drip.....  Called maintenance department they responded and opened up the hatch and assured me it was the cold water pipes.  Now, I get a call from the front desk, had to move to a new room.  Here is why I refuse to come back here and I caution anyone who would be thinking of coming here.   I asked if they could being the key up and a staff person to bring a trolley.  No dice, the clerk sounded as if it were my fault that I had to move!Next, looking up in the open hatch I clearly saw the bottom drain of the shower with bend underneath...MEANING MY SOFA WAS FULL OF SOMEONES USED SHOWER WATER.....  I am posting picture as proof.  Paint chips, water damage, pissed off staff, no assistance with moving....Not what I expected at an Embassy.Two more things to consider.  The hotel seems to be in a ""high risk"" area.  You see security van patrolling the parking lot non-stop.  The the final nail in the coffin.  There is a freight train line within a few hundred feet and you can hear it clearly as they go by.  For those who are old enough to remember I love Lucy there was a train scene when the Riccardo's and Mertz's were in a hillbilly hotel on their what to see  uncle Ernie and the room shook so bad the bed moved across the floor.I am being a bit dramatic on the train, but the totality of the problems makes it a place that I cannot and will not recommend.  I snapped a few shots and posted them in my page here.  Please take a look!Rude front desk upon check in- bad first impression No maid service on second day- had to call at 5pm and ask for towels at least. RUDE restaurant employees- pompous...got the eye roll and all...food not so great either. Over-chlorinated pool...could not let my daughter swim because just sitting in there for only 10 minutes burned our eyes and noses. Expected better quality from Embassy Suites but was VERY disappointed. We travel A LOT from North Carolina to Texas several times a year and have never stayed at such a rude, arrogant, unprofessional hotel EVER! Will NOT stay at Embassy Suites EVER again.","I stayed here for a conference last month and was pleasantly surprised  by how nice it was.  The lobby was very attractive, the staff was extremely helpful, and the food (especially Omaha Steak House--some of the best salmon ever, no lie) was awesome.The negatives.  Like all atrium hotels, noise from the lobby can funnel up to the 4th floor very easily.  Not a big deal during the day, but it's a different story at night.While the rooms are tastefully decorated, the mattresses have to go.  My room had two queen sized beds and both mattresses had hollowed out pits in the center.  I would stay here again, but I really hope they upgrade the mattresses before then.Grade A+ times 10. Staff was one of the best if my years traveling and staying at hotels. One of the cleanest and spacious rooms ever and if you leave some things home just go to the front desk and its free of charge.(we stayed here May 15-19, 2011) we went to our room and the moment i walked in i could smell mold. I am allergic to it so i went to look up at the air vents and it was visible there was mold. We called to the front desk to have us moved, when we got to our new room it was not as bad as the first but i could tell it wasn't good. We turned off the air for the night since it was very late. I called maintenance first thing the next morning and they said someone would come take care of it. When we got back that afternoon it didn't seem like anything was done. I got the manager on the phone and had them send maintenance back up. I asked the man if he opened the vents up and cleaned them and he said no so i asked him to take the vents off so i could show him what was in there. It was disgusting! I asked how often they clean the vents and he said ""they are supposed to clean them once a year"" but it is obvious they don't. See the pictures i added of their vents.Do not stay here unless you want to breath in mold!no please avoid.fire alarms going off all night long.loud party in common area.long lines for food.screaming children everywhere.over-crowded ... avoid!!As I have come to expect from the Hilton family of hotels, this Embassy Suites was no exception. I was staying with my husband and a friend of ours after a wedding and we were all very happy with the hotel. Despite one rude encounter with one singular night staff front desk employee, everyone we talked to at the hotel was very friendly, helpful and generally awesome. Even the cook-to-order chef at the included breakfast area was very friendly and super nice, at 6am! The lobby area was very nice and welcoming, well kept and clean. The rooms were the standard suite style rooms, plenty of space, which nice accommodations, decor and very clean. The pool area was slightly awkward, as the pool was indoors but there is an outdoor area to lay out on lawn chairs and sunbathe. The bartender at the manager's reception was super nice, and made some great suggestions for local dinner places to try. They also have a shuttle that will take you within 5 miles of the airport, and dropped us off at the lightrail station to get into downtown Charlotte. I was pleased with our stay and would recommend the location to anyone visiting the area (if you don't mind a lightrail or car ride into the city as it's a ways out from downtown).While your first thought may not be food when you hear Embassy Suites, it ought to be at least your second, especially if you have kids, and even more so if you have kids who can't agree on what they want to eat.We have one who likes the big breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, biscuits, everything he can get his hands on.  Then we have one who likes the not-so-big breakfast, which consists of cereals, breads, fruits and the like.  Note that this doesn't mean he doesn't eat a lot of it.  Just that it's not called the big breakfast in our family.So the Embassy Suites holds a special place in our hearts when it comes to food, because both kids are happy when it comes to breakfast.  And they can go back again and again.  Will it win any awards?  Probably not.  But it just fills a need, and it does so really well.  Sometimes, that's all you need.If you get stuck in Charlotte and are flying US Airways, you might end up here.  The rooms are spacious, and clean... relatively comfortable.  Their little general store was out of stock of everything, so we ended up having to walk to a CVS, but we were able to get the hotel shuttle to come and pick us up on the way back which was nice.  The room service meal we ordered was good, but way over priced.  The internet is also not free, which always is a -1 star for me.So earlier this year during all those snowstorms on the East Coast and all eastbound flights were being canceled, I somehow ended up grounded in North Carolina. Now I've vacationed in NC before and I know it's beautiful but in the dead of winter with my flight canceled and me looking at having to cough up extra $$ for a hotel, I was none too happy about being in North Carolina, beautiful or not.Since I knew I had no other choice except to spend the night in Charlotte, I wanted to make sure I wasn't stuck in some seedy motel. As a female traveling alone, I didn't want to take any chances so decided on the Embassy Suites Hotel since I'd stayed at one before and knew that even though it wasn't overly luxurious, at least I'd feel safe. There was a free shuttle bus transfer to and from the airport which was very helpful since I didn't need to worry about cab fare.For what I paid ($99 for the night which was decent considering there were probably hundreds of stranded travelers like me calling in to find a hotel room that same night), I got a very nice suite. The front desk was very helpful and sympathetic to my situation and gave me a nice room. It was actually sort of too big considering I was all by my lonesome and didn't even have any luggage except a small duffel bag.  I made the most of it by grabbing dinner downstairs (review to come), taking a bath, and ordering a movie. The bed was soft and comfortable and I slept like a baby.The next morning I had a great breakfast they'd set out downstairs and I took my free shuttle to the airport where I caught a flight to my destination. A nice stay if I do say so myself. 4 stars for service and amenities.This hotel is beautiful!  As you walk in the door you feel as if you are walking into a resort.  The rooms are more like a condo than a hotel.  You have got to see it for yourself!",,,"['love', 'hotel', 'excellent', 'gym', 'ellipticals', 'treadmills', 'weights', 'body', 'balls', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'includes', 'made', 'order', 'eggs',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ballantyne-hotel-and-lodge-charlotte-2,The Ballantyne Hotel & Lodge,4.0,$$$,54,"We love the atmosphere here. The concierge is wonderful  (Jennifer) went above and beyond to make our visit all that we hoped it would be. The spa services are wonderful. Thank you Ballantyne Hotel.Benny &amp; TonyWas here for a birthday brunch on a Sunday... in my 20 years here as a Charlotte resident, I have driven by this hotel (wait was it there when I first moved?.... I think so).  Really didn't know it as other than a golf resort and the occasional wedding reception place, but this was my first experience inside - not just doing drive-bys....Not that there would be drive-bys in the Ballantyne area (shock-faced emjoi here).Anyways... ample parking for hotel guests and visitors.  I had no idea how big the place was until it was time to decide which entrance to go into.  I chose poorly and entered through the main entrance when really the restaurant entrance is located closer to the Ballantyne commons side of the resort and not the Johnston road side.  It was nice to take a quick stroll through the hallways.Obviously looking lost, one of the employees directed me down the hall to where I needed to go - luckily they are connected but they were pretty nice about it.  Oh- some backstory: I had a big birthday gift bag with me so it was pretty clear I wasn't checking into the hotel.... unless people travel in birthday gift bags?  no judgement here.Brunch was great... lots of options on the menu and everything was prepared/executed perfectly.  I think the only hiccup in service was that the birthday celebrant's waffles were late... only because the chef didn't like how the first batch came out.The birthday celebrant graciously paid for the entire party... (I thought it was supposed to be the other way around) so I can't begin to imagine what the total bill was.  I had the eggs benedict ~$14 and coffee~$3... lets just say $20/person.  True you can probably get a brunch experience elsewhere for less money but it was nice to experience the luxury of the resort and their offerings.Alright... I'm going to do that thing that yelpers hate and say I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars and right an obnoxiously long review. I know, I know grab the pitchforks!! This is review is solely based on their specialty teas and some of their salon services. I'll start off with the services, and whew are they expensive and not worth the price!! Now that's not to say the pedicures and manicures aren't good, because the one's I've had here were good. However I can get the exact same experience at my normal go to place for $35 versus the whopping $90 here. Yes it comes with a cool blackberry martini, but no that martini is not worth the extra $55. Not to me anyways, plus my normal place even does a hot stone massage over my legs and feet. Ballantyne doesn't do that, just saying! The staff is great in the salon and girls that I had have all been good at their jobs and very friendly, however the cost just does not reflect the service!  I give the spa 4/5 stars on the whole though.Now when it comes to the specialty teas I was rather disappointed. The first tea I tried was the Downton Abbey tea and I was blown away. They use Harney and Son's tea which I love and the sandwiches were good (the chicken salad in a tarte are my absolute FAVORITES). The sweets portion of the tea were magnificent!! Our waitress who was an absolute doll told us that the pastry chef was new. She even made us little to go boxes with samples of the tea we chose and some extras of the lavender meringues because we raved about them so much. I adored her!! Since that tea was such an amazing experience I went ahead and booked 3 more teas. Next was the Queen's Birthday tea... it was okay. Nothing very British about it, we got the exact same sandwiches so nothing new there and the pastry selection was just okay. The scones were the tiniest scones I have ever seen but they tasted good. The next tea scheduled was the Marie Antoinette tea however in between that time they had a Chinese tea. I wasn't going to do that one but I saw a picture on Instagram that looked amazing ( I didn't even register that it was actually a picture from the Downton Abby tea until later). So my I took my grandmother for her bday. Our waitress bless her heart was a walking talking disaster. So very sweet and nice but so very bad at her job. English is not her first language and we had an issue there and she ended up telling me that they didn't have a reservation for me. To this day when I see her she still calls me Mrs. Todd (not my name). The tea was laid out like a traditional Chinese tea but they were not executing it properly. My grandmother has been to China many times and knows her stuff and she made a small fuss and had her do it properly as best she could. The sandwiches again were the same and the pastries were abysmal. Not going to lie it was the most drab atrocious thing I'd ever seen. I complained on Instagram and Ballantyne responded. Said they wanted to make it right the next time I came in which honestly they didn't do anything differently. Well Marie Antoinette tea came next and it was okay but nothing ""special"" for a ""specialty"" tea. They also lost my reservation AGAIN so fail on making it up to me. Although we did get free glasses of champagne for the lost reservation. So I had previously booked the Christmas tea for 7 and made them double check my reservation. I was told yet again it was lost and then an hour later it was found. I didn't have high hopes for the Christmas tea. I got my original waitress back for this tea and she was great as always. The sandwiches were different and not as good this time and the chicken salad was missing (big disappointment). The pastries were good/fine but again nothing wow about them. For whatever reason the Downton Abbey tea got so much creativity and deliciousness but it was all downhill from there. Most likely I won't be back especially considering the cost. I waited till now for the review because I wanted to give them a chance to redeem themselves. Maybe I expected too much after one excellent experience. So tea I say at this point 3/5 stars and that's being generous, which is sad considering there aren't many places in Charlotte who do a proper tea.Went to a wedding and reception at The Lodge. Loved it! Such a great venue. The wedding was held downstairs in a private room which was set up perfectly for a smaller-medium sized wedding. We then went upstairs for the cocktail hour and reception, which boasts a dance floor, which is separate from the dining room area. The cocktail area is right when you walk in The Lodge, and the rooms are upstairs. It's a great all-in-one place that allows guests to stay there from out of town.The service was great, and all the staff I interacted with were friendly. The hors d'oeuvres were creative - there was a chicken and waffle, mini burgers, and mozzarella cheese rolls. The dinner was just okay, but that may have been what the wedding party selected (it was fried chicken, bbq pulled pork, side salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and bread). The wedding cake was not very tasty at all, however. Just a bland, stock chocolate and vanilla cake with frosting. I couldn't even eat it all and I have a sweet tooth - just didn't enjoy it.Everything else about the venue was great!Catered Dining Hall Event: I came here last weekend for an informational session and was pretty impressed with the set up. You could park wherever you want pretty much and there's no BS parking fee. Very formal with water glasses, pitchers, and mints for every two seats. There was a table in the back with coffee, sodas, and little bites. The email said small bites but it was more like mini BBQ pork sliders. They actually weren't that bad, I was just impressed they had them at all. The chocolate chip cookies and fresh fruit were yummy. I wasn't a fan of the watery coffee. All in all, pretty good.Teatime at the Ballantyne! We went here with a friend and fellow Yelper who had previously attended tea time and it was lovely. They offer the afternoon tea in large comfortable chairs around lovely little tables just off to the side of the main entry to the hotel. After we settled in we were offered a menu with the assurance the only choice we needed to make was the tea that we would like to sample. They had a wide selection from traditional black teas to the seasonal light summer fruity teas. I selected the Darjeeling, and it was delicious. Even better than the teas were the pastries and sandwiches provided with the tea. We received 10 mini sandwiches (is there an official term for them? I feel like tea time is the appropriate time to use exact vocabulary) and we had two sandwiches of each of the five varieties. My personal favorite was the egg salad, though I must give special mention to the smoked salmon since it had a good portion of salmon to bread and was delicious (I am not usually a fan of smoked salmon!). The dessert tray was masterfully presented and served with lemon curd, clotted cream and jam. There were so many desserts I experienced a sugar high and low by the time we left but I was able to sample one of each so it was worth it.Our server was impeccably polite and they brought the tea and finger food around on an adorable little tray. She came around several times with a water pitcher and hot water to refill our teapots. The teatime presented the perfect opportunity to dress up and have a mid-afternoon social event. The only consideration I have is the cost. At $32 a person it is actually more expensive than tea at the British Museum even accounting for the exchange rate.  However, a trip to the Ballantyne is much cheaper than a plane ticket across the pond so we will most likely return for special occasions.I stayed at the lodge adjacent to the main building. charming building with an old-world feel in well-appointed and cosy rooms. Staff was great and very friendly. Gym is small and disappointing. Will return if in Charlotte again.Was in town for a business conference. Beautiful decor, comfortable and relaxing room with balcony view to the golf course...amazing. The customer service was great and I want to give a shout out to the two young men who were my shuttle drivers during my stay...the young man from NY and the one who is looking to study film...thank u for your hospitality!I got my hair cut by Serena here and she did an amazing job. It's the best hair cut I've ever received. I get compliments on it daily. She is kind and well educated in her craft.  I believe she cut off about 8 inches!!I attended a conference here a few weeks ago and had really high expectations since it is part of the exclusive Luxury Collection.  The hotel is certainly nice, but not the caliber I was expecting.  The lobby and amenity spaces are quite nice, but the rooms are in need of some upgrading.  The pillows are very flat and the bedding was quite dated.  Overall, a very good experience though - extremely friendly staff at the front desk!Stayed at the Lodge for work. The rooms are massive and includes a pretty big hot tub. The only thing I can't stomach is that the price of this place is quoted at $299/night. Although I didn't pay for the rooms since the host company did I don't think this hotel is anywhere near that price. The curtains are outdated and the couches are old. I get that this for corporate events due to the golf course but come on.. at this price they should update the basics. If your conference is at the Hotel and not the Lodge you will need to take a long walk. I can't believe there isn't even an access point without going on the main street. Kind of strange.It is a Starwood property so at least you can get the points. Plenty of parking and wifi is $14.95/24 hours.END OF REVIEW: 2 of 2I went in and they tried to figure it out for us, they were very polite at the front desk. I go downstairs to change, and couldn't find an attendant in the oddly appointed greeting area downstairs to follow up on this... maybe THEY could help find our drinks that were MIA! So, at this point, (which was actually my husband's birthday), he  just wanted to leave. We changed, went back upstairs, and asked to check out. I asked the gentleman to just please see if he could get us our drinks and we'll take them to our room - at this point, our room would be more relaxing than this frustration. He politely agreed and we proceeded to checkout.Now, as a plus, I had very meticulously planned every detail of the day for over a month. I spoke with a front desk (hotel) manager, and Lydia in the spa many times over email. Both were extremely helpful and accommodating. I would give the spa 1 star if it weren't for my prior/pre-experience with Lydia. Also, my masseuse (a gentleman) was great as well - great pressure and technique! Lydia had confirmed I could use my SpaWish gift certificates for our visit (the hotel participates in this program) - which I was grateful for! At spa checkout, I gave the gal my gift certs and paid the balance to the room bill. I got a call from her a few minutes after we returned to our room (after waiting for the bar to make our drinks - the Ballantyne was great, the basil one was disgusting and we dumped it). There had been a mix-up with SpaWish noting two of my vouchers had been previously redeemed - I took care of this with SpaWish separately and in the meantime the spa was very patient as I gave them different vouchers/gift cards to redeem so we were able to close out without incident. I appreciated their patience with this after the fact. Appreciatively, as SPG Gold, we were allotted a late 4PM checkout. We intended to shower and nap before heading to a different uptown hotel for that evening. We had a 6-course wine-dinner booked at Ruth's Chris which we were looking forward to, but simply wanted to stay closer to the restaurant Sunday evening. On the heels of all these aforementioned adventures at Ballantyne, we decided to just pack up and leave for our uptown hotel. Net, I've heard great things about this hotel and greater things about the spa &amp; restaurant. I will say the golf (Ballantyne course &amp; the Dana Radar School were exceptional!) But the GPI I benchmark it against puts it to shame. Overall, pretty hotel and the rooms are nice.  The communication with the staff in planning this special weekend was rather exceptional, so I appreciate that! The Gallery Restaurant wasn't impressive (though, brunch Sunday morning - crab cake benedict - was very good!). Skip the Gallery for lunch though - I wouldn't go back for dinner. Leading up to our hotel stay, I called on three occasions only to have nobody answer at the Gallery restaurant - and yes, it was during business hours. Hence, we didn't do our Saturday dinner with wine and the Chef's coursed meal... The staff/admin at the Spa were fantastic. Though, the spa as a whole doesn't have their act together. It is a very pretty spa with nice amenities, but when you stay at a Spa resort you expect seamless transitions. Our 'service' providers were late in picking us up for our treatments. One failed to tell my husband to return to the men's lounge where he'd be picked up for his next treatment. So... the Birthday Boy stood awkwardly in the hallway until someone kindly alerted me that he wasn't sure where he was supposed to be. So I went out to the hall (in the ""quiet treatment area"") and let him know where to go. The transitions were poor between treatments!In fairness, I would like to point out there were a few people who were exceptional leading up to our visit - they were all thoughtful and timely with their follow-ups to my inquiries as I meticulously planned every detail. These individuals were prompt, professional and accommodating - so I thank them (omitting last names for public Yelp review cut &amp; paste): Lydia (spa - she was especially helpful with my planning needs and questions), Carolina K. (hotel), Alan G. (hotel), Cameron B. (hotel) &amp; Audrey B. (hotel). Nice facilities, nice people, but not an A-Class experience overall - you PAY FOR THE EXPERIENCE PLUS THE VENUE - great venue, underwhelming experience. VERY disappointed in the room problem (This was a BIG deal), plus I'd called and emailed three times to confirm this. Thankfully, we slept ok in our parking-lot view room, but missed our drinks with lunch and just had a mediocre experience overall.All in, after the total cost, I would rather drive a few hours for an experience that is far superior at the same price. It was worth a try since we're local...Stayed at the Ballantyne for one night with my wife for our anniversary.  We had the spa package (massage and pedicure) to start, then checked in our room. Because it was our anniversary, we were upgraded at no extra cost, and got a view of the golf course. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very professional.  A very good experience all around for both of us.We went there for afternoon tea. It's held in the lobby, which I always find a little disappointing due to noise, and overall traffic. Lucky for us we were the only ones and they sat us by the fireplace. The scones were small and tasty, the sandwiches were great! Good selection of teas. There was a lot of sweets, but only half were worth it. Good service. Overall, not the best afternoon tea experience I've ever had but decent.Let me say first of all that I have not personally stayed at this resort; however, this is where I used to make a reservation for the owners of the company that I previously worked for, so I did get to see the hotel's rooms, the common areas, and the restaurant. My guests LOVED this place! The food is good. The hotel is clean. The service is impeccable. No, it isn't inexpensive.I highly recommend this resort for out of town visitors who demand a really NICE place for the night.Time of Stay: Weekend of July 18thThe Ballantyne Hotel in South Charlotte is a beautiful property belongs to Luxury Collection Hotel who is managed by Starwoods. There are 103 Luxury Collection hotels in the world. The property has a beautiful Golf Course, indoor &amp; outdoor poor, in additional all the beautiful decorations inside of the hotel. On top of that, Gallery Restaurant at The Ballantyne is great, it is a must try! Customer service: It is simply amazing from the moment you entered the property. Valet /Bellman was good, Front desk staffs were really friendly and happy ! Housekeeping staffs were also good. In room dining food tastes really good, server was really helpful when it comes t o picking up the right food. Yes, it was delivered within 30 minutes. Food was delivered in about 24 minutes. Concierge at The Ballantyne were amazing!  Amanda wrote a card to ensure that we had a great stay. It is better than giving you a bottle of red wine and some flowers. Little thing like hand written card will make hotel guests really happy. Martin also recommended some amazing places to visit in Charlotte area.  Why did I give it a 4 stars. The exterior wall of the hotel needs to be cleaned badly. Sorry I used to work for luxury hotels, and I am a graduated of Hospitality Management program. So I look at the little details in the hotel that requires improvement. The shower door in our room can't be closed properly. So when I was taking shower, the bathroom gets really wet. The room also muggy smell to it, but it was clean. Not sure how or why, the room has this type of smell. We asked housekeeping for some air freshener after check in. Yes, I DO WANT RECOMMEND ALL MY FRIENDS &amp; FAMILY &amp; STRANGERS TO THIS  BEAUTIFUL PROPERTY :) WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN, TOO ;)One of the best experiences I've ever had, and I've been to resorts around the world!!!  Awesome experience!!Have visited people staying here, have attended luncheons and dinners and have enjoyed many of their displays and exhibitions throughout the year.It is a gorgeous facility, very classy and opulent.  The staff is professional and formal.  Have always been struck at how in good old south Charlotte that there can be such a first class facility.  But it is there and is worth a visit. Special occasions would be great to celebrate here.My husband I are were in town from So Cal for my sister's wedding.  Beautiful property, very friendly staff.  Room service was fantastic and the prices were surprisingly conservative, which is not typical for room service.   The Spa was also nice, and the gym was pretty well equipped.  If we are ever in that part of the country again, no question we'd stay there.If you really want to get away this is the place for you. I stayed here for two nights the staff was very helpful and willing to do anything to make sure your stay nothing short of amazing. The spa was nice, neat , relaxing and smelled amazing. The sheets are nice  fluffy and the rooms were very clean. The gallery restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and the food taste great. I had all three meals here. I recommend the fried chicken. Will definitely come back.","Over the past four years, I have attended a lot of corporate events at the Ballantyne Resort and for the most part, everything is good.   There have been 1 or 2 service issues on a couple of occasions at the corporate functions, but no huge issues.Dec 2013 we had our company holiday party in one of the ballrooms in the main resort instead of the Lodge, and it was overall very good. There were a couple of small snafus during the dinner service, but when you are trying to serve 180 people sit down pre-ordered dinner selections, there are bound to be a couple of small mix-ups. Staff was good about trying to quickly resolve the issues, so everyone eventually ended up with the correct orders.I have to say the quality of my guestroom that evening after the party was quite exceptional. The room was a King Grand Deluxe &amp; the bed was very comfy! The bathroom was quite luxurious as well! I have stayed at The Grove Park Inn in Asheville as well, and I think the guestrooms are much nicer &amp; more elegant here. 5 stars for my room.The one really negative experience I have had here happened May 2, 2014. I went to meet my significant other after he finished playing golf at the resort. He was still playing when I arrived so I went to the bar &amp; ordered a drink. He then texted me to let me know he was about to play the 18th.  I asked the bartender if I could move outdoors to watch &amp; she said that it was no problem at all.  So I took my drink and sat at a hightop overlooking the 18th.  After golf was finished, my SO came up to join me on the patio. There were 2 male servers working outside that day and they were terrible! Both my SO and I tried on several occasions to flag one of them over (they were completely ignoring our table). When we FINALLY got one to acknowledge us we asked for water &amp; a menu (by this point it was dinner time &amp; we were both hungry). We never got that water or a menu. Finally my SO went back into the bar to pay for my previous drink &amp; told the bartender about our experience. She apologized profusely and refused to let him pay for my drink.  She was very professional &amp; helpful, and I give her 5 stars for her level of service.  However, I give those 2 male servers who were working outdoors on the patio between 6:30-8:00 pm on 5/2/2014 absolutely zero stars!!! If that were my first &amp; only experience at the Ballantyne Resort, I am not so sure I would go back. Because of the poor service out on the patio, we elected to leave and go elsewhere for dinner that night. Its a shame because you definitely expect much more professional service from the waitstaff at a place like this!As an update to a previous review, the Gallery manager called me and could not have been more understanding, gracious and concerned about my experience. I assured him it was only one night out of many positive experiences we have had. I felt as if the management really tries to serve its patrons in the manner to be expected from such a lovely resort. I am impressed with the immediate attention I received.Very nice facility.  Professional, friendly staff.  Great location in SE Charlotte.Wonderful place to eat dinner, go to SPA and take better half for in-town vacation.Book early, as special events will sell out the facility.This is where the Obamas stay when in town.Did not stay overnight, but instead visited for Gingerbread Lane.  This hotel is much grander than initially anticipated and very beautiful.. I pass it almost daily, as I work in the business park across the street.  Beautifully decorated.  Hotel staff are very pleasant and engaging.  I would definitely visit again, and depending on the price- possibly spend a night enjoying a room and the various amenities.Christmas Day Brunch at The Gallery at Ballantyne Hotel was excellent.   There were beautiful winter wonderland ice sculptures to set the mood.  It was a beautiful buffet set up with carvers on two ends and the side dishes in the middle.  The turkey was very moist and tender.  The most delicious collard greens were one of the best dishes ever.   I don't usually care for mashed potatoes but these were divine.   There was another setup for cheeses, grilled vegetables, and salads.  There was an omelette station set up outside the main dining room.  The dessert station was set up with beautiful Christmas desserts and there was a bananas foster station. We had decent service by a very polite sever.  They were very busy.  I had a pumpkin tart for dessert that was out of this world.  This was 75.00 per person but it was Christmas and it was beautiful.I'm a bit of a hotel snob- Ive stayed over 90 days in Starwood properties over the past year. So when i go to a property in the luxury collection I have high expectations. I expect St Regis / ritz kind of luxury and service. This property didn't deliver and neither did the staff.  It was ordinary, which, in the luxury collection, just doesn't cut it. I should have stayed it the aloft which is just down the street. I'm confident that they would have exceeded my more modest expectations.Our friend got us a night here as a gift after our wedding, and so we were on cloud nine anyway, but everything was excellent while we were here.  I can't really rate the place in the traditional sense of a hotel, because we didn't even have to check in, since our friends had checked in for us to decorate the rooms with rose petals and cake, etc.  And we left early the next day, so we didn't use any other part of the hotel. The only issue we had while we were there was the TV didn't work, but we didn't get it fixed, so it didn't matter since we were other-wise engaged....Nice place, but for what I think our friends payed, I don't think it's as nice as it could be.This is more a business resort-hotel rather than a family resort, in fact, in the three days I was there I didn't see one child. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff highly professional but with a pleasant North Carolina touch of down home. The food is slightly above, in fact the room service is the fastest I've ever had anywhere in the world and the prices are oddly low.This review is for the Afternoon Tea. I've been to the Ballantyne hotel numerous times for afternoon tea and I absolutely love it! I've taken family and friends visiting from out of town and I've visited just because it would make for a lovely Saturday afternoon.Afternoon tea seating is in the lobby of the hotel where they set up low tables and comfy seating  - perfect for a relaxing afternoon. The only thing you have to decide on is your tea. You are offered a menu to choose your tea - it's a pretty wide selection  - but my favorite is the vanilla.  Depending on the time of year, they also have special teas such as a holiday tea.The rest of your tea consists of a preset selection of tea sandwiches, scones and pastries. It all comes out on beautiful china and tiered serving trays. The sandwiches and pastries do sometimes change with the seasons but they are all very good.The service is very attentive. Patricia, the server we see most often, is great. She recognizes us and is so welcoming each time we visit. She even remembers where we like to sit :)Afternoon tea is offered only Tuesday through Saturday from 1:00 - 5:00pm so I do recommend reservations on Saturday.  And it is a leisurely experience, so expect to hang out and relax.I won't check out for another hour or so but I had to get on yelp to share my love and praise for TheBallantyne Hotel and Lodge. Unbelievable and consistent service! This property is INCREDIBLE. Check in yesterday was flawless. The front desk was more than patient with me with my several questions: where's the fitness center, the business center, my key to the business center won't work, forgot a toiletry can you help...They were amazing and extremely accommodating in sharing where I could find everything including the pool and spa.  The fitness center is great. So much nicer than what I'm used to in a hotel.  Large facility,plenty of machines and free weights. Two onsite trainers.  H20 available if you wish along with plenty of towels and great music to get you into your workout groove. The TVs on the treadmill off you the chance to listen to music, watch TV, play games.  Get this, the TV personal screens are not killed with TV snow. You actually get a CLEAR visible screen! Bonus. :) The staff was also very sensitive to who had water and who needed water.  You didn't have to go searching for it. It was brought to you. The in-room dining is spectacular.  Ordered the Hearts of Romaine salad which was HUGE. The dressing was a parmigiano-reggiano flavor and placed to the side which is my preference.  Sauteed Atlantic Salmon was the largest piece I had ever seen and made to my medium order. Braised mushrooms were hot and very savory.  Definitely go for the chocolate availability of the day: mine happen to be double chocolate cake.  Probably could have ordered a glass of wine only but didn't see any glass options in the menu; only half bottle and full.  Will need to ask if you order. Their guarantee is your hot meal served in 30 minutes.  My server was incredible. Very polished and very polite. 'May I come in' and carefully explained everything to me and put it all together in a beautiful spread.  Offered to come get the dishes or I could place everything in the hall. The bed was the best I'd ever experienced. SOFTEST bed and pillows you will EVER experience.  They really make it tough to want to get out of bed. :)  My wake up call was perfect. Told me the date, time, temperature outside and would I like fresh made coffee delivered to my room? :)  The shower was perfect. I sound like a broken record player here but I mean what I say...it was perfect pressure. Perfect towels that were HUGE and very soft they envelope you very comfortably.  Dine at the Gallery onsite restaurant. I went for breakfast this AM and again, the service from my hostess to my server was perfection.  You are treated as an honored guest and it was a fabulous experience.  Ordered me a veggie omelette with egg whites, whole wheat toast and a side of fruit in lieu of potatoes.  Ice tea made half and half.  My server was attentive, kept me at a good pace, was professional and very welcoming. When my meal came out with white bread, she was all over replacing my white with my ordered wheat.  I was waiting for my tea to be delivered early in my sit down meal when the hostess noticed I didn't have anything at my table and could she get me a drink? This staff spots you, watches you and cares for you. Unbelievable service and very, very kind. My biggest take-away re: The Ballantyne is outstanding and consistent service.  I don't know how many staff I passed on the way to the gym, the business center, the Gallery and every single representative from the property was beyond professional, acknowledged me, SMILED, offered kind words and you felt very safe.  It's like connecting with ONE person throughout your entire stay and the best part is you get exposure to multiple people all with the same mission. I have never experienced anything like it. My company booked our meeting here and at a glance to the agenda and property I didn't know what I didn't know. Having experienced The Ballantyne in Charlotte was a very memorable experience.  Heaven on earth right here in NC. Who knew!  THANKS BALLANTYNE!!!!!!Free valet, prompt check in, smiles, almost st regis style, amazing (really amazing) food, two great pools inside and out, huge gym (for a hotel) and golf course views. Awesome property.So to be more specific, this review is for the Ballantyne Hotel's SPA.  I recently received a gift card for the SPA.  I chose to go with the Axiomm Gel Nail Treatment because I have gotten it done before at Polished (Shellac) and hear the Axiomm stays on longer and looks better (obviously I was pumped).So making an appt was pretty easy, everyone was really sweet, my nail tech joked around with us and she was funny - and they had water with strawberries in it - who doesn't love prissy water?!  I sure as heck do.Unfortunately the Gel Treatment was a bust - or at least they didn't do a very good job of applying it because it started peeling and cracking two days later.  BUMMER.  On the upside - I gave them a call and told them what happened and they sent me a another certificate for the full refund.... so I can't complain too much.My advice?  If you want Shellac or Axxiom, go to Polished!  They do a way better job and it's cheaper.  Spend your money at the SPA on something else!Not a terrible experience, just a lesson.  Best of luck!This review is for the tea only. Very disappointing. The sandwiches are tasteless. The filling is so thin you can't tell what you're eating. The desserts change daily, so we must have come on a bad day. The menu says the foods are locally sourced. I'm skeptical about that, or else the area has some pretty bad food. If the food is made ""fresh"" daily, ours must have been made that morning. The tea itself was just ok. For $32 a pop it is overpriced by about $30. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice afternoon tea. There is not even enough ambiance to justify the cost. The only good thing was the polite &amp; friendly service.This hotel is absolutely beautiful. From the entrance to the kiwi strawberry fresh water they have at the front desk.. I attended a wedding &amp; reception there. The ceremony was outside and was beautiful. The reception was inside of course and the hall was also very elegant looking. The food was catered by an outside  vendor. I was however disappointed with the drink pour at the reception. It wasn't even an ounce.. and when I asked for a double, the ""bartender"" got an attitude and said it was against company policy when earlier I had gone over to get a drink from another bartender. Obviously there is no structure with the staff. Another thing I noticed is that the staff had no idea what the food was and during lunch and dinner they were not prompt to put the food out on time. meaning a dish was empty and it took them at least 5 mins to refill. Again beautiful hotel but I believe the event planner from the Hotel along with Staff needs better training. I would not recommend this place for events. However after the wedding we went upstairs to the Lounge/Bar and had Mimosas which were made perfectly and the staff there were very friendly.My wife and I loved it here.  Staff was excellent, room gorgeous, and across the street are sorts of things.  The room was overlooking the golf course and there was a large mirror on the wall (hubba-hubba).  I would love to go back right now... That's right, leave work and go back.Just happens that clients have had a few offsite meetings here lately, one at the Lodge and one at the resort proper.  Both times, we were met with excellent service and excellent accommodations.  The Lodge is a bit more casual in style as befitting something with the name, Lodge but don't let casual fool you.  This was a nice, well-appointed room.The main resort is a bit swankier with the Spa, furnishings in the rooms, etc. Both locations offer the same level of attentive service one would expect for the price.  We had a cooking class as a team event last night with two chefs from the Gallery restaurant helping us through preparations of Southern and Italian (not Southern Italian!) meals.  The were encouraging and helpful, fun guys who led us through the preparation of what turned out to be some outstanding food.  Highly recommended for a group activity!Great place in all regards!Rooms are top notch and the bathroom is amazing. Enjoyed are two day stay. There is golf, tennis, swimming and a gym. You can walk to places to eat, or eat at the award winning gallery restaurant.  I would have given this a five star rating but the spa did not measure up to the rest of the hotel, and lacked customer service and the relaxation factor. Skip the spa and enjoy the rest of the hotel, it is grand.5 stars for luxury service, room, lobby, pool, restaurant!Amazingly friendly and pleasant staff. Gorgeous property and room. Wow!Beautiful. Elegant.  Of course.  This is to be expected.  Two complaints - You have to PAY FOR wi-fi.  Come on, even McDonald's has free wifi.  Two - the beautiful marble floors in the bathroom are very slippery.  But, you can wear the super soft comfortablel slippers given to you t in the room.","Ok, so my last visit was a VERY long time ago. I went there for a friend's blow out birthday party and everything was fabulous. We got a room so as to be able to drink and not have to drive. (Can you tell we were going to have fun? LOL) Anyway, the room was beautiful and overlooked the golf course. It was spotless and when we got back after the party the room had been turned down. It was great not to have to fumble around to get into bed. The breakfast the next day really hit the spot. It was delicious and much needed.I'm writing this now because I had forgotten I had a gift card that I never finished spending. I emailed them this morning to get the balance and within 2 minutes had a response. Talk about fantastic customer service! Wow! When I emailed back to thank her, once again I got an immediate response to help with anything else if needed in the future and to have a great day. After this many back and forth emails I'm beginning to think I might need to send her a birthday card when it's time. ;) But seriously, what great customer service. I loved the place before but love it even more now if that's possible. Kudos Ballantyne!This hotel lodge was excellent. It is Christmas Eve and the service was just excellent. The lady was so sweet and nice working the lobby ..not even giving it a thought but helping and being cheerful! Excellent food and great area!This place is pure class. I just had my wedding reception there and couldn't have been more pleased with how it turned out. Alli Hall was my planner and she was absolutely amazing. The staff is friendly and will treat you like family here. The rooms are comfortable and service impeccable. The cottage was perfect for our after wedding party and for my wedding party to get comfortable. If it's a one night escape or a large event you are planning, I highly recommend this hotel!I've been here a number of times, and every visit I experience the same consistent top-notch resort-level service and comfort, highlights being:Service: impeccable, they really know how to make you feel welcome without being at all intrusive. You can tell they've been trained well. When you check-in, you can get fruit-infused water or hot cider depending on the season. When you first enter your room, you're greeted by little Ballantyne chocolates on your bed and soothing classical music. If you're staying for more than one night, they usually remember you on a first name basis.Comfort: beds are nearly almost as comfortable as those you would get at the W. Also, soaps and shampoos are from Remede, which is the standard St. Regis bathroom set. I love their bathrobes (super comfortable) and slippers. Showers and sink are great.Atmosphere: upscale in a southern way, spacious and beautiful. Lobby is amazing and so are the bathrooms. This place is like a giant mansion where you have plenty of hallways and spiral staircases to walk around. Not to mention the golf court and patios that overlook the golf course.Location: If you like to be away from the city in a nice area with a good restaurant scene, this place is perfect. If you prefer the city, then you should try to shoot for one of the hotels in the city.Every time I come here, it's really like a heaven. In terms of service, a wonderful blend of professionalism and family feel. In terms of comfort, they really have it all there from your soft pillow and mattress to the fancy shampoo brand you're using.Review is for the Lobby Bar only.Dad's sister and BIL were in town for just one night.  We met them here for drinks and dinner later at The Gallery Restaurant (separate review)  Setting and atmosphere were perfect for catching up with family not seen in more than a year and for sharing pictures and stories.  We sat in the very comfy upholstered furniture near the fireplace rather than closer to the bar which was a bit more boisterous.Cocktails were reasonably sized, not what I would describe as generous and, although I didn't see the bill, I would guess they were not inexpensive.Service was prompt and friendly.  But they did ask to ""hold"" a credit card at the bar until we closed our tab.  Always makes me nervous to have a credit card out of my sight for any length of time.If you need a place for cocktails with the parents or in-laws or to impress a potential client, this could be a good option for you.Great resort property with that added plus, golf! A little ways out from downtown but alot nearby to keep you busy. Having business there it was a perfect place for a 3 day layover.The food and drink were more than adequate with the on site restaurant and bar, The Gallery. Situated toward the rear of the hotel, the outdoor veranda overlooks the 18th green fronted by a picturesque water hazard. All in all very fare and decent prices on their wine list and appetizer menu.Rooms were above average in size with well appointed furniture and bathroom features. A major plus for most hotels these days seems to be their pride in beds and being a Starwood property it is no surprise that these were ""heavenly"" to sleep in, one of those that you don't want to jump out of right away. Within walking distance is a lively Fox and Hound Smokehouse &amp; Tavern with various other stores and restaurants including Nikko's and Carolina Wings &amp; Rib House. The golf course was challenging and enjoyable for all levels with undulating fairways and fast but true greens. We only got to play 10 holes but not a dull layout in the bunch. So next time for business or pleasure we'll stay here again without any reservations.They changed from 'resort' to hotel no matter what the name is the is a nice place to stay. The rooms are top notch, I've never had a bad meal in the gallery restaurant. There are several bars on the property one right off the main lobby which has a balcony overlooking the 18th green. The other bar has a nice feel with a big screen to watch a game, etc. They added a new pool last year which makes the property more attractive. I've never used the spa so I really do not know much about it. I ha e played the course and used the range. It is playable for the average golfer but the width of the fairways is gonna be a challenge if you can not keep it at least a little straight. The greens are somewhat forgiving but in the middle of the summer they get fast.I think they have a golf school there but not sure. The pro shop has all you need high end. They have club rental also.If you stay in this country club spa-like hotel, request a golf view, otherwise you'll be staring at the parking lot and CVS across the street.  The room I stayed it was nice--you felt like you were in a room in your grandmother's house, provided your grandmother liked touches of southern charm (and wallpaper). I wouldn't call it luxury, but it was comfortable, clean, sunny, and the room service was reasonable and attentive. Everyone working there seemed helpful and friendly, and having a glass of wine and a flatbread on the terrace in the evening was relaxing and quiet. Overall, Ballantyne might be the kind of place that Clooney might have stayed in for Up in the Air given its convention / golfer group vibe. Maybe I'm just not up on how it works for people in the south. There's not many appealing places to eat nearby, but chances are you will not be staying here long.So far a very nice hotel .,it's big and rooms and bathrooms are nice the restaurant is wonderful alsoThis was a pretty fancy hotel. We stayed on the 7th floor, with amazing views. The pool was my favorite part! The chairs were comfy, the pool temps were perfect, &amp; the drinks/food served fantastic. Loved the bar/restaurant inside the hotel. Delicious food.I have to say I am incredibly impressed with how quickly the staff at the hotel wrote back about my review. It goes to show my first impression on the staff was correct. It's hard to not be a fan of them. I would go back again for a second try, maybe I went on an off weekend. Definitely be sure to ask for a golf view though.to add to Keith Y <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/tM3oXoB1VqkfSLZU9bH9TA#hrid:gh9XOEgBn_oh8_DVzAApnA"">yelp.com/biz/tM3oXoB1Vqk...</a>Country club feel hotel.

Excellent hospitality.Overall a wonderful resort!  We are here right now, and they have been great.  They were a little snotty at first, but I found most of the people to be very helpful, and it is a great property, with 2 swimming pools - indoor and outdoor, a fitness facility, golf school on the property, and driving range and golf course.  We ate at the restaurant a few times, and it was not bad, not too pricey.  The rooms are fabulous, nice view, spacious bathroom, and it is well located next to several shopping complexes and malls.  overall a very nice vacation!",,,"['love', 'atmosphere', 'concierge',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-charlotte-uptown-charlotte,Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte Uptown,4.0,$$,42,"Nice and clean but dated and in need of revitalization. This Hilton Garden Inn property offers free (round trip) shuttle within 3 miles, snacks, wine, frozen pizza and Charlotte souvenirs behind the from desk and a full service restaurant. There is an indoor pool attached to a tiny fitness room (not subtle for anything but cardio) but better than nothing at all I assume.Hotel staff was extremely hospitable and accommodating; namely Adrian at the front desk, Maly &amp; Kyle in the restaurant, Santorio the shuttle driver and each of the female chefs who prepared my meals just as I desired morning &amp; evening. I simply would not have enjoyed my stay without the outstanding service of these employees and I am grateful. The rooms were spacious and neat; my kitchenette area came equipped with microwave, frig, Keurig coffee maker, tiny sink and plenty of counter space. There were flat screen TV's in both my living &amp; bedroom, sofa bed, lounge chair with ottoman and desk for working. The bath towels were thick while the bed linens were a bit thin and lacking the comfort I'd expect from a Hilton property. My room also offered a beautifully priceless view of Uptown Charlotte.Enjoy your stay. ~ChristyI stayed here for the weekend of June, 10th. During my stay I had a horrible experience with a shuttle driver by the name of Al, Al was extremely rude and disrespectful to me due to a miscommunication on the hotels part which resulted in me sitting outside of a restaurant for 45 minutes in the humid heat while Al attempted to retrieve me 3 different times at the incorrect location, Finally I gave the address to the hotel clerk(who should have asked from the beginning if they didn't know exactly where I was) Al berated me, insulted me and essentially committed everything NOT to do while in a customers service role.When I returned to the hotel I was fuming, Fortunately a manager(Jim) was on staff to assist, he reassured me this was not company policy, that the issue would be addressed and as a way to apologize Jim offered me a refund on 2 of my 3 nights stay. This is where things got even worse...Today is August 31st, in the 82 days since my stay I received 1 call from Jim about a week after my stay advising me that a check would be in the mail within the next 7-10 business days, Great! After 14 business days I follow up, and after multiple calls to different people I am assured that the check is on his desk and will be sent ASAP. After another 2 weeks I follow up again, I'm advised a different story, that this has to go to corporate and they will have it out as soon as possible and that its a top priority. When asked about the different stories Jim simply brushes me off and says his hands are tied at this time. another 2 weeks go by and I call back AGAIN, and play phone tag with Jim(in which he never returns my calls, but requires me to continue to call back until I get him.) I am told that they have a manager with some priority authorization to get a check out expedited with priority shipping. Great! I am excited to finally have this all behind me! another week and a half later(today), I call Jim to follow up. He's oblivious to the status of my check, has no idea whats up with it and immediately offers to transfer me to someones voicemail... no.Jim gives me the run around AGAIN, placing blame on others and essentially not taking ownership of the situation and says he'll call be back tomorrow with an update. I've called the Hilton now over a dozen times, had to deal with Jim's incompetence and all I want is this to be behind me! I just want my $250 bucks back so I can move on. It's unfortunate that I am staying at another Hilton hotel this week on a trip to California as this has been the worst customer service experience I have ever dealt with in my life.This was a great hotel. The check in clerk was really nice. The room was spacious and clean - had nice furniture and an adjustable bed. There was free wifi that actually worked and was fast. The hotel is walking distance to lots of bars, restaurants, and parks downtown. They even had fresh baked cookies in the lobby. Free! And delicious. The lobby and shared restrooms were absolutely spotless. An excellent choice for a hotel stay in Charlotte.This hotel has a great location and is very clean. On the other side though our room felt very dated. The furniture and the bed were old and not modern at all. I would only stay there again if it was significantly cheaper than other nicer hotels downtown. The staff was very friendly.Very impressed with how accommodating they were. Meghan at the front desk &amp; the manager Jim really helped us out! Our reservation got screwed up &amp; completely took care of it. Nice to have people help you out during the hectic holiday season.My Charlotte experience would not be complete without the unforgettable stay in Hilton Garden Inn. Everything is just a short distance. Close to the Charlotte Transit Center, the hustle and bustle of Uptown Charlotte, and very close to Nascar Hall of Fame. What made it more pleasant to stay is the friendliness of the staff and the way they make sure your stay is nothing but very satisfactory! They also have a shuttle that can drive you to your destination and even request them to fetch you from where you are as long as its within three-miles. A laundry facility is also available in the third floor free of charge if you opt to do your own laundry. All you need to buy is the detergent they sell near the front desk (The Pavilion Pantry) for $1.50. In the Pavilion Pantry you can find snacks, cereals, key chains, magnets, and drinks. Overall, my first experience in Charlotte is unforgettable not only the breathtaking beauty of The Queen City but also to this place I call 'home away from home'.Nice hotel close to everything downtown.  Shuttle service (complimentary) can take you anywhere in the city (but not the airport).    They have a nice cook-to-order breakfast option for $10.95, and a decent drink/good menu for dinner.  Rates are much more reasonable than hotels just a few blocks closer to the city center.Hampton Inn is just across the parking ramp... Easy to get between the two buildings.Stayed two nights for the NFL football game. Not a bad stay. Well located hotel. Clean. Shuttle available within a few miles from hotel. Very convenient. Breakfast buffet not bad at all. Omelettes, fried eggs, waffles and more. The coffee  not good. 1 star for coffee. But overall stay was as expected. Nice, comfortable, clean and walking distance from restaurants, stadium and the Epic Center.It's across the street from the NASCAR Museum, a block from the convention center, and the host to body building competitions (apparently).If you're coming into Charlotte from the north, you may get the impression that there's nothing but student housing around this location - not true - just a few blocks away are all of the restaurants one could hope for.  And it's worth the trip, because while this location does have room service and a pretty sad, open til 10 pm on the weekends, -type bar, the food available onsite is scrape-your-tongue-terrible.Room / bathroom were clean and fine, except that window covering (yes, with inner shade liner pulled closed) did not block light from nearby buildings.Parking structure signage is fairly craptastic and guests appear entitled to stay parked in the very small ""check in"" zone damn near forever.  Bigger problem is that even though signage indicates that both the Hampton Inn (?) and this location are accessible from the 4th and 5th level of the garage (note that the lower levels are reserved for valet parking), they don't mention that in all cases (fairly narrow, not designed for folks with accessibility issues, even if they don't require ramps) stairs are involved in getting to the hotel of choice.  Further, the 5th level access route is completely open to the elements.  Well, just awesome (channels the Lego theme song)!!!  Because who doesn't just love extra bullshit thrown in their way just to have a normal night in a hotel, when paying for the opportunity?So, all in all, not thrilled. Location is fairly good to great. But crappy food / drink with terrible hours, window cover that doesn't, despite being across from the flashing, pulsating, neon light display that is the Nascar museum, and some terrible ADA ""compliance"" leave me feeling extraordinarily tired (hey, at least the strobing lights didn't spark a seizure, Imeanright???) and achey (don't get me started).This hotel is in a good location, right next door to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and one block away from the convention center. I had a nice two room suite on the 9th floor (so I can't confirm or deny the comments about the stench on the lower floors). The room was clean and comfortable and there was a nice jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. All the staff i encountered were friendly and helpful. i will say that it was a little bit of a walk to get to the ""heart of the action"" in uptown Charlotte..not too far, but in the 90 degree weather a slightly sweaty walk :-)I will agree with the other reviewer that said the coffee was terrible..i agree whole heartedly, but since there are so many nice coffee shops in uptown charlotte there are other choices. All in all a solid choice to stay.Park yourself and save the $15ProsRoom was clean, Carpet was cleanGreat housekeeping services, even the elevators smelled fresh!Comfortable bedsFamily friendly cable tvPlenty of open outlets for devicesFree cookies, coffee, lemonade all day in lobby for guestsConsNo exhaust fan in bathroom so it got pretty humidVery slow wifiObnoxious plumbing sounds, hallway noise, and street noiseTap water was awful so we had to buy bottled water for our stay. For the rates charged, the hotel should provide free bottled water for guestsCarousel in microwave was not workingKuerig coffee maker in room with mediocre coffee pods, suggest getting the free coffee from the lobbyRestaurant was overpriced, but lots of restaurants and fast food within walking distanceGorgeous rooms and beautiful views of the city. Extremely friendly staff and reasonably priced rooms.There are two things that are important to me in a hotel: cleanliness and service. This hotel meets both those criteria as my room was spotless upon arrival and they let me check-in at 10:30 am (standard time is 3 pm). It is very centrally located - literal overlooks the NASCAR museum (not that I would ever go there). Valet parking is $15, but it is easier to self-park for $10 as the garage connects to the hotel on floors 4 and 5.parking garage difficult and cumbersome to get into.  Staff ignorant about possibility of getting something to eat in downtown Charlotte on Friday afternoon.  Nothing available at the hotel, of course.  Noisy room where you could hear everything going on next door.  Dirty floor in bathroom. Coffee machine doesn't work.  Fancy adjust-your-side-of-the-bed hardness also broken.  Worst of all:  We ordered a wake up call which didn't happen causing us to drive at breakneck speed and no breakfast five hours back home so I could get to work.  Worst ever hotel experience.Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte Uptowntraveling from AlabamaVisited Charlotte for an IICRC course and stayed 6 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn.Was received at check in by valet that was extremely helpful not just upon our arrival but throughout our stay. Overall the staff was very tentative to any need or concern. Mathew who seemed to be an all-round staff member assisted me several times and went way and beyond on. On one occasion he took quite a bit of time to explain and tour the best route and shortcuts to get from my car to hotel elevators and what garage floors to park on. Way to go Mathew.  The front desk was always helpful. We had an issue with room noise one night at 10 PM and it was handled in the best possible way with no hesitation either Lynn or Carolyn (not sure who was on duty that night) fully addressed this concern  to our 100% satisfaction the next day. The shuttle is really great the driver saw us in the lobby looking around and asking directions to local restaurants and  JB stepped right in with a very enthusiastic attitude and offered to take us wherever we needed. That impressed me because usually the guys working a shuttle would rather avoid having to take anyone any where. JB even gave us his card and instructed us to call him when we where ready to be picked up. The breakfast is offered in the lobby and is not free but worth the price. I would advise to get a package so its included with the cost of your room rate with parking. It works out to be less that way. At the breakfast buffet the cooks will prepare you several items all of them are really nice an attentive. Nelly, Lupe and Laura where great and Lupe is a gem, thank you for having a box with breakfast to go for my wife every morning.  This hotel offers room service from 5-10 PM and the selection was good as well as the food. My wife had the pork almost every night , it was that good. Overall this hotel is very clean and centrally located to down town. The parking is good and the views as well, but the great staff was the best feature by far. It fit the bill for my business training as well as a get away for my wife and I. I would highly recommend.After spending 3 cold and rainy days camping in a field with hundreds of people and terrible restroom facilities, this hotel was paradise.  We stayed in a king room with a whirlpool tub.  The tub was in the bedroom, but there was also a shower and regular bathtub in the bathroom.  I hadn't properly bathed in days, so the whirlpool bath was one of the best baths I've ever had in my life.Service was outstanding.  Self parking is $10 a night and valet is only $15.  The room was clean and large.  The food we ordered from room service was some of the best hotel food I have had.  The portion size of the vegetable tortellini I ordered was enough to feed a family of six.  We had leftovers for breakfast the next day and over half of it was still left.The hotel is in a great location with easy access.  The rooms are a little dated, but I was totally satisfied with my stay.Perfect location for the Time Warner Arena and across the street from the Nascar Hall of Fame. Its a mixed bag. One visit is perfect...comfy bed, great and friendly service. The shuttle took me and picked me up after the Hornets game. Thats a big plus! My only downside is that the bed was terribly lumpy on my last visit and the water pressure was a joke. The room service food is good. I'll go back but will ask to switch rooms if the bed is so old. Oh, they did let me check in early. The service was splendid on each visit.I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice, and the staff was great! I had never stayed alone in a hotel and got upset while eating in their restaurant and the wait staff took care of my meal! It was so nice! I can't say enough nice things about them! They made my trip better and made me feel so welcome! I'd definitely stay there again!Pros: - good location, - friendly staff, - affordable parking,- great shuttle option which will drive you within 3 miles of the hotelCons: - the room was a bit stuffy and there wasn't a fan in the bathroom so it got really humid,- the coffee is terrible. In the room there is a keurig, but it made terrible coffee, and the coffee in the lobby was also bad,- breakfast is expensive for what it is. Basic breakfast food for $12.99. We only stayed a night, so it was easy to deal with these small issues, but I'd shop around before I stayed here again.Great place! Jacuzzi tub room was wonderful, clean. Friendly and helpful staff. We stayed on a Sat night and found $5 parking right next to hotel if you don't want to pay $15 in hilton' garage.","(Stayed for a business convention)-Very pleasant staff at front desk. -Decent free cookies available in lobby.-Tasty free coffee in lobby.-Close to the Convention Center.-Close to Nascar HOF-Comfy pillows in the very large suite-Did not like the stench on the lower level by the restaurant that follows you in the hallways in the elevator and almost to my 3rd floor room(Smelled like old stale grease/ cafeteria cooking.)-I would prob try another hotel next time I'm in Charlotte just to see some comparison.Clean rooms, friendly staff.  It was a weekend with an event in town - heads up to get there early - the garage fills up.  Fortunately we did and it was no problem.  Great location to all things downtown.Convenient. Friendly. Clean.I liked this hotel. We checked in for the Beyonce concert and surprisingly were upgraded to the executive suite for free. I didn't request this so I was a caught a bit off guard and sadly, we had no view - I believe if the suite was on a higher floor, I would've been much more pleased because of the view. I also am glad there weren't more of us because we would've been SOL. Parking was limited, they said because of the amount of people going to the concert. I liked the people working there, but I think that's customary for NC. Everyone is so darn nice!!! I also had the brunch in the morning and it was worth the $10.95 if you want to eat and then just hit the road or lounge a little longer. Checkout at 12pm was also a plus. Also, the shuttle was VERY helpful. Location was also very good for what I needed. Not sure about the WI-FI we didn't need to use it but we did use the business center. Beware - you can't download, which I understand but we NEEDED our tickets!!! I had to find a shortcut way to do that. Torn between 3 and 4 went with 3 would like to do a 3.5.Nice hotel undergoing renovations. Clean, comfortable and a short walking distance from the convention center and NASCAR museum. I'd like to suggest to runners a great route: the fantastic Little Sugar Creek Greenway. Entrance to the greenway is 0.6 miles from the hotel front door. South to McDowell, east one block, then south on E. 3rd St. Just past I-277 you'll see the trail. This trail is 19 miles long. Run south if you're up for a good, long run. It's about 2.5 miles to the center of Freedom Park -- a 5-mile roundtripper!When I asked the front desk for a good running route, they had nothing to suggest. Which is a shame, since this is one of the finest urban trails I have ever run!Enjoy.For more on the greenway, visit: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FIHHB4o&amp;s=8f34adbaf60678324cddb6de586f9f52f232b86a5cf0785178752c085d6b4548"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/IHHB4o</a>Couldn't really ask for more: free wifi, clean and spacious rooms, conveniently located next to the convention center. The pleasant bonus was the complimentary shuttles that ferry you around the area. Yeah! That was cool. But the front desk and the shuttle drivers were all very pleasant individuals willing to do whatever I needed. That kind of service made it a wonderful experience.Very nice room with views of downtown Charlotte.  Next door to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.  We had tickets to the Panther/Bear game, which is a hop skip jump from the stadium.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Staff is very nice and personable.  Parking is reasonable with easy access.  Free coffee/cookies in lobby.I am giving the HGI 5 stars based on what it is, not compared to other hotels. I have been staying at the Hilton Garden Inn for the last two years; I'm here for business and I fly back and forth every weekend. I have lived through their growing pains, their remodeling, and their re-birth. Right now, the HGI is at the top of their game.The lobby was recently redecorated and has a crisp, modern feel. I liked the old wood-heavy look, but this open-space, airy look is also quite nice. The front desk staff is very friendly although I would love to see the check-in process streamlined. (The Hyatt Andaz has you check in with a personal concierge, and other hotels are completely done on iPads.) The rooms are spacious enough; I usually get a 2-room suite with a jacuzzi. While I rarely use the jacuzzi, I like the second room for the extra space. The hotel maid staff is fantastic. Day after day they do an amazing job of making my place look fresh. On occasion, a maid does forget to replenish coffee or leave conditioner in the bath, but a call to the front desk fixes that.Unlike some who complain, I like the location of the hotel. It's off the main strip, but only takes a 5 minute stroll in this very walkable and safe city. Within minutes I'm at the Mint Museum, at the Epicenter for a movie, relaxing on the Green, or in a number of great restaurants.Speaking of restaurants, the HGI on-site restaurant is quite good. The selections change several times a year and everything is delicious. A giant helping of hummus for $5? Yes, please. Fresh fish? Excellent.There's free on-site laundry which is worth staying here alone. The fitness center is small, but this is a hotel (and a budget one at that), not a Gold's Gym (which is a few blocks over.) Regulating temperatures in the room can be tricky depending on what kind of thermostat your room(s) have. The WiFi issues seem to have been resolved, thanks to lots of complaining and that the Democratic National Convention came through last year. Yes, the street can be a little noisy with a siren from time to time, but I'm from Cleveland. I sleep better with noise.Tip: Ask for a room that looks over the NASCAR museum. The lights on the building coupled with the lights on the Duke Energy Tower are a lot of fun.4 of 4 stars (Excellent, mid-priced hotel).Can't possibly qualify for five stars (only high-end places can).Newly remodeled and contemporary lobby.Fairly small rooms.  Fantastically comfy Herman Miller chair.Good choice for downtown hotel when you don't plan to spend much time in your room.My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 5/21-5/28/14 for the NASCAR races.  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very good.  The room was made up clean every day much to our satisfaction.  We ate breakfast here most days and the staff in the restaurant area were very prompt and friendly.  We stayed here because of the location across the street from the Nascar Hall of Fame and it's proximity to the downtown area.  We were also right across from the Speed Street street fair, very nice.  The close proximity to the highways worked out well as we made it a point to visit South Carolina as well as other areas of North Carolina.  I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Charlotte for business or pleasure.  The only ding, if I may, is the parking which is a little limited and there is a nominal daily fee.  There was one day that the hotel appeared to sell out and we had to park in the adjacent open lot.Very nice hotel; super friendly staff!  The lobby is impressively layed out and quite enviting to linger around and just relax.  For this trip, we treated ourselves to a lovely corner suite and could not have been happier; our vista view of the gorgeous Uptown Charlotte skyline was truely a treat.  For the dollar value, you can not do much better in Charlotte.Great staff. Average rooms. Very clean.One of the nicest experiences I've had when traveling. Room was clean, large, ready when promised. Rate was much better than local Westin or other Hilton. Staff were all gracious, helpful, and kind. I was traveling alone and sometimes (in other hotels) not treated as well b/c of that. Had a govt rate suite and was treated like a VIP even though my rate was less. Free local shuttle was a bonus. Shuttle guy was friendly and prompt. Breakfast buffet (part of my room pkg) was good and plentiful. Staff there were also solicitous. Yes, I did hear some sirens. Yes, the gym was very small and the indoor pool postage stamp sized. I also had an in-room jacuzzi and so I was relaxed and didn't even care!Forgot a piece of jewelry. Housekeeping staff found it and front staff person (Elizabeth G) mailed it to me. Nice!!I recommend it overall and would happily stay if I return to Charlotte.Pay over 100 per night and still expect me to pay $10 bucks to park? Not again! Decent rooms, but not much different than a $60 room in a Days InnI'm writing this review as I sit in the Hilton Garden Inn at Charlotte.The rooms are adequate, with most coming with a flat screen television or two, comfortable beds, and ample showers or hot tub jacuzzis. There is also a full service restaurant and bar in the Lounge area of the Hotel.I will also give them a nod for their complimentary shuttle which will travel you anywhere in a three mile radius of the hotel. The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.The gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.Concierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me ""You can purchase water from the gift shop."" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?The in House internet is the slowest you will find. I'm a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.The location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you'd want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.Alright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don't waste your time. I saw a park bench a few blocks away that I will be living under during my next stay in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and visit the aLoft at the Epicenter -- it beats this place in every measurable way.Usually always stay here.  Great location, nice rooms, nice hotel and the location is perfect.  Within 6-8 blocks of everything you need for dining and entertainment.  Off the main beat so there is never any heavy traffic as if sitting downtown in the middle of the banking district.  Rates are always superior to anything in the area.  Rooms are over sized compared to Hilton and Marriott in the banking district.  I would highly recco this hotel for future guests of Charlotte.I'm the kind of person who loves staying in hotels. And one of my favorite chains to stay in is Hilton Garden Inns. This was a large hotel situated right in the heart of Uptown Charlotte. Everything was clean, organized, the staff was friendly, there was a large restaurant inside the hotel as well as a concession area, which was a nice  bonus. I believe it also had an inside pool and a work out area, but we never saw either.Also, this hotel is very near the Time Warner Cable Amphitheater (we were in Charlotte for a concert) as it was just a few blocks away. However, the hotel was kind enough to give us a free shuttle ride there and dropped us off right in front of the place! I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great location and a great value in the Charlotte area.Nice hotel. Good beds. Across from NASCAR Hall of Fame.  Did not notice street noise mentioned in other reviews. Self-parking. Decent breakfast.Shares parking garage with Hampton Inn. Not a problem, except confusing car entrance.When traveling, I look for location, amenities and comfort, plus value for the price.  The Hilton Garden Inn Charlotte Uptown was booked for me, not by me, with all good intentions.As a business traveler, I often get in late and must be up and out quite early, often as early as 5am.Location is adjacent to major sports venue. Strike one. Urban center, so there is apt to be street noise that can permeate the rooms, and there was quite a bit of this - emergency vehicle sirens, loud auto sounds.  Strike two. The hotel is not well insulated from outside sounds.  The room doors and the rooms themselves are not designed to contain noise so it does not effect others.  I could easily hear even not loud conversations in adjacent rooms on both sides as well as guests speaking not too loudly in the halls, even after 1am.  I got precious few hours sleep that night!.  Strike three, and they're OUT was the obtrusively loud plumbing sounds.  When adjacent rooms used their facilities, whether it was the toilet, sink or shower/bath, I do not know.  I just know that it created a roaring sound in MY room.When I mentioned this to the desk person the next morning, she acknowledged each of my stated concerns, indicating that this is just the way it is at this property.In addition, for anyone in need of ready and waiting cabs, this is another negative for this property.  I requested a cab pick-up for 5:50am, and was assured one would be there and waiting.  As you may have guessed, this did not happen.  Despite their best effort, no cab was there.  About 10 minutes later, one arrived, but it is somehow unsettling when one is on a tight schedule and relies on punctuality.  Of course, I built in some fudge factor so I did not go nuts, but if you need reliance on either waiting cabs at-the-ready or reliable pre-arranged on-call cabs, you might be sorely disappointed in what this hotel can assure.On the plus side, their FREE Internet in the room was quite fast, measured at about 9Mbps down and up.  This was a pleasant surprise.Okay, I came back, based on my previous experience.  This time, I stayed in a 6th floor room, overlooking the main road and right across from the NASCAR museum.  As noted by another reviewer, these rooms catch A LOT of street noise.  If you are a light sleeper, be sure to bring ear plugs, or ask for a quiet room facing the other direction.  My first stay here, I had a suite with a separate bedroom.  It was very quiet and nice for sleeping.WE stayed next door at the Hampton Inn but came to the American Grill for dinner. Service was excellent, food too. Had a GREAT burger which I typically don't order. I'd give it 5*****'s if it had more of a selection of menu items.","They had a shuttle pick me up after the taxi dropped me off at the wrong Hilton.  Doh!  Super nice staff.  Their gym is really small and doesn't have much.  Pool is small too.  Nonetheless, a cozy place to stay.I stayed here one night while in town for a job interview.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable with different pillow selections (foam, feather, hard, soft).  I appreciate having the microwave and fridge in the room when I travel in case I don't feel like going out to eat again or I'm too tired to get out.  Also, in the lobby there are pre-printed directions to local businesses.  I didn't take advantage but there is a bar in the lobby.  Internet access was free and there was a desk in the room.  Highway access is convenient and it is close enough to bars and restaurants.The gym is adequate and the equipment is better than most hotels, including tv screen so bring ear plugs if you want to listen.  There were not weights though and the pool is too small for laps but there is an aquatic center just a few blocks away with both ($8 a visit for non-residents).  The treadmills are sufficient for running but Uptown is completely side-walked so if you prefer running outside its 'safe' from traffic at least.",,,"['nice', 'clean', 'dated', 'need',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-charlotte-charlotte,DoubleTree By Hilton Hotel Charlotte,3.5,$$,44,"Stayed here for a test that I had to fly to Charlotte to take. It was downtown at the BB&amp;T center, and I got a good deal on this hotel from Expedia so I booked it. Checked in late on a Sunday night after coming straight from the airport, and was happily greeted by the signature Hilton cookies :) yum. Easy checkin, and I was able to request a room on a higher floor to see the cityscape and far away from the elevator so as to decrease the potential for excessive noise as I was taking a test the next morning. No problem in accommodating me. I got up to the 8th floor and the door on my hotel room was THE MOST DIFFICULT to open I had ever experienced with a modern hotel key. I almost thought it was programmed wrong, and seeing as I was alone and carrying all my stuff I didn't want to go back downstairs if I could avoid it. I finally got in but then I didn't want to leave again. So I ordered room service seeing as there was not too much around for dinner at 10:00 on Sunday anyway without getting an uber. I didn't feel like leaving the general vicinity or getting a car, and room service was decently priced compared to the convenience factor. Came up LIGHTNING fast and was hot, and wine was chilled. I did have concierge call me and ask me to turn down a Bluetooth speaker I had playing in my bathroom around 8:00 pm-it wasn't late and it wasn't loud yet someone complained. Seems a little bit tattle tale to me, but whatever, I wasn't about to get kicked out. The bed here was huge and beyond large enough to sprawl out in for just me, and the towels and robe were luxurious as well. For a trip that wasn't the most fun overall, at least it was a good stay here, this was a great place to rest my eyes.Stayed here for a business trip. The staff was very unhelpful. They watched me struggle as I unloaded my luggage. There is no valet. There is only self-parking, so you have to unload your luggage and then move your car to the side lot. I was unhappy with my room upon arrival. The desk staff immediately found me another room. However, there were no other rooms available on the honors floor, from what I could tell they were all still being cleaned...at 4 o'clock. I met the staff person on another floor to get a key to my new room. There was a linen cart in the way of the luggage cart I was pushing. The staff member watched me struggle to move it out of the way. I had to finally ask her for help because she just continued to watch as I struggled. I finally settled in my room, which was ok - nothing special. I walked to find dinner. Options were limited - subway and chinese food. I would not stay here again.We were here for a bachelorette party, the hotel was very accommodating and friendly. We were very disappointed because although we were told we would have adjoining rooms - we didn't, which made the other guests around us unhappy as we were going back and forth between rooms with the doors slamming. We also had a fifth person and the hotel didn't have cots, so they had to sleep on the floor which was rough.When you are reading the reviews of this hotel check the date they were written carefully because I stayed here over the weekend and this place has gone to the dogs. The room was shabby and uncomfortable and the bathroom was a joke with the toilet sitting in the middle of the bathroom   It was so small you could barely move around. The bed was less comfortable than the foldout couch at my Aunt Mildred's. There was construction going on in the hotel which is to be expected from time to time.  However there was  no notification of this on their site or when booking. This did not alter the room rates however because I paid over $250 a night for something that should've been around $100 based on the lack of amenities and comfort available.  Think carefully before booking this hotel unless every other room in Charlotte is booked because there is absolutely no value for the money they charge.Everything you would expect from a Hilton Doubletree - clean, modern, aimed at the business travelers of the world. Of course, wifi is only free for Hilton Honors members, which is semi-annoying, but that's pretty standard for hotels aimed at business travelers. The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful, and beds were super comfy. There is self-park and valet - around $15 or 20 a night, if I remember correctly. Starbucks is right across the street, but aside from a Subway, other dining options within walking distance are pretty limitedService - Excellent.Parking - Daily charge with in and out privileges.  However, they do not monitor the parking very well.  We had to tell the staff that we had a car in the lot just in case they towed.Rooms - Clean, spacious, quiet.  The only thing that was off was that the restroom had limited counter space. There was a normal counter with a sink. However, the toilet was set right in front of the counter so you couldn't use the counter.  Location - In uptown Charlotte.  However, it is DEAD at night.  We stayed here Sunday night during March Madness.   Location is in a downtown business district, near Johnson and Wales College, Bank of American Stadium and condo's.  However, you hardly see anyone.  It was walking distance to some random restaurants and you felt safe walking at night. However, it's not lively.I love Doubletree hotels. This one was no different. I think they have the best beds. This particular Doubletree hotel was very clean and had a nice staff. I did have a problem with the final billing, but they immediately corrected it when I called the front desk. I normally stay on a higher floor, but this time I was on the 3rd and heard all the outside noise. I didn't like that at all. I also think the hallway was pretty noisy as well. I wish they had better insulation or noise barriers. There is a parking deck associated with the hotel that will cost you $14/night. However, you can take your chance and park on the street for free if you are visiting on the weekend. I will definitely stay here again (but on a higher floor).Warm cookie at check-in!  They even gave me an extra one when I returned one night from dinner and needed dessert (though I was told this is not the norm, since it's supposed to be one cookie per check-in).I like the attempt to make the hotel room a bit more modern- dark wood finishes, accent walls, lime green and turquoise colors on the curtains, carpet and chaise chair.  Overall the room was modern, clean and convenient, with a large granite vanity and large shower.  I had a nice view of the central courtyard.  Free wifi as a Hilton Homors member, in the rooms and common areas.  The doors tend to slam loudly so you do hear others entering and exiting their rooms.Covered parking is not free, but it's just down the street from restaurants and bars.  I like the convenience of the Starbucks located just across the street.Stay here if you like: Modern hotels, chocolate chip cookies, free wifi (for Hilton Honors members), convenience to Starbucks (across the street).Do not stay here if you like:Historical buildings/districts, free parking, free breakfast.Great first impression.  Lobby looks very clean and nice, staff are friendly, the hallway on the 8th floor is bright, clean and feels cool, not warm and muggy like some hotels.  The rooms are very nice and contemporary, with nice clean corners.  The bathroom is clean, one of the best I've seen.The AC has a motion sensor which is annoying, I was able to get the staff to bypass it and I was able to get the temperature down to 60.  Which feels very pleasant.Got my warm cookie, breakfast coupons and free Internet for being a diamond member.I never tried breakfast, even though I had free breakfast coupons I was simply too lazy to wake up early enough to try it.The gym was nice, they had free weights, 2 treadmill (one was broken) and 2 elliptical machines.Parking was in a parking structure that requires your hotel card or pay as you go.I would recommend this hotel.BEWARE! Housekeepers are THIEFS!I stayed at Double Tree in Charlotte, NC for 6 hours, while I was sleeping a house keeper entered my room and stole $400 out of my wallet. I confronted the manager, they checked to see the history log of entries to my room and the manager confirmed a house keeper did enter my room 20 minutes before I woke up and complained. Then told me that he does not think she took the money because she is a long time employee and that was it.... Why did she enter my room while I was sleeping at 12:43 noon time? There was not a single knock or a phone call. She claimed there was noise complaint between 3 rooms. Wouldn't the lobby call or knock on my door? The manager did nothing to help, and I ended up leaving the hotel to go to the airport. I am shocked that this would happen at a Double Tree and the manager did not offer ANY HELP! I will not stay at Double Tree ever again for the lack of help from the management. Manager did not even offer to comp my 6 hour stay either! Terrible way to start my vacation!The location was great and the rates were affordable. With a military discount it was under $100/night (including NYE). Booking online was a breeze and the staff was very friendly when we checked in. The cookies they give you during your check-in are amazing!!! I'd probably go back just to eat the cookies lol... One of the great things the hotel offers is a town car service instead of taking a cab. The rates are comparable and they run until 2a-3a.My only complain would be the placement of the toilet in the bathroom. It was very awkward and seemed like an afterthought... otherwise, I loved this place and would recommend it to anyone staying in the downtown Charlotte area.I stayed here over the weekend (September 26-28) and was honestly not pleased. I booked with my HHonors and checked in with their app. The app lets you add things to your room before you arrive (refreshments, extra pillows etc.). I knew we were going to be coming in late so I requested two bottles of smart water and extra pillows (I'm eight months pregnant). None of this was provided upon arrival. When we arrived we found out there was no valet and self parking was $14 a day. The self parking garage is not close enough for me to walk so my husband and had to get the car and leave me in the lobby waiting. If $30+ wasn't enough for parking they also charge $10 for WiFi for just a day! When I called the front desk to see if she could offer me anything since I was a loyal HHonors member she simply said no and wouldn't help me. The room was clean and I had no problems with it accept that the bath tub was small and I couldn't sit down and fit. I love Hilton hotels and will continue doing business with them but this DoubleTree was a no in my book.I really enjoyed my stay at this particular doubletree property in Uptown Charlotte. The hotel's modern design and colors were a very welcome change from the typical hotel experience but the lack of free wifi was a little discouraging, along with the distance to travel to most of the local restaurants and bars. If you're planning on going out for an evening of dinner and drinks plan to get a cab back to the hotel. The staff at the hotel was very polite and the cookie you receive when checking in is delectable.This DoubleTree is located at the Johnson &amp; Wales campus just north of Uptown in Charlotte, NC. It's an interesting location. It's about a mile walk to Uptown. It's in a very quiet neighborhood. If you want anything nearby, there isn't much.My friend and I checked in and we got delicious warm chocolate chip cookies.The room was nice and very comfortable. Everything was clean and in working order. The hotel was quiet, no loud events. The restaurant/bar downstairs looked nice but a little pricey.I didn't use many of the other amenities but I was pleased with the hotel. The service was friendly enough.I love the fact that they have a recycling bin in each room! The layout of the room was nice and service was really good. The fitness center was not amazing, but it was definitely nicer than a lot of hotels. Covered parking and easy to access.Pros:                            Cons:Awesome staff.            14$ breakfastClean rooms.                No fridge                                      No microwave                                      No coffeeStayed here on business for 2 nights. Likes:My room was recently updated: fresh decor, electronics, and bath fixtures.  I appreciated the divided trash bins for recyclable and non-recyclable garbage in both the bedroom and bathroom.  Drawer-warmed cookies (not fresh-baked warm,  so a little crunchy) upon check-in, and depending on who you get - late night munchies!Perfect easy location for what we needed- our meetings were located not even across the street.  Nice outdoor seating area available off the front drive way (it was 70 degrees and sunny before our meetings started), and Starbucks across the street.Not so great:$10 per day WiFi access (and despite being told there was free WiFi in the business center, I couldn't get reception).  No in-room checkout (via the TV).   Also an overwhelming 'sweet' aroma I can only guess was some sort of air freshener in the lobby.  It was consistent each day at various times, so it was not one person's perfume or results of  resent over-zealous cleaning.Not sure I would stay here for a vacation (a little outside of 'downtown' and historic Charlotte), but I would and will definitely be using this DoubleTree again for business.In town for the Belk Bowl Game. The room was average size and had a sort Chaise chair for relaxing. The bed was very comfortable. One highlight was the excellent staff. Room service was fast and the food very tasty. When we had a problem with the in room safe, a technician was at the door within 10 minutes and fixed it immediately. Even brought up a new key after getting the safe fixed. The breakfast buffet had a good selection and as a Gold HHonors member, free.Parking was not cheap ($13) but convenient I would stay againDecent rooms. Great location downtown. I wanted to work from my room but there was no hard wire connection and the wifi was weak along with a weak password given to everyone. The breakfast buffet was ok, but way overpriced.The location was not bad.  It took me about 20 minutes to walk to the more festive ""epicenter"" part of town.  Even though I passed a bus station, the city felt pretty safe.  The bar in the hotel was tiny so don't expect a lot of guests to hang out there.  The pool looked really nice but I didn't test it out.The bed and room were excellent... I slept like a baby at a hotwire price.","Comfy beds and overall seemed very clean. Thought this place would be way nicer and a few blocks closer to the Epicenter for the price though. Weird bathroom layout with toilet under the counter. The pool is nothing to write home (or yelp) about. The guest elevator is also the service elevator with a second door that opens each time you're in it to the towel/supply room, so it always smelled like bleach. $13 self parking with a walk from the garage that doesn't have a ramp to take your luggage over and no option to valet. Meh.One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully, if you book your room through a third party, such as Orbitz, they do not guarantee the room that you booked online. Traveled with my brother and booked a two double bed room and when we arrived all they had were rooms with a single king bed. Was told by the front desk I could get a roll away bed brought into the room at an extra charge of $10 a night if they had any available. Didn't matter whether they had any available or not because I had no intention of giving this place any more of my money. I travel often and I mean i travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever had this happen to me. I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list. Also, room was tiny, small fridge, breakfast was not free where as in most places I stay it's complimentary. Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back. One last thing, you hear everything that happens in the hallways no matter what's going on and that sucks when you are trying to sleep.First time here ..stayed one night .. The fresh cookie was a nice hot gesture to bad I don't eat nuts lol but I still thought it was cool the hotel has a fresh mod vibe the room was clean and a decent size and great price they also had great hand-lotion which I loved  it was like coriander or sage I can't remember.. This was a nice hotel clean and comfortable I highly recommendI was in town for a week, and stayed at the Double TreeNow normally I have great experiences with Double Trees but I was throughly disappointed with the customer service. The staff was very difficult to deal with. But the accommodations were wonderful. Great locations, and wonderful rooms. Just know what you are going to deal with.We were here for New Years, for 2 nights.  And, It appears the ""Occupy"" movement has got tired of tents and have moved into the Double Tree hotel.  It seems we were the only people on our floor without dreads and pot.   Many of these people were hanging out in front of the hotel, sitting on the steps,  for most of the days and evening too.  When I asked what was going on to the desk staff, they said... ""Sir, it's New Years"".  Hmmm?  The sheets have been used too many times and they need to get new ones.  Also, our room came well equipped with two unique blood stains, on the down comforter and wall in bathroom.     Happy New Year to us.Not worth $150. Furniture is outdated. TVs are old, wall paper is bubbled, draperies are dingy &amp; stained, and bathroom is outdated. Shouldn't be called the Double Tree by Hilton...seems more like a Super 8. The hubby and I are checking out in the morning to find a much nicer, updated hotel.I give it two stars because the bed was really comfortable.FYI: They do not have free Wi-Fi...you have to pay for it. Parking is $15.I attended a convention in Charlotte at the end of July 2013 and the hotels that were partnered with the conference were all booked. I chose this hotel as part of a package on Travelocity.Located uptown right near the Johnson and Wales campus, this hotel fit the bill.Roughly a mile from the center of Downtown and the Convention Center, the location is far enough to be out of the hustle and bustle but near enough to walk to the Convention Center and Downtown restaurants if you choose to do so.The room on the second floor was smallish, but adequate. Safe in room, but other than that, no in room bling. Not a fan of the open shower at all. I like a nice shower with good water pressure. The shower in this room has a seat and a hand held shower head. It's not enclosed and there is no tub. To be fair, the shower head is on a mount that can be adjusted for height and direction, but the result is less than adequate water pressure. Any more and you would flood the bathroom.Staff is very friendly and helpful. Check in was uneventful and you can check out via the phone in your room. Final bill is shoved under your room door on the morning of your check out.Bar/Restaurant is typical. Overpriced, but you have other choices. Dining options immediately around the hotel are limited. Subway, The Great Wok, Cedar Street Tavern are within short walking distance and are fine if you don't want or need to go downtown for better dining.There is a CVS and a Harris Teeter also within short walking distance.Parking is $13 a day in a structure next to the hotel. In room internet is $9.95 for 24 hours. I understand a parking charge, but it seems a bit steep. I simply do not understand any hotel charging for Wi-Fi access in room when it's free in the lobby and other public spaces of the hotel.Minor quibbles, but If I were attending a multi-day conference at the Convention Center, I'd look for a hotel closer. Price would be close to a wash and convenience would be better.Lots of adjectives come to mind. Dumpy. Ancient. Moldy. Quite far from the heart of downtown (by Charlotte standards). Most rooms don't even have a minibar. Nor do they have nice TVs.The wifi speed was decent though. That's always a plus.Stayed here in Decmber, 2012. Great hotel. Nice warm cookies at check-in, or if you just ask for one. Try and stay here anytime I'm in Charlotte.Being in Charlotte the last 15 weeks I needed a new place top stay that was not going to show up as a huge expense to my client but better than the HGI.  Welcome to the Double tree.  Located right off the West Trade Street exit on 77 South it's easy on easy off.  The hotel is on the edge of the ""happening"" area of the city but there is a trolley that runs every 10 minutes up to 10(ish) nightly or a 5 minute cab ride to some of the best restaurants in the area.  The hotel has nice rooms that are clean and spacious.  The bathrooms have the Kholer water saving toilets and the giant water saving shower heads with good pressure.  The other thing I love is a good heating and cooling system that evenly cooled the room.  The bar is small but I am never there except for a quick nightcap.  You have a choice of getting the extra points or breakfast vouchers.  Here is my suggestion that works every time for those that stay in the same hotel for weeks at a time.  If you are there for a week, book for 3.  Take the breakfast vouchers.  Then check out at the end of the week.  The next week you can elect the points, use one of those quality white out tapes and presto..... It gives new meaning to the Hilton Double Dipping concept. I give this place a solid 4 stars for friendly staff, good parking and great rooms.  Oh, and remember to ask for you warm cookie.......This place is great for the price and location.  def recommend if you in the areaOkay, I'm basing the low review on one factor--they charge for wi fi in the room.  I can't stand this new ploy some hotel chains are using to squeeze another ten dollars out of you (after the normal 3 or 4 special taxes they hit you with).  The hotel was fine otherwise but as you can tell charging for wifi is my pet peeve.  I will look for a more hospitable hotel next time I'm in Charlotte.2 stars for the curtious staff.  Rooms do not have fridges or microwaves....they can be provided at a charge if $10 (each) per day.  Decent fitness facility, with good running trails (frazier park) nearby.Official Team Hotel of the Charlotte Hounds. Bill, Kim, Rachael and the rest of the staff are amazing. Rooms are super nice. Location is perfect. Take advantage of the Hounds friends/family rates ($89 Weekend, $119 Weekday) by clicking thru one of the Doubletree ads on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottehounds.com&amp;s=cc4aa66ece8cf895d12434809ad6db26bea83e63d914a6fd46e23e5b543f22e4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">charlottehounds.com</a>.Nice hotel and good location.  The room was nice and the breakfast buffet was good but didn't include made to order omelets.  I would stay here again.Beautiful hotel, lovely sunny room decor. Very comfy beds. Super clean! Nice amenities. Close to everything. Staff helpful. No free wifi, come on! Quiet. Great view from our high room. Great deal for my Johnson &amp; Wales student. Loved our stay here!This hotel is located on the west side of downtown Charlotte, less than one minute from Highway US 77. The location makes it very easy to get to and from the airport and any other highway taking you to parts of the city or its suburbs. In early February 2009, the hotel was in the midst of a makeover. The lobby, the area around the elevators, and the common areas on the ground floor were inaccessible due to the construction. Based on the finished work in some parts, the end result promises to be spectacular and commensurate with what one would expect of a top notch DoubleTree Hotel. The room was fantastic with a king sized bed and all of the amenities that usually accompany a DoubleTree hotel room. The property is far enough away from the nightlife of downtown to allow you to get a good nights sleep. Also it is within walking distance of the convention center if that is your destination. The staff was very helpful and the business center provides free Internet access in case you want to print out your boarding pass without incurring a fee. The parking lot was confusing. I am certain that there were more than the 12 spots that I saw when I tried to park. It is my own fault for not following up with the staff to ascertain how to access the other sections of the parking lot, so I won' t hold that against the hotel. Since I obtained this booking via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a>, the rate was very good, probably due to the construction. I would not expect to get the same rate at this hotel once the construction is completed.Excellent all the way around. Very accommodating, nice rooms and convenient! Thank you!Hotel is pretty nice- great location- very clean- gave it three stars instead of four because the televisions in the rooms are the same model I had in my college dorm room in 1989- could use a little updating- got in early on Sunday afternoon to hopefully catch the football games...Room was decent - no thrills - good selection of HD channels. Wifi could have been better...Room service was affordable.","how do they give you a warm cookie when you check in? i'm not sure but they do!everything went well with my stay at the double tree hotel, i ate the fish and chips, which was very different than fish and chips i'm used to.  i'm real glad that i ordered a salad to go with my huge piece of fried fish and steak fries.my next door neighbor woke me up for 1 hr by watching infomercials really loud on their tv from 4am-5am (and i was on pst time so that's 1-2am for me).oh, and they had everything i needed in the bathroom except shaving cream, which is pretty standard.Stayed here while in town visiting family.  The accomodations are nice and the price is right.  Has a great location right in uptown Charlotte.  The place will also accept pets which is a big thumbs up in my book!  I ate breakfast in the hotel every day - it has the typical assortment of breakfast food and it was ok.Nice hotel, nice warm cookies!  I have stayed at this one twice and would recommend to out of towners.I stayed at this hotel while in town for a meeting. The hotel was close to all the hot spots, located in a trendy part of town. This was a great deal on Priceline for $49. The room was well decorated and look to have been recently renovated. Great area for walking , Starbucks and other shops across the street.",,,"['test', 'fly', 'take', 'downtown', 'amp', 'center', 'good', 'deal', 'hotel', 'booked', 'checked', 'late', 'night', 'coming',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-charlotte-charlotte,The Westin Charlotte,3.5,$$$,130,"I like the Westin CharlotteAnd it's not just because the chandelier in their lobby is the size of my apartment. It's because in that lobby, they also have a mini Starbucks. And they also have a large parking garage that is attached to the hotel. And the hotel rooms are nice. And the front desk attendant I dealt with was really nice and cute. And their hotel bar is huge. And the last reason I like the Westin Charlotte is... it's so large, that I did not have to use my google maps to find it when I was walking back from the outskirts of downtown. It's also a stop on the light rail!The hotel itself was pretty nice - unfortunately, there were a few very important things that caused this stay to be a bad experience for our trip.The valet service is HORRIBLE &amp; DANGEROUS.1)  When arriving back to the hotel on Saturday night/Sunday morning, as we were pulling in, one of the valet men came speeding out of the garage full speed and almost hit our car.  He didn't apologize or even acknowledge almost doing it.  We had to slam on our breaks so hard it shifted many things around in the car and screeched the tires.2)  When checking out of the hotel on Sunday morning, our car (which was a rental car, might I add), had the fresh smell of cigarette smoke in it, as if someone had been smoking and put out their cigarette as they were getting in the car and blew the smoke in the car.  We had to roll the windows down in the very cold weather to get the stench out on the way to the airport.3)  The same valet man gave us wrong directions to the airport, sending us north of Charlotte.  Luckily, I was somewhat familiar with the area and could tell that we weren't going the right way, and turned us around.  This, however, made me have to get more gas in the car - which we had pre-paid for gas and had it set to deliver it back very close to empty.  Instead, I had to pay for more gas to ensure that we didn't run out because of the 20 miles off track we were.  ALSO, this made us almost miss our flight.  Thankfully, security was moving people fairly fast on Sunday.4)  When I have tried to contact valet management, I continue to get voicemail.  I tried to speak with one of the hotel managers, but the operator kept sending me to a answering machine.  After a while, I finally told the operator, 'I want to speak to a frigging manager - quit sending me to voicemail!'.  HOWEVER - after saying this, she transferred me to a lady who answered saying - 'Hello - this is one of the F'ING managers - how's your day?' in a very smirky tone.5)  Finally, after e-mailing the man that continues to ask that people on this site e-mail him directly with their issues about all of this, I never received any sort of reply.Wonderful location, minutes walk from the center of Uptown and other venues such as the BoA Stadium. Right next to the light rail so super convenient to get where ever you need to be. The interior is of the hotel is quite good, though is getting a little dated. The bed is very comfortable and the linen was clean and crisp. The room's size was okay and the bathroom was on the small side. The bathroom light was quite dim, but shower pressure and soaps was also very good. WiFi was quite fast and reasonable for the price. I had a room facing Uptown, and the Westin had very large windows, allowing me to look out of the beautiful skyline. I will definitely be back.We stayed on the 18th floor looking out over the city. It was fantastic.We were greeted immediately in the driveway by our valet. He was well-dressed, courteous and  he was quick with jokes that were actually funny.  Totally professional crew outside working three or four cars at a time with ease. Great process.We entered the the reception area and we were totally impressed with the chandeliers, beautiful  marble and travertine tiling designs on the floors and walls.  The look was pure luxury and it seemed that every few feet there was a Westin employee helping someone or offering a greeting to you as they passed us in route to a very important task.The room,  oh my, the room was/is fabulous.  The bed was covered in white full of feather pillows and egyptian cotton linen.  I have not slept that welll in months.  I loved sleeping on that mattress, the bed is my new bestie.  Smiles!  The room had a HUGE football game watching TV set with a crystal clear picture.  All my TNT shows were wonderful in stereo sound.  Closet space was scrumptious - double wide and double deep. My dream closet.  I measured it and wrote down the specifications for my builder cousin coming in for Thanksgiving.  I must have that closet at home.The bathroom was luxe covered in cocoa brown marble tile.  The shower was equipped with a huge rain showerhead and handheld pulsating spray total heaven for neck and shoulder muscles.  I liked the mirror and lighting combination.  But you will lauugh but I LOVED the tall toilet that allowed you to sit down and not drop down, seriously important as you age. Ha Ha!Big box hotel.Went to the bar for a glass of wine---unbelievable.  The bar was out of pinot noir, merlot and malbac.  Basically what was some dubious cab.  The bar was understaffed for the big convention that apparently was in the hotel.We put a door hanger our for breakfast (yogurt and coffee) to be delivered at 7.  At 8 am and two phone calls, still no coffee.  No apologies.   First phone call at 7:35 we were told it was on its way.  Second phone call at 7:50, they are sending it up ""right now.""The carpet in the room is very stained and worn (staring at it as I type and wishing I had flip flops to I would not have to walk on it).  Big box, impersonal hotel.  The views are not worth it.PS....8:30 and still no coffee or breakfast.  Time to check out and never come back.  Will upload photos in another review.This is the one hotel in uptown Charlotte that I don't mind coming back to, since it meets my expectations nearly every time. Since arriving here for the first time for a convention in 08', followed b subsequent conventions and business meetings, the Westin Charlotte has been a welcoming accommodation that continues to leave an impression after each visit.The first impression easily was the Heavenly beds. I've never slept in a better bed in a hotel prior to this visit, nor since. This bed set the benchmark so high with me that I purchased a comparable model a couple of years later at a pretty penny. The rooms within the Westin Charlotte are standard Westin: a littler smaller than expected, with the bed dominating a good portion of the space. The standard amenities of the pool area, gym and so forth met expectations. The front desk staff is very, very good, in addition to the banquet staff when it comes to accommodating colleagues that are in for a convention. The bar area across the floor from the front desk is one of my favorite places to network with professionals as much as I do drink. Known as ""The Lobby Bar"", the area is set up strictly as one to rendezvous with business associates and friends during events primarily after 5 PM. The menu is moderately reasonable for beer drafts, yet a little pricier for hors d' oeuvres and cocktails. If you can get your company to approve drinks and appetizers under T&amp;E, it is highly advised. Parking is so-so. While the convenience to park within the underground lot is appreciated, I really think that it should be marked better with regard to where the elevator is in relation to the section of where your car is. It took me nearly 20 minutes to find my car at one point!Altogether, the Westin Charlotte can be a place to really enjoy. A little pricey, yet worth it if you prefer a downtown (they call it uptown in Charlotte) location while either traveling or on business.I aboslutely loved this hotel! My co-worker and multiple people I spoke to even mentioned how good it smelt- that's how you know it's a great hotel! haha no lingering smell of mildew or mold, it was so fresh and clean.The beds were so extremely comfortable, i never wanted to get out of bed! They have a great service where if you'd like to skip your room cleaning for the day they'd give you a $5 gift card for going green.This hotel also features a deal I've never heard of before and sadly didn't take advantage of.. You can rent workout gear for $5. They will send New Balance shoes and clothing to your room! for $5! Such a steal if you dont' have room in your carry on for extra items.Stayed on the 24th floor for one night for work. Hand's down I had one of my best night's sleep on a foreign bed ever! The hotel staff was courteous and friendly all around! I especially loved the waterfall shower head and Starbuck's coffee in each guest room. Nice touches!Came here for New Year's Eve . The music was terrible , to buy a drink I had to spend 30mins in a line first to buy a ticket and then buy a drink in another line . Total time spent 1 hour for a $15 drink . Want my money backComfortable stay and good customer service.  $20 a day for self-parking in uptown Charlotte seems a bit extreme.  This is what I would expect to pay in a larger city.  Housekeeping forgot to supply clean towels one afternoon and promised to come back with some but never did.  We were left with 2 washcloths and that was it.  Housekeeping was also always knocking on our door by 9 am to see if they could clean the room.  When we were not ready to leave the room for the day, they seemed a little irritated.  The room was very nice sized and the felt clean and light.  I would stay here again but it didn't knock my socks off.AVOID THE VALET AT ALL COSTS!The valet curbed 3 of my 4 rims on my new BMW and refused to pay for the damages.Couldn't me happier with my stay in the Westin!I proposed to my girlfriend now fiance and the staff here made it all the better. They helped me set up, sent champagne and nibbles and even gave me an upgrade so I could show my fiance the best time of her life. Her staycation, our engagement, the whole experience was fantastic and I look forward to staying there again soon!This is a good option downtown especially if you have an event at the convention center. You can walk to everything from here. Overall this is a good choice for the area. The decor is nice, but could use some updating. The staff is friendly. The rooms are inline with expectations. I do not like having to pay for internet, especially daily, so that was a mild inconvenience. There are two bar options in the hotel. There is also a cafe that serves Starbucks and some breakfast pastries. There is a restaurant on site as well. I only tried it for breakfast. That was very disappointing but i will save that for my review of it.Absolutely the best!  I stayed here this weekend for the V-WISE conference.  The room, food and staff was fantastic.  I will definitely stay here againI was a manager at a six-star hotel with 2,800 rooms in downtown Seoul. So, I might have high standards. I really liked my experience there working for Avon Walk twice, competing at World Affairs Council World Quest twice, and hanging out with friends. So I almost gave it four stars. But I have to be professional. I do see a lot of things that i would change if I were running it.That doesn't mean that it isn't good. It still is a nice hotel. Some people just love Westin for what it is. Not too fancy but one of the big boys. But the way the guests were lined up and waiting in the small lobby in multiple direction was difficult to overlook. There were some even blocking the entrance.The nice things about it is that it's in the right place. Location, location, location. It's in the center city, yet not right beside the biggest businesses and heavy traffic. The overstreet mall isn't connected to the hotel, if I remember correctly, but everything is in walking distance. And if you are in the city for conventions, or a professional sports game, it's a perfect place to stay.I have also been to most other popular hotels in Charlotte. The city doesn't have a Four Seasons, Wardorf Astoria type of a hotel. So for what it offers, it's pretty good. So enjoy it.I stayed at the Westin for business travel about a month ago and found it to be wonderful.  The people were warm and welcoming - from the valets to the front desk.  Pierre was especially kind on this late night and helped make me feel welcome.  The next morning, one of the valets (forgot his name), helped me get a black car to one of the buildings because it was raining hard. The room was clean, fresh and had the conveniences I expected.  Breakfast buffet was good - price was higher than I would pay personally, but very nice restaurant and quiet.I was here for a wedding this past weekend and the staff @ The Westin were great. Able to get an early check-in and had the lovely Savannah check us in. The 25th floor housekeeper organized everything so well (I have a bit OCD and it was perfect) Front desk specialist Pierre was friendly and informative on the local whereabouts. Very happy the Westin believes in customer service.I like the Westin. The lobby is adequate, rooms are predictable and safe. If you love beige, you'll love the interior decorator's style. Views: Nonexistent (it is Charlotte after all, what are you expecting to see, suburbs?). Water was hot, beds are cozy and clean. I didn't see a single cockroach.Like any large metro hotel you'll see a interesting variety of people - business peeps for a conference, kids on a tour all wearing the same coordinated clothes, and random weirdos (like me). And of course on the right weekend when there is a game - lots of Cowboys fans. People watching is a sport in itself - all the tarted up ladies (welcome to The South y'all) and kids freaking out.Lets talk about the bar. The first night I went I got served twice with STRONG drinks (negroni, then gin &amp; tonic), and only $10 bucks. I'm gonna like this place, I thought - I wonder if the locals come here knowing the drinks are strong. But alas... the SECOND night I ordered a whisky sour and it was basically sour mix. When I subsequently ordered a double it came back with a shot floating in the top and... wait for it.... the charge was $24. Yep, you read that right - they charged me for TWO drinks (and for some reason added on a $2/drink charge). I asked for snacks, and they served me some peanut things that were wet. I guess the dish was still wet from the dishwasher. So it was soggy snacks.And finally, one of my drinks was served in a hot glass (straight from the washer??) So it's quickly melting and getting warm. Bartending 101 dudes. I knew the score because the night before a woman asked for them to repour her martini in a COLD glass. Apparently her glass was hot. At the time I was thinking - what a b*tch, but then it happened to me. Sigh.They also charge for internet usage, because apparently the owners think it's 1995.I didn't stay at the restaurant. My friends said it was $26 for a breakfast buffet. Ouch.Parking will add another $20 / night.These little things added up. The Westin has this vibe of trying to be a nice fancy uppity hotel - people waiting to call cabs for you (we used Uber, half the price), and when my bill was emailed to me they called it a ""guest folio"" instead of a ""bill"".... all fancyshmancypantsy - but the thing is they miss the details like a competent bar, and they nickel and dime you for things like internet... in 2015.Pros: Clean, predictable rooms, fast elevator, people watching.Cons: Bar is hot mess, nickled and dimed for fees, beige.Had a room overlooking the city but the seals in the window were broken and it was a foggy blur. Staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball. They double billed my credit card for the room. The hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment.I'm in my room as I write this review. Being so close to the convention center, I assumed the place would be more pristine. I was wrong. While the room is fine, it's only fine. It's not the cleanest room I've seen by a long shot. The air conditioning vent is extremely dusty as is the majority of the furniture. The bed seems clean but as with most hotels, there are layers and layers of linens which are meant to feel plush but just get tangled and feel hot in the middle of the night.Finally the self parking is $20 a night which is just much too expensive for a city like Charlotte. Being from DC I'm experienced with pricy parking but $20 a night in a small city like Charlotte is just ridiculous!","Very nice hotel in a pretty good location - you can walk out the door into downtown, you are just on the  outskirts.   Super clean, the lap pool is the perfect temperature, gym has lots of equipment.  The restaurant is closed for repairs, so unable to comment and that was a bit inconvenient.   Parking is rough through - $20/day.I stay in a LOT of hotels. The Westin in Charlotte is easily staffed with the nicest, most accommodating staff of pretty much any hotel I have been to...and compared to other hotels I stay at in this category, it is also one of the least expensive. Besides the Ritz, it is by far the nicest of all the hotels I've stayed at while working in Charlotte. The food is pretty good, the bars are nice and its close to my office. When the Westin is not available when I come down, I am very disappointed.Used to be a lot better but I hear they are renovating?Used to be clean and luxurious but last visit I had bugs in my bathroom lamps, stained carpet and broken furniture.I give 3 stars for prior visits and hope the smelly, broken rooms get fixed soon, as its actually a prime downtown charlotte spot!This has to be the worst ""luxury"" hotel I've ever stayed at. First off, I was staying here for a conference and had requested a higher floor room, but was given a 4th floor room - which is the lowest floor for rooms. I had also requested a King size bed since my wife was travelling with me, but we were given two double beds. In addition to not being able to sleep with my wife during the stay, I couldn't even fit comfortably on the bed (I'm 6' 4"" so I always get a King bed). But I usually don't make a fuss about these kind of things when I'm at conference because I'm not paying for it anyway. The room itself was just okay - nothing wrong with it, but perhaps the most underwhelming room I've ever had at a supposedly luxury hotel. The only positive is that the bed itself was comfortable - would have been nice to have that King bed though, of course. Many of the hotel staff seemed rude and inappropriate in situations - including the onsite Hertz staff. Obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location. Plus I had went to the front desk to get my key card ""keyed"" for use in the parking garage because I had rented a car there, but they couldn't even manage to get this right. I never could get the key card to work in the parking garage. Conference rooms were poorly set-up, freezing cold, and loud! The walls were paper thin and it was at times very difficult to hear the presentations because sound from the other presentations next door would drift through - this was especially a problem in the back of the conference rooms. Attendees often were left standing at the back of the room because not enough chairs were set up.Perhaps for Charlotte this is a nice property, but for those of us who have traveled around a bit, this place falls very far short on the luxury scale. If you are in Charlotte for travel and have an option to choose where to stay, I'd recommend the much nicer looking Hilton down the street - that's a nice looking property and Hilton is always good. Not recommended.***The Westin Charlotte has a great location in Downtown Charlotte (within walking distance to so many key Charlotte attractions) and the hotel is contemporary and comfortable***While I mostly stay at Marriott hotels, Westin hotels (of Starwood) are nice and typically more contemporary than Marriotts.  Westin hotels are also known for their comfortable beds though I personally do not notice much of a difference compared to Marriotts.  The Westin in Downtown Charlotte definitely delivered on Westin's contemporary image and comfortable rooms.The rooms are not incredibly modern, but they are contemporary and have a simple and good neutral color scheme.  The design is definitely a notch above a lot of Marriotts that often feature an unappealing color scheme and ugly carpets.  The bed at this Westin was comfortable--excellent linen too and a comfortable room temperature.  The bathroom had a great look and featured a rainfall showerhead.  While I do not have status with Starwood, I did like the nice touch of two complimentary bottles of water with each night (it seems every Starwood member, even non-elite members, enjoy this benefit).This Westin also has a great location.  It is right on College, which leads to several Downtown Charlotte restaurants and even some of Charlotte's nightlife like a dance club and a dueling piano bar.  This Westin is also within walking distance to several key Charlotte attractions including a minor league baseball stadium, the Carolina Panthers (NFL) stadium, the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) arena, and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.The fitness center was big and had several machines.The lobby was nice too.  It was spacious and there were several sitting areas if you are waiting for someone.I tried a little bit of their catering for a nightly event in their restaurant as well as in one of their banquet rooms for breakfast.  The food was definitely subpar for a Westin.  A lot of it was due to poor preparation and the effects of having buffet style food as the scrambled eggs were not that fluffy, the waffles were very soft and the flatbread was limp (it had definitely been sitting around for too long).Service throughout the hotel was friendly though I felt that housekeeping was a tad slow to service my room on some days.Prices are high, but the hotel is nice and the location is very convenient.For travelers looking to explore Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a great option.  The rooms are nice and the location is near perfect.  Downtown Charlotte is not my favorite downtown city.  It is a tad sleepy though not as quiet as Phoenix or as small as San Jose.  However, if you need to be in Downtown Charlotte, this Westin is a good hotel for a short or long stay.Pay valet and self parking are both offered by this Westin.  It is easy finding a spot with self parking.Went here for a (crappy) Meetup and while I've been in Charlotte now almost 4 years, I have never been to this hotel. It's on the ourskirts of Uptown, and it is an architecturally impressive hotel....if you look at it from the side, it's kind of got that ""bad guy's lair, Gotham"" look to it. So we all met in the large Lobby Bar, and ordered quite expensive glasses of wine. The CHEAPEST they had was $10, and they averaged about $13 a glass. Normally I can get those glasses elsewhere for much less but it's hotel prices. Pours were decent though....selection was below average with about 10 red and white wine selections.Staff was OK. Nothing special.This to me was just another nice hotel bar with expensive drink prices and an expensive parking deck (thankfully I had a Meetup voucher or I would have had to pay like $10 for parking - to get their expensive drinks!).Unless you absolutely have a good reason, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.Beds are great and fitness/pool area is good, people are fantastic. The location was excellent, close to the baseball park, nascar hall of fame.Love the hotel, love the employees. Great service, super nice people! Parking is not my favorite thing here as you have to find a parking spot in the garage attached to the hotel unless you valet. The beds are super comfortable and they bring you extra pillows when requested. As I am a pillow snob and very picky about my pillows I give them extra kudos for the feather pillows.We enjoyed our rooms and the hospitality the staff conveyed.  The only down side was how far of a walk it was to get to any dining or entertainment.  The surrounding parking lots are monitored like prisons constantly harassed by security for just walking through.The front desk staff are amazing! Particularly Kimberly, Adrienne, and Jasper. They always greet with a warm smile and are helpful (even when there is a long line) great individuals and examples of customer service! This is a busy hotel with a ton of demanding business clientele. The hotel is amazingly accommodating despite being booked to capacity almost every night.Amazing hospitality shown to our company FASTSIGNS, we were there for a Sales Summit for our FASTSIGNS store in Rochester, MN and the entire staff was incredible.  If I ever come to Charlotte, NC again this is where I will stay.  The rooms were clean, fabulous, and just overall a great experience.My husband and I stayed here for two nights this past Valentine's Day weekend for our second babymoon. I must say it was hard to leave! Hotel:The Westin is right in Uptown located across from the Convention Center and next to a light rail station, The Epicentre is only a 10-minute walk away (yes, we braved the cold, but it was nice!), and the arena is another few minutes from there. You can pay $25 for valet parking or $18 to self-park (which we did).The lobby area was nice, and check-in was smooth. There is a mini-Starbucks there and a gift/sundries shop around the corner. The elevator bank has six elevators, so we didn't have to wait long (except when we ran into the ACN International Convention attendants coming back from the arena!).Restaurant/Food Service:We didn't eat at the restaurant or indulge in food service, but apparently the breakfast buffet isn$25 per person! If you're here on a Sunday like we were, check out Pike's Soda Shop (a five-minute drive away in South End) for their amazing breakfast and breakfast buffet for $8.95 (before 10am--after that it's $13.95, but they add more food).Room:We booked a corner Superior room on the 23rd floor with gorgeous views of Uptown. It faced north and east, so the sunrise was absolutely beautiful. There is a nice-sized TV, individual thermostat, a desk with chair, an armchair with ottoman, a mini-fridge, and a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee. They even threw in two free bottles of water (but don't consume the third, or it's $3.95). We didn't hair any noise from neighbors besides one instance of dogs barking (yes, the Westin is pet friendly). If you choose no housekeeping each day you're there (excluding day of departure), you get hooked up with a $5 dining voucher you can keep (or you can exchange that for 500 Starwood points when you check out). We initially had a problem with a non-functioning remote for the TV, but they sent someone up within 15 minutes and took care of it. Also beware that Wifi isn't free, but I believe if you're an SPG member you may not have to pay.Bed:The Heavenly Bed definitely lived up to its name! It was extremely comfortable and hard to get out of. The pillows were a little too soft for my taste, but if you love very soft pillows you're in for a treat! The duvet and sheets are comfortable as well. If you have a corner room, be aware there is a window right behind the bed. It wasn't a big deal with the blackout curtains.Bathroom:The bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom (no exhaust fan, unfortunately). The Heavenly Shower was awesome! It's both a rainfall-type shower, and there is a nice handheld component to it. My only gripe was the bathtub didn't drain well.Conclusion:All in all we had an amazing stay! I highly recommend this hotel. This was our second time staying here, and we will definitely return. :)I really enjoyed my stay at the Westin Charlotte. I stayed in a King Room, with a gorgeous view. My only complaint is that no matter what I set the temp to on my thermostat, my room was FREEZING. Other than that issue, I couldn't have been happier. The beds are SO comfortable. I took a trip to Charlotte alone, on business, and stayed in my room most of the time, while not working. My room was clean, elegant, and that bed! I guess they're called ""Heavenly Beds""? It's true. Tons of pillows and clean, white sheets and blankets on probably the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. I wanted to take the bed home with me lol. Because my room was cold (I don't know why this room was so cold!) I was in that bed quite a bit. Their customer service is stellar, and although pretty pricey, their food is excellent. I ordered a late-night club sandwich, and it was perfect. The staff at the Westin Charlotte work incredibly hard to make sure you're comfortable, and have all you need for a pleasant stay. Check out is at noon instead of the hotel-common 11 AM, and an extra hour, or 1:00, is complimentary. If you are not a morning person (I'm so not a morning person) or have a late flight, this is a very nice thing. Highly recommended.It's convenient but if you're looking for high end lodging, keep moving along.  The highlight of this property is the gym...seriously.  The rest of the place is fine, and the access to the light rail and convention center are dynamite.  Staff is solid, not overly helpful but solid, and when there are issues they hop to it.  This property rides on the tails of its location, so if that's key, you're good.  If you're looking for top-tier, Westin-style accommodations, you'll be disappointed.I can only speak from the experience of staying here for a recent convention. Several conferees and I had issues with the staff during the event over displays and services. Due to the nature of the event (romance novelists and readers) I got the impression they hovered close in case we decided to cause trouble. I did not find the venue pleasant.While my room was clean, I think the bed aggravated my back pain. I also understand a number of conferees who drank the water experienced discomfort and sore throats.It's the Westin! It's Uptown! I just KNEW I was going to be amazed....and I was not. Perhaps my expectations were just wayyyy to high. But for me everything was just very blah. The staff were all pleasant enough, but they didn't go out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable.The rooms were fine. But I wasn't impressed with anything except for the beds. Those things are super fluffy and comfortable. I do have to give them kudos for the views...especially at night. However, I'm a fan just yet. I'll give them another try...but I'm not really in a hurry.I've stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality.  There was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day I waited 30 minutes to check in.  As a result, I didn't have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner.  They said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when I got back at 10:30 p.m., ready to collapse, they were no where to be found.There was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working.  Not the kind of experience I expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything - I'm talking $15 for one day of parking!  I have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great.  Why are you slacking Westin Charlotte?One word ""heavenly"" beds. Need I say more. I'm a fan of Westin everywhere I travel. The beds alone make it a good stay. This location is ideal, right in the city center. Walking distance from EpiCenter and far enough away from the noise.This Westin was as expected. The staff were friendly, but as another yelper stated. They didn't go out of there way. Being a SPG gold member, we were put in a superior king room. The view of the city was amazing from the room.I checked in thursday morning which was great because I just got in from a redeye flight and it was 10:30 in the morning and they had a room available. Which I took full advantage of and took a nap before my sales conference started.  The room was very nice. I ordered Carolina pulled pork sandwich from their after hours menu. The person who brought the food up to my room said it was the best in Charlotte. Description said grain mustard Cole slaw and pickles. The coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots. There were no pickles or grain mustard. Then the next night I ordered a turkey club and it is exactly what it said on the menu. The customer service is awesome but they need to  follow what their menu says. Other than that I had a great time. The channels are very scarce and it takes multiple seconds for the channel to change. Either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible. We live in a time where tv is very simple. Their tv service reminds me of watching TV in the early 90's.Great Stay During Business Travel in Sept 2013Clean, modern, comfortable bed, good gym, indoor pool, two bars, a Starbucks in the lobby, and great downtown location.Side Note, the architect of this building is very cool.","Really enjoyed this place during a conference at the hotel for 600+ people.  Nice upscale appearance, very accommodating staff, and great breakfast and lunches for a big crowd all were reasons for my satisfaction.  Lastly, I requested and received a room with a ""roll-in"" shower to assist me with a chronic back problem.  That plus the comfortable bed minimized my back discomfort during the meeting.  BTW, special group parking rates and room rates were a great value added factor!  Great place for a meeting.  Just one more thing, you can get takeout from the restaurant if you want to get around the in room fees for dining.I love this hotel.  Love love love.  I stayed years ago for business and was impressed and recently stayed for a wedding weekend and was not let down.  The staff was super nice, the car service was prompt, our room was nice and the location is great.  My only complaint was the A/C in our room was acting really wacky and not coming on and the drinks at the bar (which the patio is a great area outside to relax) were kinda pricey.Fantastic views from the suites were a highlight for us here, as were the comfy beds.  The rooms aren't huge, but they don't really need to be.  Staff was courteous and helpful throughout.  Prices can be a little high, but given the location they aren't outrageous.My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a night this weekend, and overall we had a pretty great experience. But for the money, I'm pretty sure that's expected, we just aren't used to places this nice :-PFor what it's worth though, the beds were great, the room was clean and well kept, and we had pretty much everything we could have wanted there except for a microwave. The staff was very friendly as well.The only real downside to this place is that everything is expensive. Not just the room, but parking was $18/day, and even to rent a movie was expensive ('Gravity' was going for $16!).So if you've got the money to do it, it was a beautiful hotel, just don't forget that the room is only the start of the cost.I stayed at The Westin last week and I have to say it's not nearly as pleasant as it was a few years ago. Within 24 hours of my arrival my sinuses were freaking out. I thought maybe it was the climate change or the dry hotel air. But by day 2 my nose was bleeding and the person sharing my room was also not feeling great. It was then I noticed small mold spots in the shower. (there was no ventilation fan in the bathroom) I was there for a convention so I had to spend a great deal of time inside and by the time I checked out five days later I was miserable and so happy to get out of that hotel. The AC in the room also did not seem to operate properly. I'd wake up in the middle of the night hot despite the room temp being set on 64. No way it got near 64 or I would have been freezing. I fully believe the lack of ventilation and poor AC quality led to my roommate and I both ending up sick. But imagine my surprise when I get back home and complaints start popping up like crazy from dozens of the convention goers who also came home sick. I can't say for sure what the cause was, but I am comfortably saying The Westin in downtown Charlotte is not a healthy hotel. It needs some major work.Staying here is always a treat. I don't necessarily like the parking area, but it serves its purpose. I was here for an event, the lobby area was really crowded but was expected for the event. Seemed a bit unorganized, but the staff was nearby to answer any questions and help out in any way they could. I did have to stand at the bar for about 20 minutes before I could get a bartenders attention to get a drink, but I chalk it up to it being crowded too. The  rooms are nice, comfortable beds, room service is an option and the food from the restaurant is a sight for the eyes, and its pretty good as well.An architectural site, this is one of the better Westin's.Pros:Great restaurant, food is creative and tastyLocation in the middle of downtown CharlotteGreat for the priceCons:Rooms a little bit on the smaller sideOverall, a great stayA beautiful hotel with accommodating staff and good amenities. The catering is splendid. The food is fresh and REALLY good! I don't need to say anymore than what has been said about the beds. Just the best there is. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Charlotte's beauty can be seen out my window. Stay here!BED BUGS. Got 5 bites for one night. The bites caused an infection that was so bad that Dr. gave me 3 antibiotic shots within 24 hrs! He also suggested me to go to ER if not getting better. STAY AWAY!!Great place. Accommodating and the staff was awesomeI had an incident yesterday. They had some sort of rapper or hip hop artist staying in the room next to mine. They were being loud, a lot of cursing and shouting, many doors brig slammed. And this occurred in the room (which was next to mine) and in the hallway. It went on until late at night (4 am)I felt unsafe and not comfortable calling security. I should. Retaliation was my main concern. I expressed my discontent this morning and manager gave me the possibility if late check out, which was nice considering my flight is schedule to depart at 6 pm. All and all it was good, however I would recommend to ANY hotel that have guests that are prone to kiss behave and not obey the rules to either NOT have anyone stay in t contiguous room (or on the floor at all) or to warn them prior to checking them in.I am not certain I would pay full price for this hotel. Yes, it is beautiful -- I absolutely love the architecture. At its height, the hotel is 25 floors. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, the view was OK. But it is quite typical of other Westin hotels go, as far as the decor and ambiance. Thankfully, the hotel has a lap pool and workout room. The workout room has at least one dozen machines, treadmills and the like. It also has some medicine balls and free weights. Some of the machines have those built-in television sets -- something I'm not fond of, but something that I understand to be popular. The staff here is uber professional. Very direct and, at times, stiff. It can be a bit strange, but you at least feel like they are handling business. And that's about all it is. The hotel does not have a comfortable, cozy feel, per se, likely because 1. This is not a spa, folks. 2. This hotel likely sees mostly individuals shuffling in and out for conferences (the Convention Center is directly across the street). I'm not saying I want to see a juggling bear in costume tossing shaved gold in my direction when I walk in. But, goodness. The lobby is nice, leading to a beautiful and open bar space with free WIFI. Bonus!If you can, pack some crackers, chips or peanuts because the room service menu is somewhat short and there are no decent grocery stores nearby -- though there are a couple convenience stores. And if you brought your own wine but forgot the wine key, call room service. They have those little plastic ones and delivered one to my room. That was awesome.The Westin is your standard business traveler hotel in your standard business traveler city, (which is about as warm and fuzzy as I can get about the stepford city of Charlotte).  It has some really great aspects to it, and some less great aspects:Good.  Great.  Grand, even.1.  The fitness facility has a ""club"" feel with its low light, and has a good variety of equipment, ample mats, weighted balls, and stability balls.  What it's missing is a good machine for lats, but other than that, it's better than most hotel gyms.2.  That darn bed is so comfortable I can't even stand it.3.  Catering services from the hotel and their meeting space is well-supported, and well-done.  Not so good.  Troubling.  Odd.1.  There's a phenomenon out there called ""sensory branding,"" and one of the ways to engage a customer's senses to get them to remember your brand is via smell, so the hallways are piped with smell.  A horrible, putrid, over-the-top, overpowering lavender-y spell is that so perfurme-y and strong that I literally coughed all the way down the hall to my room.  Having this be your welcome to your room?  I think not.  I held my breath the rest of the week.  2.  The service in the lounge of the hotel is virtually nonexistent.  You'll see your cocktail server every 30 to 40 minutes.  This has been consistent through three different visits to the hotel and its lounge.3.  The person who checked me in assured me of a great view.  The roof of the convention center is not/was not/will never be that.(WiFi is free for Starwood Preferred Guest members, paid for others)Hubby and I like to hang out in Charlotte on the weekends, and this is definately a great hotel. If you want to relax - it is suitable, but if you want to people watch and have a great drink - the lounge works too! The rooms are always the same -  clean, cool and with a descent view of the Queen City! I have called ahead, and booked through the reservations line - and this is the only complaint I have. One time I visited, they did not have my reservation on file. The front desk obviously does not share the information that the main booking line has. They had actually reserved a room in Columbia, SC in error - then charged us for not showing up !? Everything was resolved a week later so we got over it! Also, if you stop in the bar on the way out, or just chill down there to enjoy the view -- you just might run into a celebrity. I refuse to name drop, but we have spotted a couple of celebrities there, and they are usually pretty friendly !There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!Now the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every, yes every, bath towel had a stain (either black or yellow). There was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past. Even the shower curtain was stained. Then there was the hair dryer. It was sooooo sticky that I didn't even want to touch it. It appeared to be covered in about 15 years worth of cheap hairspray. I can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon, but come on people!  How about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now!  Let me be clear that I think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given. They just need a better starting product!Stayed here while working the NASCAR race at the nearby Charlotte Motor Speedway. I'm glad the room was paid for by the company, as I don't feel like it was really a $170/night room. There wasn't anything wrong, particularly, but it wasn't ""all that"" either. The gym and pool looked decent. The bed was very, very comfy. Food (including room service) was WAY over-priced. The location right downtown, near the convention center is great. I would suggest taking a walk over to Brevard Court, near Church street to hit the little alley of bars and restaurants. They've got great atmosphere and reasonable prices (The Belfast and Valhalla in particular).There is a lot to like about this place. The amenities are very good. Starbucks in the bedroom, flat screen TV, a bed that's probably more comfortable than your own, clean bathrooms with toiletries you want to stuff into your bag each night, etc.The only downside is this sneaking feeling that almost everything costs just a little bit extra. It seems ridiculous. You could go to a cheaper, less good hotel, and all the amenities and perks are complimentary. But here, at the Westin, it seems, if they don't get you in the wash, then they'll get you in the rinse. So far the only thing ""complimentary"" here seems to be the workout center.So drop the cash and enjoy the comfort, just don't think about dropping the cash until after your stay.We always stay here when in Charlotte. I've always had a clean king room and friendly, efficient service. Full service Starbucks coffee downstairs in the lobby. The room has free Starbucks medium roast coffee, with coffee maker in your room. A mini fridge and safe are built into the dresser the TV sits on.There's a make-up mirror, hair dryer, iron and ironing board in the room too. They have a good breakfast buffet in Embers. It's a bit pricy though. Having the affordable light rail (it's NOT FREE) right behind the hotel is VERY Convenient too. You won't have to take a taxi to get to the Time Warner cable arena. But if you need a ride they offer towncar service out of the hotel for a decent rate. There's convention space in the hotel and the Charlotte convention center is right next door. Be sure to sign up for the SPG rewards so you can earn a free night at an SPG property.I love attending events at The Westin Charlotte.  The staff members are always attentive and courteous.  Today, parking was included with the event so that made it even better!  Lunch (baked chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans) was quite tasty and the event (Goodwill Cornerstone Luncheon) was fabulous, as always.  I continue to receive inspiration from the Good Works recipients.Let me say that once the luncheon was over, getting TO the parking garage was quite a task (slow elevators or walking the ramps with the exiting cars), then getting OUT of the garage was an extremely slow process.  BEWARE!  Had it not been for Speed Week, I would have parked elsewhere.NOTE:  I am unable to check in at The Westin.  Yelp says I am 13 miles away...So I've stayed at this hotel several times now.  I really enjoy the convenient location to the light rail.  There are several good local spots to eat at just off the light rail's route.  The breakfast Buffett in the lobby is expensive, but pretty good.  I've had drinks at the bar down stairs, and let me tell you that you'll be paying full price for under poured cocktails.  I've never had an issue with the staff.  They've always been helpful and friendly.  They have a car service available out front, so you can roll in style, for a price.  If you have the extra cash, not a bad spot to stay.In Charlotte for  conference.  Everyone has been incredibly nice, and helpful.  Good location. Walking distance to other hotels, shopping and dining.  Next door to Charleston Convention Center.","Stayed here for about 3 days since there was a conference going on.I would say it is in a pretty nice location.  Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.For a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.The staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.Internet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.The gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a ""refresh area"" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.As for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference.  Caterting was done right near the escalators.I didn't eat the restaurants on location since most of the meals were taken care of by the conference but I did check it price... and I would definitely venture out and explore the city a bit.  For the same price, I could probably check out a nice steakhouse around the area.Would definitely try to stay here again next time if I'm able to visit Charlotte again!Friendly staff. Super comfy bed. Awesome shower head. Can't go wrong. Unfortunately, wifi isn't free, so plan accordingly. Within walking distance most downtown happenings. Appreciated the town car service. I mean, who doesn't like rolling up in a black Escalade. Drivers were friendly too and offered Charlotte-centric tips.I expected much more from a Westin. Cons-The toilet didn't look very clean and the comforter had some stains.-Expensive parking-Mini bar, no fridge-$20 continental breakfastPros:-Convenient location-Radio with iPod dockI'm in a pretty unique position to write this review as I have a law school friend who stays here almost every weekend and the wife and I meet up with him most times.  I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.I'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.The restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.The rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.I also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.My only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.Expect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.  Convenient for guests but a slight traffic headache.I had a tremendously positive experience at this Westin (the 12th-ish or so I've stayed at this year).  - Beautiful, very new-seeming property- Great location pretty close to anything you'll need- Reasonable prices on self-parking- Excellent service- Extremely clean, well-kept and comfy space (I was on the 22nd floor...so I suppose I can only speak for it)- Upgraded to a corner suite that was amazing---very well appointed, functional and comfortableAgain, this is my 12th or so Westin stay this year---and it has been the best of all of those.Beautiful lounge downstairs that doubles as a lobby/workspace and hotel bar. Great place to work, wait for someone, or hang out for a drink (my work team definitely had to do all three). The rooms were extremely nice as well with amenities (fridge and iron, essential for a work hotel room). This location is completely walkable to the rest of the downtown area. They also sometimes have flavored ice water in the lobby which was a nice touch. My only complaint was how overpriced breakfast was (the hotel bar was a bit overpriced, but not exceedingly so). $10 for an English muffin and a coffee? However, our server was very friendly and attentive -  and they also give you your coffee in a to go cup after you finish your sit down breakfast. Nothing like 3 cups of coffee and a spare before you get to a conference.Clean hotel, friendly staff, good location to get around when visiting for work and the hotel bar is a nice place to grab a drink after a long day.They must have read my review. Since my last visit, they remodeled the hotel bar and improved the seating capacity. The hotel restaurant menu was revamped and now offer an all-you-can-eat cold or hot breakfast with over 20 items to choose from. Much much better!Also, several towncars and SUVs waiting outside to take you to the airport for a similar flat rate as a cab but far more roomy and stylish.Pros: Super comfy beds and nice amenities like Starbucks coffee in the room. Cons- room did not have a hair dryer, we had a room for four people but were only provided towels for two.Stayed here for a week for a conference in town, and it was like home away from home. I had a very comfortable stay. Location was great. I was able to walk around the downtown area with no problem. The restaurant on the first floor was very good, and I ended up eating there almost every night. That, and also I couldn't really find other ""healthier"" options in walking distance. The bartenders at the restaurant/bar were also very nice. One bartender in particular (and I forgot his name, sorry), on my last night of stay, gave me free drinks, which was very kind of him.  The gym was clean and spacious, and also empty most of the time, which I loved. The wireless internet, on the other hand, was unnecessarily expensive ($15 per day? WHY??) and slow. I used their room service for breakfast twice (I was feeling lazy)- also tasty and you can find ""healthier"" options on the menu. Their Starbucks in the lobby, however, was closed a lot of times, and the closest coffee place was about five blocks away, which was a bummer..But all in all, if I ever make it back to Charlotte again, I would most likely stay at the Westin again.Great hotel. Bed was comfy, room clean and the bar relaxing. Kudos to Brian (front desk) and Jarrell at the bar - great staff! The view from our 25th floor was fantastic. Would definitely stay again!Beautiful view from the room and the BATHROOM !!!!Staff was very helpful, Rooms clean - Embers restaurant food good but limited menu. All week the ice machine on floor 23 and 24 did not work. Called front desk but problem was never fixed - the whole week. Also they working on the pool deck area so we could not go out and relax on the deck on some of the most awesome sunny days.The maids did and awesome job every day !The nitty-gritty:1.  Location is great, walkable to Uptown attractions.  If you're sticking local, you don't need a car.  If you want one, there's a Hertz at the hotel, but you'd probably be better to rent at CLT and skip the rail to the hotel or $25 flat-rate taxi.2.  The Internet is $12.95 / day. It never worked for us, which was a major bummer. I put in a call with IT, who forwarded it to ""advanced IT,"" but despite calling on day one of a four day stay, I never heard back.3.  Parking is $18 / day and in-room movies are $14 - $16 / each.  Breakfast buffet is $19 and has everything except waffles and pancakes.4.  The pool is NOT open 24-hours, as the hotel's website advertises.  It closes at 10pm, and there were always kids there when we tried to go.  It'd be great if 9pm-11pm was grown-up only pool time.5.  The hotel is GORGEOUS.6.  The staff was extremely friendly, though seemed a little inexperienced.  There was rarely anybody at the concierge desk, and staff recommended odd things, like taking the rail one stop ($1.75) instead of walking .3 miles because ""you'd have to cross a big intersection.""  7. The bed is PURE HEAVEN.8. The hotel room has no fridge!  This is a major drawback in a city known for outstanding restaurants and huge portions, and more than once we had to decline to-go boxes.  I've never thrown away pan-seared branzino or salmon with lobster before, and I hope to never do so again.stayed here for less than 18 hours, so I really can't justify giving it more stars.  nothing spectacular, but nothing offensivethe bed was comfy, the room was fine.  I was attending a meeting &amp; the food was not very good- but that could be because of what was ordered.  vegan options were slim to none (even the granola bars they had a snack were dairy &amp; they could not find soy milk for coffee, WTF?)I do have to say they have a GREAT gym- huge with lots of equipment &amp; space.I wanted to give it three stars because the lobby was so great, the bar and bar staff were awesome and the beds were comfortable enough. But for the rate that we paid the cleanliness of our hotel room was unacceptable. There was a massive stain in the middle of the floor and left over beverages from the last occupants, and a stain on the comforter. Big disappointment...try the Hilton.I've actually been here at least 3 or 4 times now and it's fine. It's a Westin. Pretty consistent as a chain in my opinion. Been to about half a dozen now and they all seem to match up pretty evenly more or less. A solid option before you leap up the prices to luxury status. That said, if you're curious about the nicer Westins, I would say that perhaps the nicest I've seen is the one in Minneapolis. After that, Boston.I went to an event lasy night at the Westin Hotel,  its a yearly event that has been hosted at the westin for years.  This year was smaller than the past due I think mostly because people are not happy with the continued issues of under staffing at the bar.  It took about 30 min to get a drink, and once again they ran out of vodka.  I would think because of past experiences with this group they would be better prepared.  There was so much lost revenue, last night because I saw a lot of people including my group that just left and went elsewhere to get a drink.The main bathroom off the lobby was one of the most disgusting I have encountered.  one stall was roped off with no toilet at all,  there was  a broken bottle in the other shattered all over the floor, no towels, and one had overflowed.  Wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion.My recemendation is step it up Westin,  I assure you I wont be back unless you do..I hope this group considers another venue, want that wants the business, as it seems the westin is not interested..I really looked forward to writing a good review based on my first initial impression, but sadly, I cannot.The architecture is beautiful inside &amp; out.  The rooms are comfortable &amp; modern &amp; OH MY - the beds &amp; pillows. I wanted to secretly haul them out with me &amp; bring them home. Nice flat screen TV's, a mini bar, nice room service offerings, beautiful views, &amp; double shower heads in the shower. Radio with iPod dock. Location of the hotel to downtown is perfect. These all deserve 5 stars.Now for the bad. :( Paying to park - we were there from 9 PM December 31st - 10:45 AM January 1st. Our parking debt was $18, which was already billed on our check out summary. Paid internet - $12.95 for like 3 MB. Seriously?! And here is a rundown of our New Year's Eve: We had somewhat prepared ourselves for loud activity around 2 / 3 AM; however, we were not prepared for 2 straight hours of our ""next door neighbor"" playing an acoustic guitar, having guests coming &amp; going slamming the door, &amp; loud talking outside our door / through the wall.  We endured 30 minutes prior to making the first call to the front desk, asking for someone to contact this guest.  The employee stated she would send someone from security up.  A few minutes later, the guitar music briefly stopped.  However, it started up again soon after. Again, we called down to the front desk, explained the issue at hand, &amp; was given the same response. The music continued.  Around 4:15, my boyfriend got out of bed, went downstairs &amp; pleaded for some assistance.  Again, he was told that security would come.  No one came.  Around 4:30 / 4:45 AM, he called the front desk again &amp; was told the issue was ""pending &amp; that meant it was taken care of"". Unfortunately, ""pending"" in normal circumstances does not mean ""taken care of"".  My boyfriend waited at our door to ensure someone was in fact coming to handle this noise complaint.  Finally at around 5 AM, security came, knocked on their door &amp; asked them to ""keep it down"". It was at that point, there was silence.Was it necessary we had to go through all this?  Therefore, my perfect NYE hopes did not end on a high note.This hotel is so swanky! It looks so cool outside with their chic building design, concierge service, and a lot of the amenities you'd expect from such an establishment. So why the low rating? I'll elaborate!The positives? My room on the 25th floor had a pretty cool view. The beds are super comfy and fluffy. The rest of the room is just okay. The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast.Here's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were. At least she made sure I got to where I was going when I was looking a bit lost.So I ended up paying the parking fee of $7, but I think I'll be heading to the Ritz Carlton in the future where I'm sure they'll at least treat me with some modicum of respect instead of treating me like I came in off the street begging for some change.I am writing this after my horrible Omni experience because now I appreciate my experience here even more. The staff are great and I had a very wonderful experience. I didn't get that intrusive uncomfortable feeling like I did at the Omni. The room was very modern and their electronics were up to date including the ipod deck and the mini bar. The room was CLEAN and large just like the bathroom. And the view from the large windows was beautiful.","Consistent with other Westins.  Staff was welcoming and friendly.  Room was clean and comfortable.I'm giving this 3 stars because of the nice modern decor, and because of the fact that they always called us by our names when we called the front desk (I'm a sucker for that kind of thing).We were in town for a comic book convention, so we got a rate of $119 per night. This still seems expensive, but it was a popular weekend so we didn't shop around much more.The wait for the elevators was ridiculous! I guess that there's not much that can be done about such a thing, but waiting for 10 minutes at a time because every elevator that stops is FULL TO THE BRIM with people was annoying. At once point, my husband took the stairs back to our room WHICH WAS ON THE ELEVENTH FLOOR after visiting the Starbucks in the lobby. Oh, and it's not a full Starbucks so they didn't even have iced coffee...???The room was nice- we were on the end of a hallway, which I had heard was good because of the views and tons of windows. There were a ton of windows, but they overlooked construction and highways. Meh. The shower/bathtub situation was pretty awesome, also with tons of windows (there were shades, if you wished to pull them down!). There seemed to be no fan in the bathroom, though, which surprised me. Also, there was a burnt out bulb in the bathroom, right near the magnifying mirror; when we called down to the front desk to have it replaced they said it would take them a while...and it did. Also, this is a small thing, but they put lotion in the shower instead of shampoo (next to the conditioner). So I washed my hair with lotion. Yeah.We visited the bar on Saturday night between 10 and 11 and it was insane. It took us 40 minutes to get a drink, which we expected, but people behind us were being served first! I guess that's our fault for not being savvy enough to know how to get served in bars? Also, one bartender with red curly hair was making drinks kind of ridiculously- packing more ice in when she ran out of something and choosing things at random to pour in the glasses. We were glad the the person who finally served us (our overpriced cocktails) seemed to be measuring a little more carefully.A few more details: Parking is $18 and they bill it to your room; pretty standard for a downtown Charlotte hotel, but not exactly a welcome charge on your bill. The pool is inside. Someone on Yelp said that there is a rooftop bar at the Westin, but they must have gotten rid of it because we were told there was no such thing when we asked.In conclusion, I think I prefer the Courtyard Marriot a few blocks over, on Tryon. The location is a little better, the rooms a little cheaper, and the pool is outdoors (on a rooftop!).Westins have the best bed linens...my room was a little too hot for me...air set to 64 and was still a bit warm.  Otherwise, very nice place.This is a good hotel to stay in when you are at Charlotte, the only bad thing about this hotel is that they don't have complimentary breakfast (however that seems to be pretty standard now for the nicer hotels). We were on one of the higher floors and the view was great. The linen was clean and the staff was friendly.The location was also very walking friendly for all your downtown exploration needs.The hotel park is very expensive - $18/nt. I recommend going around the corner, there's a $6 parking garage you can park in during nights and weekends.My husband and I were here for a wedding and it happened to be the same weekend as the Coke a Cola 600. So, there were a ton of people and we were always greeted with a smile and even given an early checkin and late check out. Our room had an amazing view of downtown, but I did notice that the comforter was not clean. I'm hoping it was a coffee stain. Minus that everything was up to par and would live to stay here again.I've been to better Sheratons and what hotel sends staff to knock on the door at 8:30pm telling me that I'm playing my banjo too loudly.  Never happened before and I'm in the thick of bluegrass country.My stay at this hotel was on the expensive side but I certainly did not think this was a luxurious experience. When I checked in they told me they only had double bed rooms even though I specifically requested a king sized bed. I walked into my room and noticed how stuffy and warm it was even though the ac was at 60 degrees. I had to change rooms and was moved to a lower tier room with no view and was located right next to the elevator so there were loud noises throughout the night. My bed was probably pretty old since there was a slump in the middle of it which made it uncomfortable to sleep in. This Westin was not as modern as I had expected it to be and I was pretty disappointed. The mini fridge was pretty useless since it didn't keep anything cold. All the channels on the TV had frost so I wasn't able to watch anything. Front desk staff was nice and friendly. I wouldn't stay here again though since I can get a better quality room for a much lower price in Charlotte. The location of the hotel is not even that convenient, unless you are in Charlotte for a convention.I am only giving them a 5 because of the service I received.  I have stayed here before and the rooms are always great and this time I unfortunately got a room that must have had a party in it.  Stains on the carpet and the walls were damaged and marked up.I love Starwood brand hotels.  This Westin is a very well run hotel.  I have stayed here several times for business. The service is excellent.  The rooms well done. The catering is outstanding.  The restaurants and bars are well done. The location is ok with a quick walk to the heart of Charlotte.  Stay here you won't be disappointed.You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.Want a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  I will NEVER be back.Downtown.close to the airport and directly across the street from the Convention center.I love this hotel. For some, it might seem too 'far' from downtown (3 blocks), but for me it's in great location. Walk to everything, including the Stadium, Convention Center, Downtown, and the Epicenter. Service is great - I would expect it! It's the Westin! From the time you get out of a scorching hot taxi (even with air conditioning on) up until the time you leave at 6 in the morning 3 days later. I haven't experience a single hiccup (except a spider in my bathtub that scared the hell out of me one night). Amenities are great:Room - 4 stars. Last time I was here, I got a room with a great walking shower bathroom. This time, it was the regular small bathroom. Last time, my friend managed to get a room with a treadmill (yes, they exist!), this time they were all sold out. I got stuck on the 6th floor, she got stuck on the fourth floor. This was an upgrade for me, as last time I was on the 4th floor as well. Ok, enough bitching. The rooms are great. Beds are called heavenly for a reason and all the condiments and towels and sheets are so fresh you feel energized be mere being in the room. Air Conditioning is a bit loud so either turn if off for the night or bring ear plugs.Gym - 5 stars. From the variety of the workout options to the gym facilities - everything screams class. Perfectomundo! Individual TV screens for every machine (bike, elliptical, treadmill) help time pass by while working out and watching ""True Blood"" on HBO. Hmmm. Plenty of channels to choose from, though. Sauna, showers, and the locker room are squeaky clean with plenty of extra shampoo, lotion and mouth wash.Pool - 3 stars. Even though this is a great big lap pool, it's too shallow - only 3  1/2 feet deep. I understand that they don't want kids to drown there if unattended, but come on, waist-deep pool is not very appealing to me.Ember Grill - 4 stars. I have only been here for breakfast - I can't complain, except for the prices. $18 for breakfast is a little steep. However, you can eat all you want from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and nobody will kick you out (not that I have done that, I swear!).Business Center - 1 star. Ok, what they call a business center is actually a 50 square foot room with 3 workstations, a printer and a fax machine. Internet is pay-per-minute, except to check in on your airline's website and print the boarding pass (which was actually all I needed from the Business Center). However, for travelers who actually need a business center - better bring the laptop and stay in your room with $12.95/day internet service.Airport Transportation - 5 stars. Checking out at 4 a.m.? Take advantage of the flat rate towncar that will take you directly to the airport. Air-conditioned bliss!Ok, let's summarize: I would give this hotel a solid 4 stars and would definitely stay here again. Not because I have to, but because I loved it twice!Doesn't get much better!The Westin is a wonderful hotel with outstanding staff in a great location.  This was my first trip to downtown Charlotte and I was very impressed.  The room was immaculate and very comfortable.  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet one morning which was absolutely delicious with many choices from healthy to the more decadent!  My server was very friendly and attentive.They have several towncards/SUV's available to take you to the airport (no reservation required) for the same price as a cab.  This was a great amenity too!Highly recommend!Stayed here for a few weeks and enjoyed my time for the most part.  Cons are that it is expensive and gets very busy sometimes being so connected with the convention center.  There is often something crazy going on.  Garage parking is steep and they also charge for in-room internet unless you have a certain preferred status level.Pros are the location in Uptown (easily walkable to many eateries and sundries), awesome views, comfortable beds, great gym with pool, and the in-hotel restaurant, Ember Grille, which is pretty good.  Easily one of the top hotels in Charlotte, though we are limited in our options!Like most other Westins, the decor is very nice, and rooms are spacious and full of amenities. The bar and the restaurant is pretty good. Location is in  downtown, but certainly on the edge of town.Deducting one star since they don't have a platinum/concierge lounge.Don't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler. The Internet is awful and they don't support iPhone or iPad So many better options aroundStayed here almost every week for about 8 months and it's your typical Westin. The doormen when you're entering and leaving are a bit annoyingly intrusive at times and the front desk staff, while pretty good generally, don't really remember you - except there are 2-3 who are quite great.The reason why I give it 3-stars is that this is like a conference hotel - so many types of groups flow in and out every week that the hotel seems a bit over-used, though you don't really see too much wear-and-tear.Location:About a 10-15 minute walk from uptown epicenter and at night you have to walk by a few shady homeless people to get back. Hyatt, Hilton, St. Regis, and Aloft seem to be much better bets when it comes to location.Rooms:Standard Westin rooms with the white tea scented soaps/shampoos and Starbucks coffee packs - nothing too extraordinary or exciting. Gym:Really good in terms of both cardio and weights. This is one of the best parts of the hotel. Overall, nothing impressive or unimpressive. It pretty much meets your expectations of a Westin. Just a bit too many conference attenders pouring in and out every week.Great location especially if in town for a Panthers games. Clean rooms, comfy beds and nice staff. Late night lounge / bar scene is pretty good as well. Been here about 10 times and I'll come back again.I stayed three nights at the Westin with a group for a conference. The staff was courteous in all of my interactions with them, which were few.  The room was tiny for the amount of money that we were paying, but it was clean. I was a bit upset that their website advertised in-room refrigerators, but the only fridge was the mini-bar which required a hotel staffer to open (and which was labelled as being 'not for guest items'). Having specific dietary requirements, I had planned on using the fridge to purchase small items that i could snack on during the conference that I was attending.  I was also extremely upset at the cost of the dining options at the Westin, as well as the charges for *every* service that they offered.  This hotel was a bit of a splurge for me, even sharing it with some friends.  Two cups of coffee per room per day, extras can be purchased.  Internet (slow!) only available in the lobby, in-room you have to pay for it.  Ridiculous charges for room service, and the cost of the food itself was astronomical!  NINE DOLLARS for a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, or $20 if you wanted the breakfast buffet.  I would have been happy to pay $10-$15 for the breakfast bar, but $20 is way too much even for a 'resort' hotel.  Next time a conference I'm attending is in Charlotte, I'll be looking at other properties in close proximity to the conference center or staying further out and riding the train in.Exactly what you would expect from a Westin property. Nice decor, rooms are up to date, good location.The lobby bar in a little unique with the waterfall thing.  I don't know how close the uptown restaurants are from a walking perspective but a nice place to stay and have a meeting.","['like', 'chandelier', 'lobby', 'size', 'apartment', 'lobby', 'also',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/dunhill-hotel-charlotte-3,Dunhill Hotel,4.0,$$,44,"This is a nice hotel right in the middle of all the action, on the same block as the Capital Grille. Lot's of nice comforts, really nice rooms, great bar in the lobby, and big fluffy bathrobes hanging in the bathrooms! I loved the service provided by the front desk and by all the employees while there. I will say that it is a little confusing trying to park there. you can pull up in front of the hotel to unload your things but the parking is in the garage behind the hotel so if you miss the street then you have a decent drive in order to backtrack.Other than that I highly recommend this place.I found this boutique hotel months ago on Yelp when searching for a place to stay in Charlotte. It was a great stay. The staff is so welcoming and like other reviews have stated, Pete the bartender was awesome! He was super helpful in recommending dinner spots and made some great cocktails.The rooms were clean and the artisanal breakfast they serve in the morning is phenomenal. I wish I had that spread whenever I woke up at home! The hotel has so much class &amp; character. Reading about it's history was really cool. I would definitely stay here again.This boutique hotel is hard to beat. Decent prices for a great experience. Excellent location in the center of everything: within a 5 block radius, there are dozens of wine bars, eateries, nice restaurants, and even clubs &amp; lounges.Their rooms have good wifi, free sodas and water bottles in their fridge, and they sometimes come during the evenings with free mini Ghirardelli chocolates to hand out. Rooms also stocked with luxurious bath towels and robes.Beds were comfy, albeit on the softer side. Linens were crisp and clean. The restroom was super spacious and decked out in white &amp; grey marble. They offer free breakfast  that starts at 6:30AM, as well.This is the best bar &amp; the best boutique hotel in Charlotte. Peter in the lobby bar is the most attentive bartender I've ever encountered. I feel so at home here I never want last call to happen &amp; I'm so sad when I have to check out &amp; go home. I am so impressed with this property &amp; the hospitality &amp; service is beyond 5 Star 4 Diamond Resort standards...Booked a room on short notice, Exceeded expectations!A small cozy ""Queen"" room, not ""upgraded"" but just perfect and on the 8th floor. Sylvia at the front desk was patient as I tried to decide on which room. Quiet, no street noise, the ""European"" breakfast was just right and the coffee was good &amp; hot. Oh, and it was Saturday and I found an open parking space 1/2 block away on N. Tryon.I look forward to my next stay there! I thought the price was reasonable considering the location, not moderate but not too pricey. :)Popped in for an after dinner cocktail.  Bartender made me an awesome rendition of an Old Fashioned but with Dark Rum instead of Rye.  He took very good care of us!  There is a restaurant attached to the lobby, will give that a try next time, but it was nice to hang out in comfy chairs near the bar.The hotel was great. Complimentary breakfast, friendly service, clean rooms,complimentary  wi-fi and great location. This hotel was very cozy and it almost felt like home. The front desk staff were very friendly and they were able to get our rooms earlier. Better than any well known hotels.Cute, boutique hotel that is reminiscent of a bed and breakfast in the middle of the city.This hotel is incredibly clean, cozy, and rich with history. And while my room was not flashy in any way (my room reminded me of a nice guest room of a cottage) I have to admit that the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on at a hotel! Additionally, the location is incredibly convenient since you're in the heart of uptown Charlotte.If you're a frequent hotel hopper, keep in mind of a few luxuries lacking:1) Dated temperature control - old school dial that was difficult to adjust kept me sweating at night. 2) No room service or mini bar, but there were a few complimentary waters and sodas in the fridge that were welcome for guests to enjoy. Overall, I have no complaints with service and my experience, but since I stay in so many hotels I think I had higher expectations and anticipated a personal touch that may not be present at some of the larger hotels.Stayed here overnight while visiting for the Liverpool-AC Milan game. Arrived at 3:30pm but the room wasn't even ready despite check in being 3pm. Bed in room wasn't a queen size it was a full size so this is false advertising. I know this for a fact as we just changed from a full size to a queen size bed at home so we are aware of the size difference. In addition the mattress was very soft and the bed frame felt like it might fall apart any time - so we didn't have a great night's sleep which made the 7 hour drive home tough!A/C unit on wall glowed bright blue all through the night, there was no way to turn off the glow without turning off the A/C which would have made the room too hot.Room itself was small but nice enough, I appreciate this is a downtown hotel so you don't get value for money at those type of hotels, but still we personally cannot recommend it.This property has a fine central location.  The staff is very courteous, helpful and efficient.  Having said that, the Dunhill is both over-priced and over-rated.  Its glory days are in the past: the decor is drab, tired and dusty and the rooms are a major disappointment for the $320 per night charged.  The bathroom was awful, bedding lumpy and ancient, and the lighting poor.  Will not be staying here again.I really enjoy this hotel. I've stayed here a few times now and it's very comfortable. The first time I stayed, I told the front desk it was my first time in Charlotte and they gave me a corner room on one of the top floors so I could have a great view of the city. This time I'm in a regular room -- view isn't as nice and the bathroom is much smaller than the last time, but the room itself is nicer, with a couch and coffee tale so I don't mind. Super helpful staff too! The only reason I took off a star is because I do this some things could be a little cleaner. The bedding, sink and shower were spotless, but sometimes the towels are ratty and the curtains have a stain or two. Not a huge deal, but it's still something I noticed. I'll stay here each time I come to Charlotte.This review is just for the bar, as I am local and live in Charlotte.  I highly recommend locals and hotel guests alike to stop into the Dunhill bar for a drink.  Pete, the bartender, is the BEST and will take good care of you!  He mixes up some amazing cocktails and provides spot-on recommendations if you need them.We spent the ""first"" night of our honeymoon at the Dunhill due to an overnight layover before heading to the tropics. We wanted a hotel with some character and history and found both in the Dunhill. The Dunhill is historic which means it's not the most up-to-date hotel, but it has charm and special quirks such as fresh cookies and milk delivered to your room in the evening! The hotel is located in the heart of Charlotte and just steps from your door, you'll find museums, bars and plenty of restaurants. Check-in was seamless and the staff was very friendly. They have a hotel bar and a hotel restaurant, along with complimentary coffee and cookies by the front desk. We also got complimentary wi-fi during our stay. We were only at the Dunhill a short while, but while we were there, our stay was delightful and a great spot to stay during our lay-over!Great hotel! Came here for the weekend with my boyfriend. It was my first time in charlotte and I loved it. Check out was at 12 and they allowed extended checkout which was helpful. Complementary coke and water in the room was awesome! The room was nice with fluffy pillows. Ac was nice and cold and the shower head had great pressure! (Its the little things that matter)  definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel to stay at.If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself, it is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and so quiet.  I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors in the two different rooms I stayed in.  The complimentary breakfast is on point!  Look no further if you are looking for a place in Charlotte that will make you feel like you are part of their family.First class everything,  service incredible. Great hidden gem in the heart of Charlotte.  I recommend staying.The Dunhill is my favorite hotel in uptown Charlotte. A historic boutique hotel where the object is to please. This warm, cozy hotel is reminiscent of by-gone days in all but the amenities. It's close to the Blumenthal performing arts center and many good restaurants. If exercise is your thing, while they don't have a fitness center on site, you can visit the Charlotte YMCA at no  charge and it's within walking distance and one of the nicest Y's you will find.Perfect. Cocktails in the bar. Room service for breakfast. The suite was beautiful. Romantic. NYE already booked. Great location and plenty of things to do without having to get in your auto. We could live at this hotel. 8-) This is not the typical chain hotel....That is a great thing.This hotel is a classic.  This small little hotel sits quietly on Tryon Street and has a nice selection of rooms that are tastefully done.Add in a staff that is helpful with advice for the what to do in the city or will just leave you alone if you just want to lock the door of your room and check out for 24 hours.When looking for lodging in the center city don't count out the Dunhill....great little place in a great little city.Very nice hotel! A friend of mine stayed here last night &amp; had me come through.  I had always wondered about this hotel, since just based on the outside, it looked as if it had been there for a while.  And it has! Since 1929...The rooms are very nice &amp; spacious, with nice, comfy beds &amp; a neat seating area.  The bathroom though is what's really nice! The shower is HUGE walk in, with tile &amp; an all glass door.It also boasts nice flat screen tvs.  A nice bar area awaits you downstairs in the lobby.This hotel is definitely ""old world charm"" with a touch of modern.","Location is amazing- short walk to anything and everything in uptown Charlotte. There's a bar in the lobby as well as a separate restaurant. They have renovated the entire inside of the hotel- our room was gorgeous with antique furniture- and it was CLEAN! The bathroom had all white marble, granite counter tops, and a large glass shower. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We had a small issue with being overcharged on our bill upon checkout, but it was quickly cleared up. This hotel has a boutique feel with wonderful service and quality product, all at a very reasonable price. We will definitely return when we visit Charlotte again!We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate, so you don't know what hotel you get until after you pay for it.  Let's just say if you like small rooms with a small bed, in a small historical hotel with only apx 65 rooms then this is your place.  They had no king size beds or rooms with two double beds available in the rooms they had left.  Location was decent, but prefer to be closer to the action near more restaurant selection.This hotel is nothing special (for my purposes), but the location is great for downtown Charlotte and there were no horrible aspects to it.  The bathroom setup is stupid (like many hotels) with no counter for the sink and those old-fashioned separate hot and cold water knobs that make calibrating the temperature needlessly difficult.  The shower pressure was adequate, but there is no place in the shower to put your shampoo, soap, washcloth, etc.  That's just dumb.  Toilet paper sconce is behind you and a pain to reach.  An overall bad layout, design, and decor in the bathroom.The room is very dark with just some dim lamps scattered around the room.  There is a desk, but its shape makes it painful to sit at (there was a wooden part jabbing into my legs) and you have to unplug something if you want to plug in a computer, a short sighted setup on their part.  Because I was here for work I was too busy to eat their breakfast or spend any time at the bar, but I did need to get some stuff done in the room and the above features made that difficult and unpleasant.  Also, you have to park in a public lot behind the hotel and get your ticket validated by the staff to not pay there, but you still pay Dunhill $12 per day for the parking.  Not convenient, and one time I forgot to get the thing validated and therefore ended up paying more than just paying the garage itself.  Bad system there too.But overall the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet and getting around is easy.  As a business traveler I'd still prefer a Fairfield Inn or Holiday Inn Express, but this place is almost as good.The Dunhill costs a few dollars more than the chain hotels that fill downtown Charlotte. But it is a good value. The room (with some rates) comes with a free delicious american breakfast for 2, and the breakfast is made entirely with organic ingredients grown within 100 miles. The hotel is blissfully quiet; we slept across the hall from the elevator and somehow never heard it. They'll drive you anywhere in the city in some kind of old school crazy british car from the 1950s. Centrally located in a safe neighborhood, easily walkable to everything downtown. And the employees were unusually cheerful, practically whistling while they worked. Recommend so long as you don't give a f*** about Hilton Starwood PointsMiles.I've stayed here some time ago so I'll keep this short because it and the staff may have changed.  As I remember the staff was very attentive much like a 5 star hotel but for me personally I wasn't digging the old traditional style decor.  In full disclosure, the stay wasn't planned by me, so I probably would have steered clear had I made the plans.  All that aside, it's a fine hotel to unwind for a romantic weekend and take in all that is uptown Charlotte and the history of the place is pretty cool as well.  I don't think there is another hotel downtown that has been there as long as the Dunhill.My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration &amp; hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)Stayed there for the first time while attending a trade show at the convention center.  Although it's not the closest, it is still within easy walking distance.The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The only problem I had was the lack of a valet at the valet parking when I arrived late (near midnight).  Self parking was easy enough to figure out.It is a historic hotel, so some of the rooms have a funky layout.  The decor is traditional, but clean and comfortable. Also quiet.  I was in a room next to the elevator and never heard it.I really appreciated the fact that I never felt nickled and dimed.  Complimentary soft drinks in the room and coffee in the lobby (no bottles of water with a $3 ""convenience fee"" like some other hotels).  If you get a rate with breakfast it covers a real breakfast, not just coffee and a muffin.There is an onsite restaurant, The Harvest Moon Grille.  The selection is sometimes limited, but all the food is outstanding.  Fresh local ingredients are highlighted. Overall, a nice change of pace from the large luxo chains, and a great place to experience Charlotte hospitality.The last remaining independently owned hotel in Uptown Charlotte. Sad, but true.While it may not be quite as high-falootin' as it was even 10 years ago, this is where I send out of town guests in need of a full service hotel. The rates have gotten somewhat reasonable as of late, which makes it accessible to middle-class peons like myself and my brethren. Old school is a good description of the whole shebag - although the rooms have been recently updated and are comfily redone. Beds are soft enough but not too much. They have large flat screens for those Law + Order-binge hotel stayers (like myself). The rooms on the upper floors have had their bathrooms completely remodeled - very modern, marble, with those slighty-freaky belly button-level spray things, I no likee but I guess some do. But the bar's in the lobby, the bartender's got some weird 6 button vest on, there's a huge ball of floral arranging changed daily in the middle of the retro-greecian-baroque Bowling Alley carpeted entryway, and the staff is slightly stuffy, adding to the whole old-money feel. Plus, for all their staff's scatterbrainedness, the Monticello (and now, the Harvest Moon Grille) is a great place to grab a dinner or brunch. Free parking even if you're just there to grab a well-made Martini. Awesome.Very nice boutique hotel in building with a long and interesting history. Not usually what my wife and I spring for, but we are glad that we did!  We stayed in a ""Vintage Queen"" room which was more than we expected!  Furniture all appeared antique, bathroom finishes very nice. Mini fridge with complimentary water and soda was a nice touch. This really felt more like a B&amp;B than a hotel! Using AAA discount, this room was a touch over 100/nite for weekend. You can NOT beat that rate!  This rate also included breakfast each morning in the Harvest Moon Grille (attached/owned by hotel). Oh, parking is easy in the garage behind the place 12/day, again, not too shabby!  We would certainly stay here again if in Charlotte!This is an excellent, boutique hotel for anyone who has business or pleasure travel in Uptown Charlotte. It's right in the heart of the uptown commercial district, so if your business is there, you can park the car and walk to your destination. The accommodations are beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and fairly formal, but not over-the-top. I've heard the hotel restaurant is great, and features ingredients from local farms, but I haven't tried it yet. The Dunhill is not cheap but my company has a group rate which I am happy to take full advantage of. And I also prefer an independent, boutique hotel over a nondescript chain.An intimate hotel whose charm and sophistication is matched by outstanding service.I recently visited Charlotte on a family vacation and had the pleasure of staying two nights at the Dunhill.  This is a historic building set in the middle of downtown Charlotte, within walking distance to many restaurants and attractions.  The staff was beyond friendly.  I have stayed at many Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, Mandarin Orientals, etc.. and I can say that this was one of the best experiences I have had in terms of customer service.  When I called down to the desk to ask about a nearby pharmacy- they offered to drive me!  It was only a few blocks but in December it was nice to take a ride in the warm London cab they have.  The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds, newer furnishings, and flatscreen televisions.  If I ever find myself back in Charlotte I will definitely return.  I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.Absolutely the best and most elegant hotel in Uptown Charlotte and the only one with any historic character.  Truly a landmark, I have stayed here on several occasions myself and it gets my highest recommendation to all my visiting friends.  In a previous career, we put all our visiting executives and VIPs up at the Dunhill, knowing they'd have a good experience. As a professional photographer, I worked a couple of weddings and a birthday party here.  The Dunhill is perfect for those occasions because of it's unique architecture (the penthouse can't be beat for a bridal suite), restaurant, proximity to other amenities, and friendly staff.  I always coordinated with Kandace Stafford in events, who is on the ball and will make sure you are well taken care of.I cannot say enough good about the Dunhill Hotel.  The hotel is quaint yet modern.  It is reasonably priced and within mere blocks of everything needed in downtown Charlotte.  The staff was incredible!  I'll start with Kaela who made the choice of where to stay over the phone a no-brainer.  She hooked us up with restaurant and bar passes to lots of great spots.  Pete at the bar was awesome!  I cannot believe he remembered our names so effortlessly and made both of our evenings there so fun.  The crowd hanging out at the hotel bar was very fun both nights.  And I cannot forget Nick who drove us in the Dunhill old-timey car one night when it was raining and we were too lame to walk a few blocks.  It was a nice bonus to have an included breakfast (with gluten-free bread!) and free water and sodas.  I will stay at the Dunhill everytime I am in Charlotte.This is a quaint historic hotel that has been a part of Charlotte since 1929. I enjoyed staying here though I wished I'd brought ear plugs since I could hear a lot of the street noise outside from our corner room. It was still nice to have our wedding here and then go right upstairs to our room- no driving! We left first thing in the morning for our honeymoon which was a snap since uptown is close to the airport.WEDDINGS: Also, for anyone considering having a wedding here... Modern Salon is in the Hearst Tower just a block away from the Dunhill. My bridesmaids and myself had our hair done here- they did a nice job and once again- no driving! Oh! AND Flowers Plus who I highly recommend is right down the street (in one of the Wachovia Buildings). They do the Dunhill's flowers and will work with you so the Dunhill's flowers will coordinate well with your wedding flowers. Joel was wonderful to work with.OUT-OF-TOWNIES: One of the things I appreciated most was the hotel's location. It's within walking distance of everything from the Mint Museum of Arts and Crafts to the Bank of America Stadium. The main library is diagonally across the street. It was really great for guests coming in from out of town who didn't know their way around the city which can sometimes be a bear to navigate for the newcomer. DINNER: There are many restaurants just outside the doors if you do not wish to eat at Monticello, the hotel's restaurant. But I would recommend staying for at least one meal. It's delicious! AFTERNOON TEA: As good as the restaurant is, I do not suggest having Afternoon Tea there. Unless they have drastically improved since last year, there's nothing good I can say about it. The service for the tea was subpar, to be kind. The sandwiches were on the stale side. The server didn't know that desserts were included and when we finally did get them they were only so-so. The whole thing left me feeling like I had been an inconvenience to the staff since they had no clue what they were to do for a tea.BACK TO DINNER: But dinner? That's a different story. They do have that cinched up beautifully.Full disclosure - I have never stayed at this hotel but it does look lovely.  So why am I here?  To pay homage to the bar!  Dunhill Hotel has the best lemon drop martini in Charlotte.  It simply must be said!  The bartenders are wonderful as well.  I'll be back Dunhill!We arrived at the Dunhill from the airport at crazy-o-clock, east coast time (that's midnight, ya'll).  The staff were impressively attentive, held the door for me, helped us into our room, when there was a key mixup (the key to our door did not work) they quickly assisted us.  The interior of the Dunhill is elegant and well-appointed.  The interior bar stays open late, so if you don't feel like freezing your tail off (it was twenty degrees the night we stayed over) you can warm yourself with a bourbon in the lobby.The oldest hotel in Charlotte feels old in a good way - it's not outdated or dirty or sketchy or infested with anything but good cheer and southern charm.  The staff is amazing - really amazing and helpful, even for the late arrivals.  This was so refreshing after a very long day of multiple flight connections and shoddy treatment by surly American Airlines staff.The price was very reasonable - less than $90 (online special) for one of the nights near Thanksgiving.  The location is perfect should you wish to explore downtown Charlotte - you are smack dab in the heart of things, close to bars, restaurants, and coffeeshops, but far away enough that the noise of the grittier downtown nightclub scene doesn't infringe on your sleeping experience.So why the three stars?  The bed in our room was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever encountered in my life.  There was a really deep pit in the very middle that kept my husband and I awake all night as we kept fighting our way out of the sunken pit and over to the edge.  There was no relief.  We both have bad backs - I'm actually in physical therapy for mine - and the bed really set our trip off badly, as it re-injured my fragile muscles and caused me to be in pain for the week of Thanksgiving.  My husband ended up sleeping on the floor.  If the bed had been even remotely comfortable this would be a five-star hotel.This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located, there's a bar in the lobby (watch yourself, that guy pours em stiff), and the staff give a crap.  The only drawback is the parking situation ...and it's a little hard to actually drive to the building itself, given the whole ""crazy series of one-way streets"" in downtown Charlotte.  But yeah, I thought it was fantastic all around - oh, and the price for it all is great.just what i look for in a hotel. history. location.service.amenities.and originality.  the rooms were appointed well, the building maintained perfectly, the staff excellent, and a welcome respite from all the cookie cutter chain hotels.What a fabulous place! Great  place, great location, wonderful staff, excellent food, great value too. And here's the best part: This is independently owned. It's making it on its own--no soulless corporation bleeding it for profit. I would come here for a fun weekend even if I lived in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and stay here.beautiful historic hotel in the most fun place in all of Charlotte, NC. Service was awesome and what else could I say except ""I'll be back!""","Love this hotel.  In the middle of everything, quiet, clean, great price, nice restaurant.  For the money this is probably the best hotel downtown.  Sure, you could spend more at other places with bigger names but why....to take a shower?Great experience. Fantastic customer service and great amenities. There aren't many hotels now-a-days that give you free bottled water, free access to a local gym, and free wi-fi. Rooms are clean and well maintained. I would definitely stay here again.Great bar, nice atmosphereStayed here about a month ago.  This was really a great hotel.  It's very classic feel, but with brand new bedding, TV, and bathrooms so no old dirty feeling in the rooms.  The employees were super nice, I found a good rate online making it a bargain for downtown.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-charlotte-center-city-charlotte,Holiday Inn Charlotte-Center City,3.0,$$,46,"I would certainly love to give this place a high rating. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the restaurants pretty decent, and the location is great! I've stayed here before and had a good experience so when I came back the second time I expected the same.Unfortunately, I had to try three rooms before I found one that worked that didn't have weird stenches! The first one had a very strong musty odor, the second one smelled like rotten curry, and the third was OK.Although they were very accommodating, this place is seriously lacking on a few fronts. The rooms are a little bit small, which is a problem with most hotels in uptown. The rooftop pool doesn't have a great ambience, but a rather industrial feel. Breakfast is not included the way it is in many other Holiday Inn properties. You have to go to the restaurant, which doesn't open until 630 in the morning. If you were here for business, that's a problem. It also cost 15 bucks to eat the breakfast buffet which isn't  anything special. There is some kind of executive lounge, which for some reason I did not qualify for even though I'm an elite IHG rewards member. I'm never impressed with fitness centers in hotels, but this one is particularly lacking! You do have the option of paying $10 per day to work out at GoldsGym across the street, but who wants to do that after paying $200+ per night for an average hotel!The parking is a bit wonky, and it isn't very clear how and where to park if you haven't been here before. Unfortunately this is at the corner of two one-way streets so if you miss the turn you have to go several blocks out of your way in order to make it happen. The valets were very nice and helpful, but the whole process seems like a bit of a pain in the ass. You can get your parking validated and placed on your room bill, but why don't they just give you a card like they do at the Hilton? Instead you have to bring your parking pass with you, get it validated at the front desk, and then go to your car.All in all I'm sure he would stay here again, but I will definitely check other places first. I would definitely recommend other properties here in the uptown.As another patron posted, they don't honor the prices as posted on the IHG site. I was truly disappointed about my membership nit being respected. It'll say one price on the app and allow you to book it but the price will be a lot more when you reach the counter.The tiny toilet and lack of complimentary heart attack breakfast was a killer for me.  Also, the walk to the garage to get your car from the hotel is quite a hike.  The staff was nice though and the hotel wasn't bad.  Their bathroom design as you see from my pics is pretty crappy and the room is kinda small.  Overall though not bad.  The internet was pretty speedy which is rare lately.The rooms are decent and the location is great.... But the management at the front desk and at the restaurant are rude, inappropriate and lack some serious customer service skills. Next time I'm in Charlotte I will be staying at one of the many other hotels downtown.Vincent,the restaurant manager, was so helpful with many things!  This includes outside of the restaurant as well.  My wife and her friend had a huge exam next day, that's why we traveled 9 hours.  Vincent went above and beyond to meet our needs and was humorous while doing so!  What a great hotel and manager at that!JJ and the rest of the staff here are life savers! Missed my connecting flight because of previous delays and the airline set me up at the Holiday Inn Center City. After a $25 cab ride from the airport, I find out that the airline lost my reservation and I now have to pay full price for a room. I talk to JJ and the other desk staff and they get me set up with the original promised rate. Room was a dream (even though I was only there for ~5 hours) and I was greeted by name in the lobby the next morning. I'm not often in Charlotte, but I know I'll be back to see everybody here.I stayed at this motel for 2 nights (June 19th &amp; 20th). The first morning I had 2 red spots on my right arm but just dismissed it. We stayed out all day &amp; returned for the last night. I woke up Sunday morning with 15+ bites on me--mainly right arm &amp; forehead. I called &amp; talked to manger as soon as I saw the bites. She insisted that I was probably having an allergic reaction or I had picked up something outside!!!  The places were itching so bad. I checked the bed &amp; saw a couple of reddish flecks on the bed skirt. When we checked out I spoke to manager &amp; showed her my bites. She said they would shut room down(room 416) &amp; have exterminators come in and let me know within 72 hours. On Monday I had 42 bites on me from my head down to my toes!!!!  I'm still waiting to find out what ate me up!!!!   No way would I EVER stay at this motel again.While the front desk staff is friendly, the security team is the rudest most condescending group of people I have ever met. I did not understand how to use my key card to get int he building and they raised their voices at me stating that ""what did I tell you to do yo."" And in front of a group of people at that. I have never been more humiliated when I was using a defective card that they were to ignorant to realize. DO NOT STAY ST THIS HOTEL.We went here after a meeting. Made reservations in advance.  We let them know we have a EMS dog due to my PTSD, they said no problem. Upon Check-in, we were told that they do not recognize PSTD as a disability, and our dog was not welcome. beware veterans, they do not acknowledge war.  No more.  PA...We have paperworkThe only hotel I've ever stayed in that denied room service on two different occasions during my stay. Also, was put in a room with black, moldy leftovers in our microwave. Who knows how long it had been in there.Overall for a holiday inn, I give them a 3. When all hotels in walking distance of this area are sold out, this is then my default hotel. Rooms are clean and check in is fast. My room faces the back of another building and was quiet. The beds are on the hard side. All expected things were in my room which was great (bottled water, coffee maker, hair dryer and plenty of towels). Room service was acceptable, the New York strip was really good but my glass of wine tasted like cough syrup (yucky).VETERANS BEWARE!!!This hotel has decided not to service those who have paid the emotional toll of serving their country.Please read on to hear our story.My wife and I made reservations, then emailed Holiday Inn to inform them of our emotional support animal, for which we do have a letter from our doctor stating the need for this animal. When we arrived, we were told that they would not honor our reservation due to us traveling with an emotional support animal. I asked why and they recited the NC ADA rules. Now, we have NEVER been turned away from any establishment in the past, including Holiday Inn And other hotels and businesses in North Carolina. I spoke to the general manager on Tuesday and specifically asked if anyone would be turned away in the future with an emotional support animal and he also hid behind the ruling. This ruling does NOT state that services cannot be given to persons with EMS Animals, just the definition. You decide.As an after thought, we drove to Columbia, SC Where the Holiday Inn Express Downtown welcomed us with open arms.GREAT LOCATION!  Very clean and very nice. Not the Ritz which is right around the corner, but for a Holiday Inn, the price was right and the property was flawless. Beds were comfortable and the area around the hotel is clean, and everything including great restaurants and entertainment in short walking distance.  Would have liked a couple of bottles of water, but there was a vending macing right down the hall.  We were greeted by a very nice valet, and when we entered the lobby, we were met by Adam!  Very cheerful, explained the area and had discount and freebie coupon's for almost everywhere in the vicinity.  Whatever we needed.....Adam took care of it.  Very cool and professional young man!  Definitely a place we will return.The staff at this hotel are all so attentive and efficient. Look you guys.... I'm accustomed to to rouging it since I'm on the road so much and this is Not that.From the accommodating Front Desk Staff, to housekeeping, to the valets and belhops. Just a really good experience overall.We had one seriously minor hiccup, but the front desk staff was gracious and appropriately apologetic. They got the issue taken care of quickly &amp; we didn't have any other problems.Parking downtown is expensive. I took advantage of the Lynx Blue Line Park &amp; Ride to  pinch some pennies and it worked out. Parked 2 days for the cost of the train ride. Win.Let me start by saying that the hotel its self was great.  The rooms were spacious and clean and everything was well kept.  The staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk.Our flight didn't arrive to Charlotte until 11:40pm on Friday night. That meant that we didn't get to the hotel until 1am Saturday morning.  As we pulled up to the hotel we quickly realized that we were smack dab in the middle of party central.  The restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well.  There was a line out the door and around the corner and down the block to get in.  The hotel was crawling with both police officers and security (kudos to hotel management for making sure the place was safe at least).  Once we made it to our room on the 15th floor we spent the next hour listening to screams and yells from drunk club goers 15 floors below us.  Cars would drive by with stereo systems so loud that the glasses on our night stands would vibrate.  Every 10 minutes it seemed like someone felt the need to either over rev their motorcycle and bounce off of the rev limiter (I guess showing people that you can twist your wrist on a throttle like EVERYONE ELSE in the world makes you some sort of hot shot?) or do the same to their car.  This would usually be followed by that same vehicle attempting to peel out from the stop light at the corner.  All of this while drunk club goers are undoubtedly stumbling only inches away on the sidewalks.Fast forward to the day on Saturday.  We awoke to grab some breakfast then hit up a bicycle store to get a part for my bike since I was going to be racing a major national race that evening at 6pm.  Our plan was to eat a big breakfast then go back to sleep in order for me to be well rested for my race.  Little did I know that when we got back to the hotel and climbed back into bed around noon we would be kept up by what was apparently repairs being done to the plumbing or other piping on the 14th floor, right beneath us.  Workers were banging on pipes constantly for hours.  We tried to nap but simply couldn't.  We left a couple of hours later to grab an early pre-race meal and made it back around 3pm.  The banging didn't stop until 4-4:30.  So much for any form of a nap.  I thought I would get some rest being in a hotel?Fast forward again to Saturday night/Sunday morning and the same events from the previous night were far, far, FAR worse.  Apparently some DJ decided to set up on a corner or something and proceeded to play dance music until 2am, on the dot.  More screaming and yelling than the night before.  More vehicles with motors bouncing off of rev limiters and, no doubt, blowing speakers in a vain attempt to show others how cool they are by playing overly distorted music through craptastic sub-par car audio equipment.  All to be up at 4am on Sunday morning in order to catch my 6am flight back home.I will never, let me emphasize this: I WILL NEVER stay at this hotel or at any hotel in the vicinity again.  Annoyed doesn't even begin to describe my level of irritation.  Hotel management should be ashamed that they A) let this happen right outside of their doors B) put paying customers on an exterior part of the building where they are subjected to this kind of noise.Beware of this hotel...  Under renovations until December 30, 2014.  New RF ID keys and I have had to get a new key 3 days in a row!  The middle elevator has been known to get stuck or doors not even opening....  Things to just be aware of!When living in Charlotte, I came to many events at this hotel, hosted a few of my own, and have been up and down the building on many occasions. We recently stayed at this hotel when in town for a wedding and it was great. Rooms were clean, cozy, housed all of the amenities you could ask for and then some. The king-sized bed was awesome and super cozy for me and the Mrs. The entire hotel is great. However, one of the biggest bonuses in hospitality and service in the concierge and valet. The guys were so nice and helpful as my wife and arrived at separate times. Huge thanks to those guys for being so accommodating to us and willing to provide more than what was needed. If we're ever visiting again, I'm booking here for sure.It is 1:41 AM on a Wednesday night as I lay awake listening to extremely loud DJ music from the bar across the street. It literally sounds like there is a major concert going on. I am traveling on business and will not be able to function well tomorrow because of this. I called to complain twice. The staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything. I was told music would end at 1; I counted the minutes but nope..,,still going. The amenities are fine and staff is friendly but unless you come to Charlotte to party DO NOT STAY HERE!Great hotel - very clean, organized, the staff was amazing. Breakfast buffet in the morning was perfect. I gave it a 4 star, because I been road tripping around the states and out of all the holiday inns and hampton inns this one was more pricey and parking was also expensive. Since it was in the city I can understand, but I feel if you're checking in so late (9-11pm)  there should be some type of discount (that most hotels offer) Overall I enjoyed my stay and stood at other holidays because of it!I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. 1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.NOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. 1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the ""hookup"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. 4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious? FREE? He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. The stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!","My wife booked my son and I for a father/Son weekend to the Giants/Panthers game. I had no idea a Holiday Inn could be so nice. It offered everything the top hotels had in my years of traveling. The decor, room, location were all 5 stars! The front desk and valet parking were top notch! I needed to charge my phone and iPad before the game and the valet brought my car down so we could sit and charge it. After we were done he parked it again with a smile.We will absolutely be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!Perfect location with a warm friendly staff.  What more could you ask for?  Everyone from the valets to front desk staff were wonderful.  Our room was clean and looked to have been remodeled in the last couple of years.  When we mentioned we were in Charlotte for a sick relative, kids in tow, and that it was our anniversary, they delivered chocolate covered fruit to our room.  If you book through their website, the prices are very reasonable.Definitely the nicest Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at, in fact, I only knew it was a Holiday Inn from the signage.Its a very well run hotel and the staff is super conscientious and helpful with excellent customer service.The place is immaculate from the lobby to the hallways and other common areas to my room.   They have a great breakfast included and also an included cocktail hour with appetizers and drinks.There is an additional restaurant /bar in the hotel which was also quite solid so it is nice to have a place right there if you don't have the time or desire to venture out.Good place to stay if you are in the part of the city.Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one.We had a great experience here:  helpful staff, clean room, comfy bed, free WIFI, and plenty of security.  My only complaint was that silly basin sink located at the entrance to the room.This hotel is marvelously situated within walking distance to some of the best entertainment and dining in town.I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel, and I truly believe it. Our room was 15th floor room 1534.  It was on the corner so we got 2 walls of windows, one side had a great view of uptown (not the arena which is behind the hotel), and the ceilings were over 12 feet high. Our king bed was comfy as always, and I always fall asleep quickly on them.The hotel itself is furnished in a contemporary style, and will appeal to 9 out of 10 people.  It is located one block from the Epicenter, and only a block or two from the lightrail system for easy commuting.    The one time we had to leave parking was to travel about 3.5 miles to go to an auditorium (we saw Wicked, and it was fantastic).  Other than that there was no reason to drive anywhere since you are close to everything in uptown.  In the beginning of my post I said that my boyfriend and myself always stay in a variety of the Holiday Inn brand hotels.  For anybody looking into hotels, I suggest you sign up for their rewards system, whether or be this one (priority club) or another chains version of it.  Hotels reward loyalty, and will do a lot to keep you loyal.  We did our research and liked the IHG brand (everything from Holiday inn express to Intercontinental)for a few reasons; they are literally everywhere so we knew that when we travel we can stay with them and continue earning points, and price-wise they stay competitive.  Our room preferences are already saved to our account (free to create).  So as a tip to everybody do a little research into hotels rewards programs, then stick to it.  If you stay with a hotel chain ten times a year, they will do a little more to keep you happy, and make up for any bad experiences you might have along the way. When I first started out with my Priority Club membership I highly doubt they would have upgraded me to the 15th floor with some of best views in the whole hotel, but because of my loyalty to them they rewarded me (at no additional cost).  The room was only $97, and that really can't be beat  for this location.Recently stayed at this Holiday Inn location for a business trip and was pretty happy with it.  The location is great and the room was pretty comfortable.  Free Wi-Fi is very nice since so many hotels now charge you a fee.  It was walking distance to many restaurants and pretty much in the middle of everything.  If I were to come for a personal trip, I would probably still stay here if the price is reasonable.If my life were more like a rapper's and less like a graduate student, the 8 daytime hours that I spent in my room at the Holiday Inn would have included a lot more models and bottles and lot less reading and writing ... that being said ... I have never been to a city where the Holiday Inn is 2 blocks from the Ritz Carlton.  In my experience the ultra-luxury hotels keep a respectful distance from the less-fancy brands. But if one of your hotel fantasies is to stay really close to a Ritz Carlton, Charlotte can make your dreams come true ... it's just gonna cost ya' a couple of Benjamins.    See, the deal with all of the hotels at Charlotte City Center (Holiday Inn, Ritz Carlton, Aloft, Omni, et. al.) is that they are in very close proximity to one another and the City Center.  They are all within a 4 to 5 block range, so you are definitely paying for location.  But it's a good location if you're trying to take in downtown or you have pursuits at the City Center.      So, about the Holiday Inn - I like the fancy, modern furniture in the lobby.  I appreciated that it is a very tall hotel and on the side where my room was, it looked out at an art deco office building. So it was amusing to watch the workers doing their work thing as I whiled away the hours at Le Holiday Inn.  The room was comfortable and had some nice touches, including an ipod docking station, FREE wi-fi (which seems a bit scarce in Charlotte) and two types of pillows with helpful, little signs denoting them as ""Firm"" and ""Soft"".  I love it when my pillows communicate with me, so I know what I'm getting myself into.   The hotel also has a feature that I have never encountered before.  On the roof - which also houses the pool - there is a painted ""track"" for aerobic activities.  I tried it out for running, but I found that an open rooftop on a cold, windy, and rainy day makes for an unpleasant exercise experience.  In my brief little jaunt around the track, I appreciated their thoughtfulness and decided that this feature is probably better for walkers than runners.  Nonetheless, I think it's the thought that counts.  Overall, I liked the room, had pleasant customer service experiences, and would be willing to stay there again if I went back to Charlotte City Center ...Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man. The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place. Doesn't even deserve one star in my book. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!Just checked out this morning from this hotel. Stayed a single night before Thanksgiving. Unfortunately can't give it a good review. While I can somewhat understand reduced staffing on Thanksgiving, I'm not sure I can let a hotel chain off. On the biggest travel day of the year (day before Thanksgiving), there was a single bellman, no restaurant open, and NO room service available. When I inquired, the front desk just said ""sorry"".Room was clean and comfy; location is good; adjacent to plenty of restaurants, bars, activities.Parking and access is poor, as the hotel can be approached from only one direction (typical for a mid city business), and the parking deck is a fair hike in cold weather.I would have returned to this hotel prior to the morning of check out, however the defining moment was the lack of hot water. The shower could best be described as ""tepid"". Very uncomfortable for a winter morning.The overall experience had the feel of an older hotel trying to save costs. Maybe limited staffing for Thanksgiving caused it.....not sure.Although I liked the location, I would not stay again. I may be spoiled by the Westin Charlotte.......We had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived, all the way through to the time we left.  It's actually quite sad because I'd like to share the information, but I'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place.  It's awful and we won't be going back.  The worst of our experience?  Let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room, while we were in it, with the privacy sign on, pretty much sealed the deal here.  If anyone's had theft problems, this may be why.  Hotel staff was quick to throw out ""sorry"" for each thing that went wrong, but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said. (I didn't want to give this place any stars, but one star is needed to submit this review...)Decently priced, modern decor and within walking distance to multiple restaurants, bars, clubs, etc.  The location can't be beat.  The price was a little more than an average Holiday Inn, but it's all due to location and amenities.  The staff was friendly.  Rooms were clean and modern....just laid out a bit odd.  (Several of the pics on Yelp are from before they remodeled.)  The only real downside was being charged $16 to park overnight.  Valet service was even more.  The bar and restaurant in the hotel seemed to stay busy....but why eat and drink at a hotel when Downtown Charlotte awaits?  We were only here for one night, but would happily stay here again.The decor here is very nice and modern. Within walking distance to lots of center city attractions. Everyone here is friendly and helpful. Only downside is parking which is $15 a day for self parking or $19 a day for valet. We had trouble connecting with the wi-fi even though we were given a code to use at check-in, but we were out most of the weekend so that really was no biggie. Great hotel right smack dab in the middle of downtown!Very pleased with king suite! Great customer service, clean and quite.It was a pretty nice place to stay. The first room I was given smelled strongly of smoke (it was a non-smoking room) and I asked for a new room. They gave me a new room and it was much better. Some of the rooms have this weird basin thing -- instead of giving you a sink in the bathroom, there's a sink outside the bathroom, with this weird tall basin that is hard to use. If you don't like the room with the weird basin, ask for a different one, because they don't all have them. There isn't a free breakfast, which is sort of weird, I think, and the room's supplies weren't as nice as some other Holiday Inns I've stayed at. The best thing about the room was that the clock-radio thing had a spot for your ipod, so you can listen to your music in the room (and it charges your ipod, too!). Amenities -- The pool on the roof is a uniform 3 1/2 feet in depth -- yeah, I know, exciting -- and not very big in terms of length and width, either. The fitness room features a few treadmills, a few bicycles, and a bowflex thingy -- not even any free weights! There is a ""jogging track"" on the roof, which is really just a path painted on the roof so you can run around in a circle on the hard concrete. It's really pretty up on the roof on a sunny day, but even the most hardcore runners in our group couldn't stand that running path. There wasn't anything wrong with the place. It was clean, comfortable, and centrally located, and the staff was very accommodating. I just sort of hoped for a tiny bit better, considering the price.I stay in 3 to 4 hotel rooms a week so I am not too picky when it comes to beds but these were terrible. If I'm going to pay $160/night I at least want a decent bed. And this may sound weird but the toilet seats were too small (and I'm a small guy). The rooms were clean but I would not stay here again.When I wrote my original review, I forwarded it to the branch manager of Holiday Inn North American and his office acted promptly on it.They have given me their sincere apologies, and offered me 8k hotel points, which translates into 8 Southwest Rapid Rewards Credits, which is about have of a frequent flier ticket.  This is in addition to the half price my part was charged for our overall stay.They explained that the Charlotte Holiday Inn is a franchise and independently owned and operated, however they are working with relevant mangers to resolve the issue I experienced.Thus I am happy with their response and compensation, even though it was a harrowing experience, I think we can all look back and say we are better people and hotels for having endured it.However, please read my original review for helpful advice when checking into hotels....i.e. use a credit card rather than a debit card in order to protect your funds.The Good:This place is in a pretty prime location downtown as it is located to some of the best eateries downtown (Merts, Pita Pit), a few blocks from Bobcat Arena, walking distance to Bank of America Stadium, and a stones throw from the heart of Charlotte (Trade/Tryon).  The room had an ipod dock which was a nice touch.They seem to operate on the honor system when it comes to receiving more room keys.  I stumbled downstairs at about 2:30 in the morning, asked what room my party was staying in and was promptly given a room key.College St. turns into a ghost town at about 2:30 at night, so it is very easy to make your way back to the hotel from the Buckhead Saloon, which if situated anywhere else would be an inadvertent vehicular manslaughter waiting to happen.The Bad:See Austin J's review regarding payment policy and competency of front desk.  At least worth -2 stars.Their televisions could be called outdated... at best.  I am fairly confident that their analog tv's will go the way of the dinosaurs when the changeover happens next year.The beds.  This is not 18th century America. People no longer reach maximum biological size at 5'8 160 pounds.  Don't advertise a room as comfortably accommodating four when it would be a snug fit for the cast of Little People Big World.3 years ago I was charged $80 dollars for a flower pot that I ALLEGEDLY broke.AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!The three stars given here are actually for the desirable locations next to and across the street from the hotel (Pita Pit, Mert's Sould Food, and a terrible awesome bar called Buckhead's Saloon).  For an account of the managerial skills of the staff and overall accomodations, please see Austin J.'s review. The bathroom/shower situation is extremely odd.  Loretta P. described it well as an elevated basin serving the function of a sink that's not even in the bathroom.  Water pressure is pretty weak as well.  One plus:  you can request a room with an ipod dock alarm clock.  No continental breakfast, but they do have an overpriced restaurant connected to the lobby called Caffe Sienna. I think they'll even let you bill your room so you can pretend you're not paying for it.I would recommend this hotel only because it's a decent price (especially if you complain enough to get half price) and in a great location.  Close to plenty of restaurants, bars, and the Bobcat's arena.","The service is great. The staff are very friendly. Our stay at the Holiday Inn was pleasant. It's nearby many of the entertainment centers in Charlotte, just a couple blocks from the Epicenter. The Sienna Cafe in the hotel is a nice place to catch lunch too.been traveling a lot lately and this was one of our stops.  we booked the aloft W down the street and those posers, actually sold our room out from under us and, as a 'sorry' comp'ed us a room at the Hilton here.... now, first off, if you're going to say sorry with a comp, why wouldn't it be a nice hotel.  not that the hilton isn't 'nice' but it's not quite at the level of the aloft.  so why not find a comparable suite?  anyway, that's a dig at the aloft and i don't want it to influence the hilton.i hesitate to give this place only 3 stars because what else do you really expect from this place. it's very clean and orderly. service is good. room is BASIC. no frills. they have an iron so you can iron your wrinkled shirts before going off to your meetings in the morning. hair dryer works. hot water. room is quiet. etc, etc.... they COULD spare a thicker blanket as i had to turn the heat up in the room to sleep comfortably because the blankets where _thin_... but oh well.and i should take a moment to point out the breakfast buffet was unusually good.  not a massive selection but there were 9 staff down there waiting on about 8 customers hand and foot.  i was playing with teh waffle-maker, about to make myself a waffle, and one staff member jumped in front of me (at the SELF-SERVICE waffle-maker) and said: ""no problem, sir, i'll make that for you and bring it to your table.""  amazing. the food was 3 star but the service was 5. the room was 3 stars but the service at the front desk from 4.  so again, i wonder if i should round to 4 but it's ultimately a holiday inn, a basic room.  so it's good for what it is but not a ton more.I was so impressed with the service at the Holiday Inn in downtown Charlotte!  (Or, is it ""uptown"", Charlotte?)  Either way, the one that's appearing on the map at right.  Everyone I came in contact with at the hotel was hospitable and accommodating.  Thank you (Sunny, Elizabeth, especially) for making my stay so comfortable!I stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for 7nights while on a business trip.  My room was okay, nothing too exciting.  My only problem with the room was that my hair dryer didnt work, not a big deal but I was brought another one that didnt work, and another and another.  I believe the 5th dryer actually worked.  The one night we wanted to use the hot tub it was closed (looked like maintenance maybe).  The valet is wayy expensive, my friend stopped by for literally 10minutes (they didnt even move the car), and they wanted 12$ !!  The real reason I gave 4stars is because of one staff member.  His name is JJ and he is amazing.  He recommended a place for us to eat almost every night.  The night we went out on the town he gave us a list of all the places to go.  Its very obvious he truly cares about the customers and knows whats going on in Charlotte.  People like him are few and far between, he made our trip so enjoyable.  Thank you JJ !!!Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars &amp; restaurants. The staff was very accommodating.This is the second time that my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15/day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience.",,,"['certainly', 'love', 'give', 'place', 'high', 'rating', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-house-charlotte-center-city-charlotte,Hyatt House Charlotte Center City,4.0,$$,75,"This place really is a treat, it's a luxury hotel at a reasonable price. My suite was big and immaculate, with a nice kitchen area, couch and comfy chair, giant flatscreen, and huge, comfortable bed. The hotel itself has a nice high-end feel. It's super clean, updated with modern amenities. Valet service was really quick and convenient at any time of day. Front desk folks, cleaning staff, everyone who worked there said hello and made me feel very welcome. Breakfast features an omelette station, great coffee, and tons of options. It's super fresh and pretty delicious. The downstairs bar area was full at night and there was a giant open space across from the bar with tons of tables and comfortable chairs to work in or to hang out. Location was right in the center of the city, close to everything, an easy walk to city attractions. I would absolutely recommend this and will stay here the next time I'm in Charlotte.We had a fantastic New Year's Eve stay!The (Studio) Room was very well appointed, we wanted for nothing.  Ordered food at the bar and had it delivered.  Delicious and it arrived in about 15 minutes.Check in and check out was smooth despite the dates.  Valet service was a nice touch.  We wanted for nothing during our stay, can't imagine it getting any better than this.Excellent hotel, will definitely be back!What a wonderful stay we had here! We booked last minute through Priceline and got a pretty sweet deal. I enjoyed everything about this hotel...location, cleanliness, full fridge in our room....THE SHOWER!! LolAll the staff were extremely pleasant during our stay. The bartenders were awesome as well.Can't forget the breakfast. Probably the best complimentary breakfast I've had at any hotel stay!Oh, and I forgot... I had some mushroom soup at the bar. Made me wanna slap errybody!!! It was sooooooo good!!We will definite be back at our earliest convenience!!Booked this room back in October for graduate school board exams that we were taking in the area in Feb. 2016. We paid around 400 for 3 nights which isn't a bad price for the location. The breakfast is great, and there's also plenty of places to eat in the area since its located right next to the Epicentre and Amelie's. They even offered a courtesy shuttle to our testing site but it was so close that we walked. Furthermore, it was a busy weekend for the hotel (Panthers were playing in the Superbowl that weekend and there was a Nets vs. Heat game next door too) but we always were able to reach the staff when we needed them. We bugged them quite a bit for directions and special requests and they were always kind and courteous! The rooms were awesome because of the kitchen. Though a little small, ours came with a king sized bed and a full size couch pull out mattress.  The full kitchen set up included pots, pans, plates, silverware, a stovetop and a dishwasher! Great for us because we had tons of leftovers that we wanted to eat and we didn't want to leave our rooms so we had more time to study for our exam. Overall we had a wonderful experience here and would definitely stay again if we were in the area!I loved the modern design and art throughout the hotel. The staff were very friendly and made sure I was taken care of. Inside my room, there was a kitchen, full bathroom, couch, tv, wifi, full bed, coffee, fridge, beautiful view, the works! The entire hotel was super clean. Location was perfectly in the center, walking distance to all the cool bars and restaurants. We were right next door to the hornets stadium. If I'm staying in Charlotte, I would definitely stay here again!Nice, clean hotel with friendly service.  My only complaint is that parking will cost you at least $7 but that is to be expected in a downtown location.This place was fantastic! Awesome location to everything in Charlotte. The parking was easy.  i usually hate trying to park anywhere in a downtown area but this was a breeze. Friendly staff and my room had an amazing view of the city. Everything was easy and my bed was super comfy. I didn't want to get up and leave. I will for sure be back.Good option for a hotel in this class. Ideal location right next to Time Warner Arena and that Epicenter complex downtown. Staff very outgoing and friendly. Rooms clean and well maintained. Breakfast provided had good options and more than the usual complimentary options at other hotels. The towels could use an upgrade however I believe it's a specific choice to follow suit of hotel class level. Regardless I found them a bit thin. Also the elevators (all two of them for 17 floors) is tremendously under supplied. Housekeeping is forced to use the guest elevators so a a natural result, the traffic all day make elevator cars scarce. Every time I approached an elevator there would be 5-10 people waiting with me. For a while. That require immediate attention. Other than those two items I liked the property.Hotel is just a block off the main uptown area. Great location to walk the area. Hotel was clean, staff friendly and hot complimentary breakfast was good. We would stay here again.I booked this hotel last minute after leaving Le Meridien Charlotte a night early for have such a terrible experience. The first impression started with a very friendly and helpful Valet, Dylan, who welcomed me. The front desk staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure I had a nice quite room. They were able to give me an early check in which was very nice. The room itself was a nice corner suite over looking the Time Warner Arena.  It featured a Sitting Area, Bedroom area, and Kitchenette/Dining.  The bathroom was a little smaller than I thought it should be but I think that I have been spoiled by Ritz Carlton bathrooms. However, the shower pressure was GREAT! The location of this hotel is GREAT. Everything is close and within walking distance. Although the pool area is a little small it doesn't seem to get too over crowded and it was very relxaing to just hang out, have a drink, and relax. Ironically I was there the same night that Shania Twain was having a concert and loads of people were around.However, I would not have know otherwise as the noise level in the hotel was so quite.  Either they have air tight rooms or the people who stay at this hotel know how to be respectful. This was the first time that I have stayed at a Hyatt House, but it will not be my last.I recently stayed at the Hyatt House-Center City for business purposes, and was extremely happy with the facility.  The room was spacious with a kitchenette to work with (always a plus, as I like to cook for myself whenever possible).  The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels, shampoo and other toiletries, and the bed was firm and comfortable.  There is a complimentary breakfast buffet which was perfect, with a wide selection of items (I'm on a restricted diet, and had no problems putting together a good meal).  Mike, the front desk person that checked me in was great, when I called to tell him that I would be arriving late, he kept an eye out for me and had summoned valet parking for me as soon as I pulled up.  He was the real star of the show for me during my stay.  And speaking of stars, the hotel is right next to the stadium where the Carolina Panthers play!  It's a great hotel, and I will certainly want to stay there on my next visit to Charlotte.Excellent hotel in its class.  Having stayed at a few different hotels, I'd say the HH ranks at 1st or 2nd in my experience.  It's clean, freshly decorated and quiet. Yes, the Ritz is nice as well, but if you have a room facing the Epicenter, you will hear window-rattling bass all night.  Here at the Hyatt, I actually got some rest.A nice touch is the hot breakfast.  There's a variety of breads, cereals, as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. The made-to-order omelet bar was fantastic.If you've stayed at these Hyatts before, you'll be familiar with the decor.  The furniture is classy and modern while comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable.It's a block or two from the Epicenter, so it's not too far away from restaurants and office buildings. On your way, you'll pass by the main bus stop where there can sometimes be people who hang out there.  They usually leave you alone, so it's not too much of a concern.Hubby and the boys were at No Grease nearby so I waited here. Grabbed a glass of vino. Service was great. Bartender flirted just enough to still be tasteful. Cool ambiance. Never would have suspected from a ""hotel bar"". May have to come in again when the boys are at the barber!Front desk attendant Anita is a sweet soul. She was very accommodating. We arrived early from the train and she made sue we got the next available room. She remembered my name the next morning and greeted me at breakfast. The room, service and breakfast was great. #giveanitaabonusI loved this hotel! I could not have chosen a better location. Everything is so nice and new, spacious rooms, outstanding service, and amazing views of the city. The complimentary wifi and breakfast were icing on the cake. I would definitely stay here again!Enjoyed my stay there. Room was spacious with a beautiful view. Will definitely returnThis hotel was such a great steal for the price...actually...I would have expected to pay twice the price for the service/accommodations PLUS the totally awesome continental breakfast. I've seriously never seen a spread like that before!Very nice, stylish rooms with super comfortable bedding. The front desk clerks were very helpful and friendly. I don't have a bad thing to say...wish I could have stayed longer! We didn't ""go out"" while we were there, but it seemed to me to be in the perfect spot for nightlife. On our way home from dinner there were large groups of people dressed up for a night out on the town.I can't decide between giving this hotel three stars or four stars. At first I felt that the location was really good as it is close to the city centre, but it is at a location at the far end of the city centre at a part where there was not so much going on, a bit industrial opposite the hotel, and I didn't necessarily feel so safe all the time. This might have been an exaggerated feeling from my side, nevertheless the feeling was there. The room rate was very reasonable and it was for sure good value for money - hot breakfast included, free wifi, fridge, microwave, full kitchen, dishwasher etc. The pool was very small and only outdoors, I had expected it to be a bit bigger, it was more for hanging around rather than actually being able to swim at all in it. It is located on the roof though and that was kind of cool.The breakfast was decent, but could have been so much better if the staff stayed on top of refilling it, or if simply there was more staff to handle all the guests. Breakfast items kept running out constantly after what felt like less than 10 minutes. The plates were dirty and several times I could see stale yellow egg stains that apparently did not get cleaned in the dishwasher. The knives and fork were stained at times. The breakfast stations were not very clean. The coffee was out several times. Out of coffee at a hotel breakfast?! Really?!The hotel has a luxurious feeling in some sense and I would have expected it to be more expensive seeing it from the lobby and public areas. The rooms are really cool and it feels like high end apartment with a really nice view with big windows from floor to cieling. The bed was very good. I had some complaints about the room though, it was very dusty and it felt like they hadn't even cleaned it before we checked in. The coffee pot was broken. There is no door between the bedroom and the bathroom sink, which is a little bit odd and annoying when one person gets up at night and has to turn on the light at night and wake up the other person sleeping near by with no door inbetween. You get more space without the door I guess, but it just isn't very functional.You couldn't be any closer to Time Warner Arena...one block....hotel room very roomy with full kitchen..just went to Disney on Ice with 2yr old granddaughter and accommodations were excellent with free breakfast and homemade omelets....Pricey room and you have to pay for parking daily. That's a bit of a bummer but if you're staying in the uptown area and can just walk to where you're going it's a good deal. Friendly staff, clean rooms, and beautiful lobby! Great location next to Time Warner Arena!","Great location.  Right beside Time Warner Stadium! Everyone on the hotel staff we encountered were very friendly.  Nice sized room with kitchen, dining area, and desk.  They have a fitness center and pool area which were very nice.  Would stay again if in the areaMy sister got us a room for my bachlerorette party. It looked beautiful, but smelled like 20 people had just been smoking in there. When we told the receptionist about it she acted like it was us smoking in the room. It took 3 calls for them to come up and just spray some air fresher around the room.I hadn't stayed at a Hyatt House before but thought it's a Hyatt so it should be good- and it was. The staff was very friendly to us, they offer fruit at the front desk and specialty water for free. We stayed here twice in a week period. The rooms were alot bigger than we thought- almost a suite size. It had a sitting area and small kitchen area. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very attentive. And they offer a fantastic free breakfast complete with an omelet station- YUM. They also have a bar with a decent selection of local beers instead of the usual miller, bud, etc. And the price was not only competitive but actually a bit cheaper than those around. I'd stay here again.Very nice hotel. Modern and clean. Everything is new and not built cheap. An easy walk to everything downtown.We were put in a handicapped room even though we aren't handicapped. I disliked this because handicapped rooms remind me of being in the hospital which makes me very nervous. Everything was low to the ground including the bed which was lower than at any other hotel I've ever stayed in. The closet was so low that our hanging clothes touched the floor. We even continously got locked in the bathroom because the strange lock contraption, which I'm sure is meant to aid those who are handicapped, kept getting stuck. The shower head was one of those removable hand held ones but there was no way to tighten it to the wall and the water always shot out toward the shower curtain and we couldn't get it to spray straight down. The room altogether was rather small and cramped. We didn't get a chance to try the free breakfast buffet but when we passed by in the morning there was always a decent crowd. I noticed the hotel is frequented by a mostly young, college aged crowd instead of business professionals. The elevator required a room key to operate but it didn't even work properly. We were in the elevator with another couple and we each had to try our room cards several times before it worked. Valet was $22 with in and out privileges and the car usually came out pretty quickly although the guys weren't all that professional. As for customer service, no one was rude but no one went out of their way to offer exceptional service.Visited here for one night..Great location...steps from the Epicentre and other local attractionsService..the Valet attendants seemed unorganized...but at least my car was parked and returned each time with damage...so I'm thankful..there is a charge each day for ValetComplimentary breakfast...great choices for everyone!!  I really enjoyed the made to order omelets.  The one young lady closest to the elevator...she gave them omelets life!!!!!Rooms...very spacious, loved the decor and set up!!  There is even a mini kitchen...great asset!Pool...kiddie sized.  I am not sure why hotels opt to have this style of pool in an 100+ room hotel.  Luckily my 6 yr old was able to enjoy it to herself...the time we visited no one else was in the pool.  A bridal shower was held in the seating around the pool...but still a great vibe!The bar scene...very chic!!  Drinks were yummmm and priced well considering!Beds:  comfy!  Even the pull out sofa was comfy too!!Checkout...this is why they only get 4 stars...We get to the counter to checkout and there was incidentials added to our bill that WERE NOT AUTHORIZED!!   After this was handle we were ok, but I'm thinking how did they end up there in the first place.  No one had an answer...Needless to say, I would def recommend this hotel.  I stayed in early October :)I'm very disappointed. I had a horrible experience here. When I checked in everything seemed fine. After going out and having a great day I came back to this hotel exhausted. I came back to what I thought was a clean room just to find what seemed to be make up and wine on my sheet on the bed. I called down and the manager Chris came up but expected me to change the sheets with No apologies empathy or compassion let alone hospitality --the business he is in-- I was shocked that he just left the sheets and the dirty bed and gladly walked out saying I can take it up with his general manager. After being forced to change my sheets and sleep there because every room in Charlotte was filled due to a football game. I woke up to see there was piles of hair on the floor the room was not cleaned. I'm very unhappy and think that Chris the ""manager on duty"" needs a lesson in hospitality and customer service. I wouldn't even expect my guest at home to do what I had to do. I understand things happen but own it and make it right.Everything about this hotel sucks from the location, the wifi, the breakfast, the front desk employees, it is all awful. Zero service, zero help. The woman who checked us in could not be  bothered to even direct her gaze our way.  Not one greeting upon entering or exiting the building during our two night stay.  When the wifi was down for a day all they could say was to call Time Warner myself. There was only ONE employee in the entire hotel who I could speak with when I took issue with this suggested solution. It is concerning that they would only have ONE employee in the hotel at 10:30 at night, even though my husband had call 15 mins earlier to complain about the wifi and had talked to someone with a different name. Of course when I called they said there had not been one complaint about wifi. Buyer beware ...this hotel does not care and does not want your business. My husband is a business traveler and unfortunately he chose this one for a short family trip, he won't make that mistake again and will mention it to his corporate travel planner. Thank goodness Verizon works :-)Place is very nice and clean don't really know why it only has 3.5 stars. People at the front desk are very pleasant. The view from the 21st floor is amazing!!Ahhhh... A home away from home.  A beautiful hotel with modern decor.  My kind of place!  Looking forward to future visits to Charlotte and Hyatt House!I arrived Saturday afternoon at 5:30 pm and did not see how to park and check in. After speaking to the security guard for the Arena next door, he said to pull in where they do valet. This hotel is Valet parking only and is at a cost of $24 a day that was not disclosed at my booking through Expedia. After clearing out everything in the car so I could check in I find out that my room was not ready. When expressed I was a little tired, the front desk person got a little snippy and said that they were going as fast as they could. They were still cleaning it at 5:30 pm, so I'm glad I was not there at 3:00 which was check in time. After putting away everything, I called down to the desk and requested that my car be brought around so I could go to dinner. After waiting an additional 15 mins for my car at least my dinner was good at Outback. I got back to shower and there were not enough towels for that night and morning showers nor were there any wash cloths. A hand towel was a little big, but it works. So I got in bed and the bed was wore out probably about 5 years ago and in need of being replaced. The sheets were also in the same shape. Around 11:00 the air could not keep up and it was just miserably hot in the room the rest of the night. Thought with the Hyatt name it would have been good, but I was really disappointed.From what I was told, this is one of the nicer Hyatt House properties.  And, yes, that is correct.  Spacious/comfy rooms and great location.  Only complaint is that there is no bellhop (yes, you have to carry your own bags so pack light!).First time stay in uptown Charlotte. This is a great hotel with spacious rooms. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Close to Epicenter with lots of restaurants and bars. Also right beside Time Warner Cable Center. Short walking distance to the heart of Charlotte with lots pf history and sight seeing opportunities. Will definitely be back to stay.My husband and I decided to stay in Charlotte last minute and we are so pleased we did. I found The Hyatt House quickly on yelp and checked a few reviews, rates, location &amp; availability. Great rate especially with the AAA discount. The room was perfect- large comfortable bed, sofa, large flat screen tv, adorable kitchenette (studio king) &amp; spacious shower room &amp; vanity area. We had the luxury of walking to a wonderful restaurant only a few blocks away and had dinner. I always have left overs &amp; was happy to realize I could take them back to our room to enjoy later, late night munchies are the best! The small kitchenette had everything we needed, leaving us with the feeling of our home away from home.  I highly recommend this hotel due to the price, comfort, cleanliness, &amp; kindness from the staff. I will definitely be back.Stayed at the hotel for a quick trip to Charlotte. The hotel was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. All the workers were friendly. Hotel was extremely clean too. Would defiantly recommend this hotel and stay there again.I stayed at this property while attending a Conference.  I had never visited Charlotte before, so I was unsure what to expect.  Hyatt House was one of the conference hotels and it looked nice with reasonable rates so I gave it a try. What a pleasant stay!  The room with a king size bed was beautiful, contemporary with floor to ceiling windows and a great view.  For a small room, it was very well appointed with a full kitchen, nice bathroom with good lighting, TV with a swivel base to watch from anywhere in the room, comfy couch, nice sized desk, Wi-fi and a very comfortable bed.  Everything was very clean and looked and felt new.The hot breakfast in the morning was excellent as was the bar service and food in the evening.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.The construction was annoying and made it a little difficult for taxis to get in, but that certainly isn't the hotel's fault.  I didn't use the parking service, gym or pool, so I can't comment on those.The property is not right in the heart of the City area, but close enough so everything from dining to shopping was very convenient.  The Conference provided bus transportation to the Conference Center, but I preferred to walk.  It was a very nice walk from the Hotel to the Conference Center.I will definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Charlotte.It kills me to only give Hyatt House Charlotte a 4 star rating due to a surprise charge at the end of my stay. This hotel was the best I'd ever enjoyed, and I've stayed at a Ritz Carlton in Dearborn and a $1,400 per night suite at the Mandalay Bay in LV. There were hundreds of things that make staying here very special, luxurious, modern, personable... The list goes on and on. Some common interests as follows:Location: Really couldn't get much better. Located next to Time Warner Cable arena, it is a one minute walk to what I consider to be the intersection of the heart of Uptown. We were never winded walking back to the hotel after touring the city, and felt very safe.Hotel Character/Room: Super modern and boutiquesh. The basic non-suite is even equipped like an upscale New York apartment that includes a kitchen fully stocked with tools (even a damn cheese grater!), living room area, cloud like king bed, gigantic closet, and updated bathroom area. An amazing value considering all you get in your stay.Staff/Amenities: Staff was mostly great, with the exception of the front desk people who are always chaotic, confused, and hard to get a hold of. Their performances were outweighed however but the AMAZING bar staff. James in particular could not have made the bar service better. He made friends with everyone, each night we were there. He is polite yet personable and extremely accommodating. The bar itself is a great feature of staying here. The food is incredible. My adult grilled cheese with chicken and bacon one night and cone fries with chipotle sauce were so savory. Breakfast: I have to include this separately because their COMPLIMENTARY breakfast should retail around $15 per head per day. This was well worth the stay by itself. The food is A++ and has everything you can think of, including the best cheese grits ever. The woman who makes the made to order omelets is the boss of quick cooking! Best omelette I've ever eaten.The only thing that bummed me out was upon check out. I received a bill that included a $22 per day for valet that totaled up to around $100. When I booked, I used the Hyatt House website specifically because there is a ""Park &amp; Stay"" offer if you book through them that waives the daily valet fee, or so it appears. Otherwise, I would have used another website that would have saved me more money in the grand scheme of things. The woman at the counter had no idea what I was talking about, so I showed her on my phone. The only stipulation reads about the booking dates which mine was well within. She had never heard of this offer so had a supervisor come to help. He seemed extremely confused, but then told me I must have just booked through the website without using the offer. I proceeded to check, and sure enough the offer page and the regular booking page both lead you to the same site! The supervisor couldn't not offer an explanation, apologized professionally, and left even though I said ""I don't understand this"". I now have my doubts as to whether or not this waiver even exists or if it's just worded so cleverly on the website to appear like you're getting a value just by having valet service. I was confused, they were confused. If anything, the mobile version of Hyatt House needs a close looking at and perhaps a revision.Despite the surprise charge, I would stay here in a nano second! The hotel is exceptional in so many important ways and we loved coming back to it every night.This is our second stay at this location. So far this is our favorite Hyatt. Staff is super friendly and answer with a smile. Location is great. Nice view overlooking Trade Street. Rooms are clean and put together. Free Breakfast in the morning. Just perfect.The best hotel I've ever stayed in!The design/decor is VERY contemporary.  I was in awe from the start.The Service - was great, the receptionists in front were VERY polite, and very helpful.  During the complimentary hot breakfast, everyone nearby was incredibly helpful.  They took dirty plates out of my hands very quickly, and asked to bring me things that I could get on my own!  The bartender was also very kind.Hot Breakfast - was delicious.  I couldn't believe the quality in this free breakfast.  There's an omelette station, a yogurt bar, a coffee station.  What more can you ask for?The Room - was amazing.  I felt like I was in Barney Stinson's apartment.  Very fancy, very modern.  The TV was 42"", with several HBO channels.  They have a full kitchen also!  The Location - was perfect.  It's near the bus station, near the light rail, and you can get to the Airport on the Sprinter very conveniently.  Also, you're right in Uptown, Charlotte.  Worked out well.Great hotel!  Five stars!!!I had a wonderful stay at The Hyatt. The rooms are fab and nicely decorated.  You feel like you're at home, because the ""rooms""  feel like a condo with a full kitchen, separate living room and bedroom, and a huge bathroom. The lobby, bar, dining and pool area are clean and well tended to. The staff was also super friendly and chatty which I always appreciate. As for the location, The Hyatt is in a perfect location and within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and bars. I'd definitely stay here again and would recommend to a friend!","This hotel was formerly named Hotel Sierra before it was acquired by Hyatt. Stayed here during a business trip to Charlotte and was absolutely blown away by this place. I had low expectations as it was listed as a 3 and half star hotel, but the experience turned out to be anything but.Upon walking into the lobby I was greeted by some of the friendliest staff i've ever come across in a hotel. The lobby is one of the most modern I've sen at any hotel. Very new age and has a lounge feel. When I got to my room, i was shocked to see that everything in the room was brand new and spotless. It came with a full kitchen equipped with a stove, family size refrigerator and microwave. There was a 32 inch plasma, brand new couch and  one of the most comfortable hotel beds i've ever slept on. The location is perfect as it's located right in the middle of the uptown area and is actually right across the street from the Charlotte Bobcat arena. I was able to walk to all meetings and restaurants.This hotel is truly awesome. I sincerely hope they stay on top of their game because I will certainly be staying here on my next trip to charlotte. This is a must stay if you're going to Charlotte!One of the best small hotel experiences ever.  The vibe is slightly boutique-ish but not at all stuffy.  Here are some of the highlights of my stay.- Reasonable price per night for what you get.  See next bullet point.- Free breakfast 6-9am!  And not just any breakfast... bacon, eggs, sausage, french toast or pancakes, omelette bar (!!!), fruits, yogurt, cottage cheese, cereal, pastries, oj, apple juice, coffee, and tea.  Very impressed!  It is located right in the dining room in the lobby.  A great way to utilize the lounge area in the morning.- Trendy and modern decorations.  Very young.- Close to everything in Uptown Charlotte.  If you are going to take the NBEO Part 3 this is great because you won't have to worry about breakfast and the walk is close by.- Epicenter is across the street.  Plenty of food options and shopping.- Front desk staff was so nice!  Always greeted whenever we entered or left.  It's the little things that count.I had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Charlotte.Stayed here for the first time on the night we attended a show at TWC Amphitheatre.  My wife and I both came away impressed with the entire experience.  The vibe is modern, the room well appointed with a kitchenette that included a full size fridge, microwave, two burner stove and the staff is really friendly from the front desk to the housekeeping staff.  We rode the elevator at one point with a member of housekeeping and she went out of her way to make sure our stay was going well, making us feel welcome, making sure we knew about the pool/lounging type area on the 7th floor.All in all Hyatt House rates now as one of our favorite ""getaway in town"" destinations.  It won't supplant the Ritz-Carlton on the list but that's apples to oranges.  Easily knocks the Omni and Hilton down a peg.This is my new favorite hotel. Everything I ever wanted in a hotel I found at Hyatt House. I stayed for the weekend. When you pull up to the front of the hotel there is no cul-de-sac. You have to pull up to the valet which is located in there parking lot on the side. That's fine, the guys were pleasant. Front desk greeted us with a smile and warm welcome. I was impressed by the lay out of the lobby. Trendy, chic and inviting. It's also where they serve the free breakfast. That is the icing on the cake. Not too many hotels in the city serve free hot breakfast. The breakfast staff was friendly and busy at making sure the food was stocked. You can order an omelette to your liking, real potatoes, sausage/bacon, grits, cereal, muffins, French toast, hot coffee/tea you can tell the breakfast was to my liking.Housekeeping always said Hello. The rooms were more spacious then a regular hotel room. It's set up like a studio apt. Love that they provided stainless steel appliances (fridge, dishwasher, oven, dish-ware, glasses, utensils). The sofa which is a pull out was comfortable, 42"" flat screen, tasteful carpet and drapes, very comfortable king bed w/ nicely colored linens. The room looked and felt so comfortable we did not want to leave.The hotel is right next door to TIme Warner arena. You can walk a few blocks to the Epic center. As a matter of fact you can leave your car park and walk to the various restaurants, clubs and the Blumenthal theater. Bravo Hyatt House. You sure know the meaning of hospitality. Looking forward to my next visit.Several of my friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party about a month ago and it was THE WORST customer service experience I have ever had. We had requested rooms side by side or at least on the same floor and upon arriving discovered we were on two VERY different floors not even remotely close. As part of our party was not in the area we called to ask if we may be able to switch rooms. Anita and Linda were both incredibly rude on the phone, beginning with ""I'm not going to spend time with you on the phone because I have guests in front of me"". They only got more rude from that point telling us we weren't listening and saying things like ""are you on property? I can't help you"". When we returned to the hotel we went to the desk to ask and were given the same answer. ""I will not change the answer you received on the phone"". In the morning once the staff had changed Skye was very helpful and happily switched our rooms so that we were next door to one another. That should have been an easy fix considering she quickly did it for us the next morning. The valets were very nice for the night staff started the trip off as a disaster. One of the rooms did not have an ice bucket or toilet paper and when asked to bring extra towels we never received them from the front desk or housekeeping. The rooms are very tiny so do not expect what you are paying for. I will not recommend this hotel.Hello friends,SIDE NOTE: we were here on 11/24/12 &amp; I'm just writing this review to give me time to calm down. This is one of my few low light reviews. We were surprised with a free nights stay on our wedding day. So naturally it was only a small amount of time here since I was the day of. 1st- the valet parking! We were in the middle of the street behind 2 other cars waiting to be acknowledged. After about 7 mins some guy walks out and begins the ""valet parking"" took way too long and seemed unorganized. 2nd- when checking in the front desk was very cheerful and knew our names. Cool. In talking to her she upgraded our room to the (I forgot) package/deal/room. Cool. We got to the room and was blown away. Very nice and spacious. The indoor pool was feet away (but closed).  After the long day we wanted to get undresses and changed to hit the streets. Well HERE'S THE 2 star Part. It went DOWN from there. All the way down. There was long blond hairs in the shower. On the couch. Dirty carpet. Some type substance on the remote control. Stains on the coffee maker. The bed had imprints in it that would make you think someone had been lounging on it before we got there. Bathroom floor was dirty. We called the front desk and told her (at this time it was a new shift. I think her name was Tina). We sat and sat for over 36 minutes waiting for someone to come clean.It took so long we forgot that we called. Called back and she acted as if this was news to her. Waited even longer. At this time I'm almost about to lose my religion. After all this is our wedding day. It was probably the worst night n a room (except for well... Ya know) I've had. The service was slacking from the ""valet parking"" to the guy finally cleaning the bathroom. Tub. Floor. Sink. Etc. I don't do bad reviews much nor often but THIS was the pits. Maybe on any other night but wedding night and the fact that they knew this made me loath this place. When checking out I was asked how was it. My answer was simply BAD!! I explained and asked for the managers info only to be told/giving some lame card with basic info. I haven't heard back from the management. See my pictures. Had this day not been one of my best in life, this experience would have made me go postal. WoosaaahhhThis was a boutique hotel and Hyatt took it over. It has some of the features of a boutique still with the services of a Hyatt. The decor is modern and fun, the lobby bar is small but nice and the meeting rooms were well appointed - the food and banquet services were great. I was staying here for a business event - the room was cute, had a small kitchen, living room and bed.. floor to ceiling windows and a nice view of uptown Charlotte.Only draw back is that their are only two elevators for the entire building, so when everyone left the meeting and was headed to dinner - we all wanted to go to our rooms to drop off items and then go back to the lobby and it took forever to get elevators.Great value. Rooms are amazing. Great beds. TV quality awesome with movie channels. Staff very friendly. Free breakfast and free wifi. Location great for restuarants and bars. Only downside was parking was valet only at $22 per night but eh. You get to drop it off and pick it up :) full kitchen with all that you need and nice bar at night. HicThere are few times I get the opportunity to endulge in a lavish hotel such as the Hyatt in uptown. This place really did have a great layout and great accomodations. Although I definitely paid for it ($320 for NYE), I did think that it was vaguely justified. Very comparably, a similar room in the Tropicana in Atlantic City had cost $600 the year before and the style of this room definitely had it beat. Although a mere 300sqft (?), had a full kitchen, full bed, full bath, and slight common area with enough space to fit a couch without being cramped. Lobby and bar are also very nice. Great location.Unfortunately it was not made aware to me in advance that my room fees did not incorporate the mandatory valet and associated fees, with any on-site parking. They do not let you park your own car in their garage. Felt great to get slapped with another $25 in addition to that room cost. Why they don't rope that in right off the bat is beyond me, other than to make thier rates look lower. Watch out for that.NYE was probably their biggest night of the year I'm sure. The computers kept crashing while trying to check in, and although the capacity for valet was overbooked, they seemed to be on top of it.I also hated needing the damn room key to operate the elevator. I had to go down to the lobby 5 times to bring people up to the room, from the 17th floor, mind-you.Overall, I really did enjoy my stay and would come back again I'm sure. Highly recommended. Especially if you have a AAA discount or Orbitz/ Priceline (not valid on NYE unfortunately).Super impressive!  I came here to hang out with some friends staying downtown for NYE.  I spent a lot of time in the lobby and it is a pretty nice lobby to spend some time in.  Not exactly sure when Hyatt opened up, but it is another great option if you are looking to stay downtown.  It is right next to Time Warner Cable Arena and well withing walking distance to the Epicenter.The rooms are pretty set up with a kitchenette set up and nice couch and tv area.  Felt very comfortable with a ""home-away-from-home"" atmosphere.  I'm liking the newer hotel designs where you just don't walk into a bed once you open the door.Hotel has it's own parking deck with complementary parking if you are staying there, otherwise there is plenty of street parking or lot parking around to park and then walk up to the lobby bar to meet people.I really, really love this place and everyone is always overwhelmingly nice (even the valet guys when I forget it's valet only and don't have cash to tip with...)  Extremely modern decor, yet homey and welcoming, and anytime I've asked for something, they get it for me, including a king bed over a queen without charging extra.  The pillows, beds, couches, and everything else are extremely comfortable and free wi-fi!  It's never been warm enough to test the pool but it looks really fun.  My only complaints: parking is valet only and it's $22/night (though it is right downtown), the food is pretty terrible and not vegetarian friendly, and the gym is kinda under-equipped (but this isn't overly fair since it's just a hotel gym, not a real gym - and it even provides warm towels so this is just me being picky.)  Since the only one of these complaints that's really legit is the food, it gets four stars - 4.5 if I could.The breakfast is amazing. Made to order omlette, potatoes, French toast, fruit, sausage links, cereal, pastries, OJ, apple juice, coffee.... Excellent! The room and service is great too! Def recommend!This Hyatt House is in a great spot if you want Uptown Charlotte. It's right next to the Time Warner Center, and fortunately, no games were going on, so no traffic or noise. Loved our room--super comfortable bed and a nice bathroom. Friendly staff though not so aware of the neighboring towns or activities. The majority of guests--the majority of Charlotte visitors for that matter--know where they want to go, and/or are there for work or specific, planned-out reasons.  Nice gym, small but nice pool. All day valet parking was $22 a night. A bit $$ but the convenience is worth it. Plus with hot breakfast, wifi and the gym included, it was more than fair trade-off. Area seemed relatively safe, but Uptown Charlotte is dead at night. Restaurants and bars are open, but no one in on the streets. All in all, this hotel was a good choice for our trip.Hyatt Bar has yet to disappoint me throughout all my visit but yesterday was an off day for the restaurant.   Order an order of wing (drumettes) and the second one I bit wasn't cooked throughly.   Since I was with a large party last night didn't want to state the obvious.   Needless to say a waste of money and killed my appetite immediately.   The Bartender has always been cordial with such a welcoming spirit I truly enjoyed his personality.  This isn't my first visit and won't be my last :) Just gotta keep those wings at a distance.We spent Saturday night at the Hyatt and really enjoyed the stay.  The hotel was clean, modern and upscale.  Perfect for the girls getaway that we chose it for.  A couple of items to note:  breakfast runs until 10am on weekends and they have a made to order omelet bar.  Valet parking is $22, but if you are willing to walk a couple of blocks, you can easily park on the street (for free on weekends).  You also have a full size fridge in your room, which was nice for chilling our Prosecco.Only a few little gripes:  as previously mentioned, there is NO sun at the pool.  There are also not chairs to lay down on, only to sit on.  They do not have Coca Cola for sale in the little convenience store, so if you don't prefer Pepsi, bring your own to keep in the fridge.  The location is right by the bus station, which makes it feel a bit sketch when you walk outside.  Lastly, there is a sign in the room that if you forgot a phone charger, they have you covered.  EXCEPT they don't have any chargers for Apple products.  All in all, it was a nice hotel and for the price I would stay here anytime I am in Charlotte.Very pleasant hotel experience. Sharply designed, generously sized room, nice view of the skyline, friendly service, good buffet. Only complaint: The gym is not up to the rest of the hotel's standards.I spent three days at the Hyatt House last weekend for business and I was very impressed.  My thoughts:  1. Everyone at the front desk was incredibly friendly.  Every time I needed a cab or directions they were extremely accommodating.  2. The breakfast in the morning is great!  The menu includes eggs, sausage, potatoes, grits, granola, fruits, baked goods and a variety of drinks.   3. The bar is very nice.  I had a great experience with one bartender and a decent experience with the next (she was extremely slow and didn't really pay attention to me).  The wine list isn't large, but the bar covers the basics.  4. The bar/room service menu is great!  I had an awesome harvest salad and my brother had quesadillas.  Bomb.  5. My room was AWESOME.  The room had a living room kitchen, bedroom, large closet and beautiful bedroom.  The rooms are renovated and extremely chic.  Also, my bed was insanely comfortable.  6. The location is spot on (next to Bobcat arena).  There was some Disney show playing when I stayed there so about every 6 hours the streets were covered with kids.  Other than that, the hotel is next to a ton of shops, bars and restaurants.   Overall I had a great time.  There is a ton of construction going on in front of the building (the only down side), so beware.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!I have tried the one bedroom and the studio... one for the holiday and another for the Panthers game and enjoyed my stay both times.  Next to Time Warner arena so took my little brothers to their first game and is also convenient to Bank of America stadium.  If you want a central location, I'd recommend considering this hotel.  I'm not one for room service or hotel food, but the desserts were delicious.  Tried a few bites of a friend's lava cake and had to grab one for myself before checking out.Nice new property, very helpful friendly check-in, speedy valet. Great location. Our room was very cozy, clean and had a small kitchenette. Comfy king bed, huge flatscreen, easy to use remote, quite. Outdoor pool was very small. Our best meal in Charlotte was the complimentary breakfast they serve in the restaurant/bar. Omelets made to order, bacon, grits, cereals, donuts, coffee and all the rest.Pay in advanced rate was $180.Nice hotel option. My first choice is another hotel which is typically sold out. Hyatt House is my next choice. Great rooms, bed is comfortable, modern style and clean. Food isn't bad and worth  the price. I'm not too thrilled that the hotel is so close to the bus station, but still is convenient as only a 3 block walk to the office.","Great hotel in a prime downtown Charlotte location. The rooms are large, the hotel has all the amenities and the staff is very friendly. Modern styling, and a great bar!I really enjoyed my two nights' stay here while I was in town for work. The room was cozy with a little kitchenette.I was happy to find a coin laundry on the 7th floor as I had been on the road for over a week and needed to wash a few things.The staff were friendly and helpful.The hotel is in walking distance to so many bars and restaurants and a CVS. Since I didn't have a car, it was very convenient for me. There is also a bike kiosk not too far from the front door on Trade St.I would definitely stay here again.Overall we enjoyed our stay here last night.  The construction out front is a tad annoying but I understand that the hotel can't control that.  The valet seems completely unnecessary, $22 to park my car in the parking deck of the building I'm staying in seems odd to me but maybe I'm missing some liability issues there.  As for the valet, it seems like they could use some better peak staffing, had to wait in a line while one kid tried to wrangle the 4 guests in front of us also trying to check in single handed; thankfully getting our car back when needed wasn't as difficult and they were pleasant.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, no complaints there, also no complaints on location, it's just a short walk to all sorts of entertainment and dinning.  On to the room, it was clean, had all the necessities including a lovely kitchen area fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils, even toaster and cheese grater.  The bed however, I can't believe was actually a king size bed, we have one at home and this seemed smaller to us, not a huge deal, but certainly not what I was expecting after all the other positives here.We stayed at this hotel to take part III of NBEO. Discounted to $137/night after tax. - Take the bus. There is a bus that got us from the airport to the hotel and back. one way is $2. bring exact change. Comes every 30min. Check website. Take CTC. - If you don't want to take the bus, I believe they have car service at the same rate as a taxi, but fancier since you'll be in a nice leather seated SVU. - Walk to NBEO. 10min. Travel down trade and make a L on College St and when you see the BB&amp;T, enter and go to the 20th floor. - Free breakfast from 6am-9am daily. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, meat patty, potatoes, and fruits. Pretty good. Chef makes omelet for a tip. - Small but nice pool. No spa. 7th floor.- Great gym. 7th floor.- Complementary computer use and printing. - Double queen: Flat screen, mircowave, fridge, boring view, coffee maker, free toothpaste. Comfortable bed. Lots of pillows. - Right next door to the Time Warner Arena. Go Bobcats!- EPICenter nearby to relax n grab food and drinks- Friendly staff. Always happy to say ""enjoy your stay"" and ""we're please that you're staying with us""I came to Charlotte for a conference and needed a place to stay downtown (or, Uptown, as it's called).  Hyatt House's location was ideal, the price was good, as were the reviews.  I booked a King studio suite which came with a mini kitchen that had a full size fridge, a microwave, and a small stove and dishwasher.  The cupboards are stocked with dishes, pots, and pans.  This alone makes it a great choice for anyone wanting to cook in the room or who is staying for an extended period of time.In the room, the decor is somewhat modern, with lots of gray and white accented by purple.  The bed was very comfortable, but the pillows were not - they would 'deflate' overnight, meaning they were too flat by morning but too puffy to stack up at night.  The bathroom is nice, with a huge and functional shower - the only complaint here is that there are no drawers in the sink vanity, just two open little cubbies, so you can't really put anything 'away'.  In addition to the usual soaps, etc., they stocked the bathroom with a small tube of toothpaste.  The living room has a couch and a coffee table/ottoman, plus a writing desk.  There is no safe in the room.Notes about the hotel in general: the staff were all friendly and helpful, check-in was smooth, and smoking is not allowed.  There is a free breakfast each morning which generally consisted of eggs, some kind of meat (ham, bacon, etc), potatoes, grits, an assortment of pastries, fruit, cereal, coffee, tea, etc. and an omelet station.  Also free is the wifi available throughout the hotel and the business center where you can use their computers to print your boarding pass, etc.  The location is ideal, near the Epicenter and almost across the street from the  bus station.  There isn't much of a view, since across the street is a parking lot, but I suspect few hotels in Charlotte have anything approaching a view.Overall, I enjoyed my stay here and would do so again - especially if I pack my own pillow!I like staying here in Charlotte. Even though it is close to the arena, it is still quiet. The staff is incredibly friendly and even the valets called me by name.The omelette bar is solid in the mornings and the coffee is always hot.  Come early on the weekends as Saturday morning can get a little nutty, especially if there was a game the night before.I had the pleasure of statying at the Hyatt House hotel on 2/14/14 to 02/16/14 when I attended our ACN International Training event. The hotel accommodations were absolutely amazing.  It was literally within a couple hundred feet to the Time Warner Arena. The food was divine. You could get a hot or cold breakfast before you left out. The staff was very friendly.  I don't want to be selfish so I had to post on the great value. It was a great bang for the money. I will be back.This hotel is no help and clueless! I was getting coffee 6 feet away from my table and within seconds someone stolen phone off the table. The staff got very defensive. The front desk was no help. Hyatt has a policy of no cameras in the hotel just the exit. Very poor service and just awful people. Do not stay here!This hotel is very modern and so attractive. We stayed one night and wished we could stay longer. The valet parking is convenient (maybe over priced at $22/night) but was a nice amenity. The checkin process was easy and the staff was friendly. They did say checkin was at 3 but there wasn't a room for us until 3:15, but oh well. The room had a kitchen! Free wifi. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!!! The view was great. The best part was that it is next door to the arena so we could walk -- also a walk to epicenter. Very convenient. I would stay here again!!!This hotel is truly boutique quality. The absolute only amenity that it is missing is a spa. Not that I could afford a spa. But, just knowing one was here would make me feel that much fancier. That, plus the $22 overnight parking fee, gets it four stars. The location is just a smidge outside of the action.Horrible.  no room service after 11pm.... You offer and advertise a full bar? But after 11 a guest can order a crappy pizza and have it delivered to the front desk.  That is it?   Very very far from ANY uptown upscale hotel offering .Stayed here to take the National Board of Examiners in Optometry exam so got good negotiated rates. The testing center was less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself was very nice and had a great complementary breakfast every morning. They even have someone making omelettes for you!This hotel is quite simply the best I've been to in the US, no questions asked. This is as close to perfection as one can get. Yes, it may be expensive, but you really get what you pay for: great service, spacious rooms, amazing location, strong internet, fabulous breakfast (really, it was amazing), and everything being impeccably clean.Hands down the best hotel in Charlotte. I have stayed at a couple other hotels in the area for work and this is still my favorite. The hotel is super clean and very modern. The absolute best part is that you get a studio hotel room with a full sized fridge, stove, bowls and plates and utensils which are very convenient when you order takeout every night like me. If you're lucky you even get two tvs, one in the living room and one in the room. The rooms are very spacious and you definitely feel like you're in the comfort of your home. The beds are very comfortable and everything in the room just feels very new and modern. I went to the gym everyday during my stay there and it is always very clean and the machines never have any issued with them. Most of the employees are nice and personable. My hotel stay came with free breakfast everyday and the quality of the food was very good. It was not five star hotel food but was fresh and there was a good variety to choose from. Some of the rooms that face the side the sun rises from have an amazing view. I was lucky to stay in one of those rooms during one of the weeks I was there and the view was breathtaking! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It may be a bit further from the other hotels that are right next to restaurants and bars but this is only two blocks from the center of everything which is not bad at all!Absolutely beautiful hotel with extremely nice and accommodating staff!  Wonderful experience from check-in to check-out.  Room was very nice and clean with a mini fridge in case you bring your own food/drinks and a large flat screen tv.  The breakfast every morning is great compared to the usual hotel breakfast.  They even have someone making made-to-order omelettes!!  I highly recommend this hotel....great experience!",,"['place', 'really', 'treat', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'reasonable', 'price', 'suite', 'big', 'immaculate', 'nice', 'kitchen', 'area', 'couch', 'comfy',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/charlotte-marriott-city-center-charlotte-3,Charlotte Marriott City Center,3.5,$$$,66,"We came during the CIAA and they were doing rennovations.  The bellman &amp; conceirge staff was efficient as always. The rennovated rooms are nice and streamlined. Would have loved side tables on both sides of the bed. Only doen fall was our cleaning person, she forgot to leave some replacement items when she/he cleaned the room. (That took it down to 4 stars). Guest services were on point and responded quickly when we called. Will definitely stay here again.The lobby is on the third floor, with parking underneath.  Upper floors are being renovated.  It was pretty noisy throughout the night with various sounds.  They make a point of letting customers know about the renovations, but they also assure you that your room won't be near it either.  We were placed an an incorrect room at first, but they made it right the next morning.  We were relocated to one of the newly renovated rooms.  It doesn't seem like they were quite ready yet, but the rooms are definitely an improvement. The price is not bad for what you get.  There is no pool, but there is a small workout room and business center.  I think the hotel is by far not the best I have ever stayed in, but definitely not the worse.  Hoping for great improvements once the repair/renovation is complete.The location is great.  Very near to anything you might want to do or see.  Time Warner Cable Arena is a couple of blocks, as is the EpiCentre.  This is reason enough for me to return here.Admittedly, I was concerned  that the hotel is in the middle of renovations.  They were very up front about the work, and noise it would cause.  There were even notes about when and where the renovations were taking place, and complimentary ear plugs haha!Our newly renovated room had two comfortable beds, a bench AND a sofa!   The onsite gym was very clean and had commentary towels and water.  They even have a laundry room with a free washer and dryer.Great location! This hotel is right in the heart of downtown.  It's two blocks from the Epicenter and close to plenty of restaurants and entertainment.This will be my new go-to for my Charlotte visits!Loved our stay here. Updated rooms are really nice. Love the sofa and table. Much more usable space even though rooms are on the smaller side. Bathrooms beautiful but door to bathroom is only semi-private with no lock. Look forward to coming back when renovation is complete.The hotel staff is great!  The hotel rooms, well lets just say that apparently Marriott now thinks that desks and desk chairs are not needed in a hotel room.   So yep, just spent my last night in a Marriott.  Simply unreal how this formerly customer centric company has fallen to be so mismanaged.I think that Marriott either does not understand why people travel or just how badly this is going to impact their business once people see they cannot even set up a laptop and get some prep work in before meetings.The ""New"" rooms are terrible. Linoleum floor that is so loud you can hear the people above you shoes/heels clicking!It's like a bad IKEA display in here. I stay at Hotels 150 days a year. For a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad.Terrible for business travel. No desk, no real work surface but an oversized TV tray. A lot of clunky furniture that is not useful but sort of modern. No desk type chair. To work you need to sit at a poor couch or sit under your TV. Which the bench under the TV is an absolutely terrible idea! Just a big box with a cushion on it. The side table is a large box with no apparent use but to fill space. Just a poor design all around. Definitely not for business travel.I won't be coming back to this hotel. Stinks since I am points chaser!If it's a good price - it's fine!They are renovating the rooms here so hopefully it will be much nicer once it was done.  The room I stayed in was old and run down.  The biggest problem I had though was the paper thin walls.  You can hear everything going on in the hallways and above you and in the rooms next to you.  Water pressure in the shower was also horrible.  My biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff.  Everyday they were in the halls all day long yelling up and down the hallways.  Also, they kept using the door locks to keep the doors open when they stepped into the hallway and let the door slam on it each time.  Loud, Loud, Loud!  This was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem.While they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel.  No vending on any floors, temporary lobby, the bar/restaurant is shameful.  Go to the courtyard until the renovations are done, you will be much happier.You have to look past the current construction and renovation.  Rooms are nicely remodeled but they don't offer complimentary wifi nor do the TV's have High Def.  nice 60"" LG TV's but zero HD!  Why in 2015 are hotels still doing this?  Also, watch out for the garage exits, if you are walking back to the hotel you could easily unknowingly step right in front of moving car coming out of the underground parking.Wow! Right in the heart of downtown!Nice people, great service, helpful front desk people.Love the little breakfast cafe, good food there.Plenty of parking, very clean!A good location walking distance to Epicenter and Arena. Has a parking garage below the hotel. I had a room on the 11th floor which had a nice view. Beds and linen were comfortable. Nice flat screen tv. Room service was quick and food was decent. Shower had big shower head but not much room to put anything like soap or shampoo. Clean, comfortable and quiet.The staff in their housekeeping department are NOT HONEST and they took whatever valuable you left in your room. I stayed in this hotel almost every week from November 2014 to May 2015 when I traveled to Charlotte for work. I lost an iPhone charger when I stayed here in February and they said they couldn't find anything in the room. I didn't make it a big deal but in April I lost my favorite blouse in this hotel and still they said they couldn't find anything. At first they told me I could file a claim to get a refund but then they refused to do so saying that I have no proof to show that I lost my stuff there. Two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel. I really liked the staff in the concierge lounge and the staff at the front desk. But I strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are NOT HONEST. I am a Marriott Platinum member but I will avoid staying in this Marriott again.I switched to the Westin during my last week in Charlotte and that is a way nicer hotel! And it's even cheaper than the Marriott. I would definitely recommend staying in the Westin.Barely one star here. Ongoing construction huge inconvenience. Rooms are poorly designed. Faux wood floor makes everything echo. In fact faux wood furniture all around. Entry doors can be heard down the hallway. All this for $300 a night. Never againI had a great experience. The valet was very nice at the door and as soon as I walked in, I only waited a few minutes before someone came from the back to greet me. I did a mobile check-in with early check-in request. The rooms were ready when I arrived and checking in was very efficient and smooth. The parking garage is a little tight but no problems parking overall. The rooms were very clean- Mileena did an excellent job! I was disappointed that there was no refrigerator or free wi-fi in the room and the bathroom was a bit cramped but it was still clean and sparkling! I enjoyed the stay. This Marriott is usually my number one choice when I come to Charlotte!We stayed here for a wedding in September. The hotel is super convenient bit other than that there is nothing super special. The WiFi was almost an additional $13 a day,  which is a crime when your guests are paying 200+ a night. I travel all the time and the fee is usually $5 per day, if it's not complimentary. The sun deck off the pool area is directly facing office buildings,  which is kind of awkward if you want to lay out in your bathing suit. The buildings also tower above and block the sun for most of the day. The pool was not heated, which is great when you have no sun to help you warm up. And last but not least, our room stunk of mildew...We love the Marriott because they are usually in great locations and are clean. They belong to a nice corporation. We only stayed at this Marriott for a night. Checked in around 11pm. The guest service was awesome as usual. The room a/c didn't feel cool enough but granted we came from Northern Virginia where heat wasn't turned on at night. But it's a perfect location. Within a couple blocks of restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here on weekend getaways again.Hotel is ok. Room was just ok. 6th floor and can definitely hear the street below me. I got an excellent suggestion for dinner at a place around the corner. One big downfall was that I called last night for the restaurant breakfast hours and was told it opened at 6:00. I planned the start of my day and morning calls based on this. And, you guessed it, when I got there at 6:05 was told they don't open until 6:30. When I told them I had called to check, they didn't apologize. It didn't seem they cared at all that I was given bad information.Terrible service. Under construction and when my room wasn't under my name, they didn't have the systems to even let me in. MAJOR FAIL. Not to mention the banging; the inappropriate lobby, bar and closed pool. Not okay on any level, even when it's done I would expect shady service.This is our go-to hotel when visiting Charlotte because we love to park the car and have an uptown/metropolitan weekend. It is in close proximity to all the places we want to go! The hot tub, patio, cigar bar, amenities and staff attention are why we stay loyal.Thank you especially to Teresa, in housekeeping, who persistently took on the task of returning the clothing I left behind in the closet. She called several times  and went out of her way to be sure I received the correct items in a timely manner.We can't wait to return for a little R&amp;R again soon!Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in-room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. Walking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. I always sleep like a a baby.","Charlotte Marriott city center is a nice hotel located in the perfect part of downtown. They have a decent sports bar and a good restaurant with reasonable ""hotel restaurant"" prices.Many decent clubs and high-end restaurants are within walking distance.The rooms are comfortable with a large desk for working. +lots of plugsShower is hot, a good thing, and towels are soft and fresh. (I only mention this because some hotels have a strange chemical smell on their towels after being washed)Friendly, southern staffI love this location. They have the best concierge lounge hands down. I've stayed a quite a few Marriott brand hotels and have not been to a hotel with a concierge lounge as good as this. The rooms are comfy and great customer service. The location is awesome!Stayed here for one night. Relatively quiet and still in the middle of Charlotte. Room didn't have much of a view but that's fine. Although when I woke up the next morning, I realized that there were stains on the bedsheets that were not from me...glad I didn't notice them before I fell asleep.Weirdly low ceilings as well.A solid choice if you want to be in the middle of everything. $16/day parking that is charged to the card you provide at checkinI booked this hotel for the 2014 ACC Championship game. I thought that this hotel, as a host hotel for the game, would offer options for dinner after the game. Wow, I was wrong. We got back around midnight to a line st the only open restaurant where we heard last call was most likely before we could sit down. We decided to try room service... What a mistake. I called the front desk and was told they stopped room service at 11. Wow, 11 closure on a night when they knew most guest would not get back until later. I talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all. His answer was to order pizza. I found all of this very unacceptable. I'm a Platinum Member of the Marriott Rewards program, but I can say I will not stay here again after the lack of preparation they had for game that started at 8:00 pm.Stayed here for a few nights recently. Overall, it was an ok experience. Just another business hotel. Room had a strange smell upon entry that you just got kind of accustomed to after some time. Some ventilation would be awesome. The thing that really blew my mind in a negative way was the fact that the track that the curtain was on didn't cover the whole length of the window. So it was inevitable that your curtains would be open all night letting in the bright lights from the city. This I did not like. Another little pet peeve was that the bathroom was cramped. They should really think about putting the door on a sliding track bc it just doesn't work opening into the small space. I was on a pretty high floor so I had a nice view, and everything you would want to get to in downtown is walking distance. The location is really great. I also really liked that the hotel put out little sugary snacks over the course of the day up at the front desk. It was a nice touch. On my last morning I was out the door before the Starbucks opened and the guy behind the front desk was really nice to get me some coffee before they put it out for the morning.The guy in the 18th floor concierge really is a bad apple.  It reflects poorly on the entire hotel.Not the best Marriott but certainly fine. The Sports Bar needs to be replaced with something cooler, more hip, not just a tired enclave for business people but a destination as the beer selection is limited as is the wine listStayed only one night for the Belk Bowl and it was a comfortable &amp; good night. The hotel is very nice &amp; the reps were all hospitable. It is always a relief to be met with a genuine smile when I get to my destination. Our room was clean &amp; comfortable. I slept like a baby &amp; didn't notice any city noise on 10th floor. Breakfast was delicious. I had the traditional French toast...so yummy! Thank you Marriott for another good experience.Stayed here for a management trip with my work. The hotel is semi updated, the lobby is very nice and the room has nice furniture mixed with some old carpets and decor, Bathrooms were very basic with bare minimum amenities. Nice flat panel tv with all the basic cable channels. They didn't have a fridge in the room which was disappointing. This is located in the hart of downtown so its an excellent location to visit most of downtown Charlotte.What's good: tall hotels! Love em. Some nice view of uptown CLT. The fitness room is spacious and always empty...The folks are friendly to the point of ALMOST fawning, but not quite...parking deck is below the hotel and easy to get to.The not so good: my room was an adjoining room, so I can hear the coughing, shuffling, talking and flushing of my neighbor next door. I can't imagine what he's hearing of me...The perplexing: someone on a megaphone at 2am shouting something on the streets of CLT. No no no no no no no. I cannot do that....The Hooters across the street. Classy, uptown.This Marriott is in a great location if you have business in downtown Charlotte and they have done a good job of keeping it up to date and providing value for the money. Parking is not the greatest, but this is downtown in a major city.Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.I recently stayed here because the conference I was attending was held here. In terms of accommodations -- this place was very nice! The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping service was just great. I have to say, the staff really went out of their way to make sure everything was smooth, from check-in to check-out. (They even have a luggage service, attended by helpful staff.)The hotel was in a great part of town too -- it was within walking distance of Epicentre which has a lot of restaurants.If I were in the area again, I'd definitely consider staying here again.Went here for a conference/meeting. The hotel is at the center of the Charlotte business district. The location is perfect and there are lots of interesting restaurants to visit around the hotel. The rooms are fairly modern. Nothing fancy, but quite OK. The bathrooms are a bit outdated. The beds are quite comfortable. The noisy from the hallways is ridiculous. On a Saturday night you can hear all the parties taking place. They really need to isolate the rooms better for the noise. There is even a sheet of paper in the rooms related to ""non-disturbance policy"". Clearly the hotel is aware that they have a problem:-)The staff is not very attentive. They seem indifferent to everything. The door man could not be bothered to pick up my luggage, .... Just not the kind of service you expect from a Marriott.What's that smell?Not sure if it is me but the rooms in that hotel have a weird smell very noticeable when I show up on Sundays. Some kind of wet used socks flavor ... I guess I get used to it and get less affected the rest of the week. Besides that, nothing really fancy or weird about that hotel ... just another full service Marriott. The breakfast for those with lounge access is pretty good though and the attendant is really nice! I like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday.A big thank to the night shift for going the extra mile and moving us to a conference room and providing refreshments after seeing us struggling in the lobby at 2AM trying to complete a deliverable while they were cleaning up.Rooms were clean and front desk staff was very friendly. I went for a professional conference, so we had complimentary continental breakfast daily (bagels, croissants, fruit, yogurt, pastries,cinnamon rolls, juices and Starbucks coffee) very good.There is a Starbucks in the lobby (a definite plus) along with a quick shop store, 2 restaurants and a cigar lounge. The indoor pool and jacuzzi were also nice and looked very clean. Cleanliness is my top priority and this place definitely has that!CAUTION! Beware of Champions Sports Bar in the lobby. Horrible food and service.(See my review for Champions)First, my disclaimers...  I have a pretty negative stance on tobaco smoke; especially cigars. I'm here on business from Oregon and not only don't smoke cigars, but it wouldn't dawn on me that a hotel would support a cigar bar.  But then, this is the South, and we're in tobacco country (sadly).  I'm a public health professional, and am pretty mortified that the National Association of Public Health Institutes would choose to hold a conference in a hotel that not only had a cigar bar, but reeked of stale cigar smoke.  But, to give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure they never thought to ask.So, you get where this is going, right?  Walking into the hotel, it smelled stale.  They sent me to a room (on the 8th floor) that smelled totally moldy - I kept wondering if they had been involved in a flood - did Hurricane Sandy hit here?  I thought another room might help.  The second room they sent me to was either occupied, or someone had decided to have their dinner there.  I asked for a third.Room three doesn't smell much better.  Again, stale and moldy.  But I finally got it - it's the entire hotel.  The elevators reek from old cigar smoke, and the entire building is permiated by this acrid odor.  I can't wait to hear what the public health people have to say about this tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I have to tolerate being in this building for the next two days.  And I already have a headache.  The things I put up with for my job...It is a bit over-priced for the quality of the rooms. But, still very clean with a friendly staff. There are several accommodations like bars, restaurants, pool/spa, and complimentary breakfast. Valet is not included ($24.00/day). Overall, it's a good hotel and right in the center of Charlotte uptown area.This review may be slightly biased, as my stay was paid for using a hotel reward that was soon to expire.  You would think a reward stay...not really paying...so they will treat you poorly...um, it was not the case here!Atmosphere - large, central to the hustle and bustle of the city, well appointed rooms, clean, busy.Service - Despite booking my expiring reward less than 48 hrs before use and despite there being a big college game in town, I was treated as though I was paying full price for my free room.  Upon arrival, I was asked if I had checked in as parking was at a premium.  Upon seeing me on the guest list, I was immediately sent into the parking garage.  At the front desk I was greeted by a lovely and smiling girl who informed me that they had upgraded my room to the concierge floor and that I was entitled to a free breakfast in the morning.   Sweet!!Room - The room was awesome! It had an iPhone/ iPod compatible radio, rob, LED reading lights, and a great view of the city.  Plus more pillows than I would ever know what to do with...like 4 rows of them!?!Breakfast - It was a full Continental breakfast w/ an omelet station.  I really liked the breakfast bread pudding w/ strawberry preservers (made two trips).  Overall - I had a great experience in the CLT using my expiring reward and was treated like I was on a vacation far from home (not the actual 20 mins).If I ever need a place to stay in the CLT, this will be my first choice!Marriott City Center is the host with the most! Beside the Westin this hotel has all the happenings. This is by far one of the best Marriotts that I have ever stayed in based on comfort, entertainment, location, and amenities. Starbucks check, by now those of you who read my reviews should know that SB is a symbol of civilization that comforts me when I am away from home. Friends know old lady Toya will be getting a basic tall coffee to kickstart a day of activities. This one is complete with Charlotte souvenirs, pickled jams, and veggies from local farmers-nice idea. The gym was clean and all the equipment was new. I'm talking about USB ports in the elliptical machine new! I worked out 2 days in row and the 2nd day I got into the whirlpool, which was big enough for about 10 people. Pool great for laps, lemon water, lockers, fresh towels neatly stacked, attendants on hand. Nice workout area. The Cutter's Cigar bar which I talk about in a separate review and Champions Sports bar with lots of TVs and good lookin men standing around in grape clusters. Too bad you can't pluck one when while you with one. (Just jokin)The hotel breakfast was very good, complete with brunch buffet or seperate selections. All the usual stuff belgain waffles, omlette stations, hot cereals, breakfast meats, All for a very affordable price about $10-15.The rooms were comfortable, the first time my bed ever had too many pillows. All your electronic docking stations available, a nice view of the city, large sink, huge chrome shower head that could rinse a small elephant (luv those), but oddly enough no fridge.Through out the weekend the hotel gave little hospitality gatherings, its rumored they had free drinks. This is a great place to stay, getaways to hotels like this keep me sane.","I'm really starting to rack up those Marriott points now.  I can't even remember all the Marriott's I've stayed at, but I do remember all the good ones.  This one is definitely in the top 10.  The location couldn't be better, and although the building seems a little old, the rooms were typical of the more modern Marriotts.  What put this one over the top was the Concierge Lounge on the 18th floor.  Most lounges are simple, bare-bones and offer only just enough.  The lady who ran this did a wonderful job of keeping things stocked and clean.  She even made a pretty good smoothie (healthy too) and offered plenty of fruit for breakfast.  They even had San Pellegrino.  Too bad Kristin wasn't there to take it all.4 stars for the best Concierge Lounge of all the Marriotts I've been.  The rest of the hotel is basic and room service did an adequate job.  The normal rate (over $200) is a little price, but the location is very central.Valet = $18, self-park = $12This is a nice hotel with reasonable prices.  It's walking distance to almost everything uptown.  There are two restaurants and a Starbuck's on the property plus several more on the block.  Clean rooms, but the shower head was way too low for someone who is 6'4""..The room was sufficient although were only able to get 2 double beds due to a lot of weddings.  The only thing that would have been nice was a fridge, but other than that, everything was good.  It definitely pays to sign up for the Marriott Rewards program.  They also have a nice, clean indoor pool and hot tub with a decent fitness room.  The website said there was a charge for internet, but it was actually free.The Marriott City Center has a great location close to everything. The rooms have been recently renovated and the restaurants and bars in the hotel do a nice job. The rooms are ""Marriott practical"" meaning that all the things that you need to have a successful trip whether business or pleasure are there. Nice work area with plenty of outlets, but they still charge for an Internet connection ($12.95 per day), sweet bed linens (if you like them alot, you can purchase them through a catalog in the room) and a bathroom stocked with Bath and Body works products. There is a HD flat screen TV in the room and a dock for your iPod but missing was a mini-bar which I thought was a standard in Marriott rooms. Oh well. . . . .no Pringles and beer for me! But what pushed this to a 4 star review for me was the high level of service that I got during my stay. From the moment that I checked in I was taken care of. My room reservation and keys were ready to go when I got there. They lent me an umbrella to stave off the snowstorm that was raging outside. I was greeted at every turn by management and staff alike and room service even ran back downstairs to get me a straw when my Bloody Mary came without one. Every one was courteous and polite. In the small points department, know before you go that the walls between the rooms in this hotel are not that thick. Trust me- I spent the night in the room next to the couple who was celebrating Valentines Day over and over and over again. Instead of ""getting a room"", maybe they should have ""stayed at home"". Yikes! Even the TV couldn't drown out their ""delight"" in having a king sized bed. Let's just say it sounded like they got their money's worth. That aside-Marriott's are a good choice for their consistency across all variables. I'll stay here again the next time I'm in the ""Queen City"".Rooms are very clean and the views are great.  The location is right in the heart of Charlotte and convenient to everything - easy walking!!When I give the Marriott 5 stars I am not saying this is the fanciest-shmanciest hotel on the planet where they only accept AmEx black cards and instead of a mint they leave a medium rare, black truffle-stuffed filet mignon on your pillow at night.  I'm giving this place 5 stars for 5 darn good reasons.  Quality of the facility, quality of service, quality of food, value, and location.We used the Marriott City Center for our wedding celebration (11/12/11) and Danijela Djukic took care of every single minute detail perfectly and on time.  The chef is great, and if you want to get truly inventive they will work with you.  All of the support staff at the wedding were phenomenal, the servers, bussers, barstaff, front desk, everyone.  Granted, this service wasn't anywhere near free, but compared to any other uptown hotel you cannot beat it.  Throughout all of the planning they took as much off of our hands as they could.  I guess the best thing I can say is they provided pro-active service instead of re-active repair.The suites are very nice, we had two for the weekend, one for us and the other we used as a hospitality suite.  Let's not forget the great views too.  Even though we may have been a LITTLE loud, they didn't seem to mind TOO much (I mean come on after the party it's the afterparty).The standard rooms are a normal uptown hotel room size, but they are updated, clean and convenient.The pool area is clean and is a great place to relax for a bit or stretch your legs on a treadmill. The location is perfect.  You are right at the ""heart"" of uptown Charlotte, the intersection of Trade and Tryon.  There are tons of restaurants in every genre in the blocks surrounding the hotel (be certain to try Dandelion Market on 5th - directly behind the hotel).  There are dozens of nightlife venues.  You can walk to Bank of America Stadium (Panthers), Time Warner Cable Arena (Bobcats), the Lynx Light Rail system, the Epicentre, NASCAR hall of fame, and a half dozen museums and culture exhibits.I cannot say enough about how impressed I was both the weekend of the wedding and throughout the process.  I am a fan and will recommend this to anyone who needs a large venue.Three friends &amp; I [all in our twenties] stayed in a hotel room here overnight. The decor is beautiful, and the service was quick and easy. The concierge gave us free covers into the local bars at the epicentre so be sure to ask. The room was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great price to stay downtown. It was a great hotel experience!I had such high hopes! The person who greeted me was wonderful and took care of my large bag and car. But my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak. In the hall there are mops and vacuums. Not a good sign. Is it tomorrow yet when I get to check out? This place is not worth the price!This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are good enough. The staff is friendly and there is a fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. So, why only 2 stars you ask? I'm traveling on business, like many people who come to this town, and I cannot come close to expressing my frustration with the wireless internet. ...........................Let me take a moment to calm myself.It's horrible. Paying per device seems silly when it's not uncommon for people to have a few devices, but that's not my biggest issue. My complaint is that I'm having to refresh my wireless connection every 3 minutes on my iPad. It's absolutely maddening. I wouldn't be as concerned if I were here for pleasure. The ability to work from my room is pretty critical when traveling on business. I've never had connection issues on my device, so I'm confident it's not the problem. Over the past two nights, I have spent more time waiting on/refreshing my connection than actual productive time online.For biz trip, this is a good location. For diversions, this is close to many restaurants, museums,  night life--- just walk. (I made a mistake of jogging, in the heat of the summer on another trip. NCarolinians will sit and watch you at a distance, eating their ice cream cones, wondering why the loco Californian would want to jog in that summer heat---it was like jogging in a sauna here). Hotel service was good. The hotel staff were nice and helpful.The Charlotte Marriott City Center hotel has a welcoming, helpful and friendly staff. The receptionist was very knowledgeable and informative about the places, events and what's happening around the area, a special thanks to her. Now, the rooms smell nice, have great soft comfortable bedding, a HDTV and good views of uptown from the high floors. Room service and housekeeping is fast and efficient which I appreciated. Asked for a late check-out and was easily accommodated with my request. I had no complaints spending my weekend stay here. This Marriott deserves a solid 4 stars.I have stayed many times in this hotel and have enjoyed it. The rooms are always consistent and clean, the staff is friendly, and the location is right in downtown Charlotte. Pluses: Location, Lounge (if you are a Platinum Member) which serves free breakfast and free appetizers and dessert in the evenings, clean rooms.Minuses: The Gym is small, although most of the equipment is in good shape, the views from some of the rooms aren't that great, downtown Charlotte is not very lively after 6PM unless you go to The Epicenter which is about two blocks away. The parking garage smells and so do the elevators that go down to it (Valet is a good option here).Purpose: for work, have stayed here quite frequently (50+ nights)Pros: - Check In: always pretty quick- Staff: friendly, attentive, and respectful- Concierge Lounge: the food is pretty good (i generally have pretty low expectations for the food served at the lounges) and the lady who works there in the morning and the guy who works there in the evening are such great, pleasant people. [I will edit this when I get their names.] Love the smoothies in the AM! Also, when the Concierge Lounge isn't open for breakfast on weekends, they give you vouchers for their AYCE buffet downstairs. - Bellboys: very attentive- Location: right in the center of Uptown (in my opinion) and close to my work area. About a 5 minute walk to a central bus station and I believe the train station is nearby. Less than 10 minute walk to the Time Warner Cable arena and not that far from the Bank of America stadium.- Early Check In: has been granted every time I've come in earlier than check in time.Average:- Clean &amp; Decent Sized Rooms: not expecting too much here as I really just need the shower + bed - Gym: Cardio &amp; weight room is decently sized (for a hotel). Their pool is a standard size. Yoga mats (+ space) are available. Open till 10/11 PM.- Restaurants: I've had decent food that I can pick up from the Champions restaurant, order to pick up time is consistent (~15-20 min). Cons:- Rooms: all rooms generally have the same layout / I have never been upgraded to a room that's bigger. I've only been upgraded to a room that's on a higher floor. Also, try changing rooms if you're given the rooms located underneath the concierge lounge. Starting at 6:30am, all you will hear are footsteps and chairs moving around. Lastly, beware if you request a room near the elevator as it's generally near the vending machine/ice room. When they're restocking the vending machine, you're going to have a hard time sleeping through that. - Occasionally, super loud people can be heard through the walls/doors (but this isn't really the hotel's fault...)- Occasionally booked solid during busy weeks in Charlotte (they host a lot of events and there's the annual basketball tournament)- WiFi: isn't free for non-Rewards members. Also, it's pretty slow for today's standard.- There were ~2 times where the fire alarm went off (not during the same stay though) for no reason (we were never told what happened).  Unexplored:- Parking- The other restaurant (not their breakfast room and not Champion's)...Overall: I always try to book my stays here if the rates are within my company's allowable ranges. I haven't had too many bad experiences and my complaints are pretty common across all hotels.Really nice hotel in the heart of things in Charlotte.  When I visited for my 2-night stay, they were busy, to say the least.  There were about 4-5 weddings staying there and they kept everything running smoothly and quickly.   Everyone that I came in contact with was friendly and attentive - everyone.  I didn't meet one hotel worker who was nasty or unpleasant.  I know that is what you should expect in the hospitality industry but still, it is rare.  I ordered breakfast via room service and it not only came faster than they had said but they actually called me to find out if it was ok and tasty.  It was and what was even more ok was that phone call.  I have never before experienced that level of follow-up. I also enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant which was lovely.  They were crowded so service was a bit slow but my server checked on me many times and updated me on my order.  I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind the leisurely pace that morning. I can even comment on the bell hops and taxi stand guys - they were quick to get me transportation and even negotiated for me with a local limo driver to take me to the airport for a lower fare.  Service!  Love it!  I would definitely stay here again when visiting Charlotte and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone in need of a hotel in the Uptown area.""Westin Charlotte - Sold Out""Drat.Onwards to the Marriott, the perennial B-team to the Westin.  The Marriott chain's focal point is the posturing of it's sheer monotony.  This particular Marriott is comfortable in the way that a baggy sweatshirt is comfortable in lieu of a form fitting Dolce &amp; Gabanna ensemble.  Not to say that this Marriott is devoid of luxury.  The lobby and accompanying restaurants exude an 'old-money', antebellum climate, lest we forgot we were in the South.  In the darkened whiskey bar where I dined, I could envision a group of WASPs, sipping bourbon and smoking cigars, musically chortling about tobacco and cotton commodities.  The rooms are suitable for the business class flier - acceptable bedding, a flatscreen television, and the always welcome alarm clock with iPod docking station.  Alarmingly, the hotel has yet to switch to an automated wake-up call system, so human interaction is required to do so.  This leads to the always amusing scenario of requesting a wake-up call of ""precisely 7:31am and 20 seconds.  God help you if you're a second late, I'm Platinum godammit!!""But the staff are extraordinarily gracious and accommodating, which could dissuade me from coveting the Westin the next time I return to Charlotte.  That, and there's a lot of goodness to be had in the proverbial, 'baggy sweatshirt'.Easily locatable with buildings all around.In the day time, food is easily accessible (night time, it's a little more difficult). There's a Starbucks and a bar within the hotel for some relaxation.Very attentive staff and gorgeous conference areas.When it comes to checking in to a hotel, I'm all about fast efficient service. Charlotte's Marriott City Center could be a role model for other hotel establishments. Valet parking, for instance. While many people prefer to self park, there are those of us who would rather not schlep our belongings across a dark parking ramp after a few hours worth of travel. I can appreciate the simplicity of someone waiting for you to open your front door, assist with your heavy luggage, and hand you a valet ticket, smiling throughout the entire exchange. Immediate recognition as you approach the front desk is key to happy patrons. I grit my teeth when I am left standing for a few minutes while staff members ""pretend"" not to see you while finishing up their previous business. A simple acknowledgement is always appreciated in such situations, but it amazes me how many times the front desk staff resorts to momentary ignorance. Not here though. Big smiles, and a fast, efficient exchange of information. After a quick run down of restaurant times, hotel updates and the fitness room location, I was on my way to my room. Marriott does well with creating a comfortable home away from home: comfy desk chair, ample desk space with plenty of outlets, and my personal favorite, the ipod docking station. There is something so nice about listening to your favorite play list while working away on your laptop. Bummed that wifi is not free (especially when my wireless card is having issues). If Panera Bread offers free wifi, I think a full service Marriott should too. Great location in the heart of downtown Charlotte, the City Center will be my first choice.Location, location, location is the number one rule when picking a spot to stay.  This is in a great spot in downtown or as the people of char would say ""uptown"". The parking is in a garage below the hotel and runs $20/night which is steep.  The bedding and rooms @ Marriott are comfy and clean.  My biggest gripe w this Marriott is with the scent that is used.  The scent is in the hallways and in the rooms.  I don't know what it is but it reminds me of an elderly persons home.  It has a funky smell.  I expect 4 stars w Marriotts and this one gets 3.I stayed here for a corporate holiday party that was held in their large ballroom and really enjoyed myself. The rooms were satisfactory and the suites were great for post-party gathering. The event itself was beautiful and the food was really great. I really liked the event space layout and the staff was phenomenal. Best of all, the hotel is so centrally located that we were able to walk to all the places we needed to go the next morning. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Charlotte.This is one of the better Marriott resort and hotels I have ever been too.  Let's start at the beginning.  For its money you cannot beat it.  Very reasonable prices and parking costs ($12) a night.  Easy access and plentiful.  Coming to the front desk I was immediately greeted by several folks who had me on their list and ushered me to a desk clerk.  Really made me feel special.  Service was fast and Sincere.  The rooms had that great ""hotel smell"" that  I was staying in a real class place.  The rooms were basic but nice. The sleep system is fantastic.Overall this was a solid 4 star experience.This property is by far the worst ""full service"" (if one can actually call it that) Marriott I have ever stayed in. The rooms and decor look like something out of the 1960's, water barely comes out the ancient showerheads, restaurants are terrible, poorly managed and the front desk can't even get a bill right. It really is a dump, and you can easily find better accomodations with several large competitors nearby.To give a bit more detail:The rooms have some kind of yellowed paint, beaten-down carpet and worn out A/C equipment. The bathrooms look like they've seen their best years decades ago....and the water drips out of the showhead (could barely get the shampoo out of my hair). The hallways look just as bad. Creaking old elevators complete the picture.Restaurant is actually a combination breakfast/dinner place. They call the dinner place ""Savanna Red""....what a crock. What they do is pull down some red wall carpets, and add a few bar stools to their breakfast restaurant to convert it to dinner each night! Speaking of breakfast, the buffet is tiny (like something out of cheap roadside motel) and there are not very many tables. Food is just ok...for breakfast. For dinner, walk out the front of the hotel and find another restaurant as there are dozens within easy walking distance. You will be glad you did, as the food for dinner here is somewhere between subpar and terrible. Oh, there is also a sports bar with even worse food, and service is non-existent (just try getting a drink.)And with the price being charged, the expression ""rip off"" comes to mind. The value for the money is not even close. This hotel badly needs to be remodeled, and the incompetent management gotten rid of and replaced with competent hoteliers","Really nice hotel close to everything in the uptown area. Most importantly it's away from the noise in the evening.Walk one block to all of the bars on the ave or Epic center. Epic Center area is really loud at night which makes this hotel ideal since its one block away from the noiseExcellent beds. Loved the pillows. One of the best sleeps ever. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown. Your are a short walking distance to all the attractions: Blumenthal Performing Center, Children and Mint Museums, Morton's Steakhouse.Another plus in my book: they have Starbucks on site. Guys and night owls will appreciate the intimate bar and cigar smoke saloon. Very classy, great selection and soothing music.Stayed here on a recent business trip.  Rooms are a tad small but you cannot beat the location - it is central to everything.  Overall - teh staff was friendly and the rooms, clean and the bed was comfortable.  What more could you ask for?I'm not a big fan of Mariotts (prefer Starwood properties), but this one is relatively new and certainly full of amenities. The location is unbeatable. Cigar bar at the lobby is pretty cool. But, the wifi speed is wimpy.What a pleasurable stay. All the employees are super nice. I love the unlimited long distance/local package included with Internet. The pool/jacuzzi and workout room are great and very empty. The beds are awesome, the pillows are great and room service is especially accommodating. My only slight problem was slowness of Internet connection. Wish I could give this place 5.5 stars! They deserve it!I have to say up front that I really enjoyed my one-night stay at the Charlotte Marriot City Center. The hotel was well kept and modern, clean and warm. Parking here is a breeze as they have their own parking garage which exit from is controlled by your room key. The lobby was excellent; check-in was fast and welcoming. The room was spacious though the bathroom a bit cramped. The work space was set up well and I could have easily worked from the room for a day if needed. Outlets were readily available throughout the room. The one issue I had was with the wireless service . . . it was horrible. Although it says I was connected I was unable to connect to the internet or send/receive emails via Outlook. I don't have the patience to call technical support for something that should be as simple as a wireless connection so I didn't bother.  Just a word of caution if you actually intend to work from your room.  All in all I would stay here again if I needed to.",,"['came', 'bellman', 'amp', 'staff', 'efficient', 'always', 'rooms', 'nice', 'streamlined', 'loved', 'side', 'tables', 'sides', 'bed', 'fall',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-charlotte-southpark-hotel-charlotte,Renaissance Charlotte SouthPark Hotel,4.0,$$$,64,"The hotel is very well decorated, well maintained.    They ample parking options with valet, outdoor and garage parking.   Many restaurants within walking distance.   The service at this hotel keeps us coming back.    Everyone in this hotel is just top notch.   Danny greets you with a smile and welcomes you like it's home away from home.  Lots of options on the bar menu and they always seem to change it up to add diversity.   Never ordered anything that didn't taste delicious.    Always look forward to seeing Kat at the bar.   She is the best bartender, knows us by name, knows our orders, keeps our glasses full.    Concierge lounge has lots of choices for breakfast, Ophelia does a great job in keeping the dishes full and cleaning tables so we have somewhere to sit on a busy morning.   Love the scrub in the lobby restroom, nice touch!Service is exceptional and keeps us coming back to the Ren!Horrible place. Stay Away. We booked and pre paid for our room at the Renaissance South Park a week out. We paid about 300 dollars for a king room. When we arrived we were told they had no rooms. Although they had two that were empty but those guests had already ""pre-checked in"" although the front desk became very vague when I asked how one ""pre-checks in"" We were told we had to get all our luggage and pack up again and drive down the road to stay at The Marriott. I asked why that she had two open rooms, I had already paid I didn't see a reason I had to leave. She keep saying the other guests had ""pre-checked in"" and that they made arrangements for us to stay at the Marriott. The Marriott is not the Renaissance. That a room at the Marriott was only 145 when I was looking on line, I paid a Renaissance price but now being forced into a standard Marriott. Complete bait and switch. The front desk said there was nothing they could do, period. They over sold. Never apologized for their bad bookkeeping skills. At this point a man walked by with his genitalia showing because his pants were so low. The whole situation was surreal as several other men came into the lobby wearing gang colors and similar dress. Staff seemed completely fine with dress and behavior.The front desk finally agreed that the rate was unfair and gave us a 100 credit. Which is still kind of a scam because of what happened when we arrived at the Marriott.So we left. At this point feeling uncomfortable with the tough clientele. The Marriott upon our arrival asked us to pay AGAIN! They said quote "" they made you aware of the 150 for the room, right?"" Yep. Trying to ft another 150 plus tax out of us. Complete insult to injury. Really? Asking me to pay again, and then even under cutting the rate the Renaissance had just charged me was just another slap in the whole process. Additionally nobody ever asked about my Marriott Rewards account. So at 9pm we finally get settled and what do you know? There is a party going on here on the 5th floor. Screaming, door slamming, falling into the doors all kinds of chaos. So what's my opinion of these two Marriott owned properties? Poor, I wouldn't ever recommend these to anyone.Stay Away.This is my favorite hotel in the South Park area.  The rooms are clean and the lobby is nice and updated.  The hotel has a full-service bar/restaurant that stays open late. They even have mini corn hole that you can play on the table tops at the bar.  The only downside about this hotel is that they do not offer shuttle service to nearby restaurants.  My company had a group of six staying at this hotel. We had to take Uber X to a nearby restaurant a mile away which ended up costing $45 round-trip. It would be nice if The Renaissance had a shuttle, inevitably people are going to want to go to a nice dinner close by and may not want to drive or may not have a car.Beautiful hotel with great amenities! Very modern look which looks amazing! There's a pleasant smell throughout the entire 1st floor which makes the place feel fresh &amp; clean!!One of the best hotels I've stayed at. I travel a lot for work, and from the doorman to the front desk, everyone was welcoming and offering suggestions for things to do and places to eat in the area. I even got assigned a room that gave me a good view of an event at the neighboring Symphony Park and could see fireworks from my hotel window. What a treat! The room was high quality and I didn't have any issues. That's saying a lot because I can be picky about the quality and comfort of the hotels I stay at. This place is a standout. Highly recommended!Good hotel in Charlotte. Nothing great, nothing horrible, nothing to complain about.My stay at the Renaissance has been amazing. This hotel has won the world's best Renaissance for customer service and I can see why. They've been more than accommodating on everything and super friendly. They were able to give us great ideas on what to do in Charlotte.Wonderful location, great service &amp; staff, excellent food!!Best tip about this place: the spinning top style chairs in the front lobby!Stayed here for 4 nights and the accommodations were over the top. Aveda bath products, sultry wood floors, amazing bar/restaurant in the lobby. I can go on and on. They were also nice enough to upgrade me to access the executive lounge for free breakfast in the morning; bacon, eggs, pastries, coffee and happy hour from 5:30-7 every night with complimentary wine, cheese, different apps every night such as orange chicken, potato chips &amp; onion dip.The staff was some of the most professional and sweetest people I have ever met! They also welcome you with an alcoholic beverage and bite of a different app every night in the lobby. I stayed there for business and had catered lunch everyday along with muddle of the day snacks. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.I would like to preference this review by saying that I have stayed over 140 nights in hotels this year. The Renaissance Charlotte Southpark is by far the best service that I have had in any Marriott property including Ritz Carlton's! The front desk staff always has a smile and will bend over backwards to help. The valet staff is what keeps you coming back over and over. I would recommend this to anyone the travels with any frequency or just having a night on the town.Thanks for making life on the road such a pleasure.Danny the cherry red caddy bell hop was awesome!!! So personable and assisted us way beyond what was expected! Please hire more like Danny!! Thank you and we enjoyed our stay.Overall nice hotel. To be honest, had I made the reservation myself, I likely would not have stayed here, but work made the reservation, and paid the nicely sized room rate for me. (I think it was around $300/night. Not worth it in my eyes.)The hotel is positioned in a corner of a very nice development. Plenty of restaurants and office parks in the general vicinity. In fact, some of our clients ended up being in the building that shared the parking lot!Rooms were clean, and the place was nice. There weren't a ton of places to sit in the lobby, but we always found a spot.I'd stay again - as long as someone else is paying the bill!I stayed here for 5 days last week, for work. The hotel lobby smells like a spa, which is definitely welcoming after a long day of travel. The salt scrubs in the lobby restrooms and the fruit infused water is a nice touch. The beds are comfortable, the rooms offer Aveda products and the hotel staff went above and beyond, my entire stay. I'd like to give special mention to Gabe Kaiser. I left an item in the cab to the airport and he was exceptional is assisting to facilitate having my item returned to me. I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.I stayed here in September 2013 and truly enjoyed my stay. The hotel is either new or very well kept. I stayed in a standard king room, which also had a desk, dresser, and lounge chair area. The place was quiet and the staff were extremely professional and helpful. But, what pushes a hotel up to the 5 star category? The attention they pay to detail! When I arrived, there were glasses with veggies and dip set out for guests, as well as many glasses of complimentary red wine. I took a veggie cup but passed on the wine - however, when I checked out early the next morning, I was very pleased to find a carafe of iced vanilla coffee in addition to the standard drip fare offered by Marriott properties everywhere. North Carolina is awfully warm in September, even at 6am, so it was a pleasure to be able to enjoy an iced coffee as I drove away. The property does have a restaurant including room service, though I passed on this in favor of a local hamburger place. Still, it's nice to have, especially if you are arriving late at night. Check out the photos I uploaded - perhaps they'll help you decide if this property suits your needs!This location was great, right across from the mall. + 1 starThe bed was comfortable with nice linens and comfy pillows + 1 starThe facility had great coffee available in the mornings downstairs + 1 starThe gym downstairs was small but had everything you could need + 1 starThe downstairs bar is nice and open late + 1 starThe walls are extremely thin and we could here every shriek and run of a child each morning around 6:00 a.m. - 1 starThe AC vent was at the very back of the room and would only go down to 73 degrees and it didn't feel like it cooled the rest of the room. (Ie. not fun trying to blow dry your hair while dripping with sweat) - 1 starOther than that, our stay was fine. A solid 3 star option, but I don't think we'd stay here again.In Charlotte for a graduation, we found this boutique hotel to be charming and extremely accommodating. We stayed in a standard room which was attractive, comfortable, and had numerous practical amenities. This included a minifridge, bathrobe, and the best coffee from an in room pot I've ever had. The lobby with fruit-infused water was lovely. The skylit lounge and restaurant beckoned guests with lovely low lighting, a gurgling fountain, plants, and comfortable seats. Though a limited menu, the food was very good and nicely presented. Best of all, the hotel staff from the checkin desk to the wait staff to the outside welcome station could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. Thanks Alan. We'll definitely be staying there again.This was an absolutely great hotel. The hotel is decorated beautifully with modern furnishings and the staff is friendly and helpful. -Someone always opened the door for me while entering and leaving the hotel. - nice bar area, with some additional private table seating- courtyard is so romantic and whimsical. There were several tables with outdoor gas fireplaces! (Next time I'm breaking out the s'mores!)- the club room served an excellent continental breakfast with perfectly ripened seasonal fruit, eggs and the best dang bacon ever (thickly cut bacon cooked to just the right amount of crispness), Starbucks coffee, soda, water.- the room was clean big and decorated nicely.- it's located in South Park which is near all the shopping areas and close to Charlotte depending on where in city.I would definitely stay here every time I go down to Charlotte! I just wish it was closer to my office. There is so much traffic in the morning on Tyvola Rd and highways. This doesn't have anything to do with the hotel but it might be of relevance if someone had a long commute in the morning.I have to say I almost didn't give this hotel a 5 stars, I also need to mention that I  have been a marriott rewards member for about 14 years now so when possible I try to stay there for there points..so let's get started. First of all this hotel has all the amenities you could wish for and the staff is friendly and great!. Regina our server for our event was fantastica!  All rooms have a minifridge,  and I loved that there were power outlets everywhere, even on most of the lamps. Something cool was automatic lighted closet when opening the door and you can't beat walking into your room and having the temperature preset to a nice cool 68 degrees, being it was so hot in North Carolina this summer. Little things that make a difference such as the towels inside the shower as well as having your shampoo conditioner and yes..even body wash ..all..Avena brand. ..make a nice touch. So you ask why I almost didn't give it 5 stars...well ,the first night I got up to go to the restroom the inside was pitch black, (I am sure myself as many other people do not want to turn on the light as it many times disrupts my falling asleep again) well sure enough I slammed my shin right up against that porcelain bowl....ouch! Still hurts as I write about it.....that being said , I did wake up last night around 3:00 am and was much more careful. ..but boy was I thirsty! I went to the mini fridge and there was a cold water in there.....wow...just got there star back...Great job guys!We only needed a one night stay because of our plans, but when we are back in Charlotte this will be my go to place to lay my head! The staff were so friendly. Kat, at the bar, was terrific at the cucumber and the Woodford Reserve martinis! The room was stylish and the bed so comfy! Thanks for a restful stay before our travels!This hotel was very nice and reasonably priced.  Everyday the lobby had flavored water and at night they stepped up their game with wine, champagne, cookies, etc.  always something different.  The front desk people were also very nice and pleasant.  Rooms were great.  Beds were soft, bathrooms were clean, and overall decor was great.  The only thing I noticed is that the hotel was a little cold (lobby and hallways). I did not mine but my family did.  The workout and pool area were fantastic.  Very nice for a hotel.  The one thing I did not like myself was the strong scents on the main floor of the hotel.  I had to sneeze a few times because of the strong scents!  I will definitely be back next time I return to Charlotte.","This is my new go-to hotel in Charlotte. Very nice hotel, very clean. Cute bar area in the evening with great atmosphere. Good size gym (a must for a large hotel). Room service was great, good food and coffee (as you all know I have a coffee problem lol). I don't usually like a super soft bed but HOLY CATFISH, the pillows, and bedding was like sleeping on a cloud. You literally melt into the bed and wake up in the exact same position, no tossing and turning! I just found out I will be spending a lot of time in this area for work and as long as they have availability I will be there! Book in advance as I just found out I'm going next week and the hotel is already sold out...next time I will be back here! Oh, and great location, close to mall, restaurants, Whole Foods, FedEx, etc.This hotel is in a great location right smack in the middle of metro area of Charlotte. Not downtown but only 15 min away. It's clean and affordable. You can walk to Piedmont center where they have several restaurants.I usually do not review hotels. But very impressed by this one . The location is great across from South Park mall . The hotel is very modern inside and fun kids loved the orange swivel chairs on shag rug. Room was very nice bathroom could use some more updating . Came in after long day and they had complimentary glasses of Chardonnay wine and very pretty cup cakes along with the infused water. Think this is a really nice touch and leaves a nice impression of going the extra mile and shoes care.I like the idea of the infused water in lobby and at the gym area but if it not replenished looks bad that it's empty needs more monitoring. Would stay here againWe chose this hotel as our block for our wedding and we had approximately 35-40 rooms.  Everyone raved about the customer service.  Our contact Lisa, was amazing with communicating with us before the event and even surprised us with a dessert tray.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  The amenities were great.  The bartenders stayed busy with us.  Everyone had a blast.  I highly recommend this hotel.Excellent stay during a very busy weekend! Everyone on the staff was amazing, but special kudos goes to Chelsea at the front desk and Amanda in the restaurant.Stayed here for one night while on a business trip. Very nice hotel and within walking distance to the mall with lots of shopping and dining options. Front desk staff was very friendly (maybe even a bit over zealous) and I was even offered a glass of champagne upon check-in. They automatically upgraded me to a nicer room, which was a pleasant surprise.The hotel was pretty quiet, but it didn't appear to be all that busy, so maybe that's why. My room was clean and plenty big. The work area was comfortable with plenty of plugs and lighting. Unless you are an Elite member, Internet access is $12.95/day. In this day of age, I would expect at least Wifi to be free, but sadly, it's not here. There was also plenty of plus on both night stands, which was also a very pleasant surprise. Plugs were very easy to get to as well. As for the TV, the premium channel here is HBO and you can use the StayConnect mobile app to control the TV. The room is equipped with a safe, small fridge, plus the usual coffee maker, ironing board, iron, etc. Bathroom was big and bright with a combined tub/shower, but the shower curtain is on a curved bar making the shower feel a bit less cramped. The sink area is within the bathroom, but there was plenty of counter space to put your stuff on. The bed is a bit on the soft side, so for me, my back was a bit sore in the morning. Due to the short stay, I did not get to use the fitness center, dining options, pool, etc. All in all, a very nice hotel and one that I would stay at again.I loved this hotel! My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and this hotel was the highlight of the weekend.  From the time we got out of the car we were greeted warmly by the valet. The front desk staff was amazing, friendly, fun, and professional.  Especially Raina. The entire hotel smells so refreshing and the decor is modern and vibrant. We stayed on the 7th floor in the executive suite. The only word to describe the room is amazing! It was very clean, had an awesome view of the city from the balcony.  The furniture in the sitting area was nice. And the bed was very comfortable. But the best thing in the room was the shower! I spent an hour in the shower and only got out because my husband forced me too.  We enjoyed breakfast in the club lounge that was pretty good. We will definitely be coming back to stay here again the next time we are in Charlotte.Hotel is lovely. I was treated so nicely from the moment I checked in until I reluctantly had to leave! Check in was flawless- had to request an early check in due to an early flight and this request was accommodated without hesitation. Walked up to registration desk and keys were ready- check in completed in less than 2 minutes. I had a club level room due to my Marriott Rewards status so I had access to the club lounge which was nice. They had a nice breakfast each morning! There was plenty of fresh fruit and a variety of options to choose from.  Wine or champagne plus a sweet treat were offered each afternoon during check-in. The lobby and common areas offer nice seating, bar and restaurant as well as seating and fire pits in the outside courtyard.The hallways and rooms are nicely finished. The rooms themselves are decent sized - not large but not small. The bathroom is a little cramped. It's fine for one person or two. There is parking in front - but not a lot of it. Once they fill up it's a bit of a hike around the hotel to get to your car. They do have valet parking (which is part of the reason the space is limited). But self-park is free so that's fair enough. The rooms do have a fridge. The only down side is you have to pay for the internet if you are not a Marriott Rewards member.Two things make this one of the best hotels in the area. One it has a great bar and bartender, they have food until pretty late into the evening as most places in the area stop cooking by ten. Second is the hotel in general has great facilities as their gym is a step or two above the normal gym as first time I have seen a hotel pool with a device to assist people into it. They also have a nice courtyard for large groups to hang out in and have drinks.Nice restaurants in the area, within walking distance. Big mall across the street- shopper's haven! I will absolutely stay again- an exceptional hotel with exceptional staff!You don't have to venture to uptown Charlotte for an amazing hotel experience. My wife and I booked their spa getaway package, and it was truly a relaxing time. We were greeted with a smile, champagne, and chocolate mousse bites as we were checked in with true hospitality.The room was clean and up to date with a nice widescreen TV to watch as we lounged on the comfortable bed. No noise from the other rooms whatsoever. It was almost like we were on the whole floor by ourselves.Room service was the highlight of the evening. You can even order from the menu of the hotel restaurant, Flagstones, which has better offerings than the regular room service menu. The gentleman who delivered the food was so helpful. We wanted chocolate covered strawberries for dessert, but they weren't on any of the menus. He told us not to worry and they were delivered later that evening. So, if it's not on the menu, don't be afraid to ask. They may be able to accommodate your request.Breakfast was also delicious as we had access to the Club Lounge. Eggs, bacon, bagels, fruit and fresh coffee made our morning quite nice.Don't think you have to trek into the city for a world-class hotel. Stay in the SouthPark area and be wowed by this gorgeous hotel.Love this hotel and for the price you can't beat it. The staff is very nice and helpful. Hotel is modern and very clean. Rooms I have stayed in have been very quiet inside and out. My favorite is the corner king suites. They are very large and spacious including the size of the bathrooms. The location is within walking distance to the mall and is close to plenty of restaurants. Can't beat the location either. This is my hotel of choice in Charlotte. Use AAA to save on your stay.Back again, this time for a relaxing weekend with my husband.  I'm pretty much positive now that this is THE hotel for me in Charlotte.  Great staff (made sure we didn't leave without an umbrella when there was rain due to hit), comfortable rooms, and a relaxing atmosphere.  It's a little pricey, but I feel like you really get what you pay for.Pleasantly surprised.  This hotel has been in Charlotte for quite some time so I didn't really expect too much.  I've had a couple business meetings here but never had the pleasure of experience their hotel rooms.Staff was kind and courteous.  Only concerning thing out of the whole visit was the gentlemen running the bar that night.  He seemed a bit off.  Placing drinks at wrong ends of the bar and handing my someone's credit card.  Oh well, we all have off days.The rooms were nice and clean with a contempary feel to them which is more my style so that worked well.  My visit was under the guise of a wedding and reception and I will say the staff on hand behind the bars and serving the food were great!  The outdoor atrium area is a great locale for a low key, yet romantic wedding.I would stay here again, and again, and again!!! The staff was very welcoming upon our arrival. The hotel is lavish, sophisticated, up-to-date and very clean. The location to the mall is in walking distance. Just simply cross the street if you will! It has a very clean indoor pool with salt water! The fitness center is nice with a sauna;)Great service :) everyone was very nice. We have children and they went the extra mile in helping us .. Excellent Josh .Seemed like a nice hotel if I could have stayed there... Booked 3 nights, Mon through Thursday; my flights was cancelled on Monday so I couldn't make it to Charlotte until the morning.  Called the hotel to let them know (before the 6pm cutoff time) and they said they couldn't keep the other two nights as the rates had changed.  I tell them to leave the reservation as is, and I will just check in in the morning and pay for Monday night...Show up on Tuesday, no room.  At all.Got sent to the Renaissance Airport - which frankly has its own bad story.  Will post that there.Believe this is a Marriott problem - taking it up with them.Quite beautiful until we got to our room. As soon as we opened the door we detected a musty smell. The front desk was very accommodating and gave us another room. No smell in the new room, but not the quality you would expect at these rates. Also no free WiFi. We checked out the next morning for a better location nearby.Not keen on the Christmas Decorations. In one location a Christmas Tree was hung upside down. Disrespectful!Great hotel in a great location. The property is very nice far better than average workout room. I did not use the pool but it looked decent. The service was great. Check in reminded me of a Ritz Carlton (the only thing missing was using my name when giving me complementary snack and drink at check in). I never had to open a door (a nice extra but I don't mind opening doors).Terrific hotel for business, and at a level of what you'd expect from a Renaissance.  Front desk and bar/lounge staff was friendly and attentive; rooms were modern and clean; and room service was promptly on time.  (Not delicious, but all things considered, it was fine.)  The lobby restaurant was terrific for breakfast - the NC cut grits are a can't-miss.  Lounge could really use a better selection of wines-by-the-glass, but I live in N CA so I'm spoiled anyway.As other Yelpers have stated, the convenience of being right across the street from Southpark mall is a huge plus.  I stayed here for several nights on business, and the (relatively) nicer, sit-down restaurants across the way gave some solid options for business dinners.If you're in Charlotte for pleasure, then eh, you'd certainly miss the out-on-the-town nightlife hustle and bustle feel.  If you're in town for business, however, I think this place is a true winner - highly recommend.Wow what a great hotel!  Located right in South Park near the mall, this hotel is easy to get to.When you walk in you are instantly greeted by the friendly staff.  The decor is trendy and fun - kind of IKEA-ish.  They have a little shop right off the lobby with lots of items you may have forgotten.  The rooms are very nice - nothing spectacular.  Clean tho and quiet.The ballrooms are huge and typical 'hotel ballroom'.  The patio area outside is nice with a huge tree and seating areas with fire pits - great for those chilly nights.The bar is fun also with an ok selection of wine.  There are high-tops as well as regular tables to grab a meal.Parking was a little tight but other than that it was a great stay!","The reviews about the Executive Lounge and the Gym are spot on.  While the Lounge lacks alcohol, it is well attended and has some great small plates.  They had a chocolate stout beer cheese, that was out of this world.  The Gym was adequately equipped with a little something extra in the refreshment station where you could pick up an apple or a glass of water.  Off the Gym was the pool.  Sadly it was not very appealing because of the small size, lack of outdoor space, and that fact that it didn't have a hot-tub.  The rooms and meeting room accommodations were outstanding.  My room had dark rich wooden floors and a layout that reminded me of a Springhill Suites.  The bedroom was separated from a lounge area with a desk and a TV.  This made the room feel both spacious and gave the two spaces it's own identity.  Our meeting room was extrememly well attended by both the technical and food service staff.PS: While the Lounge lacks alcohol, there is always a cocktail or wine at the reception area that you can pick up on your way.I have been coming to this hotel for almost 5 years.  It is one of my favorite places to stay whether I'm in Charlotte for business or pleasure.  The staff is always very friendly - all of them whether they are up front opening the door, at the desk or in the awesome lobby bar that has multiple flat screens to catch sports.  The hotel has a nice gym - not huge but it has everything you need.  And you can walk across the street to the mall and dozens of wonderful restaurants  Great hotel and plan on staying there for my upcoming visits to Charlotte.IT'S REALLY PRETTY. Why does that matter? Because your experienced is always subtly enhanced when the venue is aesthetically pleasing. This one is just the right mix of modern, and traditional. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms come with mini fridges. Bathroom is fairly roomy, with plenty of counter space, and there isn't mirror placed on the back of the bathroom door so you don't have to awkwardly watch yourself pee. There's an ample scattering of outlets, and a flatscreen TV. Wifi, however must be purchased separately, $13-$16 depending on the speed you want.Hotel is within walking distance to so many dining and retail venues, and anything else you could possibly want is a short drive away.Pool is a little small, unless you want to get intimate with the random stranger who is taking up most of the pool simply because he's in the pool in the first place. Gym is full of the newest fangled exercise machines, but they don't have fans in them. Instead, the hotel provides each machine with pre-sanitized sweat towels and cold water.Couldn't even get through to make a reservation. A brief hold is not 6+ minutes. Not getting my business.Very nice hotel.  I don't know the history of this place but I believe it was a recently re-renovated older hotel.  They did a nice job but as one of my colleagues said, somethings they just can't change and update and it's pretty apparent i.e. elevator and elevator buttons.  The customer service was excellent, I felt like I was important!  Maybe that was because my status with Marriott Rewards but I dunno.  They upgraded me to a corner King room which sounded really nice but the room itself was probably equivalent to a typical room in a more modern upscale hotel i.e. Westin.  The room was kind of dimly lit and there just wasn't enough lighting in the room.  Even though, it had some modern, contemporary furniture in the room, it reminded me of the ""old person home/style lighting"" which isn't ideal.  Re: Noise level, you would think by now they would have figured out how to reduce the hallway door slamming noise.  Luckily I was not in the middle and I was on an end room but I still heard a great deal of door slamming in the middle of the night and in the early AM.  Though I am writing some complaints, I think the overall experience was pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.  If I am to travel to Charlotte on my own terms (non-business), I would probably try to stay in a Westin or Hilton brand hotel though.I do not think I could say enough good words about this place.. Maybe it's the southern hospitality I am not used to or maybe this place is just that great! From the moment I checked in they carried my bags.. And a martini and appetizer upon arrival YES PLEASE not to mention you could sneak down and grab the complimentary drinks every night when people walked in (I don't know if I was supposed to do that or not but it was great) the rooms are a good size with a fridge and a nice view of the southpark mall! Not to mention you're literally in walking distance of at least 10 great restaurants.. Not sure where to go?! Just ask the staff is so helpful and friendly. I highly highly recommend staying hereWhile it has not been executed yet, I still want to review the Renaissance Charlotte. We chose this place for our upcoming wedding ceremony and reception. It has been a very pleasant experience so far with Erin helping us all the steps of the way! The grounds and inside are very nice and classy but still has a party vibe which for us works just fine. There is a fountain on the inside with a courtyard behind it with a large tree to get married under. There is a ballroom (a few actually) that is big enough without being so large you cant fill it with tables and the food we selected for our tasting was pretty darn good. I like the layout of the rooms as well.This is a very nice hotel. I was very pleased by the cleanliness of the room, the comfortable bed, and it is quiet (I hate loud hotels). It's about 10 minutes from Uptown, if you don't mind the drive.  I normally like to stay Uptown, but this time I tried something different and was impressed.Great location within walking distance to the mall and several great restaurants in the south park neighborhood in Charlotte.  The hotel is nice and has above average service and amenities.  There was complimentary champagne, sweets, and breakfast every day of our stay.  We were out and about in Char and didnt utilize everything the hotel has to offer but the bedding was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and included all basic needs (shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, etc).  I even wheeled a big old chair into the bathroom to help my sister get ready for a night out (hair and makeup).  We set up in impromptu vanity....pumped up some music and had some vino.  Good times!  This beats the downtown Marriott in my book (no additional cost for parking).  Yep!  Oh, and there is a restaurant you must hit up for breakfast or lunch right near here (Terrace cafe).  Oh so good!Fastest easiest check in I've ever had at a hotel. My husband was able to book the room for myself and two friends for a girls' weekend. The room was very well kept and spacious. There was a mini bar, a fridge, in-room tea and coffee maker and selection. The bathroom has soap, toothpaste, and a hair dryer. We took the hair dryer off the back of the door so that it wouldn't keep banging. We were treated to some loud late night activities in the room next door, but that was the extent of the noise disturbance. Check out can be done via the in-room tv.I cannot say enough great things about this hotel.  Stayed there on business this week and the staff is INCREDIBLE.  Everyone was extremely accommodating.  Got there just when lunch ended right before a meeting, and they still served us lunch!  Also, Chelsea at the front desk was amazing.  She remembered everyone's names in our group and called us by name every time she saw us.  She worked to get our rooms available early, and made sure we were happy with our rooms (I traveled with 2 co-workers).  The rooms were super clean and bright, and the public area restrooms had this awesome spa salt scrub for your hands, which i promptly ordered online (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsuncoastsalts.com&amp;s=5df039f4b97cb25c902ae2638c396df58b3211206ee2f313ba7e15a8bb2a4841"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">suncoastsalts.com</a>). I definitely recommend it and will definitely stay there in any future trips to Charlotte!  Thanks staff of Renaissance for making my trip very enjoyable.  Additionally, the bar staff was amazing!!!!!This hotel is perfect for the wine tasting held in Charlotte....we were in walking distance to the amphitheater and the mall was right there as well....definitely a pretty hotel, but I believe they may have had smoking rooms in the past and we may have gotten stuck with one. The decor is lovely, and the restaurant is delicious. The folks traveling with us requested another room because she could not bare the smoke smell in their room. They quickly accommodated them, and they lived happily ever after...would go back!!I did not expect to be able to write a review for this property but US Airways thought differently as they stranded me in Charlotte.The hotel is very nice - I had a suite with two rooms, big flat screen TVs in both rooms,  comfortable couch and bed.     I was not there long enough to experience any of the hotel's amenities.    They have an airport shuttle running every half hour.If I find myself stuck at CLT again, I'll definitely look to have US Airways book me here again.The hotel was perfect and the food at the restaurant was delish! It is a well decorated hotel with a stylish modern flavor. The room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. The fitness center was to die for. So much that I spent 2 hrs in it!I would definitely go back there or any Renaissance hotel for that matter.Stayed here for a Panther's game, could not have been better.  Rooms are recently remodeled, feels like an upscale Marriott.  Service was great, indoor pool was saline...not chlorine.  Huge fitness center, relative to hotel size.  I thought beds were soft, but I also like sleeping on a plank.  Lobby bar and restaurant were very good and not as expensive as others I've been in.  Kid friendly and good for families from my perspective.  The hotel was sold out with a NFL team staying there but was still Very, very quiet.  Free in room wifi for marriott silver level.  Much nicer than the doubletree, omni, marriott city center and blake hotel...and less expensive.We've stayed here on a couple of occasions in the past when visiting Charlotte.  For the price, in this area, this hotel cannot be beaten!  It's in very close walking distance to Southpark Mall and other great restaurants, and very easy to get to.The location, the rooms, the service and the people make this place just wonderful.  The hotel itself is very aesthetically pleasing --not to mention extremely neat, clean and tidy.  The beds in the rooms are very comfortable almost too comfortable for the price; they must be stolen :)I would highly recommend this place.  We've really enjoyed staying here as it has a pool for the kids, a very convenient, onsite restaurant --which has an amazing breakfast buffet, and nice outdoor seating patio.  This is a very kid-friendly place from both a facility and staff prospective --everyone was just wonderful with the kids.Used the Renaissance for a meeting in early January 2010. The price for the meeting was good and the food was top notch. The service while we were there was great.  The restaurant is nice and the water fountain in the middle sets up a feeling for the whole place. The Southpark Mall is right across the street and there are multiple high end restaurants in the local area.Fantastic Suite on the first floor!  Because the Marriott I booked was over booked, I was transferred to the Renaissance for a night.Terrific decor, great customer service and location!The only setback was that the suite I was in, had a sitting area right outside and a loud group was right outside the bedroom until 2am and then at 6am the folks in the workout room began dropping weights, etc...  That's just random luck dashed with a bit of poor layout.The staff did everything they could to be helpful and provided us with a great experience!I had a very bad experience with this hotel where they promised one rate AND confirmed that rate then refused to honor it when I arrived though I had the paperwork.  I complained at all levels of management and again they refused to admit the error which was one generate by their computer.  BEWARE!The hotel itself is beautiful and comfortable, it's close to Southpark mall and lots of restaurants. But I've found the staff very 50/50; in the morning the cleaning crew will yell up and down the halls very loudly, the front staff ignored me for several minutes when trying to get checked in after midnight after a very late flight!  The restaurant is decent but extremely overpriced and good luck finding someone in the evening to even seat you; after a few frustrating evenings I found it easier to walk or drive to a nearby restaurant for faster and better service, better portions and prices that didn't make you feel like you slit your wrist open to pay the bill for measly food. Nothing is included in their bloated room price, you will be nickel and dimed for everything.","The hotel was fine and perfectly good to stay at. Comfy beds and nice decor. The lobby bar kept food available till midnight, which was helpful for us. The food there was not necessarily sub par, but not really good either. They did mess up our order and bill, but kindly removed all incorrect errors.  In the room, they should have replaced housecoats as they are getting a bit old. The shower control handle got stuck on super hot and I needed strong muscles to come and turn it (once it got destuck, it was fine). Room service forgot part of our breakfast and had to return to our room with the full order. Finally, the housekeeping wasn't really that good. They left part of the room service tray in the room and didn't hang up towels left on chairs. The hotel is fine and perfectly fine to stay at, its just that the little things added up to a 3 star.Very nice hotel in a trendy and upscale area.  Within walking distance to South Park Mall and several shops and eateries.Stellar experience with this hotel. For the services, room size, food and beverage, and amenities, this is a great deal for the quality. Reception was professional and courteous and excelled in not crossing the line between friendly and obnoxious. Complimentary chilled water with various fresh fruits as flavoring (this is great for families on long car trips with thirsty kids), some chocolate sweets, and even champagen (watered down, yeah, but who's counting? I'll take it) are all complimentary at the front desk as you check in. The valet was a little overzealous, but again, not abrasive and unpleasant. Staff were all amazing--attentive, nice, efficient, great with kids, and no one seemed like they hated being there or was riding on a power trip. Bartender made great drinks. Breakfast, which I usually skip, was awesome, and would have been worth it if it had not been included on the tab for the room. Easily one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had, if not the best. Will be returning for sure--looking forward to visiting during the off season.I stayed here June 1st and 2nd.  I have stayed here in the past and had an excellent stay, this time not so much.  I arrived around 8pm Friday night and the place was swarming with pre-teens for some kind of sporting event.  Had I know that I would have chose to stay elsewhere.  The first night I got next to no sleep because of all the loud talking and children running up and down the hallways.  The following night I got back to the hotel around 9pm not only I didn't find a place to park as there was some type of party going on again kids all over the place, the business center full of children sitting on desk, and about 50 kids trying to stuff their way into an elevator as I was trying to exit.  I wanted to get an early start the next morning but the kids and their shrieks and constant running kept me from sleeping.  I will NEVER stay here again.  I will advise my friends and family to do the same.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-charlotte-center-city-charlotte,Hilton Charlotte Center City,3.0,$$,80,"My visit to Charlotte was a lot of fun. The stay at the Hilton set the tone for my entire trip. Next to all the action. The room was very nice and comfortable. I enjoyed the comfy beds and the awesome view from my window. The breakfast from the second floor restaurant within the hotel was delicious. The breakfast offered ready to order and buffet. Fresh muffins, various meats, pancakes, fruit and the usual beverages, etc. Everything was great. The hostess and servers were very polite. The front desk staff was polite and efficient. The housekeeping staff was awesome very accommodating . The bellmen were great as well.The entire hotel in itself was very pretty. They share a gym with YMCA and it was outstanding. Great classes, smoothie bar, pools and plenty of space to do your own thing or join a group.The parking was $20.00 per day in an adjoining garage and valet was $25.00.I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Hotel and will return again.Stayed Feb 2015Grabbed a room here when my flight was delayed causing me to miss my flight (but my bags mysteriously made it on the flight, go figure). The hotel was slammed busy with a wedding and other busy guest traffic.Despite this, the guy checking me in was very accommodating and made small talk asking me what brought me to the hotel, etc. When I explained my situation to him, he offered an assortment of toiletries and help getting me anything I needed. That was very cool.I did eventually call down for a toothbrush and toothpaste, and when I had been waiting for it for an hour, I walked down to the desk and got it from him myself. He apologized, stating that the security guard that delivers these things likes to do one request at a time, and their list is quite long. I don't blame the hotel, per se, but that guard should be trained differently and the staff should give some ETA as to when to expect it. The room was super clean and comfortable. With just 4 hours to sleep and get back to the hotel, it was a much needed oasis.In the morning, the staff was also very helpful in hailing me a cab, which was appreciated. I will definitely look to stay here again when in Charlotte!I stayed here for 2 nights and was happy with the room, the staff, and the grounds. Great location that is close to the epicenter and the BOA Stadium.All in all, a great place to stay in Charlotte!Really nice hotel! I especially loved the beautiful stair case I noticed upon check in. Room size was decent, free parking on the streets after 6:00, and there's a restaurant on the second floor. Bed was very comfortable and the TV was huge with pretty decent channels. Only complaint I have is the toilet handle stopped working so we couldn't flush the toilet :( Love the shower though! Glass sliding doors are awesome. I would definitely stay here again!Very nice hotel - - just missing somethings that we take for granted at a hotel of it's caliber - a micro wave and a refrigerator.  When are these not and option?Awesome Hilton, really nice and clean. Having the lounge on top was the best part. The staff is amazing. Having a ymca, gift shop and a mall connected was greats do really convenient too. Even if you don't stay here and need a haircut go see Gene at Gene Master Cuts. The best haircut I have ever had. And the convention center is across the street too. I think the only way to improve is for them to have some hot tubs. But there is a wet and dry saunaVery very nice hotel. Close to everything downtown! Staff was very pleasant. Had a cocktail at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice! Room service was delicious and so fast! Comfy beds, nice shower. Only tiny wish is that there was an ice machine on our level! Definitely recommend this gorgeous hotel!Disclosure: I am writing this review for the Hilton Charlotte Center City from an event stand point. Two of my good friends had their wedding reception here over the weekend. For those of you who know me, I am a pro at going to weddings. I usually average 5-7 a year. True story. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Maybe I should be a wedding planner in my next life.The family was super impressed with Mel the planner that they worked with here. So much in fact, that the bride's father made it a point to rave about her in his speech. The cocktail hour was super nice and classy. I love the light fixtures in this hallway. So pretty. On to main room, the room was just gorgeous. Very classy. The service was great. All the workers were professional, nice and pretty much on top of their game. The food was good. The transition from cocktail hour to the seated dinner was seamless. I didn't hear any complaints from wedding guests who stayed in this hotel. They loved the convenient location in uptown and also the attached YMCA. There are some great restaurant and bar options within walking distance.Wonderful stay, especially thanks to Lema for making our Anniversary so special!  We were beyond touched to have champagne and treats unexpectedly arrive.  What an awesome surprise, and we enjoyed every bit of it.  Thank you Lema!  As for the hotel itself:  great location...we parked our car and walked everywhere all weekend.  Yes, parking is $18, but in all our travels, that's on the less-expensive side for downtown parking these days.  We liked the security factor in needing a room key to make the elevator move.   Our room was quite comfortable.  A/C worked just fine.  Bed comfy.  Shower was super powerful, but sadly never got any warmer than not cold.   The restaurant is not one we utilized, although we contemplated it for breakfast, seemed a bit pricey for the ordinariness of it, considering nearby options.  We did experience super friendly bar service when we stopped by the attractive bar on Sunday night.  As for the fitness center, we also were disappointed to not be able to utilize the adjacent Y on our stay.  It closes at 4 on Saturdays and is not open on Sundays at all.  Oh well, we were forced to take a break...hah!The hotel itself is nice and it's in a great location, but the staff is clueless.First of all, the AC in my room didn't work.  I had to endure two days in a hot, muggy room.  They sent clueless people who couldn't fix a thing.  Finally, the evening of day 2 they sent someone who actually resolved the issue.When I went to check out they gave me a huge hassle about a late checkout, because the football crowd was coming for the weekend.  After spending $1000 over 3 days and being miserable the first two, they couldn't find a way to let me stay until 1:00 p.m.I travel to Charlotte for business 5-6 times a year.  I'll never stay at this hotel again.  There are a lot of better options.This place was perfectly located, clean, convenient, great view, great service, good breakfast, great parking ($18 per day).  The NASCAR museum is a block away and there is tons of restaurants near by.  This would also be a good spot to go to a football game.  I would definitely stay here again!  Give it a try.Was driving from Atlanta to VA and I needed to stop along the route for some good sleep. I am super picky about the hotels I stay in so I randomly chose a 4 star hotel on hotwire and ended up here. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the amenities being that I was only staying to get a good nights rest but the hotel was beautiful. The staff was soo friendly and the front desk person even showed me where I could find street parking instead of paying for their hotel parking since I was technically only going to be there for the one night. If I am ever driving through the area again I would most definitely stay here. The rooms are really nice and the bed was comfy.Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff, room service is reasonably priced and delicious. We booked on Orbitz, last minute not knowing which hotel it would be, just that it would be 4 star. We lucked out, $85/night. Parking garage is $18 overnight. Central to everything, used Uber to get around. Very nice room, comfy bed. Walls are a little thin, a child next door was allowed to scream, hit things, shout and talk too loud and we heard it all. Not sure that was the hotel's fault.  One last thing, the air conditioning unit was absolutely silent, my favorite part would go back just because I could sleep all night without hearing the AC or the elevator.Great location! Two blocks from the Epicenter (bars &amp; restaurants). Stayed here overnight for a bachelorette party in room 1804. The rooms were nice and large, fit four girls just fine. Beds were very comfortable. We ordered extra pillows (one girl was allergic to down pillows) and they arrived within 20 minutes. I ordered room service (kids meal; two mini burgers and fries) and it was very good and the perfect portion to hold me over until dinner. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was a good size. Our bed sheets had some stains on the outside, chocolate and nail polish, but it didn't bother us. Biggest pet peeve is the lack of fans in the bathrooms. I've experienced this at other Hilton's but just don't understand why they choose not to add them!Overnight parking is $20. There is a small convenience store on the 2nd floor with some toiletries and snacks, also a restaurant. Would definitely stay here again.I stayed here last weekend for my cousin's wedding and I was thoroughly impressed with the venue and more importantly the staff. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown with a lot of cool places to see i.e. bars, restaurants, etc. within walking distance. The rooms were nice and clean as well. The Hilton also has a top notch gym (YMCA) for you work out fiends like me. The best part is it's attached to the hotel so no need to go outside. Again I want to really commend the staff that work at this hotel. There was an elderly lady who was working the check in line and she was simply amazing. I asked her for additional perks and she met all my needs and then some. I was in constant communication with my cousin's wedding coordinator and she was also very helpful in whatever I or my family needed. During the reception, she even got a specific food dish that I requested for my 2 year old daughter and she was so nice enough to bring it inside the reception for me to our table. The hotel bar was very helpful as well staying open later than usual due to the amount people my cousin and his bride invited for the wedding weekend. It was great business for them. I totally recommend this place to everyone.I was part of a wedding at this hotel during the weekend and was very impressed. The hotel has many great qualities:-Top notch location in the middle of Uptown, nearly next door to Epicenter.-Check in was painless and my room was ready at 10:30 am! My parents' was not, so they switched them to another that was.-Clean room. Not overly big but does the job. I was on the executive floor and thought the lounge, with free food and (non alcoholic) drinks was worth it for a multi night stay.-The gym at the attached YMCA is fantastic!!! It's one of the better gyms I've been to anywhere, nevermind at a hotel.-The banquet hall for events is beautiful. And the bride's parents raved about Mel. She was absolutely amazing I was told. The wedding went down without a hitch. It was maybe the best I've ever been to. The bride and groom highly recommend this hotel for weddings.-The outdoor courtyard is great. Sitting outside with drinks from the bar was a pleasure.The minor gripes:-The wedding rate for the rooms was $130, which is a great value. For the executive rooms it was $160. But the pending charge on my credit card shows $466 for the two night stay, which would be a big error. I'm hoping a mischarge doesn't marr a 5 star experience. -Housekeeping never came to my parents' room. In exchange the hotel gave them a late checkout, which was nice.Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel as the ideal mix of quality and value. And a great venue for weddings or other events.If you are on the Executive Floors at the Charlotte Hilton City Center location- don't waste your time going to the Exec Lounge for coffee.They have a horrible Starbucks machine that only makes one cup at a time.  What's worse is it takes about 1 1/2-2 min per cup (small or large).  It also only has one flavor, unless decaf is the second flavor.I went up to the Executive Lounge for the second morning in a row and I saw I had to wait in a long line for the coffee machine this time.  It's so slow that they had 5 adults to use the machine. So instead of waiting 10 min for an 8oz serving, I took elevator down to the restaurant (in house) for coffee.  I got back upstairs to the EL with my coffee and the other folks were still standing in line for coffee.Hilton-  how about getting a coffee pot in your EL for busy times?This hotel smells very musty. I had to switch rooms twice and even then had to sleep with no ac because it's coming from the air vents. I can actually smell it in the street from the doors b4 entering. I have very bad allergies and am sensitive to black mold especially. They have a serious issue here I'm sure and the dept of health should inspect. If u have allergies to mustiness and mold stay somewhere else.For what you pay you are getting nothing. You can get better service and better amenities at a Quality Inn or even a Sleep inn.This hotel is very nice hotel, the rooms were clean the staff was friendly. We came in late and left early but had an enjoyable night. When I made the reservation online the only option was for a double bed room. And when we checked in a failed to ask if a king was available, I quickly remembered when I opened the door. I called the desk and they were very happy to bring up new keys and offer to move our luggage. Very helpful attitude. The new room was very nice, But (there's always that But) we noticed one of the bottles of water had already been opened. Not cool. But no big deal, the maid missed an item. This morning I got ready to take a shower and noticed there was No Shampoo. There was a conditioner bottle but no shampoo. Another miss by the maid. I would return here again.  Front desk service and attitude is worth a lot to me.","It was my last night in Charlotte, and I had the option to go home- but after all the time I didn't get to spend (and it being my last night of vacation) checking out the city, I wanted to pamper myself, my sister, and my nephew.  Since it was a Friday night, I was able to get weekend rates (as the night before I tried to get a room- but it was $229 min, bleh- too much when you have a baby with you!).  So with AAA, I got a club level room for $159 base rate (would have been $107 if I got a normal room- but I wanted lounge access and top floor views).The location is great- a block from Tryon Street and most of the hoppin places in the city.  Parking was somewhat odd though- it is a color coded confusion whatever (stick with the red, that's all I can say- however the hotel entrance is on blue, at that point- no idea if that is higher or lower).  Since the Hilton is connected to a Wells Fargo plaza and other shit, this is surely a large complex.After parking and taking 2 elevators to get to registration (kind of confusing, and mind you needed a 3rd elevator to get to the rooms)- check in was quick and easy- the guy also thanked me for being a HHonors member. We got a room on the top floor (22), which is controlled by key- that was a nice touch- and got to the room.  Nice view- got a great shot of the NASCAR HOF!  The room was spacious, and the TV was the nicest one I had seen in a hotel (42in plasma).  The desk may or may not have been 10 feet long.  Even had a fridge the room.The bathroom was well appointed too, and came with all of the fixins.  The tub was a decent size.We went to the lounge for evening snacks, and I liked that a lot.  The lady (I think her name was Stephanie) was very friendly and adored my nephew (she at first thought that was my wife and son, I had to correct her :)).  They offered cheeses, crackers, drinks, and even wings at the time.  It was a pleasant surprise.  There is even their own business center up there, with larger screens (which is much nicer than the normal business center on the 3rd floor).I went back later to check out the bar, as they state it is a cash bar- but you just give her your room number.  Since I didn't have to drive anywhere- you better believe I racked up a tab :D . We got a crib here as well, and it was easy-breezy.  I was able to sleep well (and apparently I did NOT snore that night)- however, my sis said a sheriff knocked on the door like 15 minutes after I came back and asked about a noise complaint- when he saw she had the kid, he was very apologetic (I find that interesting though, we didn't even hear any loud noises?!?! oh well).Got to have bfast in the lounge too- that was nice and filling.  I tell you, for a hotel, getting the lounge access is worth the extra $$ if you plan to utilize it!One thing that irked my sister was that they state if you don't want a newspaper, let them know and they will deduct it from your total ($0.75)- we later found out the papers are all digital.  Also, WiFi is only free to club level, and HHonor member of higher status (which kinda sucks, as it is $9.95 a day otherwise).Parking is also $18 a night, which sucks- considering the Courtyard was $10 and less confusing.All in all, for a AAA 4diamond hotel, it wasn't bad, we enjoyed ourselves here thoroughly!Very friendly staff.  Comfortable rooms.  Guest even have access to a YMCA attached to the building.  I will definitely be returning in the near future.My husband and I stayed there New Years Eve, 2014. He was snoring so I got in the other bed to discover the sheets covered in blood. We received no apologies,  money back, or an upgrade as we booked through a 3rd party. DONT STAY HERE.Not a good hotel for children. I called the hotel prior to checking in to see about the availability of the pool for my kids both 16 and 13, I was told that the kids could swim after 6:30 PM, was told this again at check in. My kids went to swim at 6:30 and they were told you had to be 18. (It's the ymca) I called the front desk and they told me that this was a new role that was just implemented and they apologized. I will stay at the Omni in Charlotte from now on.Nice room, reasonably clean.  Some hairs in the tub though.  Room was hot on arrival, the AC isn't very strong.  Check in was fast, no line.But the reason for one star was when another guest tried to get into my room at night. I could hear that he was trying his key, and he couldn't get in (obviously, this was my room).  But he came back a few minutes later with security guard, who actually let him into my room, without checking his ID and seeing if he actually was allowed into my room!  What a terrible security lapse!  A guest should never be able to convince a security guard to let them into someone else's room!Because of the security problems, I am ranking this only one star.  Guest security is a basic skill that any hotel has to master. If travels take me to Charlotte again, I won't stay here again.Nice hotel with a good location. I got the room for a decent price and it is in a good location and is close to the Epicenter and a lot of night spots.  The room was clean and I didn't have any issues.We booked this via Priceline and got an amazing deal. It has a great location. - 2 block of the Epicenter- close to several nice restraurants &amp; bars- The light rail stops right at the hotelThe hotel itself is very nice- its  a fairly new hotel so everything is very clean-the decor is modern and the rooms are small but nice.We were only there for one night so I didnt have to deal too much with the staff but what little interaction I had was good.Stayed one night at this hotel.  We spent first 20 mins of our stay trying to get keys that worked.  This required us getting back in check-in line to get new keys and then after they didn't work we had to wait for security to meet us at the room to open the door.  Based off other reviews this seems to be a frequent issue.  Room was clean and nice.  I feel like maybe there is poor sound proofing bc when we were sleeping people were very loud going through the hall.  This woke us up several times during the night.  Hotel is in a great location which is why it got 3 stars versus 2.Great location in downtown. Hotel rooms are decent size . The YMCA is on the third floor which is great if you need a good gym. Restaurant and bar in the lobby.Great location. Just a few blocks from everything. We stayed there for the St. Patty's bar crawl and it was perfect. Room was clean and modern, and the hotel facilities were great. Only complaint (and a very small one) is the detached garage, which requires an elevator change and a walk, but it was really not an issue since we just walked everywhere.Entered my room after a day of work to find the room had been entered despite ""do not disturb"" request (due to not using towels or needing linens changed) as well as plastic bag over fire alarm. Clearly the staff is not thorough or trustworthy. In addition management is absent and unapologetic. Hilton does not value business, whether large corporate account or individual. Buyer beware.First impression : nice hotel. Huge. Great outdoor area. Room inspection: Ewww. Love the gym style shower. Glad I brought shower shoes. No telling what was on that floor. Bed covers...noticed a stain on comforter...ewww. also the desk chair...dried blood or something. Eww. No fridge or microwave. As nice as this hotel seems, didn't know u had to ask for those items to be in your room. The carpet...old and stained. Seemed like and old new painted over hotel. Staff was great. Breakfast buffet perfect. Overall..C-Unbelievably poor experience. HHonors member for over 10 years. Made 2 night reservation over three weeks ago with guaranteed late arrival. After flight from Houston and cab ride into downtown at 9:00 pm, the Hilton check-in desk said, ""Oh we're sorry. We've overbooked tonight. We have no available rooms.""  They then wanted to send me back out to a Hilton Garden Inn at the airport. After an hour of fighting with them, calling HHonors, and watching the same thing happen to several other stunned travelers, I finally got a room down at the Sheraton. Worse, the cad driver said, ""Oh, they overbook and kick people out all the time. That's just what they do when they have a convention in town.""This is the worst customer service I've experienced in many years. To the extent it is limited to this hotel, their management should be disciplined/fired. To the extent it is endemic to the Charlotte area, this really makes you look bush league.Pretty much a disaster. We're Hilton Gold Members and this is the only negative experience I've ever posted about a Hilton property. The room was a mess. We had upgraded to the executive floor because I was injured, but it was closed and they wouldn't move us. The noise was insane and they did nothing. We were booked for a two night stay but left Charlotte the 2nd night rather than endure another night in this hotel. We would have left the first night if it weren't for things we had to do. They comped our second room night, but not the first. We're not out for free stuff, but the right thing to do would have been to refund both nights. Will never stay here again.I came back to Charlotte in June and stayed at the Hilton Charlotte City Center.  Excellent customer service.  From the moment I arrived the staff was courteous and always asking about how they could make my stay better.  The weekend I was there they were doing some renovations on floors above mine.  The noise made impossible for me to take a nap, but there was really nothing that could be done about that.  It has to get done at sometime.  I would stay at this Hilton again if I were in Charlotte for business.After living in Charlotte for 14 years, it is WEIRD to go there on business! But I have to on occasion now, and this Hilton is across the street from the office. The rooms and beds are comfy, and the room service is way overpriced. You can use the YMCA next door but for a fee I think. The parking is expensive, but that's Charlotte. This location has always been on target with early check-in without giving me a hard time. There are many ballrooms and other meeting rooms here for classes, etc. This Hilton can also email your bill for easier and paperless expense report filing. If you're visiting Charlotte for anything near uptown like a Panthers game, an event at the convention center, or on business for either of the banks, I recommend this location. The light rail has a stop downstairs in the back, and it's very convenient to the EpiCentre with its bowling alley, restaurants, movie theater, and other shopping.TIP: Take the light rail down one stop to the EpiCentre to get something to eat, or to bring it back to your room. Room service is way too expensive for not very much food.Love this Hilton. Friendly staff, nice/clean rooms, and walkable to everything. There is a very nice YMCA attached you can go to for free to work out. I always go out of my way to book this hotel when I travel to Charlotte for work.A pretty typical, business-friendly Hilton. Location is great, downtown and connected to Wells Fargo buildings by bridges. Service is friendly and most guest rooms have been updated in the past few years. Hallways are old and rather beat up.  Good workspace for business, desk, computer, etc.  Charlotte could use MORE nice business hotels, this one could use an upgrade--but is better than some of the other downtown chain hotels.  I'd stay here again. Beds are relatively comfortable, furniture is newer as is TV. Bathrooms are small and it's not that quiet--heard elevator, other doors slamming, etc. All that said, I'd still say it's above average.  The only ""nice"" downtown hotel I've found is the Ritz. Will the jam-packed business travelers here--they could use a couple more new hotels.So I had the company Xmas party here this year.  The large rooms allow for some big gatherings and for my employer that was the case too.Nice bar staff and the food was really good.  We had a dance floor and DJ with a sound system that rocked it, but made it a bit hard to chat with co workers.Purpose: for work, have stayed here frequently (50+ nights)Pros:- Rooms: I like that they have different styles of rooms and I sometimes score with the corner rooms (which feel bigger). - Rental Car Service: is located right downstairs. Pickup/drop off cannot get any easier. (Note: they close early on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays)- Gym: it's the YMCA, so it's a legitimate gym. - Concierge Lounge: always open for bar snacks and drinks. Open on weekends. Love the free full-sized water bottles.- Location: less than a 10 minute walk from the Bank of America stadium. Makes it easy/fun for Panther game days! Also, it's connected to various buildings, so you can get pretty far w/o walking outside.- Early Check In: has been granted each time I've come in earlier than check-in time.- Security: requires key cards in their elevator.Average:- Check In: generally takes longer than it should. Multiple times, when checking in during the evenings, there's no one at the front desk and I'll have to wait a bit for someone to come out.- Bellboy: always generally have to wait for someone; not as attentive as I've experienced at other hotels.- Concierge Lounge: the food offered is generally nothing to look forward to (chicken wings, mini corn dogs, etc.). However, the set up is nice and the view is pretty great.Cons:- Showers: I prefer showers with bathtubs and most of their rooms don't have that. Makes it difficult to warm up the water w/o getting sprayed from the shower!- Gym: they close early on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays.- WiFi: not free for non-Rewards members- Restaurant: it's not amazing and in my various stays, I've only found 1 item that I like: Tuna Crisp.- Key Cards: I always have trouble with these deactivating during my stay (even though I do a good job of keeping them away from credit cards/ phones).Unexplored:- ParkingOverall: I come here for work and really just need a bed and shower, so the rest is not too bothersome for me (but I've listed them as they may be important for others). The pros/cons balance out some of the pros/cons I've noted at the Marriott City Center hotel, so it's hard to say one is better than the other.","I immediately had a slight attitude after I booked my hotel stay on Hotwire, sight unseen. I read the yelp reviews and expected a less than stellar stay:I drove into the Hilton parking deck with yet another attitude because I have a problem paying $18 a day for parking, anywhere. I reasoned that I had to pay for parking out of sheer convenience and my own scariness - Yea; I grew up in the suburbs and get a little nervous walking in unfamiliar places....Anyway, the walk from the parking garage to the lobby was rather long. I had to go up 2 floors in the garage, which takes you to the 2nd floor of the hotel, and then you have to go down 1 floor from the elevator inside the hotel to get to registration. If I had kids with me, I would've been frazzled... If you want to avoid all of that, elect for valet service at the front of the building. You could also park close to the light rail service, which really isn't that far (I'm not sure how much they charge).Oh, so as recommended by Jason D., I asked for a room facing Panera Bread, so I could access their free Wi-Fi. After a swift check-in, I arrived on the 16th floor, with a nice view to the city. The room was large enough with a king bed, clean room, and nice bathroom. The flat screen TV was nice and even had auxiliary hookups for a projector and other sound equipment, which was facing the outside of the desk, below the TV. That's good, if you need that sort of thing...We ordered room service from the restaurant, Coastal Kitchen, a few times: The All Natural Burger with fries - $11 (ordered twice), the Chocolate Mousse Tort - $7, which turned out to be chocolate cake with mousse and chocolate chips on the outside, with whipped cream, blue berries and strawberries (ordered twice), and the All American Breakfast $14, which consisted of two eggs made your way, choice of bacon, ham or sausage, choice of juice, choice of coffee or tea, choice of bread, and breakfast potatoes. The breakfast was a good deal, considering that I needed coffee and sustenance before I departed. I didn't care for the potatoes, but that weren't terrible (no salt). Just a note, room service adds an 18% gratuity, called a service charge on the receipt, and a $2.95 delivery fee, although the menu says $3. Just keep that in mind, so you won't be surprised.The hotel was within walking distance of the stadium and the EpiCentre. The EpiCentre contains a host of restaurants like Libretto's Pizzeria, Smoothie King, Enso's, and Five Guys Burgers. I even walked my scary self to Smoothie King and Libretto's, so it couldn't have taken more than 8 minutes, including the elevator.All in all, the amenities and distance from attractions made up for the old school carpet in the hallway, the one hundred layers of paint on the door (which included and an indent of an old door fixture), the old school looking desk in the room, and kind of hearing the other guests coming in and out of their hotel room.I almost forgot; I was not able to use my HiltonHonors to receive complimentary usage of the hotel Wi-Fi or the YMCA membership during my stay ($12/day). The lady at the front desk said that since I used a 3rd party to book my reservation (Hotwire), she couldn't (or wouldn't) change my reservation code to apply the HiltonHonors benefits. Mmm hmm. I didn't believe her, but I didn't' feel like arguing/reasoning with her. I always have a plan B.... However, my plan B, which was to use Panera Bread didn't work out. :-\  Panera Bread was closed for construction. I am guessing that they turned their Wi-Fi off, or something, because I couldn't get a signal. Nor could I get a signal on my Blackberry! Not to be defeated, I used my AT&amp;T DSL account to access the Hilton Wi-Fi signal (use the username and password from your AT&amp;T email). Ha!! The unexpected plan C worked. :)As you can see, you can stay within your budget when you stay here. You just have to make choices as to where you want to spend on the extras, like parking, valet, room service, internet access, gym accessibility, etc. You can save by eating at restaurants in or near the Epicenter, parking further away, and having an internet solution available.Stayed here for two nights while in town for the Beyonce concert. The room was modern and clean. The hotel staff was friendly and responded to request for towels and ice quickly. Room service was good and drinks at the bar helped us get the night started.  No complaints. I would stay here again. Walking distance to the arena and nightlife at the Eipcenter.I was called to Charlotte on a business trip last week and I arrived on Sunday and was scheduled to return to San Francisco the following Sunday.   I decided to fly my wife and son along with me so I wouldn't have to be apart from them for a whole week.   Well, by the time Thursday rolled around, my wife and I decided to leave the Hilton on Friday and take a road trip before heading back to the airport on Sunday.   This decision was taken in no small part due to the accomodations at the Hilton Charlotte &amp; Towers.The room, adequate enough if I'd been here on my own, left much to be desired with my wife and infant.    That's fine... After all, they're clearly a business hotel and it's not their job to cater to my family.   Still, it's very easy to develop cabin fever in the hotel room.So how about taking solace in the pool?    Well, it turns out my wife and son could go to the YMCA pool but it would cost $12 a day *and* my son would only be able to use it between something like 5 and 7 in the evening.   Are you fucking kidding me?!?Service was excellent and we got room service a couple of nights...   No complaints there.   The bar downstairs stocks Hendrick's Gin, so they deserve props for that.    Still, now that I can do a side-by-side comparison with the Omni, I'd pick the Omni next time if only because access to the pool is unfettered and I've come to realize you sure as hell better have access to a pool if you're in Charlotte in July or August (either that or get used to being indoors and sucking on the AC)I stayed here quite a few times for work travels. This place is nice and the executive lounge happy hour is pretty sweet. With beverage and snacks, and free Internet.I like the bathrooms since it is marble flooring and have a nice vanity. I would stay here again especially with the complimentary YMCA membership during your stay.Not so bad, really. I got an Expedia deal relatively last-minute, and with the Triple A discount, it averaged less than $200 a night for the executive floor.  Get Triple A, people. They'll come jump your battery if your car dies AND you get discounts on hotel rooms. What's not to love? The room was nice, bed was huge, and view was pretty. Front desk staff was super nice. The restaurant isn't bad, although the service was spotty at the tables and the bar. The conference space was fine, not so sprawled out that it took you twenty minutes to get to sessions. You're also centrally located in uptown Charlotte, so it's easy to get to wherever you need to go. Parking wasn't crazy, even for two days. The executive lounge was okay, but again with the wine prices. (And I am not cheap, I just don't like paying so much for mediocre wine. Step it up, I'll stop complaining. Maybe.)Downsides were absurdly high-priced wine for the location (even for a Hilton.) Conference lunch was awful. And when, oh when, will upscale hotels stop charging for wi-fi? If you're already eating your financial lunch to have a $12 glass of wine that doesn't suck, please give me my internet. It'll gain you customer loyalty points that will go a lot farther, I think.Location is nice, but it is the typical blah Hilton - stay in one, stay in them all! Walls are thin and you can hear what is going on next door and the announcements from the light rail station. There are also no mini fridges, so no easy way to keep stuff cold. Since Hilton always screws you for wifi by charging, try to get a room facing 3rd Street since you can get free wifi from the Panera across the street. I have been going there for breakfast anyway since the Hilton's continental breakfast, which is part of the conference I am going to, is not going to fill you up to get your day started.It is always funny, the more expensive the hotel, the more they nickle and dime you for services. If you have a car, there is a Trader Joe's and Target about a five minute drive away and are a good place to stock up on beverages and snacks, although the lack of a fridge is a problem at the hotel.One good thing was if you say something about the vegetarian options lack of protein (again food part of the conference) they will do something about it. I'll give them kudos for that.Would give 4 stars for the Hilton customer service and bed... but the A/C in the room didn't keep it cold and the clock was 14 mins slow even though I asked to have it serviced it still didn't help. The rooms were nice size and TV nice... but needs repainting... mystery stains on ceilings are distracting.Hilton Charlotte Center City is a run-of-the-mill business class hotel that could do with a bit of refreshing. It took us over an hour to check in because the sales department misplaced the fax certifying our rooms were prepaid and the charge had never been processed. While the staff was polite and offered us cold water while we waited things were still not right once we got our rooms. Despite requesting to all be on the same floor, my colleagues and I were all booked into the same ""standard"" rooms scattered through out the building. Weirder yet they all had dramatically different layouts. My room had a nice business desk but no bath tub. Two colleagues had chaise lounges, tubs, and fridges but no desks and one person randomly got a corner suite. When we asked the front desk why we were in such dramatically different rooms even though none of us are Hilton Honors members they insisted we were all in the same kind of room. Just admitting ""run of availability, some people got lucky"" would have made sense but blatant denial of the situation was strange. Confusing layout and it lacks a pool, but it is connected to the local YMCA (which has a lap pool) and some decent restaurants. Would not stay here again of my own volition when in Charlotte, but I wouldn't be heartbroken if I had to stay here for work again.Hilton was my place of choice for this last visit to Charlotte &amp; must say it was a pretty good stayInternal walkway directly led me to my office building - so major props for proximityStaff was super-nice &amp; I *loved* the fact that when the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was out - they honored it!!  I've had other hotels call me to ask if I realllllly didn't want maid service.....well I DID have the sign out there.....so props here too!!Rooms were big &amp; well situated.  There was FREE Wifi!  Although sometimes it would cut out - depending on the time of day....maybe something to do w/ other traffic?Shower was a large walk-in w/ great water pressure.  Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products ROCKBeds were comfy although their pillows were horrible - hence the 4 Stars.  It was the old 1 not enough but 2 too many syndrome so I didn't get a good night's sleepInstead got a neck ache which of course led to a headache.  But would consider staying here again in the future - there *must* be something to be done about the pillows.....I run into this a lot(SO Princess &amp; the Pea I am, I am).....and regarding Jason E's note about purple - I LOVE the purple upgrade.  Gives it a soothing &amp; imperial feel to the place.  You'll love it too!!  :-)I like the location of this hotel, but I have some gripes. Paying to park at hotels Uptown is to be expected; self parking at this hotel was $18.$9.95 for Internet access and after I connect to WiFi I noticed it was only 802.11b (slower than g); that was a disappointment.My room on deck 10 was smaller than I thought; but it was adequate. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice!I may try another hotel in the Uptown area next time or stay in Ayrsley again. Last year I stayed at the Hilton Garden in the Ayrsley area. (free parking, faster Internet and larger room)Clean rooms, flat screen TV's with HD, room service until midnight and 5 minute walk from the Epic Center. I love the fact that you have access to the YMCA that's attached directly to the hotel. Awesome ammenities. Pool, weights, basketball and tons of cardiovascular equipment. I really liked this hotel. The only downfall is the hotel resturant. But, your so close to everything it makes up for it.Had a three day stay here. Overall, this is a nice hotel. Some positives:1. Check in was well-organized. A special 'thank you' to Amber, who was working the desk ... a very helpful and pleasant hotel employee.2.  Room, while not huge, was more than adequate, with comfortable beds, and a huge work desk.3.  The restaurant food was decent, the prices reasonable (but, at the high end).4.  The location near the conference center (about a block away) was very convenient.The downsides:1.  The self-parking was way far from the registration area with no luggage carts provided. 2.  The daily parking charge of $18, although within the range expected for Charlotte, was not a happy thing ... come on, people, we're staying at YOUR hotel, why 'nickel and dime' us?3.  The layout of the hotel seems to have been done by an architect who specializes in designing fun houses ... Talk about confusing: from the self-parking area you get on an elevator that takes you to the registration level. Then, you take an escalator to the next level to take a different elevator to take you to your room. So, to recap: very nice in any ways, but not up to the top of its form yet, either.My daughter and I stayed at the Hilton Center City back in January 2013.  I had given her tickets to the Justin Beiber concert for her 10th birthday.  When my daughter saw the outside of the hotel I think she was almost excited about the fact that we got to stay in this beautiful hotel as she was about seeing Justin Beiber (well almost...it would take a lot to impress more than Beiber)  The check-in process was very easy...no problems at all with the reservations and the inside of the hotel is even more beautiful than the outside.  We got a little turned around trying to get to the right elevators but there was staff right there and they were so eager to help us.  We didn't even have to ask...they approached us and offered their assistance.  I have been in the service industry before and I truly appreciate great customer service.  Later that night when we were leaving for the concert the staff at the front desk was happy to give us directions so we would know the quickest and safest way to walk to the arena.  After the concert we didn't feel like going out so we ordered room service.  The food arrived around 45 minutes after we ordered it but at least they warned us that it would be that long (i hate when food places say your order will be right there and it doesn't arrive till forever and a day later) The food was decent but a little pricey.  But hey what can you expect while staying in a nice hotel.  The price was worth it though to not have to navigate through uptown Charlotte looking for a place to eat with a tired yet very excited 10 year old at 11pm.  In the morning I went to the gift shop before checking out.  The gift shop was also a little pricey...especially for things like canned drinks and those little bowls of cereal that might hold 1/2 cup of cereal.  If I need to spend the night again in Charlotte the Hilton Center City will be my 1st choice...not because of it's beauty but because of the exceptional customer service.  They really helped make my daughter's special day even more special than originally expected.I do no know why more people do not review this hotel highly. We checked in with NO PROBLEM, our room was clean and comfortable, and the front desk staff was able to give specific recommendations. The wifi was FREE, but the parking was $18. I guess that's average for the area. The best thing about the hotel is the LOCATION! 2 blocks from the Epicenter, 5 blocks from the New South Museum. It was a great central location to walk around and do cool things in the city. I would go back!!This hotel is in the city center of Charlotte, a beautiful city with a vibrant and exciting downtown scene. The only downside is that things are pretty expensive overall downtown, including this hotel. I am quite sure it is comparable to the other options, the Omni, Courtyard Marriott, etc. Our company tried to get the Courtyard, which we had experience with before - and really enjoyable as well - but unfortunately they were fully booked for our 13-member team.The greeting we got from the staff was very nice, but the parking rate for the hotel was a real downer. If you are visiting from out of town, take the advice to get a taxi, as the daily rate is very high and you can do nearly everything by walking the area.Upon entering my room, it was an odd corner room layout, but everything seemed OK. It was a bit dated and a little bit worn, which was a slight disappointment given the location. The location of the hotel is perfect, with only a slight walk to the restaurants and shops around.Major problem: the toilet did not work properly. It turns out their toilets are a bit weird anyway, in that you have to hold the handle down for a little delay to get the proper flush (found this out when I got to my new room). But, no matter what I did, the toilet did not flush properly and nearly overflowed ... which is terribly frustrating and gross! Oddly enough, after anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes, I would hear this gurgling sound and when I went back in, the thing had finally drained - not flushed - because there was still ""stuff"" in the bowl.When I called for maintenance help at 11:00 pm or so, the woman told me she would send up someone with a plunger. I paused, then thought she must have meant she would send up a maintenance person with the plunger. Nope. Literally, a maid came up with a plunger and handed it to me, then left. Can you believe that? I was so stunned, I didn't even say anything.The next morning, I requested a room change and after some arguing, was able to get that accomplished. The next room was fine.The conference room facilities were decently appointed, but the room we were assigned for our team was inadequate. We were crammed in like sardines around the conference room table. The facilities provided were good - projector and screen. The food they provided was very plentiful - crazy plentiful actually - but the quality on the first day, sandwiches and rolls, were boring and somewhat tasteless. The second day of hot options were very good.The bar was good, with decent service and bartenders, but one colleague complained his Manhattan was not well done at all.Overall, for a Hilton property, I was disappointed. The cost to value ratio was not that good, and I am quite sure that other properties around the Hilton would be a better choice overall.You have to try their homemade pizza.  It is great!Renovated and beginning to look good.Now I can see why I was told to stay at the Westin...but heck, I didn't want to walk far to work.  First, when I first got the room, I kept hearing and noise, but didn't think anything of it.  Dropped off my stuff and headed to the office.  When I got back, the noise was still going...found out it was the toilet that wouldn't stop running.  OK, went downstairs to ask someone to fix it...then headed out to grab some food.  1-1.5 hrs later, came back and wasn't fixed.  Got ready to head to the YMCA and went back downstairs to remind them.  45 mins later, it was fixed.  Cool, right?  Not quite yet.  Found out that the toilet was leaking water...pool of water behind the toilet.  Called and had them come fix it.  Glad the guy was close by...didn't take long.One pro is that most check-ins are around 3pm.  I actually switched from the Hilton Garden to this Hilton super early one morning.  They let me check in at 8am.  =)No way would I stay here again... I travel a good bit and am usually Hilton loyal, but I'd stay at the Westin down the street next time.For a hotel that claims to have been recently renovated, there's much to be desired. The rooms feel old and not in a charming way - there are exposed wires all over the place. My room was also kind of dirty when I checked-in.As for room service, they were fast enough but they don't have many healthy options. As someone who doesn't eat meat, I appreciate when the hotel (or any place for that matter) is willing to work with you to concoct things and they were. Although, I think I just had good timing with calling on the late side.The hotel gym is one of those out sourced ones so it's a YMCA that's attached. I don't mind paying more for a nice hotel gym. However, they were charging $12 a day for access to the gym and pool and it was only open from 8am til 9pm.... what sort of working person can get into a gym during those hours? Ridiculous!If the food was any good, this would get an extra star.Basically, if you've stayed in one Hilton, you've stayed in them all.  The place was fine - the beds were comfy, the chairs were not.  The shower was swell, but the soapdish was mounted on a slant, forcing an unsexy bend-over every time I needed soap.  Lucky for me (or any hypothetical shower partner) I was showering alone.The staff was friendly, the food prices were ohmigod exorbitant. The gym was actually an attached YMCA, but it was a *nice* Y.  It's free for Hilton Honors members, as is the internet.  Otherwise, the gym is $8.00/day, and internet is $10.00.  Worth joining the honors program to get those free.There are cookies and some sort of kool-aid available in the lobby in the afternoons.","I've stayed at this particular hotel before. The rooms have always been hot, even with the thermostat as low as it will go (60) and the fan on high. Uncomfortably warm when you're trying to sleep.Other than that, they have spacious rooms, comfy beds (and extra pillows), spacious bathrooms, and fancy decor.We arrived late and they sold our room, requiring us to move to another hotel, and then move back the next night. NOT COOL! We did however get comped breakfast for two nights, and the ""continental"" breakfast on the executive level was much better than I expected. Executive level aside, the gym has very limited hours and costs extra to use, and so does the internet. To me, that's a bit disappointing.I had no issues with this hotel. Well I guess it does help when work is paying! The bed was comfortable but the blanket wasn't thick enough for me so I had to crank the heat up. The check-in process was fairly quick and the staff was friendly. I got randomly chosen as the Wells Fargo guest of the day. I'm not sure if it's because I'm an employee of the bank or what but I'll take it! It pretty much means  you get free water and fruit in your room and you get access to the little penthouse lounge on the top floor.I believe the location can be considered downtown/Financial District so there were restaurants near by, even a bowling alley! Not many places to go shopping though.Decent hotel and responsive staff.  There frequently for meetings.  The restrooms on the ballroom level have SERIOUS plumbing issues.  Three times in the past month toilets in the men's room have been unusable. I and colleagues gave reported the problems to staff.  I can't believe these problems remain.Very nice hotel and staff.  Close to everything and train is directly behind the hotel for easy travel.  Rooms are very clean.  Only complaint is that there aren't any draws in the room for clothes.  Just 2 small ones under the night stand next to the bed.DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE. The events coordinator, Dawn, was horrible to work with . My sister got married here on 10/27/2013, and it was almost a disaster because of this woman. She hardly returned phone calls and emails unless we completely harrassed her. The day of the wedding, the front desk had no information for my sisters wedding, and Dawn wouldn't answer her phone or return the calls. I realized she ended up turning her phone OFF because it started going straight to voicemail after we called her phone a few times! After about an hour of front desk clerks, and managers running around to find out where the bridal suite was, and what we were supposed to be doing, we finally met with a man named Sam who ultimately turned the day around for us. He could not have been more helpful and gave us champagne and couches to sit on in the suite. Dawn, on the other hand, finally shows up a couple of hours later, and after I gave her a piece of my mind, she apologized in the most unsincere way. Not ok! She is very unprofessional to work with for an event, and upset my sister on the day of her wedding - DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE!!This is the worst hotel room I have stayed in outside of a Third World country. I believe I was in a corner room 2028?  (I was so traumatized I have tried to block out the experience, so I may get the room number wrong.)The bathroom LOOKED beautiful, as it was clearly renovated in recent years.  However, the workmanship and functionality were unbelievably sub par. I stayed in this horrific room for a week.  I was working so much I simply dealt with it.1. Flooding shower: it had no bath, only a shower and my first night it flooded  forcing me to use every available towel.   The glass shower doors did not close properly, which did not help the problem.  When the handyman came to fix it, he pulled from the drain untold amounts of long red hair --the culprit. Despite this ""fix,"" I was forced to use all the towels again and again because the nature of the shower was to flood, period.  Poor construction.2. Crooked soap holder: this was installed on a slant, so the soap slid off every time.3. Flooding sink faucet:  the faucet was too short and did not allow the water to properly project in to the sink, so if you did not run the water hard, it did not land in the sink.  Instead, it would simply dribble backwards and flood the counter, which, of course, it did. Very stressful, as I had to remind myself to run the water a certain way every time.4. Dirty sink after sink faucet fixed:  after the handyman came to ""fix"" the sink, he left it filthy.5. Bedside phone nonoperative for two days.6. Ordered breakfast and requested extra butter.  Exactly two pats of butter were provided.  Can you spare it?  Really?7. No cup of ice with order, despite the request.8. Two tiny garbage bins: each held about two bottles of water.  Not at all functional, despite being very attractive and modern bins.  Indeed, these bins were metaphors for that horrible room.9. No working heat: it would simply never come on. After my last FEW experiences with the handyman, I dare not call him back.10. A frozen TV channel: one TV channel was frozen for my entire week-long stay. The picture did not move.11. A TV channel with no sound: another TV channel had movement, but no sound during my entire week-long stay.12. Constant digital break up of picture and sound on all channels.The lobby was beautiful.  The room LOOKED beautiful, but I have never encountered such a shoddy bathroom renovation in a place of lodging.  The Hilton should be ashamed of itself.We stayed here last year in December, and thought it was great! I can't get over the experience that Patricia had here with the GM and the hospitality suites; I can't comment on dealing with the GM but I will review our experience staying in the room here. We arrived and were able to check in right away, and we found our room to be clean and neat. With a huge flat screen over the desk and great decor, we were definitely happy. We had plenty of towels, clean sheets, and a comfortable bed. The breakfast in the morning downstairs was good, and they were undergoing some renovations at the time so I'm sure the ambiance is much better now, although it was fine then too. The service was great and the eggs were yummy. The only downside to our stay was that a company was throwing a huge party downstairs, so the place was flooded with loud partygoers who DID NOT sleep - and some of them were right next door to us. Music blaring, doors slamming, and loud conversations made for an almost sleepless night. We didn't do any complaining and just decided to fight through it. This of course could have happened at any resort, although I was suprised that no one came up to tell them to calm down. Looking back, and especially after reading Patricia's review, I wish we did call someone just to see how it was handled. Overall, though, a great experience.I got a good deal on Priceline, but was disappointed that it cost extra to use the pool, internet and park. Ridiculous!Btw, The room was nice.We stayed here two nights during spring break, first night being Easter.  The location was excellent.  It was pretty easy to get find and get to, although, being Easter Sunday evening certainly helped!  We had planned to valet park, but the desk attendant said self park would be very easy at that time (and it was!  saved a few bucks).  Outside the room, the halls, elevators and lobby were very nice looking and elegant.  Our room was pretty standard.  Not large, not small, pretty clean and comfortable.  The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows and puffy blankets.  We were on the 12th floor, overlooking the light rail and Epicentre area.  You had to really try to hear the trains, it wasn't an issue at all.  There was a nice little shop in the lobby for snacks and stuff you forgot to pack.We found the hotel to be super convenient for walking around downtown (er, Uptown?).  With two adults, a kindergartner, and a 2 year old, we had no trouble getting up and down College and Tryon to get to museums and restaurants and just walking around to sightsee.  The area around the hotel was super clean and safe feeling and the whole place seemed well policed.  We did not try the restaurant or the YMCA fitness area.  The fitness area looked way crowded when I walked by Monday afternoon.I would gladly stay here on a future Charlotte visit!Great room, appears to be completely renovated with minimal to no traces of the old.  Friendly front desk and room service staff.  Good location, there's a light rail stop right outside, but if you're a light sleeper, the sound of the trains might wake you.  Nice executive lounge, but staffed poorly.  The woman in charge of the lounge could have given me frostbite.  She was visibly annoyed to have to leave her internet browsing when a hotel guest would enter.  I'd definitely stay there again, but I'd probably grab my happy hour elsewhere, even if it isn't free.This POS hotel now goes by another name - Charlotte Hilton Center City.  I haven't stayed here, but feel I am qualified to review them.  Read on.....My firm is attending a large conference in Charlotte, and unfortunately were placed here by the housing bureau.  I requested two hospitality suites that we could use for meetings, along with five regular sleeping rooms.  When the people from my firm arrived yesterday, the so-called hospitality suites featured ONE COUCH.  Yes, that's right.  ONE COUCH and ONE COUCH ONLY, as opposed to the couch, armchairs, coffee table, end tables and 3-4 other chairs that were supposed to be in the suites.  Oh yeah, and one of the couches feature a BROKEN ARM.  Nice touch.I called the GM's office as well as the conference events manager to find out WTF happened.  No response, of course.  This comes after several weeks of conversations with the events manager about room setup, furniture layouts, reserving a/v equipment, etc. to ensure that everything was done correctly.ARGH.The room was nice and the hotel was clean but there was a lot of mechanical noise. $18 for parking is a bit much.We live just outside of town, but have been using this hotel for years when we come to Charlotte for a night out and don't feel like driving back to the suburbs.  Had reservations on January 15th for their Park and Play promotion that included a room and valet parking.  Check in and most of our stay went well.  The actual room was nice as always.   We came in late Friday night/Saturday morning after valet service was gone, told to leave my keys at the front desk I thought my car would be taken care of.   When we went to check out after getting up Saturday, My car was still sitting where I left it overnight. I wish that was all I could complain about it, but this is where it really goes downhill.  The next week when their charge goes thru the bill is $50 more than what I signed for.   A quick call and complaint to customer service was supposed to resolve it.   They think they charged us for two cars instead of one and they'll take care of it.  We wait a few days without hearing a response and try again, my wife calls to ask about it and the girl taking calls at the Hotel is rude and won't even bother to listen to the whole story (cutting her off and talking down to her) .  We end up getting transferred to some call center in Texas and trying to explain the issue to them.  Needless to say, its a week later and they're still holding our money hostage, and we'll probably never stay in another Hilton because of this one experience.I gave this hotel three stars because over all the service was average. That was very disappointing for what bills it's self as a 4 star property. The room was very nice and newly remodeled. I was upgraded to the executive level which included access to the bar, breakfast and light snacks. That was very nice and the staff in that area are truly exceptional. Check in and check out was also note worthy and I was greeted with a smile and friendly hello. Where this hotel failed miserably was the valet. First every time I returned I had to wait. I started timing how long it took for a valet to appear. The worst was at 11:30 pm on a Friday night (13 minutes) and the best was Sunday morning (2 minutes). I am not sure where the valet was as there were no other cars around? Twice I had to go to the front desk and complain that I had been waiting. The desk clerk went off looking for the valet only to return and announce to the other clerk that the  valet was no where to be found. Ouch! I didn't need to know that.Like the hotel very disappointed with the reastraunt.  Long wait, never connected with us no menu...... Looked like they were overwhelmedStunningly bad for a major chain hotel. Internet access costs $12 per day, and TV was not working the day I checked in. If you are a  business traveler, don't accept this overpriced mediocrity. Stay anywhere else.A solid business hotel, very close to where I had to be for my meetings so i could not complain. The rooms have been upgraded so all the floral horror is gone -- nice bathroom fixtures, flat-screen TV, the works. The hallway carpet is still old-school so it might hurt your eyes early in the morning. My room plan included free internet access and free YMCA access which is located in the adjacent building. Overall, can't complain.Adjacent to everywhere I need to go so convenient location for work purposes. Rooms are clean, beds are comfy. Weird carpet in bright and odd color combinations.  GREAT gym partner with the nearby YMCA which is large full service classic gym. Walk to a great selection of nearby restaurants in Uptown. Best choice downtown.The day before my stay at this hotel, I received an email informing me that check in time would be later than usual.  Not a problem -- the problem was that the person who wrote the email exposed the email address of ALL of the guests who were scheduled to check in the next day.  When I called the corporate office to report this (after cancelling my reservation) I got the impression that they wanted to make amends by offering me a free room or a deal.  Are they kidding?

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-charlotte-uptown-at-the-epicentre-charlotte,Aloft Charlotte Uptown at the EpiCentre,3.0,$$,99,"Location, Location, Location! If you have never stayed at an Aloft, you may be missing out on what you are not missing :)The room is very simple with a bed, bath, and desk. There is not much for closet space but the still enough for a day or two.The hip decor is fun and there is a charging station! The sliding door to the toilet and shower is fully mirrored and cool, Along with the translucent glass between the shower and bedroom side for the dividing wall.The XYZ bar is cool too. The house specials are very reasonable and I have always had cool bartenders. The lobby/cantina/rec room is a cool lounging area (unless kids are present). It has plenty of sectionals and seating areas for groups big and small. Board games are available and fun along with the small pool table.The cantina serves up breakfast sandwiches in the morn and plenty of healthy snack options, which include fresh fruit and coffee, along with the regular fare.The pricing is not bad and the bed sleeps well.I feel like I need to give Aloft four stars because really, it's not as bad as everyone says it is, if you stay on certain nights (business travelers) and make note to get a room on a side facing away from the Epicentre.  Many of my colleagues warned me of Aloft after they had some less than ideal stays here, but so far, my 2 night stay has not been bad at all for a ""cheap hotel"" (relatively, compared to the rest around here).   However, am I a fan?  I wouldn't call myself a ""fan"" of this place, but it's definitely ""a-ok"".The space is modern.  The room reminds me of a small dorm room, but it serves my purpose just fine.  I've been so tired I just come in. shower, and go to bed.  The bathroom/shower area seems fairly clean and there is plenty of hot water and water pressure.  No issues here.  They have bliss products, but not in individual bottles - the shampoo and body wash are in dispensers like those you would find at the gym - a little ghetto in my opinion.  The bed itself kind of sucks - it reminds me of a big king-sized cot.  The blanket also sucks - it's a very thin blanket.Keyless entry did not work during my stay, but I've verified with SPG that this was an ongoing issue at many of their hotels.The gym is empty as hell and it's nice since you get it all to yourself, at least I did.  Theres a few cardio machines and a full weight rack, but as far as weight machines go - theres basically nothing.  Just one piece of crap machine that you wouldn't use at a real gym.  Die-hard fitness fanatics and gym rats should go elsewhere.Everyone seems to have a noise issue when staying here.  I am VERY VERY sensitive to noise (I wear earplugs to sleep every night) and it has not been an issue.  I live in NYC though, so maybe I'm used to the regular city noise.  I have heard no music and very,very faint bass which I think might be coming from the AC unit.A decent hotel in the heart of Uptown Charlotte that's very convenient to lots of places, especially as a business traveler.  There aren't many Starwood hotels to choose from and I haven't yet tried out the Le Meridien or Westin, but this one is not that bad if you have to end up staying here.A great place as well as a great staff.Very accommodating and helpful.Yvonne at the Front Desk was amazing.You couldn't have asked for a better person to Greet you at the Hotel!!!This place is in a great location in downtown Charlotte. You can pretty much walk to many restaurants and bars in the area.The room was nice but had some issues, which is the reason for 3 stars.While some people complained of noise, I did not experience any. Now this was on a Monday but they did leave some ear plugs, just in case. The toilet in my room never flushed all the way. I was not happy about having to double flush for everything. And every time I turned on the shower, I got hit with freezing water because there was no safe way to turn it on without getting wet. I also was not a huge fan of having to take an elevator up to floor 5, only to turn around and be in the lobby of the hotel to take it up to my room. They had a nice lobby though with a bar in the back and plenty of snacks/drinks for purchase.In all, for the price (I paid $240 for the night), it was a descent night sleep and right around everywhere I wanted to visit.This hotel has the perfect location since it's right at the epicenter. The beds aren't comfortable at all.I stayed at the Aloft hotel for 3 nights, the staff was excellent, and the reason it gets any stars at all, the rooms were average and the showers had bulk shampoo and soap. Our first room we stayed in had a very musty moldy smell, and a constantly leaking shower head. We still stayed in the room the first two nights until the A/C broke the second night. When we asked to be switched we were moved to another room no questions asked. This room smelled better, but had noticeable mold in the bathroom, honestly the location is great, not the parking, but it can get a bit noisy being above the epicenter and they even offer earplugs in the room. If you're looking for a nice relaxing hotel skip this one.An absolute must stay SPG property when in Charlotte.  Located directly in the center of the epicenter in uptown, you are dead in the middle of the entertainment district, with quick access to restaurants and nightlife literally outside of the hotel. As for amenities, it's an aloft, so it's a bit limited but still a nice size room (standard rooms) with no real suite availability aside from larger rooms made for handicap access.If location is important to you, it's the right decision!My husband and I stayed at the Aloft for 4 days while we were visiting Carowinds.  Originally we had planned on staying close to the theme park, but at the last minute we decided to see what we could find close to City Center so that we'd have more to do while we were there.  I found a great rate through the hotel's website that was much cheaper than the other hotels in the area, so we decided to give it a shot.  The location (Epicenter) of the hotel was perfect for exploring Uptown.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and only had to use our car when we went to Carowinds.  The rooms, although on the small side, were also very nice.  However, because this hotel is located in the Epicenter, the elevators were a problem.  From your room you have to take the elevator down to the lobby and then switch to another elevator to get to street level or to the parking garage.  This wouldn't have been a problem, except since the Aloft is a part of the Epicenter, the elevators were always full and we had to wait an especially long time to get to/from our room.  Another issue that we had with this hotel was that we opted out of room service in order to receive a $5/night credit which we were told could be used for anything we purchased at the hotel.  However, after ordering drinks at the WXYZ Bar, they wouldn't allow us to use the vouchers for alcohol, so we ended up having to pay full price for our drinks and had no choice but to use the credit on overpriced snacks in the lobby.  Next time we travel to Charlotte, I'll probably do a little more research and try to find a similarly priced hotel in the immediate area, but in the event that I can't, back to the Aloft it will be.  Overall, especially for the price, it was a good choice.Cool Hotel. It was right in the center of the action.Average hotel.  Room size was plentiful along with a large bathroom; however, building maintenance seemed a little lacking.  Room condition made it somewhat obvious that the hotel sees a lot of traffic and hence gets its fair share of wear and tear (particularly the carpets).  Showers come with bulk shampoo and soap dispensers rather than the typical individually packaged variety - felt like the quality was not as good.This was my first stay at an Aloft brand hotel and it seems to target a younger crowd.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but not as relaxing a vibe for working travelers.  Just thought it would be of higher quality particularly given the Starwood Property affiliation.I want to give this less stars, I really do, but I am trying to be fair. The hotel itself is decent. It's in downtown Charlotte and you really are in the center of everything. There are a ton of restaurants in the area and it seems like there's plenty to do. We were even able to walk to our friend's wedding a couple of blocks away. It would be nice if they would make it clear to guests how to get in to their hotel and where to park. We circled around for a bit before we realized that the valet outside could be used for the hotel (although it is not specific to the hotel..it's for the whole Epicentre). The parking garage is the same way. My main issue is, you guessed it, the noise level. I have never had a worse experience in a hotel in my life. There are clubs and bars around, as I mentioned before, and one in particular blasted their music so loud that we could feel the base inside our room. I asked the front desk when we could expect a little more quiet, and wasn't given much of an answer other than, ""They usually change the music after midnight and don't close until 2"". I mentioned that customers should really be warned about this, and they said, ""Oh, this is on our website."" I looked for it...it's not an easy warning to find. And the warning makes it sound like it would only affect ""light sleepers and that it's just a little city noise. No. Anyone who can hear would have issues sleeping in a place like this. Manhattan doesn't sound like this. Even with the sound machine and ear plugs the hotel so kindly provided to us when we complained, I could hear it. It even got louder. I called again, and they told us they did not have another room for us to switch to, so we had to tough it out. I've traveled throughout the country and to many places abroad, and by far, this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had.I'm sure a lot of people love this place, but whenever I stay at an Aloft, I feel like I am staying overnight in an Ikea store.  If you like Ikea-style modern furniture, you probably love this hotel chain.  I'm rather ambivalent to their style - although I do like the low platform beds.  I also appreciate the effort they make to promote minimalist/green furnishings and services.. But I think the rates are typically a little high for getting minimalist rooms.As for he Aloft in Charlotte, location is awesome.. Central uptown location attached the epicenter complex, so you can walk out the door and walk to anything you want.I only gave Aloft Charlotte 3 stars because the street noise is bizarrely loud (they actually give you ear plugs when you check in!) and the front desk was a mix of uber-polite with an air of snootiness.  I'm sure some people love this place because of but it's not really for me.So, it's weird.... the hotel itself is ok. Not SUPER clean, but completely fine. I usually stay at the Westin and it was unavailable on this trip. Charles at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful. However, check out time is noon. They ask you at the front desk if that is the time you expect to check out. I said yes because I knew I'd be doing some work from the hotel room the next morning before my meeting at 12. From 9 am to 11:30 am, I had not one, not two but THREE employees try to barge into my room with a key in order to clean it. Luckily I had the metal latch over it. Each time I would say, ""Hey, I have a 12 oclock check out"" and they wouldn't even apologize, they just walked away. In fact, the LAST person to do it, a hispanic woman, I looked out through the peep hole and said, ""I have a 12 oclock check out, please leave me alone. Check your list."" I could see through the peep hole that she gestured at me out of frustration. I can't tell if it was the middle finger, or just gesturing her hand out of frustration but that really made me mad. I mean, I called down to the front desk to tell them and they said, ""Sorry, yes we have you written down as a 12 oclock check out"" well then why are three people trying to barge into my room? It's unacceptable. I could tell they just wanted to get done and leave but guess what, maybe you shouldn't have a 12 oclock check out if none of your employees can respect it.I live in Charlotte.....however Ive always wanted to stay at this hotel. So I booked it for this weekend to celebrate my Birthday. I mostly enjoyed the Wxyz Lounge which overlooks the Epicenter.Cool hotel right in the heart of the epicenter. Very hip and not as stuffy as the Westin down the street. Can walk outside your hotel and you have a bunch of restaurants and bars along with a few convenience stores. Lots of available taxi cabs and ubers if you need to go somewhere around charlotte. Taxi to and from the airport in an uber x is about 10 bucks and in taxi or uber black car it's about 30. Staff was super nice and the maid staff didn't come knocking on our doors at 8am which was nice. Room is a tad small, wish I had a bit more room for a work station, but the bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean. Elevators are a bit of a pain as they are a tad slow which got frustrating but it was a busy week in Charlotte. Parking is 20 bucks in the epicenter lot for overnight parking as well. So factor that into your stay. Still a great spot and my go-to when in Charlotte.My first time in Charlotte. When I pulled up looking for the hotel I was a little worried. The first thing I saw was the bus stop, with a lot of people hanging out. There aren't many signs at eye level while driving that point you into the garage that is for the hotel. Once I parked, there is no help for your luggage. So you have to take your luggage up yourself, to the front desk. Once in the lobby, things got better. It was an up to date lobby, a modern look with a pool table, bar area and snack area. The room was reasonable for a discounted price at a downtown hotel, and they provide free WIFI. My room was a decent size, I still don't understand why a fridge is provided in hotels but no microwave. But having the fridge was convenient for drinks. I enjoyed the EpiCentre area with all the restaurants, clubs, bars,bowling and everything else in the ""enclosed"" area. It was good to see it frequented by many types of people, and it felt safe. I staff was great, the maids were very nice. But when I checked out I left my charger with my 4 rechargeable batteries in the wall in the bathroom. I was told it was not seen, so I took the loss on that. If I stay there again I would make sure I do not leave anything, I would not trust the maid service staff. Also I will not let them into my room until I checkout of the hotel. If this did not happen, I would have rated them a 4. Sorry but integrity and trustworthiness are very important to me when I stay in hotels, since I travel with very expensive electronics. Danny TI'm a huge fan of Starwood and stay at their properties whenever I can.  The Aloft Charlotte was a little tough to find using my GPS, but I called and they walked me in over the phone.  Great location and extra-friendly staff.  Amenities galore and right in the Epicentre!  I'll be back.I enjoyed myself here this past weekend. The room was clean and comfortable. The price was very affordable. Their location is central to everything downtown. The hotel concierge and bar staff was very friendly and accommodating. Joey was very friendly and helped me with my computer, faxing, and printing requests. I will be back to this hotel. The Aloft hasn't disappointed in Charlotte or Charleston.Pros: - Brand consistent - Solid location at Epicenter - Decent gym but they have passes to golds for 10 - Great breakfast optionsCons - Firm bed. Less W and more CourtyardOverall, I'd stay here againAs others have stated, this is a clean, comfortable, modern hotel.It was a bit hard to find - I had to call the front desk and have them guide me over the phone to the valet parking area in front of a restaurant - I was not aware that the hotel's first floor is five levels up.I arrived around 10:00 pm or so on a Wedneday evening and had the valet park my car. I took the elevator up and checked in. The young lady at the check in desk was very nice - she promised me a nice quiet room on the 11th floor. Famous last words.The room was clean and comfortable. I set up my MacBook Pro on the desk, jacked into ethernet, checked my e-mail and got a little work done. The room had a flat panel HD TV, dedicated HVAC unit, mini-fridge (located oddly in the bathroom area), two phones, a clock, etc. The HD TV did not appear to come with very many HD channels as far as I could tell - mostly standard def channels.I tried to fall asleep around midnight. I kept hearing loud music, laughter, yelling, and more. Finally, in desperation, at 1:15 am, I called the front desk and inquired as to what the hell was going on. I was informed that the night club next door closed at 2:00 am. I was offered ear plugs and I believe, a white noise machine.  I have my own white noise app on my iPad, I fired that up, but it was not enough to drown out the racket.I was so aggravated, that when the music stopped (at 2:15 am) and then another 15-20 minutes afterward of drunken yelling outside - that I could not get to sleep until about 4:00 am.The next morning as I was checking out, the lady at the front desk asked me how my stay was. I was also buying a few bottles of water at that moment to take with me. I explained about the noise and that it was unacceptable, and that I would in all likelihood never stay at their hotel again. She apologized and comped the three bottles of water and one bottle of soda I was going to buy.If you want an opportunity to sleep at night - this IS NOT the hotel for you.Overall, a clean, comfortable hotel and nice staff - but if you care about restful sleep - go elsewhere.","Became trapped in my bathroom! (Don't panic, it was a good experience despite this) I got myself out of the situation and all is well and I realize how this FLUKE incident occurred and that it was immediately corrected. It's how they went about correcting it that I want to emphasize here... Every member of the staff who heard of this was very concerned. Frank, a manager, was in my room to examine the situation within moments of my call and the engineer was on scene within 5 minutes. Further, the senior manager personally came to my room to apologize and make amends. The 5 stars represent the delivery of amazing service from the staff.  I travel a lot, so belive me when I say things always go wrong. The fact that the staff showed so much genuine concern, and acted promptly to remediate the situation is what will bring me back to Aloft.This was my 2nd time staying at Aloft. Love the contemporary look and the rooms are always clean.  If you are a light sleeper, this may not be the hotel for you since it is right beside the EpiCenter and you also hear the sirens all night long.  Great location for walking to everything...we parked the car on Friday and didn't move it until Sunday!  Parking is pricey...$20/day!  Getting ice was inconvenient...in baggies in a fridge in the lobby.  With all that said, I would definitely stay here again!I'm normally a fan of Aloft hotels but this one didn't meet my expectations. I guess if you want to stay as close to downtown Charlotte as possible this is the ticket, but otherwise it was a bit of a hassle. The place is difficult to find, since it's basically on top of a mall. There is no free parking--Only $25  a day valet and $20 a day garage (with no in and out privileges). I get that it's in a dense part of town but the SPG website didn't make this fact clear. At $200 a night for the hotel I didn't find unexpectedly having to pay that much for parking acceptable. The place is also pretty loud due to its location. Otherwise it's pretty much your standard Aloft so if you like the brand you'll feel at home. The rooms and common areas were clean and well maintained though, which of course is always nice.I do agree with the fact that this place isn't the easiest to find and they should do a better job about signage on where to park etc to get into the main lobby. I drove around a couple times on busy streets trying to figure it out before taking a chance and ended up being correct.Once inside I enjoyed they place. It's an aloft so... ya, you know what to expect. But the rooms was set up a little different compared to other alofts I've been to. The room had a bit of a European feel with little nooks for conveniences i.e. an ironing tucked into the side of the headboard. Probably annoying if you're looking for the ironing board but a nice modern touch otherwise.Being in the center of everything, there's a walkway that connects to a center with a food court and coffee etc... very convenient. If you are looking for location for an affordable price, you can't go wrong here.Staff is friendly but lack knowledge on the nearby food that delivers. which is nessesary for a place that does not have room service or a restaurant.   I realize there are restaurants surrounding the place but the staff did not have or care to share with me any knowledge about any of them.  They kept referring me to a website called <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodiecall.com&amp;s=3b4ec092753de9fca1b849804b3f7b32b47e78da9718343e27f857d44f2d8a99"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">foodiecall.com</a> which I don't have time to deal with. Aside from that it's your standard aloft room. Pretty uncomfortable if your traveling with more than one person. There is just the bed to sit in and a wooden chair. So if two friends want to watch TV or eat together one has to sit on the bed while another on a chair. They also need more suites in this hotel as they only have one. I will say that It is kept pretty clean and everything seems to be in good shapeIf you're heading to Crown Town, the EpiCentre is decidedly where prep boys, bballers, high heeled chicks, and university bar crawlers flock. In other words, it's not exactly my cup of tea, but if you're sans car, this area offers plenty in the way of food, drink, and entertainment (depending on how you get your kicks). The Aloft hotel is smack in the middle of the madness and offers you a nice nest perched atop the Epicentre. Also worth noting, the surrounding area of Uptown plays host to lots of great restaurants and bars. I often pick Aloft whenever possible. It's affordable, offers Bliss bathroom products, a loft-like vibe and looks like the W's teeny bopper little sister.Location, location, location!It's a hotel.  It's a place to sleep.  You don't get a hotel smack dab in the middle of things and expect to hole up do you?  There may be noise...and there may not be, depending on when you're staying.For me, the experience was nice.  The wife and I caught a play, watched the game, and visited a couple of pubs for my birthday celebration.The front desk was kind and helpful, the rooms were clean and modern.  Things can always be better, but this was affordable and worth my dollars.I will be back.This is just a regular ol' hotel that looks like it was decorated with Ikea furniture/decor. The staff was very upbeat and friendly and it was very convenient to be able to walk to the CVS when we realized we'd forgotten ALL of our toiletries. If you like to go out and have late night fun at bars, clubs, and shops, this hotel is super convenient.The rooms are pretty small, but the flat screen tv and king sized bed were nice. My one big complaint is, if you don't know your way around Uptown, this hotel is hard to find. They only have one sign and it is facing the wrong way down a one-way street! The only way to see, if you are driving, is if you're going the wrong way! I called the hotel and the man trying to give me directions kept giving me landmarks, which, clearly, I did not know. He told me several times that it was above the epicenter. Well, sure if I knew where or what the Epicenter is, that might help. Unfortunately, I'm from out of town and need a little more than that.Other than that debacle, we enjoyed our stay. :)The Front Desk staff is the antithesis of hospitality. When checking in, we were informed that, without reservation, there was a walkin rate of ""x"" per night, after pulling up a reservation of ""y"" per night on Expedia. With no ""option"" to honor a competitive rate, we were made to literally sit in the lobby, book the reservation through a third party and then wait another 10 minutes for the reservation to populate in the aloft system. The gentleman, ""Dee,"" who assisted us was one of the least accommodating people in the business, busy on his personal phone half the time and second only to his a.m. counterparts who were equally displeasing at checkout. These people are your first and last impression, aloft- get it together. Your employees just earned you a scathing Yelp! review, a vacation horror story in customer service and about 20 less future customers, in the immediate. Congrats!My wife booked an evening for us here on my birthday.  If you've ever been to a W hotel, you get a sense of deja vu as soon as you enter the doors of Aloft because it reminds you of the W, but it's not the W.  I later found out that Aloft was bought by the W, which explained a lot.  I think of it as a ""W lite"".  The downtown location is close to shopping, dining, sports (Bank of America Stadium and TWC Arena where the Hornets play), and the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Aloft would be a great choice for your next trip to Charlotte.The comments about finding the location is true.  We circled the block several times.  When we called for directions, we were simply given the same address we already had.  There was no street level signs to direct you, and with traffic and construction it was a bit of a process.When I checked in, the room was a standard Aloft room.  Nothing over the top.  However, when I reported my toilet didn't work, I was assured by the front desk (a young lady who was talking to her co workers) that it would be fixed.  IT WAS NOT.  For two days, I didn't have a working toilet nor did they offer to change my room.  I was out (Thank Goodness) for most of the day/ night but I did end up checking out early because I was so frustrated and grossed out.The bar was great and the bar tender was even better.  Thank goodness for her and public restrooms.Aloft offered me points to apologize.  Via email.  No follow up in person, which would have almost been nicer than the  points.Very bad experience. Mattress was stained, bathroom door was peeling and front desk staff were rude when they were informed of the issues.Great location, walking distance anywhere in Uptown. Lots of bars and entertainment right outside the door. Nice, modern room, big windows with nice view (mine from the 11th floor). Good coffee machine with free drinks in the morning.On the flip side, it wasn't immediately obvious how to get there from the street. The internet was veeeery sloooooow. Some of the breakfast choices were way to small for their price (hint - go for the breakfast sandwiches, they seem to be of better value). Those big windows came with pretty cheap blinds, both of which broke.I expected the hotel to be noisy, since it's part of an entertainment complex. They even provided earplugs among the in-room amenities. So I won't hold that against them. I even kind of enjoyed the Prince cover-band that was performing seemly right outside my sixth-floor window Tuesday night.The noise was compounded by periodic banging from the nearby elevator, but someone's got to be near the elevator, and with the amount of money I saved with Hotwire I can live with a poorly-situated room.But the large, recently dried puddle of (spaghetti sauce? pizza sauce? barf?) just inside the door was not ok. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to clean it up. Despite reassurances, no one showed up. It was late, I was tired, so I covered it with a bath towel so I wouldn't forget and step on it in the middle of the night, and assumed housekeeping would take care of it the next day.The AC cycled on and off all night, even after I turned it off at the thermostat. In a way, it was OK because it masked the other noises when it was on. But even after fiddling with it the next day I couldn't figure out how to make it stay off. Look, I totally understand why hotels have inoperable windows now, especially in rooms that have puddles of (spaghetti sauce? yeah, I'm just going to stick with spaghetti sauce, even though there were suspiciously semi-digested particles in there) on the floor. But I really do think rooms with inoperable windows should have operable thermostats.My morning coffee was postponed when I found a previous guest's used coffee grounds in the coffee machine. There was no shampoo or conditioner in the room. There was a liquid soap dispenser in the shower, but it looked like a previous guest had torn off the shampoo dispenser. Maybe they were drunk, almost fell in the shower, accidentally ripped down the shampoo dispenser while steadying themselves, stumbled out into the room, and barfed on the floor. Or not. I'm really just speculating.It didn't matter very much that there was no shampoo because I don't actually have any hair to speak of. Maybe they only rent that room to bald people, so that's all right then.Housecleaning did not take care of the (I'm pretty sure it was barf), though the rest of the room did get cleaned. They helpfully picked up the towel that I had covered up the (barf) mess with, so I put another down over it. The coffee maker was cleaned, but there were no cups or creamer. I'm not really complaining about two days without morning coffee, because I'm from Portland and that means I don't drink any coffee that isn't organic, fair-trade, and lovingly hand-ground by a hipster. But (and I feel sheepish about this) I do like to run the coffee maker so the room smells like coffee while I'm getting dressed, and I was able to do that even without cups or creamer. Maybe they only rent that room to bald people from Portland, so that's all right then.The rest of the hotel seemed pretty nice, and the staff were very friendly and pleasant, even when they weren't apologizing about the condition of my room. In fact, I stopped complaining after the first night and morning, because at some point it just seems pointless, and the staff were even more pleasant thereafter. Just FYI, I would not stay here again.This place has so much going for it yet I would never  ever stay here again. Location is great, nice views, from room, good aesthetics, and the one staffer I spoke to was nice but she may be running the whole hotel. My room had a smell that reminded me of my high school football locker which, after telling the staff about the smell and being assured house keeping would attend to the room while I went out to dinner, smelled like my high school locker room after people sprayed lots of deodorant and cologne. I almost choked on the new smell more than the old one when I reentered the room. I'm worried this is the hotel's idea of cleaning the room. The hotel has few amenities excluding an in house restaurant, but I was assured sushi could be ordered from some place near by and was given a discount card to a pub which smelled a lot like my room. Given how tired I am from not being home for a week and that I am only here for 12 hours asking for a new room or to be relocated to any other Starwood hotel in a 5 mile radius seems pointless. Just going to take an extra long shower I the morning and keep my sox on. Wish me luck!This place was nice and clean. The lobby makes you feel like you are in some Euro-club. The smell in the lobby was also very pleasant. We did not like the lobby being on the 5th floor. That was weird. It was also somewhat difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area. Parking was odd. If you valet, you can have your car any time you want. If you park on your own, you have to pay each time you go in and out. It was kind of annoying. We had our 1 year old and her pack and play. They were very accommodating and gave us a handicapped accessible room so we would have plenty of room.The price was right and the room was nice. Very comfy bed!Pros:  Great locationCool, modern roomsFriendly staffCons:No room serviceSmall gymStayed here for 2 nights on business in late January 2014.  I was very impressed with the location.  Firstly because it was right across the Bank of America Plaza which meant I had to commute about 2 minutes door to door.  Second, because the EpiCentre is a great place to hang out and has pretty much anything you might be looking for as far as food, drinks, etc.  The room had a modern layout and was well-lit.  The staff was very friendly, especially Dimaris, who helped me at check-out.  She was very friendly and helpful.The only downside was their lack of room service.  Personally, one of the best things about staying in hotels is the room service.  It wasn't a HUGE deal because, as I stated earlier, the EpiCentre has no shortage of food options.Also, the gym was pretty small, even by hotel standards.  But, at least it was open 24 hours.  If the few machines were used, I'd come back in about 20 minutes and try my luck again.  No biggy.Based on location alone, I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody.  I'll probably stay there again next time I'm in Charlotte.This is a fun hotel. The rooms are simple and modern. I wish room service was an option and I don't love that I had to pay $6 for a banana and a bottle of water in their little snack area in the lobby.Their front desk staff were great. Very friendly and helpful when I needed a room change to one with two beds instead of one. The maid service was good, although their ""green"" hangers are confusing. They say to place the hanger on your door by 2:00 am and they won't wash your linens. Not only did they not wash the linens, but they didn't even enter my room. I reread the sign and it said exactly that, so I'm not sure if they aren't informed or if the sign was printed incorrectly.Night life is fantastic here. Not only in this hotel, but in the entire EpiCentre. We had a blast here and went to several spots in the complex, but most of our time was spent at the W XYZ bar in the Aloft. The bartender was great and super friendly. I would definitely stay here again. The location can't be beat and the staff was great. I am more of a room service/full service hotel type of girl, but this was really fun for a weekend away.My girlfriend and I stayed there April 6. She made the reservations with her card but when we got there I paid with mine. The next day she had a 471.00 charge on her credit cart. I looked at my statement and the charge for the room was there. She called the aloft to dispute the charge, she left several voicemails for the manager over the following weeks never to get a return call. After contacting her bank the bank made a three-way call with her and the aloft. Aloft admitted it was their error and the bank put the money back into her account. Then a few weeks ago the aloft sent a letter to the bank saying the charges were correct and demanding the money. So she spent her whole day off at the bank clarifying the mistake. The bank also wanted a copy of my receipt. So I called the aloft and they tried to connect me to a manager but got voicemail. Since she had left several voicemails never to get a call back we decided just to head up there. Did get the receipt a manger came out, no apologizes just kind of a dumbfounded look on his face after spending countless hours on the phone, a day and a half trying to fix this thing (which still not sure it's fixed) we actually had to ask the aloft to at least validate our parking. The mix up was cause by two women having the same last name . Don't' they check room number or verify.I had a really hard time finding this hotel.  Although I could see the sign very high up on the 5th floor, I could not figure out where to park.  It took two phone calls and the front desk navigating me by phone to get there.  It's a great location, right in the center of everything in Uptown.  I did not stay on a night when the bars were hopping, so I did not have the problem with noise.  Front desk staff was very pleasant.  I'm not sure if I will stay here again if my regular hotel was not available.  The next day we did see a young male drag queen doing the walk of shame as he strutted toward the elevator.  He also looked to be high as a kite and tried to put the moves on my colleague.","While visiting a friend here in CLT to celebrate his 40th birthday with him, I stayed overnight in the aloft Charlotte Uptown at the EpiCentre. I had a great stay. I had stayed in an aloft property before (in Chapel Hill) and liked it. This one did not disappoint either. They are a Starwood Preferred Guest property, for those with rewards accounts and use those programs.You know what they always say...location, location, location. This hotel is in a great location! Right in the middle of Uptown (Charlotte's word for their downtown area, I am thinking). More so, it is attached or a part of the Epicenter complex with many shops and eateries to sample while you are there. I took advantage of this item when I checked out and the Brugger's Bagel Bakery was right there and open early to get breakfast at before heading to the train station. Bonus. I can see it would be convenient for any downtown or sporting event. Love the location. The lobby and bar area fit the aloft mold, lots of color, lights, very modern and trendy. I like the concept, very upbeat and an exciting look. Every aloft I think has the bar call wxyz lounge and this one was no exception. Pool tables, nice lounge area, and even a little ""convenience store"" for late night munchies or other needs. The staff were nice and accomodating, no problems with service this stay. They were full the night before and still had a room ready for me well before the 3pm check in (I think I was in by 2pm at the latest). The rooms are simple but Euro-hip in design. I like their concept. If you are looking for luxury or a large suite situation, this place is not for you. But if you want a nice room, modern trendy hip in design, and comfortable to boot, this will work for you. A nice desk for you use is there, a flat screen TV, and bonus of an AV box that lets you plug in your iPod/iPhone/iPad or other AV device to work through the TV if you like. Nice. A good comfortable bed, and the alarm clock is very trendy analog clock, it is nice to see those still around, it fits the room decor well. There is a large dressing area/basin outside the bathroom itself, but a small closet space there. In the bath, there is a large (oversized I dare say) shower with glass doors/enclosure. You don't have to fiddle with the small itty-bitty bottles for shampoo, soap, etc. as there nice wall dispensers for both there (I would think this is eco-friendly as well). Only one small speedbump I would mention and that is the parking situation. It's a bit tricky to find the entry to the parking deck and entrance to the aloft, and it is actually around the College and 4th corner side of the complex. Finding the correct elevator to go all the way up to the 5th floor that contains aloft is the next challenge, we picked the wrong one first that went only to 4. We were also told that getting out to pay for parking, there would be an attendant...there was not one we found. We did figure out there were automated machines that would settle your bill with your card it issued, luckily. That's one area I'd work on, if any, that whole situation of parking and getting to the hotel once parked.But all in all, I liked my stay at the aloft CLT and would stay there again.So I had a late flight due to weather made me miss my connection to Asheville, Soooooo....it was a hotel for  the night and I just picked Aloft as I hadn't been there before.Sitting right in the middle of EpiCenter, this the place to be if you want food and fun with your hotel.The lobby is funky, open, and hip....there is also little shopping section that you can get just about anything.  Plus they also have a poolRooms are hip and cool but some items in the room seem cheap.   Free USA todays or Wall Street JournalsMy room was affordable considering it was a last minute booking earlier on that day (Friday)....around $120 buck (via Priceline on my mobile phone)Pet friendly - no charges for pets!  Unfortunately, that also means a smelly designated pet room.  The cleanliness wasn't exactly top notch either.  I also missed not having a whirlpool tub that I love to get into during week long hotel stays.The lobby is cute modern and looks like a fun place to hang out and the location is the best in uptown....You're right in the epicentre and surrounded by lots of dining and entertainment.Valet is expensive at $25 per day.I wish the hotel offered nicer rooms.My mom's house being full of temporarily boomeranging family members might be one of the best things that's ever happened to me, mainly because that meant that R and I had to stay in a hotel when we visited over Thanksgiving. So we brushed off some Starwood points and headed uptown. Our room was clean, had an HD TV, and a great view, so I was satisfied. I also loved the huge showerhead that made for an even rain and the little bar of soap at the sink that smelled amazing.BUT, I thought the lighting was a bit harsh (I know it's a modern hotel, but that doesn't mean you can't have warm lighting); not all of the TV channels were in HD, which distorted picture of the analog channels, and you can't steal the soaps since they're stuck the wall gym-shower style. I consider those things minor in the grand scheme, and since we declined turndown service, we even got some of our SPG points back. Score! We'd definitely stay again if we had to.I stayed here last weekend and was not disappointed. Since it's at the Epicenter it is a great location. The rooms are nice and everyone who worked there was very welcoming and helpful. The only bad thing was having to take two different elevators to get from the hotel room to the car. Overall I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone who asked.Was very hard to find, room was nice and clean, but we had to call maintenance twice to change a light bulb and turn the heat on in the room, the other inconvenience was, we didn't know we had to take 2 elevators to get to and from our room, which we did a lot.There was a fridge in the room, no microwave, have to go to the main floor to heat up food, and get ice. We had a two night stay, and paid $$$, I really expected more bang for my buck, I'm pretty sure I will not be staying here again, the best part of this stay in my opinion was the view and the cleanliness.Great location and clean rooms. Room was freezing, even with the heat on high! Brrrrr!!!!!!I've driven by the Aloft Chapel Hill many times and thought, wow, that place looks kind of pretentious and what a strange place to put sort of a swanky hotel.  Well, my family had the opportunity this past weekend to stay at the one in Charlotte and I have to say, it was pretty nice. The man at the front desk was friendly at our check-in, though, it was early on a Friday and he already seemed a little overwhelmed.  The lobby is hip, mod, exactly what you would imagine. There was a pool table, a bar, a large lounge area and a little pantry-shop area.  The elevator was pumped full of not your grandma's elevator tunes kind of music, made us wanna boogie a little :)  And now, to our room... ahh, a mom's dream, hardly a sharp corner or exposed wire to be had! The bed was simple, clean, not too many pillows, not too high off the ground... actually the perfect height for my little guy to practice turning around and sliding off on his belly, feet first--yay!  I'm a nerd-mom, sorry.  The bathroom was super-sleek with just the bare necessities: Bliss soap and lotion, cups, tissues, coffee/tea, oh, and magazines-- National Geographic and Dwell-- nice touch.  I liked that they had their Bliss shampoo and conditioner in containers attached to the wall in the shower, that definitely seems more efficient.  The sink was a nice bowl type, keeps the potential for a watery mess to a minimum.  My son of course found the secret shelves where the ironing board and iron were hidden away, I mean, not really hidden, but sort of. I just really appreciate simple and well designed spaces and this place ranked pretty high for me, at least as far as what I've been exposed to thus far in my life.  Yep, Aloft, I'm a fan.I'm late on reviewing, but I have a good memory! :)As a surprise for New Year's Eve last year, my boyfriend decided to book us a room for the night. This was my first time staying at an aLoft hotel.  I am a huge fan of the modern style and amenities they offer.  The Epicenter is so lucky to have this hotel on its property.The hotel itself, room &amp; bathroom area were all clean. Which of course is a HUGE plus!The downside for us was it was too loud. We were on the top floor &amp; yes, I am fully aware it was NYE &amp; drunk people were staying there. Lucky for us, we didn't come into the room until almost 2 AM, but it made going to sleep really troublesome.  Also, upon checking out, you have to pay for parking. THAT in itself is so wack to me.  I have to agree with some of the points John R. made in his review.  Seems he was just there on a  regular night &amp; had the same issues we encountered.I would recommend staying here to out of towners; however, I don't see myself staying here again since I'm a Charlotte area resident.The good:The decor is cute, the bed is comfy, the price is lower than you would expect for the location and the location is AWESOME, right in the center of Downtown in the Epi-Centre. You can get delivery from Wild Wings, Jason's Deli and Some Italian place..  and there is a great little lobby bar and food area where you can make yourself Espressos and grab breakfast.  The VIEW is great! I was on the 10th floor and you could see all the action below. It is a very pretty city. It was a great place to get ready to go out to the clubs, sleep then get up and get ready to head to the office, I was central to everything I needed to get to and had I not been wearing high heels everyday could easily have walked to everything as well. The decor gets another mention because it is like being in a NYC loft, super modern, super cool, very sexy...The Bad:The lobby is on the 5th floor and the only way to get to it without making your way up the stairs (with your bags) is on the two VERY SLOW AND SMALL elevators that also service clubs and restaurants. When a conference lets out and you have tons of people trying to get to their rooms, you can wait for the elevator a good 20 minutes. It sucked when two times I was there ONE of the elevators was broken! If it had been more like 2 or 3 flights I would have made the hike, but 5? Meh.. The other down side is that the room has no minibar, no room service and the desk is way over to one side, so you cannot work and watch tv at the same time and it is shower only, no tub.The housekeeping was sub standard, I noticed that the first day I didn't have a face bar of soap and the second day one appeared. i always carry my own stuff, but those sort of inconsistencies always get noticed by me. I also noticed that they didn't put the hair dryer back where it was when they cleaned the room, they left it on the desk chair where I had set it in my rush out the door. I love when the room is back to PERFECT when you return after a hard day.. that is what makes a hotel a HOTEL...The Ugly:The only thing I can see that was REALLY bad and the reason this isn't getting more stars from me is that when I got in, I had to work, SHOCKER.. anyway, we were in the lobby area and the free wifi wouldn't let us in, it took three people and about 40 minutes to get us online, by which time my work partner had two glasses of wine and was useless! :( So we didn't get much work done that night as planned.We scored an amazing deal to this hotel and were happy with what we got. It's hyper-super modern on the inside and with the amenities they offer.Yes, yes, yes, the elevators here are insanely slow but who really cares. You shouldn'tThe rooms are furnished nicely, in a, I want to shop at Kartell, but I only have an Ikea budget. It looks great, but the quality isn't totally there.A few things you need to know. It's loud here because the walls/doors are thing, but also because the hotel is in Epicentre and people stay here to party there and crash for the night. If you're annoyed by young people fistpumping your door at 2am, you might want to look elsewhere.The proximity to epicentre was one of the reasons we loved this place. Lots of fun bars and restaurants next door, but you can walk to even better places in uptown just a few blocks away.I'd say this hotel is worth it if you want to be in the middle of the action. Check Hotwire because they're on there a bunch. I think we paid around $60-70 per night!Entirely to noisy; traffic noise 8 floors below drifts through the paper-thin walls. The location at Epicenter is great, if you are going to be one of the drunk loudmouths.  Otherwise, don't get your hopes up.  Clean, yes. Nice staff, yes.  Quiet, not by any reasonable definition.  Go to the Hampton Inn and walk 3 blocks to dinner.the aloft charlotte uptown is positioned right atop charlotte's epicentre; the ""hub"" for dining and recreation in downtown charlotte. as you can see, most yelpers choose to focus on the close proximity to clubs, bars, and restaurants. however, it seems several had the misfortune to be stuck on the ""loud side,"" above the aforementioned clubs, bars, and restaurants, and couldn't focus on anything but their lack of sleep. lucky for me, i was on the ""quiet side,"" and had no noise complaints. while in town for a work event, i needed to stay somewhere close to the convention center, and the ACU is perfectly positioned within walking distance. it's a very modern hotel, with oversize walk-in showers instead of bathtubs, an edgy bar in the lobby, and flat-screen tvs in every room. they are super dog-friendly, and i had fun watching the pooches pass by while i waited in the lobby. however, the bed was not as comfy as I'd expect from a W hotel; the pillows in particular were of two varieties, both unpleasant - either cylindrical bolster pillows that were hard as a rock, or limp, under-filled feather pillows that had to be folded in half in order to achieve comfort. $139/night was a great rate, but you'd think it would at least afford me a decent pillow.i'd stay at the ACU again for work, but not on my own dime. there's the likelihood of getting a room on the ""loud side,"" coupled with having to bring my own pillow, so i might as well get my starwood points at the westin down the street.I lived in Charlotte for a couple of years, and have since relocated back to Boston. I was recently back in Charlotte for a wedding, and decided to stay at Aloft in the Epicenter. I was very familiar with the area, so I had no problem finding the hotel. The lobby was on the 5th floor, which is different, but man is it beautiful. The lobby is spacious, with each ""room"" holding something different - a pool table, bar, computer work stations, a 24/7 kitchen type area where you can purchase food any time, day or night. I arrived a little early and was hoping to check in early since the wedding was on the early side - not a problem! Room ended up being on the 14th floor, and I'm pretty sure 15 is the top. The room overlooked the Epicenter, with the Time Warner Cable arena in view also. This hotel and its rooms are so modern and trendy - flat screen tv mounted on the wall with a chaise lounge underneath, 2 desks, king size bed. One thing that was new to me was the way the bathroom was set up - the sink and mirrors were opposite where you could hang your clothes, the coffee/water cart - all wide open. Next to that was the toilet, and the door that closes you off from the rest of the room is a little sliding door. Past that is the glass door shower, with an amazing shower head, shampoo/conditioner and body wash dispensers mounted to the wall (so you can't steal them, darn!), and a small sample of Bliss Spa body lotion and hand soap. The price wasn't too expensive either, for what I was originally expecting! One major downfall - no room service. Yes, they have the 24/7 food area downstairs, but when I get back to my room, I don't want to have to walk back downstairs (lazy, I know).One thing to note if you are coming into town on a weekend - because this hotel is attached to the Epicenter, you will hear music and the bass beats from the clubs right there (Suite, Kazba, etc) all night long.Stayed here for 5 days for a business trip. As my coworker described it when she recommended it, ""It's the Ikea of hotels."" That's not a bad thing. It's just a statement about the modern, almost scandinavian, styling of the decor and the furnishings. For example, there are no closets and no drawers. There is a very small, shallow, curtained off elevated cubby-hole with an angled metal bar like you find in department stores to hang things up, and then there are two small cubby-holes with no doors, approximately 30"" wide by 16"" tall by 12"" deep where you could unpack your suitcase. It's just... I dunno... odd. I think most people would probably opt to just live out of their suitcase rather than deal with these cubbies that are down low, next to the ground. Not a huge negative... just different. My room was clean and everything worked, and by the time I went to sleep, it was pretty quiet. However, the Epicenter, where this is located, is very ""active"", and if you want quiet to work or whatever, I would recommend going as high as you can, and maybe towards the rear rather than the front, as outside noise can get loud. The hotel starts on the 5th floor of the building, so that's where the lobby is, and the first floor of rooms is the 6th floor. Particularly liked the ""refresh"" area in the lobby where you can pick from a large variety of light food and snacks. There are quite a few healthy choices as well as the usual suspects you would find in a hotel shop, plus complimentary coffee. The WiFi is free, but it's very slow, and you have to re-authenticate every 24 hours. If you opt to ""go green"" and not get fresh linens every day, they give you a $5 voucher every day but your last which can be used towards the food, or you can take the points if you are a member of their loyalty program.All in all, I would recommend this place if you are open to trying something a little different. If you are a hardened traveller that wants the traditional hotel experience with no surprises, you might want to look elsewhere. But really, after all, you just need a place to stay, right? Why not try something a little different, and give this place a shot?~3 star average for the aloft in Charlotte-- hotel location: 2 stars, hotel quality: 3 stars, parking: 1 star and customer service: 5 stars. I came here with my bf to stay overnight on a road trip en route to Georgia. aloft was by far, the cheapest and most stylin' hotel in the area. One of the initial downers is that your only realistic parking option parking is valet, which is about $20 a day. They're super attentive and friendly (as they should be, it's frickin valet for crying out loud) but if you end up staying there for a few days, it can really add up. Prior to booking, I had read reviews of the aloft that said that 1) the elevators are slow from the parking deck and 2) the lower levels of the hotel are loud. I can honestly say both are true. When we realized we could hear everything from our 5th floor room, we requested to move to a room as high up as possible. We were taken care of by a lovely desk clerk by the name of Chelsea who was pretty quick at assigning us a new room. The room itself is nothing out of the ordinary- it was fairly small, big screen tv, comfy bed and no funky smells- yay. The bathroom is stocked with BlissLabs shampoo/ conditioner and soaps which was a nice touch! I would have liked to hang out in the lobby area and shoot some pool but there were two dudes who monopolized the table the whole night we were there.No. I cannot give above 2 stars to a hotel whose internet is so slow you can't stream or even load pages with lots of content. Holiday Inn manages to do this, courtyards, motel 6s even, can manage to have fast internet, yet an SPG property billed as W light cannot.FIX YOUR INTERNET. I know that it is free, but I would rather pay for it if it would work.Also, they only have shampoo and conditioner in one. This is unacceptable if you are a girl. How much more can it possibly cost to have these separate? Location is GREAT, right in the epicentre. But this is a crappy hotel for what it bills itself as and how much it costs. Bed is lumpy, room set up is awkward and unappealing.Stay somewhere else if you are traveling on business. You will completely regret not staying at the Westin if you are SPG. It isn't much nicer, but again, the internet works and the people who run the front desk are professional.Pros:Free Wi-Fi that is half way decentGood selection of restaurants within walking distanceHelpful staffCons:Dirty carpet in the room, stains everywhereStains on the towels as wellFridge didn't keep anything cold, let alone coolThermostat didn't work, air conditioner was on all the time, even if I turned the thermostat offHave travelled a lot for work, and have never been in an area with more sirens in the middle of the nightI might stay here again, if I had to, but the fact that I didn't want to walk barefoot on the carpet, is incredibly gross.  Also made me where flip flops in the shower.Dear Potential Charlotte Aloft Hotel Guests,This is a lovely hotel.  I get what they are doing here, and I think it's pretty darn cool.  There are, however, several things to keep in mind when booking a room here.Wonderful things about the hotel:- High ceilings with great views of the skyline- Large shower that includes dispensers of shower gel and shampoo/conditioner (the combination stuff, not one of each)- Conveniently located in the middle of downtown Charlotte and right by both the bus depot and a train station- Lots of amenities - pool, workout room, pool table in the lobby, etc-  Staff was very friendly and helpful- Room was very clean- Free internet - both wifi and cable (this is something the other hotels in the SPG chain do not offer, so I was excited to find it here)- This is one of the best prices and values you can find in UptownThings that are not so wonderful about the hotel:- These are NOT the Sheraton/Westin beds.  They are ok, but do not expect the amazing comfort you would have at one of the other hotels in the SPG chain.- The noise.  One of the two nights the noise was nearly unbearable.  The ambient nightclub noise isn't bad - that's what we had our second night and it is very easily ignored.  I've stayed in hotels where the ambient street noise was much worse.  The first night we stayed here however, was a Friday and there was a band playing below us in the Epicenter.  Specifically, an Eagles cover band.  I know this not because we went down to see them play, but because it sounded like Hotel California and Desperado were being sung just for us on a platform outside our window.  My basic advice on the noise is to 1) check the schedule for the Epicenter and see if they have a band playing and 2) when you check in, ask for a room that isn't on the side of the middle of the Epicenter.Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel.  If I go back to Charlotte, I will likely stay here again, I would just check the band schedule as noted.  This is not a Sheraton/Westin and is not trying to be - it is something else entirely, but that something else is really fun.  The main carry-over from the rest of the SPG hotels is the excellent service and attention to detail, which make this hotel a pleasure to visit.The Aloft is a Chain of Hotels that is geared to the young crowd just out of college with their first bit of disposable income...everything about them tries to be fresh..hip..and fun...The Charlotte Location is the same as the others in that it has the staff dressed casually..techno music is blaring in ""the lobby""..numerous flat screens all over the place...front desk person is behind what  appears to be just a little information desk..just behind that person is  the hotel bar with all the casual couches and a Pool Table as well...definitely not your standard hotel check in area...the rooms are the same as well with The Aloft going for that modern fun look..flat screens mounted on the wall..no dressers..cubbyholes instead..imitation IKEA looking Furniture. retro alarm clock..Pedastal Sink in the bathroom area and a Shower that has a Glass Frosted Wall so your Partner in the room can watch you shower if that's your thing..where The Charlotte Aloft takes it up a notch and becomes an upscale Frat House is that it's located above The Epicentre(Lobby is on the 5th Floor of The Building)..you will near noise coming from the clubs till 2 AM..then for the next hour you will hear that distinctive repetitive ""WOOH WOOH"" that only packs of drunken females do after bars close...then from 3 to 5 AM the hallways and rooms of The Aloft become the site of the After-party for all the people that partied at The Epicentre and are staying at The Aloft...when they go to sleep at 6 the ""Regular people"" who mistakenly stayed here are getting up and moving, if they managed to sleep at all; so there is no quiet time at the hotel ...I imagine if one called The Front Desk complaining there is a loud party going on in one of the rooms at 4 AM;the response would be ""we know..isn't it great?"";because that's the whole scene The Aloft caters to...the only thing missing to truly make it the Party Frat House of Charlotte are Bluto..D-day..Flounder..and Otter...tough place to rate; because honestly if your between 20 and 30 and in Charlotte to party; this place's location,attitude and vibe would make it like The Valhalla of Hotels...On the other side of the spectrum though,.Families with Kids and Business People(unless they were in town on Monkey Business) would think they were in Hell..my advice is just know what you are getting into before you book here","I wanted to love this place being a big fan of W Hotels, but I just can't bring myself to recommend it.  Service is wonderful, the decor is ultra modern and sleek, has all the amenities for a high tech traveler including a place to jack in your computer and gadgets into the flat panel tv.  But it was just too damn loud.  I was on the 8th floor and like everyone else, couldn't sleep a wink until 2 am.  And it wasn't just loud, but the DJ was playing some crazy tripping music, I felt like I was in and out of the craziest fever dream - not pleasant.  It was made worse by the people in the hall who kept pounding the door and yelling at their buddy to come out.  This place is for people who want to party hard downstairs and need a place to crash after the clubs close.  Otherwise, stay a few blocks down the road at the Omni or Marriott.A very trendy and chic hotel. The room has a nice touch offering free wireless Internet and there is a neat lounge seating area with a bar and pool table by the lobby just to chill and have a drink. Hotel is right in the middle of everything that is happening in the Queen City. I was gonna give it 3 stars but what took it to 4 was what transpired next.I arrived at the hotel around 11am but the check-in time they told me was at 3pm and it didn't appear I was gonna be able to check-in early. So after a few moments, the receptionist asked for my ID and for some odd reason once they knew I was from Las Vegas, they said it was perfectly fine to check-in right then and there and upgraded me to a higher floor with better views without me even asking. Whoa how cool was that? The service was top notch and the location even better.Pretty snazzy lodgings to be found here.Awesome location! There have been some who have complained about noise levels. Understand that you cannot have a location this good and not expect to hear some of the hustle and bustle below (live performances for example). During my stay however there was no excessive noise to report. This given that I was supposedly on the 'noisy' side of the hotel.Rates are right where they should be. And this is to mean that you get a lot for your money! There is more that I could write but I'll leave that for a future edit. Suffice to say for now that Aloft at the EpiCentre was exactly what I was looking for in a stay.It actually pains me to write this review, because i want to like the place so much... cool decor, good bar scene, good location... BUT - i would never ever stay there again!!when my coworker and i checked in, we were told that we were lucky to be on a high floor (11 and 12, respectively) because a certain club in the area got loud at night... now, being in town from new york, i figured it was nothing i wasn't used to.  WRONG - i have no idea what kind of steroids said club was on, but holy hell... the windows on my 11th floor room were practically vibrating until 2AM!! no joke!! i couldn't sleep a godddamn wink until after 2am... and it was a wednesday!!! even the nyquil i took in defense failed to overcome the beats.  long story short... there's a reason it's so cheap to stay here.  if you want to sleep at all before 2am, look elsewhere.  sorry aloft... otherwise, you're adorable.So I'm pretty much going to just be repeating what most people are saying. The aloft is in a good location in terms of getting around in uptown Charlotte, but unless you are rocking out with your collar popped or in your 9in heels, then you'll be unhappy with the noise level of this hotel. It's kind of a party hotel in the fact that all of the surrounding businesses are night clubs and bars and hotel itself is built to be trendy and aimed towards the younger crowd. Now I know what you're thinking. This old man just can't handle the awesome-ness. Well this only man is only 32. Though past the age of spending my nights at trendy night clubs, I'm still fine with a little noise. The night we stayed was probably a fairly rare exception, though I could be wrong. There was an Eagles cover band playing on the patio of one of the bars (which ended up being lined up with our window and 2 floors down). It was actually so loud in our room at midnight, that I was convinced that I could checkout any time I liked, but I could never leave. When the band wasn't playing, the noise level just kind of turned to white noise. It was a little louder than city noise, but nothing terrible. If you demand a silent hotel, even this level of noise would be too much, but for me, it was fine. The beds are not as comfortable as beds in other W hotels, but the room itself was nice, clean, and modern. Parking kind of sucks as the only way to get an in/out service without having to pay each time is through valet, and after tip, you may as well just pay the in/out fees and park yourself. The other crappy part about parking is the parking garage is the same for all of the night clubs around you, so just parking to get to your hotel requires you to navigate for a while to find parking and share the elevator with gaggles of co-eds that think your backpack suitcase is sooooo 2003. The only other things I really didn't like about the aloft was the party music blasting in the elevator and the smell of the lobby. The elevator would be a nice place to have a quiet moment, but instead you have to speak up just to have a conversation. And whoever had the idea of spraying a 55 gallon drum of air freshener into the lobby every min of the day must either really love air freshener or has anosmia.The three most important things in real estate? Location, location, location.It's the same when choosing a hotel, whether for business or pleasure. It's no surprise then, that situated in a part of Charlotte called ""The EpiCentre"", that aLoft is truly in a phenomenal location.There are no shortage of restaurants to eat at and diversions to be had near aLoft.* Jason's Deli -- the healthiest restaurant I have found in Charlotte, with the possible exception of Pita Pit.* Firehouse Subs -- Subs bigger than your head.* Mez -- Great lounge and upscale restaurant* Enso -- Sushi and Bar* Blackfinn -- American Bar and Burger Joint* Strikecity -- Pizza and Bowling* Mortimer's -- American Pub* Whiskey River -- THE place to be on Tuesday Nights if you're in your 20s.* Suite -- THE place to be on Wednesday Nights if you're in your 20s.* Howl at the Moon -- Great dueling piano bar that is always bumping on Thursdays Nights.* Kazba -- Great upscale bar with live music on most Thursdays and Fridays.And after you're done shmoozing and boozing, aLoft is less than a block away.As for the interior of the place, it's great. The front desk area boasts a communal pool table to hang out and play on. There's a lounge area which opens up to the wxyz bar, The BEST Hotel Bar in Charlotte. There's a swimming pool, a laundry room on every floor, and a hotel gym: complete with full rack of weights, benches, ab balls and cardio machines.Rooms are spacious, and all have plasma TVs installed on the walls, mini fridge, and safe, with free Internet for all hotel guests (Which is more than can be said about their Sister Hotel a few blocks away, the Westin, which asks for $14.99 for a day of Internet Access. Pfft, it's 2010, people: get your heads out of your butts -- wifi should be free.)Staff are extremely friendly and accomadating, and the price simply can't be beat.Just a few minor knitpicks --* No Ice machines on every floor -- you have to head to the front desk to pick up Ice.* The only way to get to the hotel is via elevator, which are notoriously slow. On those horrid days when one of the elevators are busted, expect as long as a 2-3 minute wait before you can take the elevator up to aLoft.All in all, I love aLoft. It's a solid hotel, with friendly staff, great gym facilities, and the location and price point are perfect. I would highly recommend aLoft to anyone visiting Charlotte.Some tips on the Aloft.....1. Aloft is pronounced like ""Aloha"" (hence their slogan Aloha at the Aloft), NOT like, ""A-loha at the Ale-Loft"". Just because the A is capitalized, doesn't mean you pronounce it like the letter. Ugh, pet peeve.2. The employees are all extremely friendly, even the ones who bring up water.3. They don't have room service, but some places in the Epicenter deliver to your room (and I think they're free). Check out 5 guys.4. Their AC is powerful (more powerful than the one at the Westin), and definitely louder too. You'll love it in the summer, I wore a sweatshirt to bed one time.5. Wednesdays are happening, there are clubs and restaurants galore. They get rowdy, I blame it on the 18+ clubs - I know because I can hear them from my room. Good thing I sleep like a log.6. They serve a basic continental breakfast, but it doesn't come with your room. But there are plenty of options downstairs like Brueggers, Smoothie King, and Jason's Deli.7. The TV is sweet, the HD looks amazing. And the other great amenity is their complimentary bliss products.8. The gym is tiny (like 2 treadmills, 2 elipticals, weights), and they have a pool that most people forget about because it is on the lobby floor.9. Their bar is cool and they have a pool table! A nice place to hang out.10. Valet and self-serve parking are both $20, valet allows in and outs. They charge parking to your room. Make sure you request your car 15 min early because sometimes they're really slow.I booked a room here after my sister expressed that she'd like to spend part of her bachelorette night out here, because of it's location and personality. It's definitely geared towards a younger crowd, which is a nice change from stuffy/outdated furnishings and ambience. The lobby also had a cool snackbar area, and a sweet looking bar. We started off our evening here with cocktails and chit chat in the room before heading out. Side note: though none of us actually used the shower during our 12-or-so hour stay, I did notice it had a kind of rank, locker room smell to it. My four star review does not include the 6am fire drill that we endured, stumbling down the stairs from the 9th floor was not a great way to end the night/start the day, but I figure this was a fluke. I'd definitely look for another aloft in a different city next time I travel.I enjoyed my stay at the aLoft.  Being in the ""W"" family means you can expect unique.  For business travel, you're only two blocks away from ONE, TWO and THREE so it's very convenient.  Well, make that two BRISK blocks when walking to work in the mid-30 degree temp of Winter.Josh checked me in and I found out he was a transplant from Hollywood! He took good care of me and I appreciated that.  The hand-written personalized note under the door later was too cute and a nice touch to make one feel special!Having been to the EpiCentre before I was looking forward to being in the center (if you will) of it all.  Unfortunately, it was a quick and busy trip so I didn't have time to do much at all.  Next time, I plan on having one of my fave Mac-n-Cheese at the Flemings located right there in the lobby.My only complaint is the room was HELLA freezing and it seemed like the heater was not working at all.  I didnt report it and am sure they would have handled it pronto if I had.  And just overall, the rooms are FANCY (huh) but just not all that practical for business travel.  I need real lighting, not mood lighting when I'm getting up and going in the morning. And give me a standard shower with power!!!  PS-love ""refresh"" and the assortment of goodies.  One night for dinner, I downed a starbucks drink, ate some mixed nuts and jelly bellies and passed out.  Going PT to ET on a quick trip is a Beyatch!Hotels are by their very nature expository; seldom the reason for a trip itself, they are, nevertheless, ideally a respite from the strange or even exciting city beyond...pacesetters, if you will, a launching pad into the night or at the beginning of each day. They set the stage for your visit.In that sense, the job of the hotel takes on an increasingly important lustre, becomes quite possibly a prism through which you find yourself fired up or the alternative before the second act of your time begins. The aLoft hotel, intended to serve as sort of a W lite, has a number of things going for it, and oddly enough, as I had just checked out of a W hotel two days earlier in another city, my stay here lent itself to some easy comparisons. First, I'll assume that most aLoft hotels and W hotels are fairly uniform in approach and layout -- clever, modern, perched in busy nooks in main traffic areas of their given burg, clean and open with lots of corresponding natural light filtering through the windows. This one featured easy parking in the city lot below (though the rates claimed $20 a day I mostly paid about $6 for the time my car had been there), and this one was another one of those hotels whose lobby, in peculiar fashion, wasn't on the ground floor. At least with an aLoft, perhaps that's norm de rigeur. You do miss some of the more luxurious touches you get at the W (this one doesn't come with a handy robe, for example), but in all the staff was upbeat and friendly, the room clean and comfortable and sleek, the atmosphere fun. I feel certain I'll be back again, when the adventure continues.The goods: The location is key, right in the Epicentre so you have access to all the amenities of the EpiCentre.The Okays: The decor is very trendy so if you are looking for a place to stay with the kids...may not be the place for you.The bads: If you are going to be going to be driving in and out via your own car it maybe a little troublesome. There is a parking deck at the bottom so it isn't that big a deal.I really liked the Aloft Charlotte Uptown.  I spent 12 years in Charlotte before moving to Chicago, and this was my first stay in the Queen City for a business trip.  Ok, so it wasn't my own condo uptown, but close.  Here's what I liked.....   The price was right.  $139 a night, which was much less expensive than any other hotel Uptown.  I also loved the modern decor of the hotel.  It was definitely hip and modern.  If you are a freak for furniture above and beyond a bed and  desk, this place may not be for you.  There are no dressers.  I like that.  It was more like my own personal loft.  I was on teh 12th floor, and the skyline views were pretty amazing.  This hotel is in the Epicenter entertainment complex, so getting food, drink, bowling or a movie is just a few steps from the elevator.There wasn't much that I didn't like.  I scored parking for $10, however the normal rate is $20.  (Bar patrons only pay $10...weird that the hotel would charge more?)  I did get the feel that the front desk staff was somewhat amateurish.  Also, I can't put my finger on it, but the lobby area somehow felt unfinished, like they were trying to cram too much into too small of a space.  No big deal.All in all, I'm looking forward to staying at the Uptown Charlotte Aloft next time I'm in Charlotte.  What a good find!Very convenient to Uptown festivities!  Located right in the EpiCentre on College this hotel and fun lounge is a great place to stay while in Charlotte.  The rooms are trendy and cool - sporting bright colors and nice finishes.  The lounge area is really casual and fun.  It overlooks the top of the EpiCentre AA5 outdoor patio.  Full bar and wine selections available at the lounge.  Not as classy as the other hotels nearby but definitely worth a shot!Lauren at the Aloft bar was amazing! We were staying there for HeroesCon and she made us feel so welcome. She made me several specialty drinks (she was experimenting!) and each was better than the last - just a fantastic mixologist. Our room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the city. Definitely worth the money and we intend on using the Aloft as our new place to stay when in Charlotte.Comfy rooms and really nice showers and toiletries.The location is central, but the clientele is undesirable.The lobby and elevator were crowded with drunken, loud people.We had to call security twice in two nights to calm screaming children in the hallways.I don't really recommend this place for anyone over 22 or fans of sleeping.This is not a full-service hotel.  But it is wonderful hotel nonetheless.  It has a youthful vibe in the center of town.  It is right across the street from more staid Omni and across the street from the soon-to-be Ritz Carlton.There are many restaurants around so room service is quite unnecessary - and REALLY does anyone really even enjoy room service?It has a very modern vibe.  No stuffy bellman or concierge (plus or minus?).  The rooms are very spare and modern.  flat panel tv on the wall.  Cool magazines in the room (Dwell, Spin, Conde Nast Traveler, Wired)!!  And Bliss shower/bath amenities.  Free wi-fi in the room as well.  For me, as long as there is free wi-fi in a nice designed room, I am good.  The swimming pool is an oversized lap pool.  Nothing extraordinary, but it has glass windows along one size, so the view at night is beautiful.The one negative: the hotel is located on the 5th floor of the Epicenter, and there are only 2 elevators which are for whatever reason very slow.Pretty hip and cool hotel.  When we stayed here it was pretty much empty (It was Thanksgiving week so that was cool).  Rooms are definitely modern-looking with flat panel TV's.   Didn't use the free Wifi service but that's a nice touch.My wife and I enjoyed the drinks at the Wxyz bar and had fun playing pool.   The decor of the bar area is nice.Negatives:    The temperature in the room was set at 65 which was a little too warm for a Charlotte night.   We couldn't lower the temperature at all...tried calling the front desk but they couldn't figure it out either and said a maintenance person would be in at 8am the next day.   This didn't do us any good since we were only staying for one night.  They offered to move us to a different room...but that was just too much of a hassle.Parking is $20 a night even if you park your car yourself, and they do NOT offer any type of discount for parking.   Seems strange when some of the restaurants in the same center will validate your parking, but the hotel won't.Overall, a good stay.I hadn't heard of aloft or that they were affiliated with W hotels. I got ""stuck"" here because everything else near my meeting was fully booked. But I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It's very contemporary, but it has a little bit of a vintage vibe. The best analogy I can think of is Bauhaus architecture. It used to be contemporary but is now somewhat retro. Very nice, polished lobby with a nice pool table and bar. The room was nice. Bed was comfortable. Open, loft feel to the room with lots of recessed lighting. Bathroom was brand new and with a very stylish sink/faucet. The shower was a stand up, glass encased stall with frosted glass to the bedroom that allowed a lot of ambient light. Great big wall mounted TV in front of the bed.I'd stay here again, but there were definitely two bummers about the room. 1) Despite the fact that it was a rain-style shower head, the water pressure was crap. Didn't feel like I got a good shower. 2) The bedroom had two giant glass windows but the only window treatments were thick pull down blinds. I much prefer shears so I can get privacy but allow ambient light. My room faced another building so I had to shut the blinds (or give the neighbors a show which believe me they wouldn't appreciate).The good: Clean, modern design.  Very comfortable beds.  Large flat-panel TVs in every room.  Free WiFi.  Reasonably priced.  Bliss bath and body products (shampoo, body wash, face wash, soap, and lotion) in the bathrooms.  Excellent magazine selection in the guest rooms: Dwell, Wired, Paste. The bad: Slightly pretentious atmosphere.  Indifferent, amateurish staff.  The food in the upscale-seeming w xyz Bar was served in to-go containers and was just a hair above McDonald's quality.  (Eat at Five Guys on the second floor of the EpiCentre.)  The light switches in the guest rooms illuminate the entire space (bathroom and bedroom), so if your roommate is sleeping you'll need to pee in the dark or risk a rude awakening.The ugly:  Only one (of four) elevators were working.  Very noisy.  The walls must be made of parchment.  I was sleeping like a baby on the comfy bed until a  hotel guest having a conversation in the hallway woke me.  The unacceptable parking situation: $20 daily for valet (the ""bargain""), or $10 every time you enter and exit the EpiCentre garage.  This information should be communicated to guests upon booking.    This hotel has potential, but there are tons of kinks to be worked out.  I might give it another shot because of its excellent location and good value.I really like the Aloft concept (W-lite), and my first impressions of this hotel were pretty good.  After a sort of dismal elevator ride up to the lobby from the street, we found a very communal, modern vibe around the check-in desk, including a pool table, long tables for computer work, a serve-yourself food area, and a fun little bar.  I thought the room was cool, and huge, and the opaque glass separating the room from the shower reminded me of the Standard in L.A.  And Bliss products in the bathroom?  Yippee!After a few amazing cocktails in the bar (the chipotle-pineapple tequila margarita is so wonderful!) I saw some not-so-good sides to the place.  Room service, which is actually food from the attached restaurant, was a big FAIL because no one picked up even after I tried calling four seperate times.  Our in-room clocks hadn't been changed since daylight savings the week before.  I worked in my room for a few hours during the day, and a small dog barked incessantly for most of those three hours.  A call to the lobby netted me an offer to change rooms, but nothing else.My boss got back to his room the next day and found his room wasn't serviced.  They moved him to a different room (I guess this is the default response to a service complaint?), where -- surprise! -- there were no pillows.  (A hotel employee told us in confidence that she thinks the hotel is trying to help the community by hiring mentally disabled people, and that a lot of guests have had maid service complaints.  Interesting.)All in all, I understand this is a new-ish hotel and they have some kinks to work out.  And I did appreciate my bonus courtesy Starwood points in response to our issues.  But for now, I just feel like the management needs to step up to get this hotel to Starwood caliber.","Aloft gets my business when I am in Charlotte.The downsides (noisy A/C unit, expensive parking) are ameliorated by the upsides: good location, interesting decor, comfy bar, and big flat screen TV that I can plug in to my computer.Just be sure to bring a cable!A place gets a bonus star for giving free bottled water to non-premier members.Also, internet is free and wireless works in room - you hear that Marriott and your ridiculous $13/day wired-only internet???But for $78 a night, I'd take this over a shitty Hampton Inn any day!What a beautiful, trendy, designed space!  We were lucky enough to have one of our friends with too many hotel points for his own good to reserve us a place for the weekend, so that we didn't have to sleep on the floor or a leaky air mattress.The beds and linens were so comfortable!  The window shades were super cool and much appreciated compared to the hotel curtains that waste fabric and collect dust.  The light fixtures in the hall, covered with the cool striped fabric definitely softened the fluorescent lights without making the hallways creepily dim.Getting to the hotel is somewhat a pain.  There's no street/deck parking - only valet.  Also, you have to ride the elevator to the 5th floor, and during that short ride, you'll be crammed in with others who are headed to the many restaurants, clubs, and the theater at Epicenter.  As a reward for the cramped elevator, there's a great view and a relaxing water art feature to greet you on the 5th floor, prelude to the hip and casual lounge that is the lobby.However beautiful and designed this space was, I was surprised by the amazing inattention to small, yet highly relevant, details.  They had dispensers in the shower for the shampoo and body wash, which were all Bliss brand and rather nice for hotel toiletries, but then they had cheap toilet paper.   The lobby bar was aesthetically pleasing but the oversized chairs weren't that comfortable, and there weren't a whole lot of places to set your drink.Sadly, the service did not match the hip atmosphere.  Or maybe it did in the sense of it was cool and sleek, pretty to look at, but not very inviting.  We checked in at 11:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one person working the front desk.  He was somewhat flustered by the herd of people gathered around the desk.  He was getting no help from his coworkers, who seemed more interested in their duties than in the service of the guests.  The bartender was not much better.  She was annoyed that we asked for drink menus, then annoyed when we asked for the mojito, since they were out of mint, which she informed us with a smirk as she walked away to serve another customer (no, they were not that busy), only to return a few minutes later to finally take our order.  There were two additional waitresses/hostesses at the end of the bar with very unpleasant looks on their faces.  So sorry to disturb you all!In short - get a taxi to drop you off at the front and head straight to your comfy room to take in the view!I really enjoy staying at this hotel chain whenever I can. It has a nice feel to it. This specific location is in a good location for a lazy traveler. I was visiting Charlotte on business and didn't have much time to get out to some of the neighborhoods that I would have liked to so I appreciated being able to have all of the bars/restaurants right in my own back yard at the Epicentre. My only complaint about this hotel is the elevators. They were a little slow to come and go and one of them was even out of commission when I was there for a few hours. This was beyond the hotels control, but it caused travelers in the morning to be reliant on one elevator for the shared complex. All in all, nice rooms, very clean, and great service.This is a very Ikea-type place, but in the best possible way.First off, no floral patterns or nasty ruffled bed covers anywhere!  The property opened in early 2009 so everything is new, clean, and does not have any peculiar smells like most hotels do.  The rooms are spacious with comfy beds, flat screen TVs and glass shower stalls. The toiletries are from the same Bliss collection as you would find at higher priced parent chain. Another shocker -- the bottle of water in the room is complimentary!!!  It's the small things that count; I am unfortunately used for that little bottle to be $5.  Also, free wired and wireless internet throughout the property, a 24/7 gym, a (tiny) pool, a bar, and a little snack area. Minimalistic modern design, funky music, and trippy floor panels in the elevators. The hotel is located right in the Epicenter so you're within crawling distance of all the hopping clubs and restaurants as well as the office buildings where you need to drag your sorry a$$ in the morning. Finally, the nightly rate is about $40-$50 cheaper than any other property in the surrounding few blocks.The reason I took off one star is the loud beast of an A/C system in the room that is hard to tame (there's digital control for the unit but it's pretty finicky).  But a little birdy told me that they're going to replace all air conditioning units due to high number of complains.Bottom line: this girl will be back -- I stayed in other hotels in the area and this one, though not perfect, is the best for my taste and a bargain too!I recently patronized the WXYZ Lounge at the Aloft in Uptown with some friends. The lounge itself is set up nicely with bright colors and very chic modern decor. This lounge would very good for an after dinner date spot to speak more intimately and chill. There are  few caveats. The drinks seemed a bit overpriced averaging $9 and they seemed watered down to me. The average price for the drinks in my opinion should not have exceeded $7. The bar staff is friendly and the view from the lounge into downtown Charlotte is excellent.I'm actually writing this review from my room at the Aloft.  Bottom line: This place is an upscale youth hostel.  Definitely not your traditional hotel and a far cry from it's big sister the Westin.I'm staying here while attending a conference in Charlotte.  First of all, finding the actual hotel while driving is near impossible.  As a matter of fact, I pulled over to call the hotel and just happened to pull in front of the Valet.  The entrance to the hotel is set back in a corner of the Epicentre, with discreet Aloft signs over the door.  When you go through those doors,  you only see the entrance to Fleming's Steakhouse and 2 elevators.  A very small glass sign says the lobby is on the 5th floor.  Once you get to the 5th floor, the smell attacks you.  A very strong, citrus/lemongrass scent that is everywhere in the lobby.  There is also the eclectic techno music, which is played in the lobby and in the elevators.  At check-in, I was told that the WXYZ Bar located in the lobby was voted the Best Bar in Charlotte by serveral magazines.  Well, Charlotte, I sure hope they're wrong, because I haven't seen a single person at that bar the past 2 nights.  Then there is the room.  Mine is a single with a King bed.  The bed is comfortable and there is a large flat-screen TV.  The bathroom has a shower but no tub, and the shower has a frosted glass window that you can see from the bedroom (good thing I wasn't sharing a room!)  Then there was the oddest thing about the Alfot: They provide Bliss designer spa products in the shower and even a little tube of Bliss lotion, but they do not provide any hand soap!  What's even stranger is they actually provide a soap dish, as though they expect guests to supply their own bar soap!  I ended up using the Dove body wash I brought with me as hand soap.Lastly, there is the noise.  Unfortunately, my room faces the Epicentre, and even now I can hear music outside.  The air conditioner is also very loud when it clicks on and off at night.  The good points about this place are definitely about the location, which is walking distance to many restaurants and bars, and the little ""convenience store"" in the lobby, where you can grab anything you want 24 hours a day and just charge it to your room.    Overall, this place is a great value for the price, but I would not recommend it for business travel.Definitely unique - great location downtown.  Bar is ok - they have a pool table, which is nice.  Rooms are fine/clean, decent views if you're high up, the beds are firm and a bit springy - I liked them but some of my colleagues didn't.  Shower was nice, gym is ok - clean.Great location but watch out for rooms facing the clubs. Unless you are going to be in the bar all night long, you will hate the rooms facing them. Imagine being in bed (alone) in your room and the bed is rocking from full effects of the bass.Washing machine is broken and no laundromat in the area. The price doesn't reflect the barebones size and amenities. The room reminds me of an upmarket dorm room. The lobby features loud pop music. This is a noisy area designed to attract 20-somethings (as is the hotel itself). Not easy to find. There was street work going on so I had to use earplugs for the first time ever. Parking is oddly expensive. There are way too many cutesy messages on the cups, etc. My cell phone keeps cutting out, so don't plan big phone conferences in the building. For some reason, this place is rubbing me the wrong way. When we arrived to check in, we were told they were sold out of rooms so we'd have to stay across the street at the Omni Hotel for the same price (yay!) but then my companion noted we were booked for an entire week at the Aloft, so he tapped at the computer and got us a room here after all (boo!). But that was weird. Pluses: Good, strong Internet connection. Great gym (but don't expect the word ""gym"" or ""fitness center"" on the door). Also, it is blocks away from the convention center and the high rises (and several other hotels) and next to the bus and light rail station.After arriving at midnight to find ""guaranteed late arrival"" room sold and waiting 45min. for a ride to Holiday Inn, I was very angry!! But the manager called me the next day and groveled and made amends. Nice clean room, on 14th floor corner with a great view!The aloft has been my home for the past 2 weeks and I have to say my stay here was great.  It's not the fanciest hotel you've ever been to, but its incredibly clean, the staff is awesome (very helpful and I thank you for that) and the location is perfect if you want to be in uptown Charlotte.  The noise factor is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  It didn't ever bother me, but I could see if someone didn't want to be in a ""party zone"" for a long time.  If you do want to be in a fun environment and never have to think of transportation this is definitely the place to be.  There are always events in the bar downstairs and the Epicenter is a elevator ride away.  Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'm definitely staying here again.  Thanks ya'll!The location can't be beat... but the hotel itself is kind of a dump.  The rooms are small with no desk or couch.  There isn't enough closet space.  Parking is reasonable. $20/day for valetIf I had spent the regular $179/nt on this place I may have been dissapointed but for $50 on price line I can over look a few things.  The sheets had a make up stainon them but were in a spot that didnt bother us too much.  Room are good sized and have a open feeling.  Nice weight room and pool.  I avoided the $20 valet by parking on the street.  It was a Sunday so it was free!  Athough I think we got pretty lucky to find a spot within a block of the hotel.  Lots of good resturants and entertainment close by and good views of the city as the lowest rooms are still 6 floors up.  Overall a good stay in Charlotte!Marketing at it's best.  For Starwood, this is their attempt to attract 20 - 40's business travelers.   They are cookie cutter rooms wherever you go in the USA.  About ~300 Sq foot, with a King Bed and a large screen tv.  Free Wifi, free bottled water and ""cool"" younger staff at the front desk plus a hangout bar area.  The price was right and is a good value for all you Starwood members collecting points.   Keep in mind the concept, the design, etc is all designed for that demo of young professionals.  Don't expect anything more or less.  The location is great to walk to food or meetings.  As others mention the elevators to the 5th floor suck.  But otherwise great views of Charlotte and it will remind you of a being in a bad Woody Allen NYC movie.I enjoy staying @ aloft in Uptown Charlotte, NC.  Great city view rooms and pool table in the lobby.  You also can't beat Flemmings downstairs..great place for the most part. Staff is super helpful, love the visual and physical aspects of both the rooms and the common area. Cool to have a bar, lounge and pool table in the reception area. Hated the cheesy teeny-bopper top-40 pop music playing in the lounge-definitely did not make me want to linger and it was out of synch with the edgy vibe they were going for. They need something more like Massive Attack playing. And I know it's NC, but get a little bit of real art to augment the stock car posters if you're going travelers business. Besides those details, its a great place that I'll come back to.I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!  Since when do hotels not offer hand soap in the bathroom?  (gross)  If you need soap to wash your hands, please open the shower door, step inside and use the the soap dispenser, step back out of the shower - walk to the sink and then wash your hands.  Seriously??  What no closet?  What is that bar thingy protruding from the wall with 5 hangers on it? Ohhhh - that's the closet. Yeah - I don't think that is working for me.  It just gets worse from here.  A three day stay = three fire alarms requiring evacuating the hotel including one time at 4:40am.  Did you know that it is even humid at 4:40am on the streets of downtown Charlotte??   I forgot to ask housekeeping how much starch they put on the bed sheets - they have pointy edges and are so uncomfortable. This is a ""Bring your own pillow "" hotel because what they provide is rock hard - just like the mattress.  Oh yes - ALOHA - is this Hawaii?? No, this is Charlotte and they say ALOHA to you ever time you pass the front desk.  Can you say ALOHA with a southern accent?  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.Great staff, very clean and excellent atmospher.  Hotel is built into a new entertainment complex with lots of restaraurnts and entertainment right there.  I travel a lot for work and this hotel is my favorite.funky place.  i wonder if i should knock it down a star for screwing us over on the first night.  in town in charlotte for business, we get in around 10:30pm from our flight from Minneapolis.  and they tell us they ""over-sold"" the place.  what?  i've heard of an airline over-selling because if you don't show up to your flight then you get a refund and the airline loses the money for the seat but if you don't show to your hotel room, then they keep the cash so i don't understand the concept of selling more rooms than you have.  i suppose that would mean they expect some people to default and then they'd pocket the extra cash even though they are 'full'... i guess that's their plan but as they found out, when you're going to forfeit your cash upon a no-show, you tend to SHOW.  anyway, they are explaining to us the bad news and my work colleague is grilling them on how this could possibly happen when i remind them that, well, it doesn't matter how it happened, we still have a meeting at 8am the next morning and just get us a darn room.  they give us a low-end holiday inn room down the street - but they did comp it.  so we returned to the aloft the next night.  and it was much nicer.  the room design was pretty cool.  the lobby area had the perk of the free pool table, the little snack shop, a couple computers to use, nice bar area.  not nearly as cool at the W in San Francisco or L.A.  but the aloft is a decent spot.  not a 5 star place but does a pretty adequate job for a 4 star hotel.  maybe 3.75 stars.  and they are lucky i don't knock them down a star for that mess up on the first night.","['location', 'location', 'location', 'never', 'aloft', 'missing', 'missing', 'room', 'simple', 'bed', 'bath',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ritz-carlton-charlotte-charlotte,"The Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte",4.5,$$$$,95,"All I can say is WOW!!! This hotel sets the bar that every other hotel needs to live up to. Now, I will caveat that it is not cheap and I stayed for business so I didn't have to pay the bill.  It's a beautiful, newly remodeled (or extremely well maintained) and spacious room with a decent-sized tv, two closets (with bathrobe, shoeshine equipment), mini bar and Bose sound system for an iPod. The bathroom has a separate bathtub and shower - and a separate water closet (i.e., toilet in an enclosed room). So, a very nice room.However, every little detail is taken care of in this hotel room. In the bathroom, the tv image/sound is  inset in the bathroom mirror, there is a pullout magnifying makeup mirror, mirror in the shower and even a small tile that sticks out in the shower for a woman to put her foot on for shaving her legs. What? In the hotel room, on the desk is a little caddy with post it notes, pens and paper clips. There is a charging station with a ""vault"" for all your cords. When you open the closet doors, the light automatically comes on. So many little niceties. Some I have seen in other hotels, some I've never seen but never all in the same place!The hotel bar is very nice and we entertained clients there a couple of times. We have also eaten in the neighboring BLT Steak restaurant which I will review in a separate entry.The service is great also. Front desk guy hit it out of the park when I was checking out by helping me with getting my points applied and personally getting me a cup of hot tea from the kitchen because they were out at the hospitality station. I forgot my toothbrush and housekeeping brought up a pre-packaged toothbrush and tiny tube of paste within a few minutes.If you want to stay at a hotel where you feel and actually are pampered, this is the place. Great job, Ritz!Great service, typical of a Ritz. Watch out for the noise from the front of the hotel on Thursday nights in the summertime. It can get very loud, very late. Otherwise, a great place to stay and convenient to downtown offices.I rarely write reviews for hotels, but if you're staying in Charlotte and want access to the Epicenter and downtown, this is where you should stay.  One of my favorite public(as in not owned by an individual) pools in town.  Very chill and dimly lit at night.  A super classy bar scene and extremely courteous and prompt valets.  It makes you just feel all fancy, but yet you are still in Charlotte.  Highly recommended.Beautiful and well appointed hotel. I stay here for business as often as possible, typically a few times a year.  Staff is always friendly and helpful. Meeting rooms are great, free wifi.  The bar on site is also a great addition.  And in the world of the small things that make me happy, I love the tv's built into the mirrors in the guest room bathrooms.  Nice touch!I have been fortunate enough to visit several Ritz Carlton properties. This trip I was staying at another hotel and learned this property was close by. I was able to book a facial. Trisha Compton is a wonderful esthetician. She is very nice but also very knowledgeable, warm and provides practical suggestions and tips. The staff in general was nice as you would expect at a Ritz spa but Ms. Compton stands out from several of the properties I have visited in the last year. Lastly, I had lunch after my treatment. The pool area is large but it was the first time I experienced so many kids. Granted it was raining outside so .  That was a first. It doesn't change my overall impressions of this facility. Can't wait to visit again.Great service from all departments.  Clean, pleasant, convenient, well decorated, and they all are so polite, friendly and helpfu.   Food is great.  It is worth the few extra dollars.  You will leave relaxed and happy.Out of all of the times I've came to the Ritz Carlton, I've not had as bad of an experience as I had this evening. The waiter, was rude and the only reason I'm giving the additional star is solely for the food, drinks and live music that I thoroughly enjoyed.Just focusing on the spa here since I wasn't staying at the hotel. Had a great massage here, but was a little disappointed to realize the provider cut the treatment short by about 5-7 minutes - on a 50-min massage, that's not insignificant. I wasn't late - in fact, I got there about an hour ahead of time so I could read and relax and get all zen-like - so it wasn't a case where they were forced to cut into my appointment because of my own tardiness. Just felt a little cheated. Other than that, everything was lovely. Staff was courteous, professional and warm, the place was clean and calm, and the massage really was excellent - just a bit shorter than anticipated. Last note - I left a necklace that means a lot to me in my locker, and the Ritz staff (spa was closed by the time I realized it) went above and beyond to search for the necklace after hours. It wasn't especially valuable, but it was priceless in other ways, so I was so grateful for that level of service. I lied - one more note: the valets and doormen were SO great - cheerful, friendly, helpful, etc. Sets a good stage for a relaxing spa day/vacation/business trip!Another exceptional experience at a Ritz CarltonService- I really think they are the gold standard.  We got a free ride your a local restaurant in a 7 series BMW Hybrid- very nice!Hotel- meticulous, beautiful and luxurious, pool/ hot tub, gym all free and easily accessible. Bar- they have ""Punch"" on the 15th floor that we could not get into as they have a 37 person limit.  Apparently, they have a mixologist and the cocktails are wonderfully crafted.   The bar in the lobby is very nice and had live entertainment on Sat night  Cocoa- is a chocolate themed shop next to the bar.  High end chocolates, gelato, etc. Location- downtown across from ""Epicentre"" is convenient if you want to go to restaurants and bars.  The only issue is downtown Charlotte doesn't have much for shopping so you have to travel about 5 miles to the South Park Mall to shop I would not hesitate to come back!Words cannot adequately describe our stay, no, more like an experience.  The Ritz went way and beyond anything we imagined while spending a delightful evening celebrating our 16 year wedding anniversary.  When we arrived to our room, I lost count on the number of WOWs uttered by my wife and I.  We sent An afternoon at the spa, that deserves its own 5 star rating.  We return to our room for a complimentary slice of chocolate cake with a thoughtful note.  At one point it felt like they were trying to out do the last awesome gesture.Courteous and delightful are the best words to describe the staff.Expect to pay out, but know you'll leave here knowing it was a bargain!I recently went to get some much needed treatment at the SPA and have to tell you this experience was amazing. You don't have to stay at the hotel to experience good customer service. The best part of my experience was a dip in the pool, i will be back asap.When you stay at the Ritz-Carlton it's like you're wearing an invisible tattoo of your own name on your forehead that you can't see but everyone that works there can. To be recognized all the time &amp; called Ms. (Last Name Here) can make anyone feel special. Super spacious room with two hanging closets. Ample corner desk space, USB plugs built into the desk to charge your devices. Oversized bathroom with double sinks and an echo-worthy deep tub. Can't forget the TV INSIDE the mirror. And when I wanted a late check out so I could explore a little bit of the city after working before heading back to the airport, they were happy to accommodate my request and schedule a car at the same time. This is the way this yelper likes to travel on business. It can only be down hill from here. This hotel is in the heart of downtown Charlotte and minutes from the Charlotte Douglas airport. It's within blocks of numerous restaurants, but has a couple attached to it as well that you can access from inside the hotel. I don't stay at the Ritz that often, but when I have the opportunity to, they never fail me.Simply the best in Charlotte. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you know the Ritz Carlton cares about your experience. I have stayed here on several occasions and each time the staff has been exceptional and attentive from the valet, front desk to management. There are many amenities from the spa, pool, gym to enjoy and well the rooms are spacious, gorgeous with the smallest attention to detail. The beds are simply the best I've ever slept in at any hotel and that's quite a compliment. If you're looking for a hotel for business or just a nice weekend getaway for two or the whole family, look no further. You will not be disappointed.Stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and as a top tier member, I was still given a low floor that faced that (now learned) noisy side right toward the street. I was up all night with loud noises going on at least until 2am. Very hard to sleep. Room overall was decent but the noise will keep me from coming back here in the future unfortunately.Always my favorite hotel to stay at when the city has a Ritz. You know you can't go wrong and get what you pay for. Everyone has a hotel room, the staff is what makes this place specialI have stayed at at least 10 different Ritz Carltons and the Charlotte location is surprisingly in my Top 3.Obviously, its a Ritz so the service is top notch.  What sets this location apart is its appeal to a younger (people in their 30's-40's).  Free Sparkling wine in the lobby, along with a cocktail hr free geleto bar and wine and cheese tasting.  The suite was amazing.  2 bathrooms, extremely spacious and a tv built into the mirror!It was my birthday and we were brought strawberries and champagne upon arrival.The restaurant in the hotel is amazing and  the rooftop bar is very romantic.I will be back!This was the best luxurious hotel I've stayed in. Great room, great service and the room service was delicious. I stayed one night with my wife for our honeymoon. The pool was amazing too. I'd recommend it to anyone to stay here. I plan to return here every year with my wife.One of my favorite Ritz-Carlton locations. Walking distance to everything uptown. -Great views of the city &amp; Epicentre-Clean luxurious rooms-Service is the gold standard. My wife and I jumped on an elevator with a hotel employee. He overheard my wife complain about forgetting her Chapstick in the room and found us in the lobby 5 minutes later with a new stick. Very impressive!-Awesome views from the pool &amp; spaBottom line at the top: lovely three course brunch, except for the desserts from bar cocoa.--Came here for bruch on Saturday after the family had some biznesss in Charlotte. You have a choice of a starter, main, dessert, and tea or coffee.We basically all ordered the tuna tacos, but one person had the Caesar salad and another had the fruit platter with honey yogurt. The tuna tacos are very small, like VERY small but still good. The menu said that they come with avocado foam but it was actually more of a cream. The caesar was very good and came with a nice crisp that had black olives in it. The fruit platter had strawberries, watermelon balls, blueberries, thinly sliced mango, papaya, kiwi, honeydew, and canteloupe and the yogurt was really great.Entrees our family had included the short rib sandwich with Parmesan fries, crab cake egg Benedict, steak frites, the burger, etc. the Parmesan fries are nothing to write home about, definitely way too thick for my liking. The crab cake Benedict was excellent. At this point everyone was completely stuffed, so they give you the option of getting dessert to go. We definitely considered getting some rooms so we could take a nap hahaha. Nonetheless I had a jasmine tea which was really great and my dad had a cappuccino which was fine.Dessert from bar cocoa was really bad, it's definitely time for a new pastry chef..otherwise everything was great!Lovely spa, probably one of the best in the country! They have an intimate, modern, chic Aqua Lounge that offers breathtaking views of Charlotte. The service is worth more than the 20% service charge. You're at the Ritz so you're in good hands.","Wonderful trip to the Ritz Carlton in Charlotte.  Stayed in an Executive Suite, tons and tons of room.  15th floor views were great, noise was average considering you are in the middle of the city.  Staff were extremely helpful, anything we asked for was accommodated quickly and pleasantly.If you can afford the prices this is by far my favorite hotel in Charlotte.  House car for rides w/in the 277 corridor.  Lighting and ambiance are beautiful...especially the pool at night.  Very accommodating for kids/families.  TV and Bose sound made watching movies better than home.  Great visit, I'll go back.The best hotel in Charlotte that consistently delivers the best level of service in the Queen City!We were rudely asked to leave from our suit for making too much noise. There was no music, just talking. We were waiting in the lobby and were confronted by the police. They said ""you were asked to leave nicely, so you need to leave."" We were literally just standing waiting for one of our fellow paying guests in the lobby. We left politely, but I have never felt so disrespected by such an establishment. They treated us as if we were criminals.Awesome hotel and best level-of service in Charlotte. I have never been disappointed by this hotel and will forever make it my goto hotel in CLT.Love love love Holiday Tea shindig at the Ritz. Had a lovely time with my hubby - just having tea and ordered the Royal Tea that included champagne.Service - wonderfully attended by Pia, our waitressFood/Snack - deliciously made and satisfyingTea - fresh and authentically made by JingVenue - lovely seated by the windows that oversees the epicenter and city of Charlotte downtownThere will be nothing bad said about this place because there isn't anything bad to be said. Service was impeccable, the Christmas decorations were beautiful, the lounge music was great - a live soulful jazz band...comfort, beauty,  and elegance. An amazing experience.Nice place right in the center of town. Make sure if you plan on staying here you request a room not facing the Epicenter retail and restaurant and bar complex. Your room will shake with noise. When calling the front desk they would not offer to move us but did bring up ear plugs. Sorry but for 450 a night you should be more accommodatingUm.  Wow.  Now I see why they charge what they charge for a room there.  Totally worth it if you are celebrating a special occasion.  Service was top notch.  I haven't experienced this level of service before and I was in awe my entire time I stayed. They really try to pay attention to your needs and offer you exceptional service and will go over the top to make you feel like a million bucks. Check in - Flawless.  I requested an early check in and I was prepared for them to turn me down.  Nope.  We were able to check in at 11:00.  What?!  Score.Room - <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FO.M.google&amp;s=5575cfdfdfd755d11da0255de1247af9f2fee62f383084c1ae526560bbe82d26"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">O.M.google</a>.  Very clean.  Very very nice.  The bed was like sleeping on a cloud.  I slept so well that night.  I never sleep well in hotels.  Blackout curtains do their job nicely.  Coffee machine in room was a nice touch.  I tried the espresso and I could feel my eyes rolling to the back of my head.  So funny.  The TUB IS LONG ENOUGH TO FIT ME AND MY MILE LONG LEGS! WAhoo!  The shower was HUGE.  Again, awesome.When we finally figured out how to put on the DND sign I litterally said ""shut up"".  All you do is push the red button near the door for DND and the green button to give them the go-ahead to clean your room.  So high tech.Amenities - Rooftop indoor pool was nice.  It's not heated though and I almost lost a toe when I tried to get in.  BRRR.  Sitting in the lounge chairs near the window was awesome though.  Around the corner from the pool is another section that has the whirlpool with lounge chairs.  We felt so high-class.  We ordered cocktails and sipped on them while swirling in the whirpool.  So awesome. There is also a spa, yoga room, spin room, and a really nice workout room.  Will definatley stay here again for another night of special occasioness.  Totally worth it.Loved staying at the Ritz! Room was nice, especially love the bathroom design. Coffeemaker in the room is a huge plus for me especially given that many high end hotels do not. Hotel staff was very professional and attentive. Great location and easy access to the office. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is that my food experience there was just ok.This review is for their valet parking services only - as I did not stay at their hotel.I had a business meeting at the Aria Tuscan Grill across the street from their hotel. After circling the block several times and calling the restaurant to find out where to park (this is downtown Charlotte - there are no parking lots) - as soon as I saw the front of their hotel - I pulled in.I informed the valet parking attendants that I was not staying at their hotel, but would still like to park my car. They advised me on the rate, I said no problem and I was off to my meeting.When I returned in the afternoon, I went in to the front desk, paid for my parking, and the parking attendant had my car back to me in short order!The folks at the front desk and the valet parking attendants were all friendly and professional!Perfect Service and a beautiful hotel near a pretty cool area of Charlotte.  My room was uber comfortable and for the first time ever they had a charging station in the room with different plugs, presumable just in case you forgot your charger.  Cool touch!I also had a quick but delicious meal at BLT.  The highlight was the yummy tuna tartare dish.Living in the CLT area, my husband and I don't often have a reason to stay in a hotel in our own city. However, on our wedding evening, we wanted to spend the night in a nice hotel near the airport.The hotel is beautiful. Classy, elegant, clean &amp; friendly. Indeed they are very expensive, but all Ritz's are. They charge what they do for a reason: exceptional accommodations, sharp and friendly employees, and a memorable experience all around.We were upgraded to a suite with a beautiful view. AND, our room had a mini cake with congrats on it. What an amazing touch! The room was gorgeous and room service in the AM was great. I love spacious rooms and big bathrooms, and boy was it! The bathroom had a private water closet, a huge counter and sink, and a nice walk-in shower. The most amazing thing about this bathroom, and even the room, was the TV in the mirror! When turned off the big mirror is just a mirror, but there's a remote and you can turn on the TV and magically, the middle of the mirror is a flat screen TV built in. It was amazing.Lastly, I want to add they were very gracious in agreeing to hold my wedding dress for the day until my dad could come pick it up. Top notch experience &amp; service all around!!! I highly recommend the Ritz for a special occasion.This review is for the spa, as I am a local.  I had an amazing deep tissue massage with Drea.  Ask for her!!!  I'm a self-proclaimed ""spa snob,"" and this place takes the cake.  From the minute you walk in to the minute you leave, everything is top-notch!  The experience beats everything I've had in similar NYC, ATL, SF, LA, and Portland locations.  You won't regret it!  Worth the splurge!After getting hit with some unexpected home improvement costs this year, we opted for a ""staycation"" this fall. Since we weren't spending a ton of money on hotels, airfare and restaurants, I decided to treat myself to an afternoon at the Ritz Carlton spa in Uptown.I was encouraged to arrive an hour or earlier before my first scheduled service to relax and enjoy the facilities, so I did. Check-in was quick, and I really liked the ""touchstone"" concept where you can choose a small stone that has written on it what you want from your day at the spa, and keep it with you and take home with you. (You can also add your own, if one of the many pre-written ones don't work for you.)The women's lounge is very, very nice. Everything you can imagine needing is readily available. There are several rooms to relax in, as well as multiple private showers, including one with something like 18 heads (it was like being in a car wash naked) and a steam room.The steam room was disappointing.  I fell in love with the eucalyptus steam room at the Ritz Carlton in Maui a few years back. It was clean and lit so white that it practically glowed. The steam was dissipated just right, and the eucalyptus was automatically infused with the steam so it was throughout the room. So when the front desk woman told me that the Uptown Ritz had a eucalyptus steam room, that's what I was envisioning.Instead, it was a yellow-ish room with somewhat dingy looking tiles, and a spray bottle that contained a a very watered down eucalyptus mixture. The Harris Y has more potent eucalyptus in their spray bottles than the Ritz.On to the treatments... I chose to do a body scrub treatment, followed by an hour for lunch and then a standard massage.The first treatment was interesting. I'd never done a body scrub before and I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The treatment room had another nice, very private shower to use to rinse off the scrub mid-treatment before moisturizing. The therapist performing the treatment was good, but she was a little more 'handsy' than I'd like. I chalked it up to it being a ""full body scrub"" but I've never had a therapist massage my stomach, down between my breasts, etc.Lunch was great. I had ordered while relaxing in the women's lounge and locker area. After the scrub, I went up to the Aqua Lounge where there's an indoor pool and hot tub, as well as several chaise lounges, and my lunch was served there. It was delicious and not quite as insanely priced as I was expecting.My massage was also with the same therapist. It was okay, but certainly nothing special. I get better massages every few weeks at my local Hand &amp; Stone. And again, the therapist was a little 'handsier' than I liked. It was clearly her style, so if I go again I'll probably seek out a different therapist.I spent another two hours after the massage just relaxing: swimming in the pool, alternating with the jacuzzi and occasionally heading down to the women's lounge to relax and get back into the steam room.I also wandered over to the fitness center to check it out, and I was fairly blown away by it, especially the room with at least 6 high quality spin bikes, all facing out the window overlooking Charlotte. Each bike had a rolled towel and a bottle of water. There were even complimentary ear buds packaged in a basket in the weight room if you forget to bring your own.Overall, my afternoon at the spa was wonderfully relaxing, and I enjoyed it greatly. Most of the facilities are top notch, although the steam room isn't. However, the services are incredibly expensive for what you actually get. I would consider returning, but not anytime soon. And I would probably opt for the least expensive service I could get, and just spend my day relaxing and enjoying the facilities. Better massages can be had elsewhere for far, far less.The best experience at a hotel EVER. Came here for Valentines day. Their staff is so so friendly and professional, they know how to treat a customer! Greeted every step of the way, especially when they called me the Mrs. when Im not... yet ;)  walked into our room and they placed the dozen red roses my boyfriend had ordered on the office table. It was a florist they referred to my bf. Their rooms are just lovely, spacious, and their restrooms are so awesome! I love the TV in the mirror wall. They left 2 valentines day macaroons for us also on the bed with rose pedals The best part of it all was their indoor upstairs pool/jacuzzi. we were pretty much the only ones there and it was nice. 7pm swimming and enjoying their jacuzzi, taking photos from the view. just lovely!!! I would definitely stay here if I can every single time, hopefully every ritz is like this! :)I feel elderly saying this but it is DARK in their lobby - hand the hardest time finding the friends I was meeting. This is such a chic locations and the drinks are strong and delicious. As expected service was courteous with complimentary snacks provided even though I only had one drink in the bar area. Cons- most cocktails are $15. I'm all for a premium cocktail but yeah - that's my threshold. Wine starts at $10 a glass and then there it goes! A glam location that comes at a premium. Next time I'll check them out during happy hour.This review is for the spa. I'm currently staying in Charlotte for a month for work.  While I'm staying at the Omni across the street, I needed to get my eyebrows done.  I'm really busy so I hopped over across the street to the Ritz spa, knowing that based on my experiences in Tahoe, Palo Alto and New York, the Ritz spas are usually a notch about the rest.  Oh how wrong I was about the Charlotte location.  This is honestly one of the worst eyebrow waxes I've gotten in my entire life.  At home I go to a chain salon that costs less than half and does a way way better job.  I've gotten better waxing at hole-in-the-wall nail salons in Brooklyn!  Setting aside the shape of my eyebrows (asymmetrical, with gaps where she did a bad job trimming the hair), my skin is destroyed.  The waxer used soft wax (ugh, do people still do this?!) and applied it in tiny patches, rather than once.  I do have sensitive skin, but usually any redness dissipates within 5 minutes or so.  A full day after my Ritz wax, the skin is still swollen and blotchy. (I shudder to think about how terrible getting a more *ahem* sensitive area done would be.)The rest of the spa facilities are equally unimpressive.  I tried to use both the sauna and the steam room, and walked away very disappointed.  The sauna didn't get nearly hot enough: I didn't even break a sweat.  You know the sauna doesn't get hot, when there's no thermometer/clock posted inside.  The steamroom looked like it was imported from a Soviet bathhouse: all dingy industrial tile, and a lonely sad bottle of ""eucalyptus mist"" I at first confused for a forgotten bottle of cleaner.  Even the shower was meh: I had trouble regulating the water (other Ritz spas have had push button temperature set technologies and much better showerheads).  I don't know if Charlotte has anything better to offer, but this was third rate at best compared with what I'm used to in ""real"" cities.Been to many Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons Hotels and this one is one of my favorites. Maybe it is because of the Spa. Awesome steam and then it has an Experience Shower. That is a huge shower with a control panel on the inside and you are showered by an overhead large rain like shower head and another 9  shower jets on 3 sides. I wanted to stay in it all day.  The other thing I don't remember in any of the others is the TV in the mirror in the bathroom. I SO looooved that! Nothing like watching a nice TV in the mirror as your getting ready. As usual the bed and other amenities were outstanding and most rooms have a nice view. I found the staff to be pleasant and helpful.I can't wait to go again.TamiMy husband surprised me with a night at the Ritz Carlton for my birthday. He said he just mentioned it briefly when making the reservation, but the staff noted this and wished me 'Happy Birthday' when we checked in and then offered me a glass of sparkling wine. Everyone we came across at the hotel was extremely polite and helpful, and the room itself was lovely. The bathroom was exquisite, large and filled with everything we needed, even a TV in the mirror. We also enjoyed the manager's wine and cheese reception that afternoon before heading out to dinner. An employee graciously delivered us to our destination in the beautiful BMW house car, and because they were very busy that evening, called us a cab that arrived quickly when we were ready to return. And when we returned to our room, there was a birthday cake waiting on the desk along with a personalized card signed by the manager. The white cake was filled with raspberry and covered in a delicious whipped cream frosting with fruit and was so unbelievably delicious! We were so impressed.We consider ourselves to be fairly well traveled and like to stay only in nicer hotels, mainly Westin and Marriott. This was our first experience with Ritz Carlton and I am happy to say it will not be our last. The customer service far exceeded our expectations, and being made to feel so special makes it worth every penny spent.It's always such a pleasure to spend any time at a Ritz-Carlton and this was my first occasion to stay at our hometown version of the swank chain.  My wife and I spent this past Friday night at the Charlotte Ritz for a quick Bday weekend getaway.  It's just so nice that by the time you hit the front door, everyone is already welcoming you by name thanks to the valet guy and his trusty headset.  Pampered best describes the experience.  From the lighting and furnishings in the lobby/bar area to the wood paneled elevators and immaculately appointed rooms.  Everything is just amazing.  The extra feather pillows I requested, check.  Extra towels, check.  Not a trick was missed.Even leaving to drive away is a great experience.  Car is there when you call for it and they leave you a gift of a small bag of house made caramel corn with a nice note, wishing you a safe drive home, tied to it with a ribbon.  And yes... The caramel corn was awesome as well!","Disappointing. If you like sleep, pick a different hotel. Too close to the epicenter and the noise is unreal. It's 2am and I still can't sleep. You'd think the Ritz would have invested in sound dampening / noise canceling walls and windows. Doesn't matter if you are a regular loyal customer they don't heed your preferences to be on the other side of the hotel where it's a little quieter. Instead, they give you earplugs and a worthless white noise machine.A five-star hotel that deserves five stars!  I visited the Ritz-Carlton for an event and was not disappointed.  The facilities were fabulous and the staff was on point.  I would love to have an event at the Ritz but I would need a corporate sponsor to pay the bill as I know it costs a pretty penny to stay or have an event at the Ritz.  The tea and biscuits served at the Girl Talk Empowerment Tea were visually pleasing and physically fulfilling.  We also had tea biscuit desserts but I didn't care for them.  The Ritz-Carlton is definitely the type of hotel I would love to stay in every time I leave home.  Unfortunately, they are not located everywhere and the price is pretty steep.  However, I know from experience that you get what you pay for and that's a lot!I am reviewing the lobby bar here. I met some people here for drinks and we loved it- really great service (as you would expect from Ritz Carlton) and lots of places to chill out.. sofas and comfortable chairs..  drinks were awesome too!The Ritz-Carlton in Charlotte is in my top three favorite hotels that I have stayed at in the past few years.  The hotel is conveniently located in the center of the city with very nice valet service.  The employees of the hotel were all extremely friendly and always asking if we needed anything during our stay.  There are multiple places to grab a cocktail or snack as well as a chocolatier off of the main lobby.  The room was very clean and up to date.  The view of the city was extremely nice as we had the corner room facing the center part of the city. The only complaint we had was that there was loud music until around 2 A.M. which was keeping us awake one of the nights.  We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Charlotte.""There is a reason why the Ritz is the Ritz""The service here is outstanding, from the valet, to the doorman, the check-in man, the bell hop.  The rooms are plush and luxurious.  It is one of the few hotels I hate leaving.  Glad this place is in my home town and it makes a great weekend ""stay-cation""  the bar area is pretty hip and has a good mix of people that drink here.  I love the fire in the walls too.The Ritz hotel as a whole deserves 5 stars.  It is gorgeous!!  It has such a classy feel and they make you feel like a movie star from the moment you valet your car.  This review is about the Spa, however.I have been to another Ritz spa so I had a taste of what to expect.  From the moment I entered the spa area we were greeted by very poised, professional spa coordinators behind the desk.  I was very impressed with their overall presentation and they really set the tone for the whole spa experience.  They asked me to grab a rock from a bowl of smooth rocks that each had a descriptive word marked on them.  They said to choose the rock that best describes the reason for your visit.  They had words like relax, celebrate, quiet, peace, etc.  Truthfully, I could have grabbed one of each but I thought it was a nice idea.  We were told to give this rock to the massage therapist so they could ensure we had the experience desired.We were given the quick tour and quickly robed up while waiting for the therapist....HERE's WHERE I HAD SOME ISSUES....The ""relaxation room"" was actually 3 separate areas that were placed by the windows horizontally but still in the locker area.  So there was absolutely nothing relaxing about them.  You could only fit 1 or max 3 people in each relaxing area and just the overall setup was awkward and uncomfortable.  They offered water and tea and and apple.  That was it.  For the price you pay, the relaxation room should be dimly lit and the snacks should be significantly better.  I didn't like the fact that I could see/hear others drying their hair while I was supposed to be ""relaxing.""Next up...the therapist and the massage.  We indicated that we didn't have a preference what gender the therapist was so they gave us Mr. Rogers.  I don't know why I expected Fabio, but that's beside the point.  He was very soft spoken and a little creepy to be honest.  He was professional so I don't want to be mean but he just made me a little uncomfortable.  The room was cold, not dark enough and the music was not loud enough.  The odd thing is that there was NO aroma either.  I didn't get an aromatherapy massage per se but how can a spa have no scent?  It didn't.  The room was small and the bed was right by the door so my head was facing the door...so yes, I heard people walking around outside.  His hands were so soft they felt like pillows.  I was so cold.  It was not a good experience overall.When he was done, he asked if I would like water....but isn't that like essential after you get a massage?  My friend and I proceeded upstairs to try and continue our relaxing by the indoor pool.  I thought it was awesome that they had some snacks and a little poolside bar.  The bartender was very nice and the lounge chairs were very comfortable.  The issue came in when others staying at the hotel came in to swim with their families of 4 and 5 kids.  Little kids were splashing around in the hot tub and pool which just grossed me out.  The spa area should not be open to children and/or guests.  They should have a separate area for that.  Once again, the kids splashing around made for an unrelaxing visit.I know plenty of people would disagree with me but I did not have the best experience.  I expected MUCH more for the amount they charge.  I should have left feeling like putty, but I actually left more stressed out.  I have had a better experience at Massage Envy.  I may have caught them on a bad day but there are some things...the relaxation room, the massage rooms, the pool that just are what they are.I was lucky enough to get a night stay in deluxe accommodations for a charity raffle, and we decided to stay here for our anniversary. We entered the lobby and was pleased to see more art in it than the Bechtler Museum. We checked in and the service was impeccable.  The room was nicely appointed, with lots of nice wood case goods and lit armoires with full length mirrors. High thread count sheets, but to be honest, I've stayed in much nicer rooms from a design perspective....UNTIL we opened the doors to the bathroom. Talk about putting on the Ritz. Holy shmoley, that was the nicest bathroom I've seen in a hotel room that wasn't a major suite. Nice tile work, a TV built into the mirror, a mirror in the shower, full length deep soaking tub (HALLELUJAH!) And they even called to leave a message to see if it was up to standards!! Hotels often lose me on crappy bathrooms, so the extra effort was not lost on me. The Aqua Lounge was a large pool deck around a really nice infinity pool on the 17th floor so wonderful skyline views of the city. You can order drinks/food there during the day and they have chilled cucumber-infused towelettes for you. In addition, throughout the hotel they provide free water, either bottles or fruit-infused water in the impressive fitness center or the Aqua Lounge. Unfortunately we did not test out the spa, but the other amenities were great. They provide free wifi in the lobby too.We had another interaction that provided over-the-top service to us, which was especially impressive given that I'm certain they could see we were a charity case :)  Needless to say, this was by far the best service I've ever received above Waldorf-Astoria, Intercontinental, etc... It's worth every penny. My only note- I had not visited the Lobby Bar yet and from the reviews from Yelp and friends, I honestly expected it to be swankier or more high-design. Bottom line: Agree with Carrie- a great Staycation place!I'm a big fan of nice hotels and when deciding in Charlotte where to stay nothing comes close to the Ritz.  The Westin is nice but the expansive lobby leaves it with a cold, museum like feeling, where as the Ritz is decked out with warm wood paneling interior, great decorative lighting and smaller layout that gives me that cozy....I'm home feeling.The hotel rooms are absolutely fantastic and they do all the small things that separate them from the rest of the pack...opening doors, personalized card in the room with tomorrow's weather forecast and my favorite feature....TV's in the bathroom mirror! YES!I just recently was here enjoying some time after dinner in their lounge and was extremely impressed! I love the fact they have cocktail waitress that take care of you even if you are remote to the bar at the couches.  Bar bites are complimentary and all the waitress seemed to be very friendly and prompt.  I could certainly see me as a frequent visitor of their lounge.  Lighting is perfect, elegant and subtle giving me one of the most relaxed vibes ever.  Love it :)Also, the location is convenient to nearly everything uptown so that's a bonus.Still a great bar to go to, though they just cannot hit hte 5 stars due to the wait staff just taking too damn long to get drinks or refills.  The new bar is nice and make the space work a lot better.  For this visit I was catching up with old friends.....had a few bourbons which at $14 a pop isn't cheap...period.The fire place is nice, but I'd recommend they just remove the tables....a bit silly and don't really make the space work any better....more casual seating please.My husband surprised me with a night at the Ritz, and let me tell you, it was beyond amazing!We called the hotel directly to request a bed and breakfast package and asked if there were any local incentives.  This is a great tip, by the way.  If you are staying in a local hotel, make sure you mention it.  Many upscale hotels have these deals, from their perspective, you're just a local advertisement for them!We checked in around 7:30pm and were greeted very warmly.  We also requested to be on the highest floor our rate would allow.  We ended up on the 12th floor with a great view.  Due to a little hiccup in registration, the front desk sent up a bottle of Prosseco for us.  Such a lovely surprise!  We ate at BLT and enjoyed impeccable service and delicious food.  Absolutely everything we could have thought of was already there to make our stay enjoyable.  The next morning we had complimentary full breakfast in our room and it was delicious.  The local paper was delivered, the bathrobes were soft and fluffy, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and every single staff member was warm and professional.  The price tag was definitely a splurge, even with a local incentive, but well worth it.  In my opinion, we got way more for our money.  The Lobby Lounge is still a very nice place for a drink after dinner, as this hotel knows how to incorporate themselves well with the local scene.  Go, for any reason, or for none at all.  You won't be disappointed.Like lots of folks in Charlotte, my wife and I spent a weekend here last year for an easy ""get away"" without travel.  The hotel itself is, like any other Ritz, very comfortable and well appointed - highlights are the gym (which has amazing views and is not to be missed) and the bar.  The attached restaurant, BLT, is overpriced for the quality of food (good but not the best steak) - you'd be better off walking a block to Morton's or Capital Grill if you wanted a steak dinner.  Service, except for the issue below, is very good.  But, then again, for $450 a night, all the positives should basically be a given, and this Ritz, while very good, was not better than (for instance) the Four Seasons in Atlanta.The main feedback, particularly if you're considering this place for a fun weekend trip, is that if your room is on the side facing Epicentre on a Friday or Saturday night, you will not sleep.  Noise from the clubs will keep you awake until it closes.  If you're looking for a rare night of sleep away from your kids, do not plan on getting it if you happen to be on that side of the hotel.  This noise problem is so significant that when we considered returning for a get away this summer, we requested a room that was not on the Epicentre side.  Ritz told us that they could not guarantee that, so we passed on this hotel and opted for another in town.  We were surprised that Ritz was so unhelpful with this problem, and can only guess that this was because they have had so many complaints about the Epicentre side noise issue that they cannot accommodate everyone who does not want to be on that side. Were it not for this issue, this would be a three to four star rating (if you compare this hotel to a Marriott or a Westin without reference to price or the noise, it's five stars).If your company pays for this price range. Go for it. I consider it the best hotel overall in Charlotte. The alternatives are stale and dated for the most part.This might be the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in.Nice touches:  Nearly every object seems to have a special dish, platform, or platter to rest on.  The remote control for the T.V. is in a small leather box.  The plate of complimentary cookies (which I had to hide in the closet to avoid devouring) came on a little leather platform.  The newspaper came in a dignified black bag.  And so on.  Absurdities:  There was a television screen inset into the bathroom mirror.Minor annoyances:  They called the room at 7 pm, an hour after I'd checked in, to see if I needed anything.  At 8:15 the following morning, a woman banged on my door repeatedly to see if I was still in, but didn't actually ask for anything.The Ritz really does seem nicer than comparable hotels, although their service currently comes on a little strong.[N.B.: This didn't affect me, but it might be very important of you to know that rooms with odd numbers in the hotel face some sort of a club that plays loud music late into the night.  You can hear it from your room.  I gather that this is a frequent problem, because guests were complaining about it in the lobby they day I checked in, and my room had a white noise machine, which I take as a tacit admission of guilt.  I was able to sleep through it just fine, but you may not be.  Check with them about this when you make your reservation.]All I can say here is... love it.  Just look at their website.  Perfect location, great decor, fantastic staff, very nice rooms, gym, etc.  Hopefully will stay here for every trip going forward to Charlotte for work.At this price point, one expects a certain level of quality, luxury and service. The Ritz-Carlton does not disappoint.!My better half and I checked in for a ""staycation"" weekend to enjoy afternoon tea and a bit of pampering. The hotel staff were simply unbelievable and nothing was too much effort (making dinner reservations / personalized attention and a birthday surprise to top it all). A huge THANK YOU to Mark and Philip (?) for making this so memorable.I highly recommend the Ritz-Carlton. Again, the luxury was turned up to 10 while the service took it to 11.What can I say?  There's a reason that they brand their customer service. It's exceptional and consistent at every level. The rooms are elegantly designed and furnished.  The gym and pool are fantastic if you want to burn off some calories before/after the Yelp food hunts in the area.In some of the rooms, the bathtub is enclosed in marble.  It looks nice, but it's a big step (physically) from inside the tub to the bathroom floorl.  I can see someone slipping and falling. One downside is the location of the hotel. It's right across the street from the night club at Epicenter. The last few times I've stayed at the hotel, the music blares until 10:30 at night. I mean the windows rattle.Fantastic bar in the lobby of the Ritz. Great ambiance, stellar service, and good mojitos. Clientele snobby, but bartender very nice. Oh, the Ritz.The Spa is gorgeous. Husband and I got a couples massage. The only thing I didnt like was there as a TV in the relaxation area. The View does not relax me.But they still get 5 stars for the pool-side service and excellent spa.They serve ice cream in the lobby just because. Staff is gracious and attentive. Its the Ritz, baby!Sleek and modern bar area on the first floor. All the extras you come to expect at the Ritz.  Was there for DNC and boy was this place jammed, so it was a bit too crowded.  In fact after a cocktail we decided to search for a quieter watering hole.  But don't get me wrong, still a great bar.  Also I love the showcases that Ritz properties place in various areas of their properties.  Jason of Beverly Hills was displayed in two of the cases.  Not my style, but it didn't stop me from gawking for a minute.Terrible customer service tonight. Unaccommodating staff.","Do you like things that are awesome? Oh, you do? Then the Ritz-Carlton Charlotte is the place for you.I got ""tricked"" into staying at the Ritz, and boy am I glad I did. I was under the impression I was going on a surprise trip out of town, but was pleasantly surprised when we pulled into the valet station at the Ritz for a ""staycation"" instead. From the moment you hand your keys to the valet, you are in wonderful hands. I actually left my cell phone on the center console of our car and the valet brought it in to me, correctly assuming I had accidentally forgotten it. I can't imagine any other hotel that would do that for you, really blew my socks off.My fiance (as of that weekend!) opted for the early check-in option, but unfortunately our room was not quite ready. I guess this could be considered a negative, but it just gave us an opportunity to check out the lobby bar and have a drink. The service there was also phenomenal and the ambiance was beautiful. Once our room was ready, the front desk attendant came and found us to bring our key and let us know that the room was ready. Once we arrived at the room, my socks were further removed by awesomeness, when I realized once I saw the doorbell, that we were in a suite. And a beautiful one at that. The furnishings and decorations were, of course, fabulous, and the linens and towels were delightful. Unlike most moderately priced hotels, the linens were of a sufficiently high tread count that I felt like I was home. The pillows were also very nice and fluffy. The bed was very comfortable, not too hard and not too soft. The bathrooms in the suite were fantastic and very clean. The bellhop and room attendant were also very nice and friendly. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to see the pool before the morning when we were checking out, but it is lovely and overlooks the city. Great ambiance with soothing music and an overall calming atmosphere.My experience at the Ritz-Carlton was fantastic and we will definitely return. Although it did seem a bit like a cult at first (you know, with everyone wearing the same perfectly pressed black shift dress or vest and bow-tie), the service is unmatched and the hotel itself is beautiful. Highly recommended for the weary traveler or the Charlottean looking for a special ""Staycation"". Also, a great place to get engaged. :)Solid more modern Ritz hotel.  They speak to you by name, go out of the way to make the experience enjoyable no matter why you are staying there, etc.This review is for Urban Sip as Bar Cocoa was waaaaay too packed to even get in.  My sweetie wondered what I was up to, but because of Yelp I was clued in to the 15th floor Urban Sip.  They were so nice and pleasant up there.  Fabiola was our wonderful hostess for the evening &amp; we scored a great seat by the windows.  We shared the Chocolate Pate which was delish and paired it with the Fonseca Port.  A yummy respite on a busy Saturday night!Bartender rocked. However Jona the manager does not even know the credo after over a year. How can we create Ritz Carlton guests for life when we dont know what the Ritz Carlton is?So I've stayed at Four Seasons and other hotels that are similiar before and I have to admit that my stay at this one was extremely enjoyable.When I pulled up to the Valet Parking area the employee had apparently already radioed ahead that I was arriving to the front desk.  So after having the doors held open for me and my guest by the staff and my baggage taken to my room for me.  The receptionist at the front desk already had my paperwork started and greeted me by name.  At that point another employee came around the corner with two glasses of Champagne for me and my guest.   If that isn't service... then I don't know what is.Overall style:  The style was fancy and modern with the floors being a polished marble I believe and a dark wood making up the desks etc.  It is connected to the BLT restuarant and lounge which is really nice.  Last year I stayed there I seen Shaquille O'Neil when he was filming ""VS"" racing against Dale Earnhardt junior, I believe.  Look of the rooms:The rooms are equally as nice with his and her closets which include robes and house slippers and a safe.  Flatscreen television, of course.  However, in the bathroom as well imbedded behind the mirror is a smaller t.v. that appears when you hit the power button on the controller.  The bathrooms are marble with a large jacuzzi style tub and seperate shower and seperate alcove for the toilet as well.  His and hers sinks.   There is not only a coffee maker in the room but an expresso maker as well.   Ammenities:There is an extremely nice gym on the higher levels that has about ten new treadmills as well as new workout equipment including free weights.  Normal water bottles are free as well as cucumber flavored water.  Cooled towlettes with a hint of euclyptus are also there.   For the rooms located towards the ""epicenter"" which is filled with restuarants and a couple of nightclubs, you will have a switch by the bed that will typically dampen the sound coming from outside of the room.   The pool on the top floor is amazing and well kept as is the spa.   Comments: If you are going to a restuarant on a busy night I would recommend having the gentleman at the front desk call and get reservations for you.   The hotel is directly across the street from the epicenter - so there is plenty to do.  And its close to all of the financial hubs in the city.**This is a review just for the bar areas**  Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to stay here just yet because I live about 3 blocks away.  Other than that, the bar area is super fine.  We love capping our night off after going out on 5th or the Epicentre with a comfy classy and somewhat expensive trip to the Ritz.  On Fridays, they have live music that is simply superb.  We made our way up to the 15th floor bar also and that has a really nice setup with an excellent view of the city.  Supposedly the Urban Gardens a few floors up is an excellent spot, too.  I would absolutely suggest dressing up and making a stop here for some excitement.  They are usually busy and have excellent service.  Hey, it's the Ritz!  5 Stars!!  What else did you expect??   Enjoy!!-Ian M.-Have held and attended several events at The Ritz-Carlton and have never...ever...been disappointed. The service is impeccable and the location and amenities are top notch. While pricey, the price is worth every penny in terms of the experience guests and attendees of events receive. The BLT Steak restaurant and Lobby Lounge are perfect dichotomies to the epicentre  The staff is exceptional, easy to work with and they have a top notch business and management team. You will not be disappointed!This is probably the most beautiful Ritz carlton I have stayed.  I have stayed in quite a few - but this design is very handsome city savvy.  The lobby is a great place to share a drink and stories with someone and the room I stayed in was like a penthouse, the only think missing was a kitchen.  Check out the television that appears in the mirror while you are shaving or brushing your teeth.  And how about that italian expresso machine in the lobby area of the room.  Amazing.All class! Very clean, well appointed. Extreme detail to customer service. You are treated like royalty.Did the New Years Eve thing here. Ringing in 2011. We ate at BLT had some drinks at the Lobby bar and tried out the new bar upstairs ""Urban Sip"" - Awesome! I love the Ritz. They are pricey but for good reason. They give you the 5 Star treatment. About the only thing I can say was a miss was that it took them 2 hours to bring up our bags. It was NYE so I didn't care we were keeping ourselves entertained. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is Amazing. I love the glass shower huge soaking tub. They have a beautiful pool, spa and workout facility and they even have a meditation/yoga room. I love staying here. The Ritz is always a class act.Like all Ritz Carlton locations, what makes this place is the staff and ultra luxe decor. Aiming to please any business clients, private event hosts, and hotel guests, from the valet to security to maintenance and banquet staff are above and beyond. This location is a full diamond hotel within 1 year of opening and probably attributed to their interal motto: ""Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen"".The lobby is the perfect setting for a luxurious, well cared for stay in our city - amazing restaurant, cool lounge vibe every night of the week, and helpful staff everywhere you turn.The second floor ballrooms and event spaces are beautiful decked out with luxurious carpeting, high end chandeliers and sitting areas, and a bathroom that makes you anxious to come back and visit it since it's so nice! Queue the marble floors, velvet chairs, and high end linens.This is a must-see if you're in the Uptown area, a must-stay if you've got the cash and want to have an unforgettable stay, and a must-check-out if you're thinking of hosting an event Uptown!Great, great, great!...they know you by name after the first 2 hours of being there. This location is a little pricier than alot of Ritz carltons, but its pretty new - so its worth it. Wish i could just live there! lol.My finance emailed the concierge a month prior to our arrival to let him know we were getting engaged during our time there, he responded by asking him to call him. After leaving him 2 messages NO returned phone call, so he got theater tickets and dinner reservations himself and pulled off a beautiful evening. He couldn't even get the hotel to assist with getting a car to pick us up from the executive terminal from the airport as we flew in private. With all the money that he spent for the weekend, the staff did not help him at all and for a Ritz this is not up to their normal standard! He pulled off a beautiful weekend, but not with their help. 5 stair for him, not for them. We have stay their in the past with much better service. They need to re look at their standards and go back to the way they treated their guests before. Breakfast left a lot to be desired. The hotel is beautiful but I will leave it at that.Here for a work Christmas party.  The staff was really attentive to our needs and was will to make adjustments to make sure it was what we wanted. The drinks were very pricey, but they were good. The food was just okay; although presentation for the good was great! The banquet room was a little small but overall nice. I had a good time.There is a reason that Ritz Carltons have such great reputations-- they have THE BEST customer service. Expensive, yes, but you truly get what you pay for. Worth every penny.I'm a big advocate of the Ritz Carlton chain of hotels and as usual this location does not let you down...if you're able to spend the night...do your best to spend a bit more and get a suite....some great new technology awaits you in your room.If you've traveled other locations you'll quickly realize that this hotel has one of the smaller lobbies of all locations....especially in the evening when they create seating for dinner parties.The hotel bar is very small, but always seems to spark up some excitement.Its located in the heart of Charlotte and is walking distance to many attractions.  If you're looking for fun and excitement the hotel is directly across from the Epicenter which houses many bars and restaurants for your enjoyment.Nice...really nice.Rooms and especially the bathroom was outstanding. The service was not what is typical of the Ritz.  Let me clear this up by saying why, bellman came to store our things while we finished up an event.  He didn't have any tags or anyway to right our name on our things.  When we did check out they put everything but our clothes in the vehicle.  Other than this, the service was great and the food was awesome.The Ritz is known.. well for being the Ritz. The name pretty much says it all, superstar service, creature comforts, all that one could ask for when traveling. From the moment you check in you will be known,  you will be greeted and it feels like they really do want to remember your name.  Service for me was exceptional, Jim gave me a tour of my rooms amenities as well as the hotels, Court took great care of the cars we had in Valet, and In-Room dining food was delicious. Especially, when my party and I were able to order dinner &amp; drinks 14 floors up, from the Aqua Lounge Menu. After doing some laps in the pool we felt we deserved it. I hope everyone at the Ritz-Carlton knows how much I enjoyed my stay. **I never did get to ask if they do some kind of aromatherapy in the rooms but I swear, every time I picked up the phone in my room I smelled fresh cut cedar**its a ritz, so that should tell you what to expect, its also brand new, so its not like an old ritz. the lobby bartenders make an unreal manhattan, but the bar does get pretty busy on weekend nights which can make it kind of annoying. BLT steak is in the hotel as well which is pretty decent and ive heard good things about the chocolate bar there. yes, a chocolate bar.","I've stayed in the top hotels all over Uptown Charlotte, and none of them compare to the Ritz when it comes to quality, rooms, service, vibe, food, location, etc... It's heads and shoulders above the competition and by far the choice for someone looking for the best. The rooms are good sized and the beds are some of the best I've slept in. The service is top notch, as you'd expect from The Ritz. The location is in the center of everything. The lobby is always bustling with people and energy, especially in the evening, the in-room dining is excellent.The ONLY negative I could imagine someone coming up with is the noise if your room faces the Epicenter, but the sound machine has always been the answer for us in that regard.Also, if you're a Platinum or Centurion cardholder with AMEX, they offer a great deal. If you book through AMEX, you receive a room upgrade at check-in, if available, $100 food and beverage credit and free in-room breakfast. Brilliant!Decided to stay at the Ritz when i visited Charlotte this weekend.  This place is very well run.  The staff are friendly, the service top notch and the location excellent.  I had mentioned to the agent when booking that my fiance and I were in town to look at wedding venues etc.  Every staff person congratulated us on our engagement, the staff also let a gift in our room and offered to show us the options at the Ritz for weddings.  Nice touch.  Hotel is brand new and the rooms are amazing - marble bathroom, tv in the mirror, roomy and very comfy beds!If you come to Charlotte consider a stay here.Stayed here New Year's Eve, and even though it's only been open a few months, it's already incredibly solid in every respect. The lobby can best be described as sleek and contemporary, even though those words are probably overused to describe hotel lobbies. I liked the mix of backlit abstract drawings and large photographs decorating the lobby walls. The lobby lounge is wonderfully comfortable, with a very nice southern-influenced snack menu. The pulled pork in corn biscuits with sweet potato fries is an amazing dish. They serve cocktails most of the day, which are kind of pricey but you can't beat the ambiance. BLT Steak [see separate review] made me a little nervous, since I'd read mixed things. But they came through on New Year's Eve, even though it was packed, with a fine meal and very good service. The rooms are spacious [500+ square feet] with nice design elements like textured carpets with pale blue and green patterning and tons of storage space in the double wardrobe. The wall art is unusual as well, like a large photograph of an antique doorknob done on an angle, casting a shadow. Lots of interesting details--it definitely doesn't look like the same old hotel room you've seen a million times. The bathroom also has a layout I'd never seen before, with the sinks immediately inside the door with the WC behind the sink wall and the shower and tub to the left. Minor quibble would be that the water pressure in the sink and the shower is a shade less than I would like. Don't know if this has anything to do with the requirements for the hotel's LEED certification. The minibars only have water and sodas, but there's room to add things if you want. The corkscrews are pitiful, so bring your own if you need one. Even though the hotel was full, the hallways were quiet--the building is eighteen floors tall but only has 140-some rooms, so there aren't many rooms on each floor. The top floor has a superb fitness center--two rooms, with plenty of machines [overlooking the city] and ample weight machines. There's also a separate cycling studio and a movement studio. Next door is a large indoor heated pool, which was plenty warm. There's also a hot tub in one corner. There's enough room for probably twenty people in the seating areas. You can order food and drinks through room service to be delivered to the pool. The location is convenient to everything in Uptown Charlotte. There are literally dozens of restaurant choices in all price ranges within a ten minute walk should you want to venture out of the hotel. Many have complained about the noise from Epicenter, but as it was New Year's Eve, we were up late anyway, and didn't have a problem. I could see it might be a consideration if you needed an early night. Service everywhere was efficient and polished. If you want to contrast this modern luxury hotel with something old-school, the Dunhill is a couple of blocks away and has a gracious, classic lobby bar.I stayed at the Ritz for a week during my travel to Charlotte for work. It is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at. The service was impeccable, it is conveniently located in uptown so that I was able to walk to work in five minutes and was surrounded by lots of things to do after work. The room was decorated nicely and the bed and pillows was oh so comfortable. They provide you with all the necessities that you may have forgotten to pack in your luggage. They have your typical soaps, lotion, shampoo and conditioner but they also give you a nail file, shoe shine, brush, and some other things I cannot remember off the top of my head. Even though my company paid for all my meals and snacks, the restaurants were a bit pricey for my taste. The only thing that I couldn't say no to were the desserts at Bar Cocoa. I had to pick something new up almost every night. I hope to be able to stay here again on my next business trip.Why am I even reviewing the Ritz? It's the Ritz after all. We stayed here the night of our wedding and couldn't have been more pleased. After all of the stress and hassle of a wedding, you need someplace where everything is thought of and taken care of for you-- the Ritz in uptown Charlotte is just that. Brooke at the front desk was awesome. She was super helpful coordinating things for me, and of course the bell staff were exceptional. Don't even think of staying anywhere else. The Ritz Carlton is simply the best.This is a review of the Lounge area only* We came in last night and pulled up four chairs in a corner spot the cocktail waitress started off slow but she was very nice and by the end was great!! We had just come from dinner so no food only alcohol!! But they had a drink special that was Grey Goose with Chambord and fresh Lemonade.....Really Really Good they were garnished with fresh Melon. They had live music and the crowd was large. We had a great time and picked on some bar snacks that they brought over. The bill came and as we had expected it wasn't cheap in fact it was just as much as the dinner we just had!! Oh well they were good and it was a nice time!I recently had the pleasure of spending my Birthday Weekend at the Ritz-Carlton in Charlotte.  What an experience it was! The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was incredible.  We arrived a bit early before check-in time, and our room was not ready.  Needing to change clothes to go see Wicked that afternoon, the staff arranged for us to have a room in the Spa to change and get ready. When we got back from the show and dinner, and got to our room, we were greeted with a bottle of champagne welcoming us to the hotel and apologizing for the room not being ready, even though it was our fault for arriving too early. In addition, Rhonda at the front desk sent us a bottle of wine and several custom made chocolates with a witches hat made of chocolate and a plate that said ""have a wicked day."" This is was customer service is all about. The room was spotlessly clean and beautiful, the Urban Sip bar was wonderful for late night drinks with live jazz.  I will absolutely stay here again and other Ritz in other areas!I love love Ritz Carlton.  I've been a loyal fan of their half moon bay location in San Francisco Bay area, California.  When I found out that they discounted their afternoon tea, I've since been coming more frequently.  Their kobi beef sandwich is awesome and I also tried their steaks during lunch, both are very good, tender, and prepared to my satisfaction. I am picky about the cut, the style of presentation, the temperature and the quality of their meat, freshness and many other factors.  But I consider them to have deliver on average 4-5 stars for each of their categories.  The price is reasonably considering that it is afterall, Ritz Carlton.  If you enjoy candle lights, they served both during the afternoon hour as well as the dinner hour.  The waitress/waiters are quite attention. The parking staff is courteous and responsive to my questions.  The door men are also very very polite and patient.  I usually ask for the box and pack myself - just my little pet peeve.  But they put more into the box when the waiter ended up packing my dinner.  He also warmed the bread pluff once more so when I got home to share it, the pluff was still in good temperature.  I appreciate the extra care they put it to make my experience wonderful! :)I went to the lounge located in the 15th  floor of the hotel and I had the best service ever. I have been in  a lot of restaurants and wine bars in Charlotte , New York and San Francisco and I must say that FABIOLA's service was without doubt the BEST service I  ever received. She was kind, helpful and showed knowledge of wines, food, etc. I will come back soon!!It's the Ritz.  If you are looking at Yelp for a Ritz review chances are you'll be overwhelmed by the experience.I had a very nice dinner over the weekend at BLT Steak for a great birthday celebration. I had a glass of merlot with my steak dinner then went to the bar to order a lemon drop martini. Left the BLT Steak with a martini in hand to the Ritz lobby to meet some more friends for more drinks, then to find out BLT Steak and Ritz lobby bar are not the same company. Anyhow...carry on. I love to meet friends at the Ritz lobby for live entertainment and their awesome martinis. The lobby is very alive, full of energy and a classy place to hang out or celebrate with your friends or a date. The atmosphere, the decor, the location are unbeatable. The service is impeccable.great place love itThis Ritz Carlton is perfect! They are making our business conference a nice experience.Have stayed here many times and absolutely loved it,but the person who booked our stay in Charlotte this time picked the Marriott.  Couldn't wait to go to The Ritz bar for a drink and enjoy the great service.  Post-Bobcat game crowd made it impossible.  BLT steakhouse made it possible with great service! On visiting the Ladies restroom, which is part of The Ritz area, it was in horrific shape, totally trashed and no toilet paper.  I went to give the front desk with an FYI, expecting great Ritz type service, but they copped an attitude saying over 400 people had come through in two hours.  Does that mean the Ritz is not prepared and can't provide enough toilet paper on game days?  I told the front desk this was surprising for the Ritz and got a very snippy ""I'm sorry"" and another excuse that it was game day people.  Guess this is the new Marriott ownership seeping through to the sold Ritz!  Too bad.  Charlotte has hit a new low.I recently received a deep tissue massage at the spa from Jessica and it was phenomenal!!  One of the best I've had in a long time!  The experience itself was wonderful.  The Ritz definitely caters to your every need.  The only thing I found slightly disappointing was the brightness of the lounge where you wait before your massage.  There's a great view of the city, but it's hard to relax and unwind with the sun beating down on you.","['say', 'wow', 'hotel', 'sets', 'bar', 'every', 'hotel', 'needs', 'live', 'caveat', 'cheap',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-charlotte-hotel-charlotte,Omni Charlotte Hotel,3.0,$$$,109,"The Omni would not be my 1st choice of hotels in downtown Charlotte because the place is certainly showing it's age as an older property. In my opinion, Aloft or the Westin are much better choices. However, I keep coming back because of corporate functions that are planned by someone else. As I said in my previous review, the meeting spaces are good and staff does a great job with regards to food service, valet parking, check in, etc. At yesterday's event, the food was fairly good... I had a salad with grilled chicken for lunch. The salad was fresh &amp; chicken was fine. No complaints. After our meetings for the day were over, we had a reception with heavy hors d'oeuvres &amp; bar.  The food was ok for that as well. Nothing that bowled me over but it was standard hotel fare.My room was clean &amp; king size bed was very comfy. However, once again it was pretty noisy &amp; we could hear much of what was going on in neighboring rooms. Also, the bathrooms in the rooms are really bad. Very tiny, no fan, and the bathtub was in rough shape. Also, each time the toilet was flushed, the water ran for a really long time. They really need to do a major renovation to update the bathrooms &amp; install noise blocking insulation between each room.I didn't encounter any potential bug  issues on my last couple of stays here, so the one time I noticed bug bites on my leg after a stay here must have been an anomaly.So, overall, this Omni is a-ok, not my personal favorite place to stay but decent.Roughly in the 3.5 star range with this place. In brief: Pros - free access to the Charlotte athletic Center gym (one of the best I've ever been to), connected to the Epicenter/BAC HQ, free shoe shine and pressings via the member privileges and the free top floor breakfast/dinner dining I often get. The staff is also very friendly, but maybe that is just the southern hospitality I'm not use to yet. The free drinks in the morning help too. Cons - rooms are fairly outdated and uninspiring. In a few recent cases, I've also had the AC/heat rumble all night, making it very difficult to sleep.  Ive stayed her fairly routinely on my business trips to Charlotte in the past year, but I've only seen the quality decrease. I'm going to explore other options in Uptown for my upcoming trips.What a dump. Not bothering to check these reviews before making plans for a 3 day trip to Charlotte. I mean why bother, I had done business exclusively with the Omni for almost 10 years, and billeted 100's of clients and visiting execs here over the years. So I was pretty shocked to find the current state of deterioration this iconic hotel has suffered.The rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift. Stains on the carpet, I was afraid to sit on my chair, I should have taken that 180 bucks and put it in my pocket and slept in the car, which cost $20 to leave overnight in the garage. WHAT! I checked out the next morning and walked across the street to the Holiday Inn which was a massive upgrade over this Omni. When have you ever seen those words in print? With Bank of America HQ and the Ritz Carlton next door you'd think they would be more apt to keep up the standards here, unfortunately its just not so.My advice..... stay away, there are many better options downtown.Must say it's dated for an Omni.  The other Omni's I've stayed in just seemed more high end.   I'd rather have a functioning mini-fridge than an over-priced mini bar, but maybe that's just me.  Staff was very accommodating and nice.  Heads up, valet takes 20 minutes at least.  Keep that in mind if you are in a hurry.  Never get why the mid-ranged place has free internet, and the expensive place wants $10/day.  LAME.   Great location for Time Warner Cable Center...I had an absolutely wonderful experience with this hotel! I was here helping run a convention and our event contact Kandace was always present (which is almost unheard of). The staff smiled at us every time we passed and even gave out some hugs. The food was delicious. Even the AV staff was good (and that's a real miracle). One thing I thought was super service was the fact that I left my hairbrush and iPad in my hotel room in my rush to pack (since I was helping run the convention). I didn't realize until 2 days later. I called the Omni and they had both items in their safe. I offered to give them my FedEx number and they said not to worry about it - they would handle the return with their own FedEx account. My items arrived to me in a couple of days.This hotel goes above and beyond to please the client. Unmatched.I don't even know where to begin here, except to say that we spent only 9 hours at this hotel, and that was more than enough.We ended up at the Omni by giving Hotwire a try - and this ended up being our mystery supposed 4-star hotel. Suffice it to say, I've stayed at Hampton Inns that were nicer. The Omni is stuffy, dreary, outdated, and overpriced. The halls and rooms have a that certain eau-de-old going on, and the only visible decor update since this place opened seemed to be the fresh, white shower curtain. Everything else screamed 1979. If you've read my hotel reviews in the past, you know I'm a sucker for hotel robes. The Omni has some of the creepiest robes I've ever come across... they were just really weird. Wearing them felt more like being at the doctor's office than lounging in a ""luxury"" hotel. The robes stayed in the closet.We could see the rooftop pool from our window. Granted, it's the off season, and no one's swimming right now. But this was the smallest, bleakest hotel pool I've seen in some time. It would, however, have made a fantastic set for Law &amp; Order SVU.That said, the rooms were clean enough (if very sad and beige), and the man at the front desk at 2am was very kind and chatted us up as we checked in. For that, I grant the third star. Next time I think I'll just pay a little extra and pick my hotel out on my own.Why I didn't come on Yelp to read the reviews before booking this hotel, I am not sure. I'm giving it 3 stars for the great customer service. They definitely had that down. But that's about it. This hotel is highly overpriced and the valet sucked! One night cost us $183 altogether with tax. Almost $200 to stay in a hotel in CHARLOTTE, NC? You've got to be kidding me. I pay less than that per night in Miami and Vegas and the hotels are better.This hotel is old but you can tell they've tried to do some renovations. However, we had to literally SLAM our bathroom door to get it to close. The beds in our room reminded me of something from middle school...very juvenile looking. Double beds don't have to look that juvenile...geesh. The rooms are also pretty small. AND valet sucked! One evening there was a lot of traffic and my car was parked in their overflow lot. Okay...I can understand this. But I wonder how far the overflow lot was because they returned my car to me on E. It was getting close to E but was definitely not close enough to where it should have been returned on E.Upon checking out, valet service was the worse! They literally lost my car. They could not remember where it was parked. I would say the evening before it took them 20 minutes to bring my car...this time had to take around 30. The valet attendants even kept saying, ""You're still here?"" I'm not sure how many times I heard that.On another note...housekeeping did come by with a complimentary bottle of water the evening we were there. It was a nice gesture...but maybe they should check and see how many guests are booked for each room because there were 2 of us and we were not about to share that one bottle of water. On an end note...some creeps were staying on our floor. They must have watched us walk into our room late that night even though we tried our best to make sure they did not see which room we went into. And it didn't help that our room was back in the cut on the 14th floor. You would have definitely thought our room was a housekeeping room due to where it was located. Anyway, the creeps started doing the creepiest knock on our door at around 2am. It sounded like a knock off a horror movie. They left and came back a few times so we had to call the front desk and ask them to patrol our floor. My best-friend told me while I was in the shower the next morning, the creeps came back doing the same scary knock...glad I made it out of the Omni okay! All in all, I truly appreciate their great customer service but I would never stay here again unless it was for free.The Omni Charlotte is a corporate business traveler hotel.  This is important to point out from the start.  1.  Beautiful views of Uptown from all the room windows.  Skyscrapers and reflections to your hearts content.2.  There are no refrigerators in the rooms, but you can get one upon request.3.  Internet is $9.95 a day4.  Parking is $20.00 a day5.  The lobby is bland but serves its point if you are a business traveler.  Nothing fancy.6.  Walking distance to City Center and most of Uptown.7.  Almost any toiletries upon request.8.  You need a key to get on the elevators...Even guests of guests.9.  The beds are comfy and there are waffle woven robes (very comfy).10.  Room service is fast and good.11.  The valet can be a little disorganized, but they eventually get to you.12.  The open areas could use some upgrades and modern fixtures including the elevators.Overall, it is a good in and out hotel for business travelers.  It may lack some of the added features if you are a personal or family traveler.Glad we had a good deal to stay here the last weekend of January 2015.  Not our fave hotel stay of all time, but certainly okay.  Clean (which is the most important thing!).Room was fine, although dated.  Biggest dated feature is the TOILET.  Even we have updated our toilets in our 90's home.  Not only slow, but also looked like it was going to overflow every time.  Not our fave bathroom.  Two other things that weren't our favorite this trip:  one was that the gentleman who checked us in, although super friendly, gave us the worst directions!  We asked which way to go to the Knight Theater, as we had never been to that one before.  He consulted a gal at the desk. They proceeded to kindly give us a map with perfect directions, except for the fact that we were led in the exact OPPOSITE of where we needed to be.  Fortunately, we had enough time to correct the mistake and didn't miss our show.  The other thing that was less than satisfactory was when we checked in we were warned that the next night they were going to cut off water to the hotel for hours.  We were told it was something the city was doing, but later learned it was something the hotel was doing.  Didn't really matter who was doing it, it just meant we couldn't use a bathroom for hours.  We spent some time that night in the hotel bar and it would have been nice to have been offered a drink or snack or something to compensate.  Instead it was you can fend for yourself nearby.Still, this is a great location if you want to be in the heart of things.  We love to park the car (valet...they were great) and walk everywhere, so this location is perfect for that.Great location downtown. Just walk downstairs and you have a full size wal greens. Walk next door and you have a ton of restaurant and bar options. The rooms are pretty decent sized.  The best part is their gym! It's an athletic club you have access to and they have a ton of new machines, weight lifting gadgets, and even classes!The bad thing about this location is it's proximity to loud bars, so at night if you are lame like myself, you hear the music loud and clear till 2 am while you're trying to sleep! So difficult to get a decent nights rest when you can hear club music!We stayed at the Omni while in Charlotte to attend a Panthers game. The public spaces in the Omni are quite nice. The restaurant offers an incredible breakfast buffet for $15pp as well as menu offerings. The buffet had quite a large selection. Probably one of the largest hotel breakfast buffets I've seen. The parking garage is valet and I commend the speed in which the cars are brought to the owners. We needed the car just to put some things in it, not to drive. The valet had it to us within 3 minutes!Now to the room.....This is where it doesn't live up to the Omni brand. For well over $200/night I expected Omni got a Travelodge experience. The room had a heavy odor of mildew. Nothing we did could mask it. The carpets were dirty. Too dirty to walk barefoot in the room. There were some hairs on the sink from the previous guests. But the worst of the experience was the blood stains on the sheets. Granted they had been washed, but I would think the housekeeper would know better than to use those sheets. She had to have seen the stains! I gagged when I pulled the covers down and saw them. I spread towels over the sheets to cover the stains. Although it was very late at night, in hindsight I should have called the front desk to ask the bed be remade with clean, non stained sheets.Save yourself a nightmare. Stay at the Aloft across the street.I'm done with the Omni in Charlotte. My last experience here was horrific from the frumpy pillows to the lack of a nice comforter. The bed was the worse, it was hard and uncomfortable to deal with. You'd expect a great value for what you pay but the Omni failed in that respect. The room was marginally decent but considering the price you pay it should be better. On the occasions I've been here it's never been this bad and now it's gotten worse. On the bright side the front desk was helpful from check in to check out and the valet service is top notch. Everyone is customer service oriented and accommodating but I couldn't recommend you stay here based on the fact that you may not get a good nights sleep.Been here several times.  .. won't be back.  It is extremel loud and they told me I was on the quiet side of the hotel.  LOUD music until like 3 am.  Called the front desk.  They suggested I move rooms but none would be quiet?!?    And, who wants to move in the middle of the night.  I was told on previous visits that it was a fluke that the music from the street level was so loud so I tried again.. same thing.  No thanks.  I delibertly put some crumbs in my sheets to see if they were changed.  Nope!!  I had left the card that I wanted my sheets changed daily.  Besides that the room was clean. Check in was late... they were still cleaning.  I had to wait in the lobby for hours.I agree with previous reviewers... going downhill fast.  :(  Its too bad.. I love Omni hotels in gernal.Ultimately, the director of rooms contacted me about my concerns and did give us a free night. I am a Select Member but didn't get any of those perks - the free night compensates us for the free sodas we didn't get.  I did get at least one written apology.I would have preferred to give a half star increase as I am aware of my relatives' experiences as well. However, those stories are theirs to tell.  I appreciate the effortLoud. If you get a room overlooking the pool and/or Epicentre, good luck. Music is blasted until 1 or 2 am. It's the kind of music that is not only loud, it's thumpingly loud, booming, and unsettling. Not only that, but it's the same playlist every night...Journey, Spice Girls, NSync, Britney Spears, and Mambo No. 5 - what is this... 1999? Also random country songs, electric slide, etc.. (in other words, bad wedding-type music). I stayed here for three nights on business and could not get a single night of deep sleep. I even considered moving to another hotel but they were all booked.The staff is friendly, the breakfasts are good, easy access to Walgreen's and a Starbucks is great. The room isn't modern like other places, and sure the decor could use an upgrade, but I had no issues with the room itself besides superficial aesthetic things. Too bad I couldn't relax or sleep here because of the LOUD MUSIC. Not sure what the Omni can do about this, but it greatly affected the quality of my stay. What a shame.Booked the hotel on the way to Charlotte. Concierge was gracious, and upgraded us on arrival. Be sure to sign up for the Rewards Program - includes express check-in and check-out, and complementary breakfast beverages delivered to your room. We requested milkshakes late at night. Since it took over 20 minutes, we were delighted to find that they comped the milkshakes and gave us hot fudge and diced almonds. The room was clean, the staff was polite, and we had a pleasant stay in Charlotte.For a ""four star hotel"" I certainly expected more. First off, the banquet &amp; conference facilities were excellent, maybe even 5 stars. The rooms were clean, comfortable, every meal was wonderful, and the staff were so accommodating and pleasant to interact with. Actually all of the staff I encountered in my 4 days here were great. However, the actual hotel room was very disappointing. The room had a very strong musty smell and was not the cleanest. The bed and pillows were both very firm and uncomfortable. The bathroom door didn't close over the rug that was on the floor. Not the biggest deal, but very annoying on top off all the other crappy parts of the hotel room.This is hands down FOR SURE the most disgusting 4 star hotel I've ever been in. In fact I can only think of two grosser hotels I've ever stayed at in my entire life, and they were both Motel 6s I had to get during layovers. This place is soon SO gross. I have NO idea how they have a 4 star rating, I'm SURE the hyatt and Marriott are cleaner. When I walked into my room I was met with a strong stench of mildew. The carpet has clearly not been cleaned since it was installed. The curtains are ripped. That's SUCH an easy fix, it just shows they don't care. Fading on all the couch cushions. I was so disgusted by everything I put towels down on the floor so that my feet wouldn't have to touch the carpet. tiny bathrooms with the molding falling from the showers. Tiniest bathroom. The cable cuts in and out. Seriously. I asked to switch rooms (because of the mildew, not the cable) and in my second ""upgraded"" room, same smell and same cable issues. I don't know what's going on at this hotel......but omg. SO gross. I got this place on Princeline. Next time I am in Charlotte I will pay the extra face value for the Hilton or the Hyatt (which is 3 star) JUST to be sure I don't have to stay in this nasty place EVER again. Spare yourself, make SURE you get the Hilton if you do a 4 star, or just go for a 3 star.This place looks like it could be the setting for a 1984 rom com starring Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue. It seriously looks like it hasn't been updated in 30 years and the rooms smell musty enough to be from the Carter administration. The parking situation is weird so make sure you valet. Overall the staff was pretty nice, but the hotel is super outdated and the setup is rather odd. Also, don't waste your time with the wifi. I'm currently writing this review from a tethered iPhone connection because the normal wifi was too slow to load yelp. Between this and just about anywhere else... I vote anywhere else.Stayed here thinking it would be a great place since I have stayed at Omnis before in several other locations. Made a reservation here and was also here for memorial day weekend and was very underwhelmed. The Omni hotels have always ben known to be a very nice place and this location was not up to that standard. It was not horrible but for the price some people pay I would expect better. When staying here I ordered room service several times and it was okay, but nothing special that I could not get anywhere else. I thought the food eas delicious though I just think that for the premium price they ask for you would get more. The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. The hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. As a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date. Omni would gain more business if they just did some minor changes","Stayed here because I was in town for a wedding. Hadn't stayed here in years. It could use some updating but the rooms are still nice and comfy. But, the staff are what make this hotel awesome. Everyone was so nice. They know your name and take care of your every need. The location is also great. You can walk anywhere you need to go. I've always hated the entrance to the hotel but again, this is where the wonderful staff make this hotel with a strange entrance a great experience. Parking is $15 a day. Valet parking is $22 a day. Also know that it's location is great for eating and hanging out. The epicenter along with many other places are close by. One thing you must remember when staying here, it is uptown so it can be very noisy outside and you will hear it in your room.Do not stay here unless you like being kept up past midnight with loud music outside.We got a deal on priceline and stayed here for an event near Charlotte. To be fair, this place is certainly a 4 star hotel, it's just that we hold different priorities than the hotel rating system does. We are not generally 4 star spenders.You kind of get forced into valet parking - weird to me. It actually costs more to park your car yourself than for someone else to park it. So we went with valet parking.. reluctantly.. because we love our car and don't like strangers touching it. But that's just an ""us"" thing.The concierge was very friendly and helpful. He was very willing to advise us on hot spots for dinner and drinks. He was very polite and professional.The room was impeccably clean and very comfortable. We had a good view of the city from our huge window. It was a very quiet room too, considering we were downtown, so soundproofing is a feature I appreciated at this hotel.Now here is where 4 star hotels lose points with us. EVERYTHING is extra. NO free WiFi. No complimentary breakfast of any type (not really a big deal, but we noticed). The nice 20oz bottle of water in our room, displayed invitingly, was SIX DOLLARS. Well stocked mini-bar but I can't imagine anyone ever paying that much for anything in there unless they were already drunk. In our opinion, and we are really just blue collar folks, for the price you pay for a room here you should definitely get more. That being said - with a good enough deal from priceline or another such service, we would stay here again, but never at full price.The hotel was comfortable and clean. Great price and an awesome location. The only reason I was highly irritated was because the valet was awful! I mean awful. It took more than an hour to get our car out in the morning. People were almost missing airline flights. They won't let you go get your own car because of a ""liability"" issue. Which is a lie because some people weren't even in the same parking garage as the hotel and it's the same area shared by the business center attached which is public. And there is a MANDATORY CHARGE OF $24/day. It was hot and there were babies crying and everyone was getting crabby. Terrible system and that's every morning!!!This hotel is centrally located and there is plenty around to eat and do for those staying here while in town for work. They also were very accommodating when I required transportation in the early morning hours and arranged car service for me. However, my room was foul. Not the worst or most disgusting I've ever stayed in but it was gross. The walls were bubbling and discolored, it smelled dingy and the air conditioning didn't convince me it worked appropriately. The worst was that the shower didn't drain and every time I showered I was standing in water up to my calves. I had much higher expectations for an Omni. I've stayed in Holiday Inns that were nicer.I wish I would've read the Yelp reviews prior to booking this hotel, because if I had, I would've stayed elsewhere. This hotel left so much to be desired, sadly. We arrived and went up to our room. Walked in and smelled the musty smell that other Yelpers described. The room was pretty clean but so so worn down for the price per night. See pictures for proof. I mean, a stain on a chair and bed skirt isn't acceptable when you're paying upwards of $300 for two nights. The water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low. The bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable. There was an issue with parking as the machines weren't working this past Saturday morning. Finally, I told the guy at the desk I needed to go and to get me out of the deck however he could because I was in a wedding and was late at this point (because of their issue) to meet with the bridal party. Nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately. This hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin. Some gals strolled in at 3am Sunday morning talking about strippers and we were listening to the bumping of Katy Perry's ""Roar"" remix blasting from the EpiCenter all. night. long!!!!!! See night stands for ear plugs. Word to the wise: steer clear of this dump. Spend your money at a hotel that actually has good customer service and cares about the quality of their hotel.Nice hotel. Clean rooms, comfortable beds and an assortment of complimentary toiletries and amenities in room. Room service is 24 hours, which was great because of our late arrival, while alcoholic beverages are not served by roomservice after midnight, we had gotten our order in with 15 min to spare. Besides, the room had a wet bar if necessary (it wasnt). One minor issue was that plug bank at the desk was not plugged in and working, but that was remedies by moving the dresser/tv stand Nd plugging it into the outlet behind the tv.Hotel was a little older, but still very clean. Customer service was great and the food from room service was good too! Everyone was super nice and accommodating- 5/5 for the staff!Hotel is NICE but seems best suited for business people who will only be interested in spending LOTS of cash. Our room was 300 for 2 nights and the room had a mini fridge fit for only a few items, no microwave etc. there were many things that they left in the room like bottles of water &amp; candy &amp; it was all extra. You would think at 150 per night you would get a few amenities. Internet is extra.Stayed here on a business trip. It's okay. I don't feel like the service or amenities set it apart from any other reputable hotel. The best part is the location. Close to great restaurants and bars. Also, there's a CVS located on the bottom floor. Saved me for sure!Let me start by saying that I never write reviews about anything, but I had such a terrible experience at this hotel over the last two days that I feel compelled to warn other weary travelers. Here are a few of the details that make this hotel an expensive dump. -Our toilet was broken and ran the entire time. -The shower drain was clogged with something so by the end of a shower you were ankle deep in dirty water. -The cable TV went out every 15 minutes. -A group of college kids staying across the hall decided to throw a party (slamming doors and loud conversations in the hall) and kept us awake all night. Walked down to front desk and complained but the staff did nothing about the noise.-The room was just dingy. Nasty carpet that I didn't want to walk on barefoot, outdated and chipped thrift store furniture and the kind of smell you'd expect in a room that rents by the hour. I'll never stay in an Omni again.As others have mentioned -- this hotel is extremely outdated. The location is perfect, however! The parking area opens directly (across the street) to the elevators that lead to the Epicenter. The staff seemed ok, but it just could not make up for the room. Everything felt so old. Old towels, old decor, old carpet, old halls. I would not stay again, unless a major renovation takes place.This hotel is located in the heart of Downtown Charlotte, across from a decent-sized shopping area. The rooms were fine, but the walls were a touch thin.The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and professional.My room was just fine, clean and well-appointed, outlets for all your electronics where they need to be. Valet parking was great; I never had to wait for my car beyond when I requested it for. All of the valet staff seemed to have high morale; I know this is a strange comment but I found it so refreshing I had to mention it here.The hotel is in downtown Charlotte and is with an area of night clubs with loud outdoor music.  Was in town for Business and was not able to sleep for two nights due to loud banks in the area.The rooms and halls smell MUSTY and DAMP!!The menu for the restaurant/lounge needs some updating.  There is LIMITED items for those looking for a healthy diet.Will not be my choice for future stays in Charlotte.It's been years since I've stayed at this Omni. After reading negative reviews I was hesitant to stay here, but glad I gave it a try. Overall stay was very pleasant and everything is as I would expect it to be for an Omni. Room is clean, well decorated, had all the amenities I expect and service has been good. Love that the hotel is connected to the main buildings I've needed to visit on this trip.Loved it here. Stayed overnight on my wedding night. We booked the Romance package, it was affordable and they put us in the Presidential Suite. They provided Champagne and Chocolate covered strawberries out for us. They even assigned us a ""Room Controller"" whom emailed me prior to see if there was anything else we needed for our stay. Allison was great!! The Suite was huge with a great view. If I am staying uptown again, I think this will likely be my choice.Stayed there for two days. Rooms are fair at best.  The makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall. Moldy shower areas and around the sink made me think details aren't important to this place. Smallest bathroom ever for a hotel I've stayed in. And if you happen to have to park a vehicle...Valet is cheaper!! My husband came in at 11:00pm from a business trip and the lot for self parking charged him a whole days parking (1hour difference) when we left at 9:00am the next morning!Location was excellent! Rooms were very basic. For the price I expected a lot more. The hotel is in need of an upgrade. I was here for a USF bowl game and this was the team hotel. The location was next to the EpiCenter which had plenty of entertainment and restaurant options.If I got a good deal, I'd come back.Came into town with the family.  Second time here actually as we like to stay downtown when hanging out in the area for kids soccer tournament. I would like to comment on some previous posts. Noise and loud music. My father in law recently stayed at a nice townsuites in a rural area and couldn't sleep all night due to noisy guests. It can happen anywhere and at the Omni in Charlotte in the middle of the city?  You simply run that risk.  Omni does have to get with the program and update these rooms.  But we were comfortable and the amenities in the hotel (walgreens, chick, Starbucks) are key. Finally, our stay isn't over just yet, but the staff has been first-rate - kind, knowledgable, helpful. I travel for work quite a bit and get to stay in some really nice places, but for the price, the Omni is not all that bad. 3.7 (out of 5) rating is probably fair.We had our company holiday party here and it was an AMAZING time!  Great atmosphere and all of the catering staff were courteous and helpful.","Ok hotel. Nothing special. Is located right across from the Epicenter so if you want quiet on the weekends, probably not the best place to stay.GROSS! I can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. There is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.We had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! The front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.I am going to post the picsStayed 4 nights for business. Overall the hotel was ok. Front desk staff indicated our room was a ""suite"" with two double beds, despite requesting a king.The room was clean, but small things like chipped lamps, missing paint, small hole in the drapes and an unsuccessful attempt to cover a mark on the wall was disappointing. The AC would make a big ""clank"" when it cycled on. Staff is very, very friendly, pool was nice and the location is great-across from a ton of restaurants. The beds were comfortable. Unfortunately the rest of the room wasn't much to call home about.I was the meeting planner for an event for around 30 persons and was wowwed by the (I must say very pushy) sales lady.  But the amenities offered along with the guest room rate made the deal!  I was appreciative of the standard in-room amenities like sleeping mask, ear plugs and sound machine.  Now I know why they are offered though, that dang LOUD music outside.I do not think anyone was disappointed though - I know I wasn't except for a few minor things.I agree with others that there is a musty smell in the room and as one Yelper pointed out, that smell is coming from the TV cabinet.  I am thinking that the fridge underneath that puts out heat is causing the problem.  Other than that, I did not notice any smells in the room or halls that others have mentioned.  The bed was very comfortable!I agree also that the room service menu - and even the restaurant menu - SUCKS!!  I was hard-pressed to find anything that I even liked and that was with VERY FEW choices!  And for whatever reason, the room service personal could never get it that I wanted in-room service.  Every day, my food was left outside my door which I never would have known it was there had I not looked.The meeting, IT, and banquet staff were very good and attentive.  I would definitely use the spot again if they were located elsewhere.....the VERY LOUD outdoor concerts almost nightly provided a boom-boom-booming late into the evening.  Pissed me off really but what can you do besides write City Hall (which I intend to do because it has to drive off people that want to stay in-town).  Luckily I checked out on a Thursday because at least during the week the music stopped at 10.  Weekends - I shudder to think how long it would go.Good central location though, easy walk to restaurants etc..Decent hotel downtown but has noise problem.Everything was more or less ok except for the noise.  Entertainment district across the way had throbbing disco beat that  wouldn't let us sleep.  .  Had to change rooms with my 3 kids at 02:30 a.m and we were flying back to Germany the next morning.Ask for room on side not facing entertainment district or simply book elsewhere.  Otherwise you will NOT get a good night's sleep.  It is simply inexcusable to book a nice downtown Hotel in a supposedly ""World"" city and feel like you're trying to sleep directly on the disco dance floor.  This Hotel is in need of sound-proofing renovations.Extra note in case Omni reads this.  You should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise.Stayed here for a business trip to Charlotte. Location wise, this place is absolutely perfect. Uptown Charlotte is the center of the business district in the city and the Omni hotel is located right in the middle of it. This hotel is absolutely ideal for anyone traveling to Charlotte on business or if you want to be located in walking distance to dining and entertainment. Also, most of the buildings in uptown Charlotte are connected to each other via walkway, so you can easily commute around the uptown area directly from the Omni hotel. Now the rooms of the hotels didn't match the overall presentation. They were fine, but they were nothing special and even seemed a little dated. The lobby of the hotel is very nice, but the rooms were just ok. It comes with a nice plasma TV and there's a decent amount of space, but the beds weren't the most comfortable and the room looks about 10-15 years dated. There's a bar in the lobby that is great. The bartender was awesome and hooked up a few special drinks that I asked him to make. It's a relaxed scene with comfortable chairs and couches spread through out. It even has a pretty good happy hour scene for a hotel bar. Overall this place is a great stay for anyone who desires to be in the uptown area. You literally cant be beat the location and it's an overall good hotel.This Omni is in a superb location for a stay whe you want to sample some of the best of Uptown Charlotte.  Right in the hub of things on Trade St. in between Tryon and College, across from the Epicenter, short couple of blocks to TWC arena.  Plenty of good restaurants easily within walking distance as well.  We generally stay here when attending a concert at TWC so we don't have to worry about driving, parking, drinking and driving, etc.  Had a real treat this past Tuesday night when we were put up in a huge triangle shaped suite on the 14th floor with windows running the full length of the longest two sides of the triangle.  Offered some great views of Uptown Charlotte!If the rooms were a bit less dated and the service at the bar was a bit better/friendlier, I'd be inclined to go 4 Stars but, that said, I have no qualms about staying here given the location and the prices you can find.Amazing service &amp; attention. They took it upon themselves to fix my day after Delta Airlines did a bang up job of making me hate them for life. I was tired, miserable, and 5th level of Hades ticked off. Omni, conversely, gained a customer for life on his first visit. Who does that?! These guys...thank you.The room was clean but very small. Looks like the rooms could use some updating. The staff was very courteous and accommodating. The workout area was extremely small and only has 4 cardio machines.Made a reservation in May through Expedia, which I needed to cancel.  I called the hotel and cancelled, and was told I'd be charged a $25 cancellation fee.  Well, lo and behold, Oct 7, I saw a charge to my card for $435.00.  Called the hotel and was told that the charge was for the cancellation back in May.  I explained what happened and was told that there was nothing they could do.  ""who did you talk to"", they asked?  Sure, I wrote that down and remembered it 6 months later.  Not.  So, obviously will not be staying there on future visits to Charlotte.I wanted to take this opportunity to commend Andrew S., the bellman who served us during our recent stay.  In a brief chat I had with him, I mentioned that my husband and I were overnighting there to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary and would be dining at the Capital Grille.  Next thing I knew, Andrew had tracked  us down in the bar to  inquire as to the time of our dinner reservation so that he could confirm it.  Little did I know that Andrew had  a surprise up his sleeve!  When we returned to our hotel room from dinner, we had a lovely bottle of champagne and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries with dipping sauces awaiting us!  What exceptional initiative and service!This review is long overdue.  Our trial team called the Omni Charlotte our home for a little over a month.  We were originally scheduled for 2 1/2 weeks but the freak snow storm in February kept us in through the first week of March.  Despite it being a very busy time in Charlotte, the hotel managed to get us an extended stay and made us feel very at home. The sales manager, and catering/conference coordinator were extremely helpful with anything we needed.  The entire hotel was very responsive (even with our late night/early morning requests).  The rooms were nicely kept and our war room was always in order.  True, this isn't one of the newer hotels, but it had a lot of great amenities (including a drugstore and various food court type places to eat) that made our particular stay a little more pleasant.  And kudos to Michelle M. and Hope F. for being so extremely accommodating and pleasant to work with (even when I knew our requests were tough to deal with.  What a great team!All their staff are super friendly, but there are two individuals who outshined everyone else, IMHO. 1. I forgot her name so I can't mention it here, but she is the one in charge of 14th floor lounge on 5/27/13 in the morning. 2. Jeff at the front desk who answered my wife's gazillion questions. POOR BOY :).Definitely an awesome experience. Even our dogs will agree.Painfully Blah, older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades.  The Good: Central Location, Clean, Friendly Staff The Bad: Paid $300+ for a blah hotel, rooms are old and out-dated, internet is really really slow for a business hotel, food is mediocre. Not a fan of this large downtown business hotel. Omni's can be hit or miss, this is a miss. Room decor is old and bed was not comfortable. Internet was super-slow, really? In 2012? TV was newer, but remote was terrible. Small bathroom, loud heater-A/C.  I did like the location and service was very friendly (front desk, valet, concierge, bellman, room service). But, I simply cannot explain how they can charge $300+ on a busy week. That's more than the Ritz in most towns. Meh. Needs total re-do to be worthy. Charlotte is really weak on nice business hotels... The RItz... and then what? Amazingly average hotels here, even name chains (Marriott, Westin, Omni).I just stayed at the Omni for the DNC and lets just say they REALLLY don't know how to handle bad situations. I was sharing the room with two other girls and we got a cot for the week. After the first night my roommate woke up with what she thought was a rash on her forehead and a few bug bites. We thought she had an allergic reaction to the sheets so called down to have them changed. The next day she woke up again with even more bites - which is when we all started to panic. She saw a doctor who told her based on the bites that he/she thought it was FLEAS which were probably in the cot she slept on each night. When we complained to the hotel they only switched our room. Now I've been to hotels that reimbursed people because they had cold water in the shower. THIS IS FLEAS PEOPLE!! NO reimbursement for our hotel stay which was 6 whole days. They didn't even give my friend $30 for her visit to the local Charlotte Clinic. They kept saying the had to ""TEST first."" Its been 5 days since we left and 8 days since they took the cot to test and still nothing. Not even an apology note. Oh and my friend asked them to wash all her clothes to rid them of fleas and get it to her before she left on Friday. The couldn't even do that right - when she left they said they'd ship her clothes to her. Now I'm told that my friend saw a doctor at home who said they think it's BED BUGS!! Which I could have brought home to my own house!! I'm freaking out.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!I stayed here for a week and it was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. The first thing I noticed was that the bathtub was full of human body hair... I will leave this up to you to decide which part of the body the hair was from. It was so gross and I didn't want to go into the bathtub after that. The room had an old smell to it and the carpet had a huge red stain on it. Everything about the room was just old and unclean. I dreaded going back to my hotel room every night. Good thing my work paid for the room otherwise I would've been super pissed off. I would never stay at an Omni again.Hair in the sheets and stain on the pillow! Yuk!!!!! I don't think they changed the sheets. Maybe the previous guest made the bed, so the roomkeeper left it? I don't know, but it gave me the creeps, and we looked closely at everything else and found everything grungy. On the surface, it looks OK, but OMG, it is GROSS!!!!!!!Staff was very curt bordering on rude. No smiles anywhere, just treated us like cattle - unwanted cattle at that. Don't dare ask for clean sheets..... you may become a ""problem guest"" and get the hairy eyeball for the rest of your visit.Is it unreasonable to expect CLEAN SHEETS? This place is not cheap. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but nor do I expect to be treated like a bum off the sttreet!!!!Stayed here for the Belk bowl.  Great location all kinds of restaurants nearby and the football and basketball stadiums are in walking distance. The staff was friendly and helpful from the valet to the check in to the food service.  The room was good, it actually had king size pillows for a king size bed!!  There is a Walgreens downstairs for items you forgot to pack.If you're doing business or seeing anything in the Uptown area, the Omni will put you right in the middle of everything. Wonderful staff and a very pleasant experience. Room service was great, rooms were very clean and very reasonable price for the experience. Would love to stay again.This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all. See attached pictures.","The Uptown location was perfect for the purpose of our trip. We were in town for a football game. It is a nice walk from the Omni to the BOA Stadium. All of the staff that we dealt with were VERY friendly and helpful. Now for all the rest. 1. Parking nightmare. We arrived shortly after check-in time, so yes it was busy. There was some kind of problem with a car, or not enough valets or something, but we could not even get turned into the driveway of the hotel. It was very backed up. 2. You enter on the ground floor and must ride the elevator 1 floor to the lobby. I'm sorry but that is a personal pet peeve. A. Did you really not have enough room for the lobby and front desk on the ground floor? B. you just told me there were no stairs to this exit. If that is a case, how am I going to get out in case of a fire? 3. Our room overlooked the pool, and some of Charlotte. This was scenic- and NOISY. We were not in the room all day Saturday, but the hotel was choosing to play the same songs on the loudspeaker at the pool OVER and OVER and OVER. So while we were trying to watch other football games before heading to ours, it was quite annoying. 4.The room was pretty small. I have stayed in larger rooms in much smaller cities. For $9.00 more we could have had more space- but they were out of those rooms. 5. Electrical cords. Maybe it was just my room, but there were lamp cords all over the floor. It is a miracle one of us did not trip. 6. Bad lighting. Even with all those lamps- I still felt like there was not enough light- and the bathroom lighting? terrible. 7. Water Pressure. I thought it was going to rip my skin off. Overall it seems like this hotel was poorly designed, that seems to be the root of most of the problems we had. If we were to stay in Uptown again we would stay elsewhere.This place was a bit worn, yet was ultimately an A-OK experience.The Superb:  The Valet.  At both drop-off and pick-up, these young men were superb.  Well done.  Also, the man just inside from the valet who helped me with last minute HAND WRITTEN directions to the airport?  You kick ass.The Average:  The room was nothing out of the ordinary.  The bed was fine, everything was clean, and there were no odd smells.  The $10 fee for the internet was frustrating, but accepted.The Poor:  The lobby.  It was not well marked, and was rather barren.  The people working at the lobby when I arrived were clearly not happy with their jobs.  The best part? I heard two people just out of sight behind the counter talking some serious smack about the hotel and other employees.  It would have been more entertaining on check-out, than on check-in.Long story short - Hardly the ""luxury"" hotel experience I am used to, but for the price, whatever.Looks fine, seems fine, but it's not fine. The walls and doors are paper thin. We could hear people whispering down the hall (no exaggeration) and those enjoying their rooms in a more or less romantic way were known to all.... completely. This is a hotel with zero privacy- from the loud clubs outside heard throughout the night as if our hingeless window could open and was open, to the screams of ecstasy from the rooms behind us and across the hall. If you join the select guest free membership be sure to ask the front desk what you get. There are perks but none were mentioned until we received the checkout bill in the morning under our door. I personally would have enjoyed free juice in the morning, or at least would have appreciated knowing it was an option. We will not be staying here again. Truly unfortunate as my partner is moving to this area and the Omni is in a wonderful location. Staff was friendly, can't tell you about the food or beverages since we never had any (though the completely and perpetually empty restaurant looked beautiful), parking was simple enough (garage is $15/day with in and out privileges or $22/day valet). We wanted desperately to like this hotel, just didn't happen for us. Best of luck to those that go for it ;)As far as business hotels are concerned, this one isn't bad.  It doesn't have the breadth of offerings in as many locations as say.. a Marriott or Hilton, but does the job in a pinch.  I was forced to stay here by my corporate rate, but the value didn't seem worth it.  Granted, they provide a free morning beverage (OJ, water, etc..) delivered to your room and a complimentary shoe shine, but the rate is still steep.The lobby is a bit strange as the parking elevators do not bring you to the check-in desk.  Otherwise, the location of hotel is well situated in the middle of downtown and very close to everything you need.4 stars for a decent attempt at being a service oriented hotel, but it falls shy in the luxury department.We stayed here because it was close to the arena. The staff of the hotel were great.  The people at the front desk were nice and treated us well. Each staff member we encountered greeted us warmly. Most of the guests were there like us for a concert. The hotel had a complimentary snack bar with free beer provided for us before the show! I thought our room was spacious, clean and nice.  The bed was very comfortable with big pillows! I hope we get a chance to stay here again!I'm of two minds about the Omni - on one hand, it's a decent hotel in a perfect location if you're doing business in Charlotte.  On the other hand, though, it's a bit dated and obviously wasn't built with the kind of sound insulation required now that the Epicenter is right across the street.In fact, as I sit here right now, in my 7th floor room, I can almost clearly hear the music pumping out from the rooftop event just across the street.  Luckily, it's 7:30pm, but somehow from the presence of the earplugs provided in my bedside drawer, I'm not sure that the party's going to end by the time I need to call it a night.The same goes for inside the hotel - a couple nights ago there were some folks in the hall, obviously having come back from a good night at the bars - and I could hear every. single. thing. that they said to each other.  It was all in good fun, I wasn't anywhere close to calling it a night - but that doesn't mean that others with their Privacy Please signs weren't.Other than the noise pollution issue, though, the place is pretty nice.  Rooms are decent-sized, and provide the expected amenities - including flat-screen TVs (which shouldn't be a surprise in this day and age, but somehow can be).  Their Wi-Fi is charged at $10-$15 per night, based on bandwidth, unless you subscribe to their frequent guest program, which means they'll take it off at the end of your stay.The lobby connects directly to the Epicenter or the BB&amp;T building by walkways, and also opens up directly to the Bank of America Center, which makes it pretty much an awesome location for business travelers.  There's a Walgreens in the lower lobby, as well as a Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, and several other quick-grub places.Overall, it's a nice place to stay with some minor issues - the location as a whole could use an update, but I've stayed at plenty worse places in my time as a business traveler.An Omni hotel.  You know what you're getting.This would have been a 4-Star review..... Stayed at the Omni while in Charlotte on business &amp; upon immediately walking in my room, I'm thinking man, I'm gonna love this place! Easy to get to &amp; centrally located, you're super-close to all your franchise dreams come true..... Chick-Fil-AEinstein Brothers Bagels Starbucks Bojangles Dunkin Donuts Pizzeria Uno Ruth Chris The list goes on &amp; on &amp; on The showers here are the absolute very BEST I've ever had &amp; this includes the one in my house. TONS of water pressure &amp; huge shower head to douse you in water....I never wanted to get out.  Nice &amp; smelly bathroom products, rooms are decent sized &amp; you get a coffee maker w/ free coffee to boot So why not 5-Stars? The bed is really uncomfortable but I hold reservation to revisit this statement as I have trouble adjusting to new environments... but the mattress is rock hard &amp; the pillows are super soft &amp; for me, this is not a good combo The other star deduction is due to the fact they force you to PAY for Wi-Fi &amp; it's not even a secure connection! In this day &amp; age, providing internet access should be part of the standard room charge &amp; I just think it's ludicrous to charge for Wi-Fi Something like if I am a Platinum member, I could have had it for free but charging me for internet does not inspire me towards loyalty or make me want to become ""platinum""So not saying I wouldn't stay here again but next time business brings me to Charlotte, I'll be checking out a different hotelI can't say I'm particularly impressed with the Omni.   Certainly the web site makes the location look quite luxurious, but the reality is that the interior design in this hotel is tragic.  The hallways look like some ugly 70s beige nightmare.    Worse, the room I had on the edge of the building was incredibly inconvenient:  tiny bathroom with door that wouldn't close due to floormat and in full view of guests at the aloft across the street.   I had a minibar but they never gave me the key so it didn't do me much good.    The choice of movies on demand is absolutely tragic and worst of all, no porn!  No, seriously...     I actually ordered room service the first evening I got in since I wasn't familiar with Charlotte or the surroundings.   I ordered a 3 cheese panini with french fries and a wedge salad.   The wedge salad was actually quite good but the 3 cheese panini was worse than a grilled cheese sandwich I could have made in my microwave at home with white bread and cheddar.   Ditto the fries.    Breakfast the next morning wasn't much better with the only saving grace being the scrambled eggs done easy, as I'd requested them.    I'm not sure why I got whole wheat toast instead of my english muffin, though.All and all, I'd probably come back here mostly for the location near the office when I'm in Charlotte.   I certainly wouldn't recommend it if you're coming to Charlotte and plan to spend any considerable time in your hotel though.    There's gotta be much better than this.    I'm checking out the pool later today.   If it significantly changes my view positively or negatively, I'll update the rating accordingly.Front desk staff was really helpful. Valet guys are great.Good location. Parking is the cheapest around, 15 dollars. Rooms are a little outdated. Wifi was free and people were very friendly.We wanted to have a fun night out in uptown without worries of driving home afterward so we bid $65 on priceline for a 4 star hotel and ended up in the Omni.  The location was great being right across the street from the epicentre and in the heart of uptown.The Omni has several conference/meeting rooms and seems as big as a convention center.  There are also lots of restaurants on the main floor including a Starbucks and a high dollar buffet style restaurant.The room itself was not the greatest (probably not 4 star worthy) but wasn't bad for $65.  We stayed in a room with 2 double beds and the space was small.  The bathroom was maybe one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've seen.  The beds were quite firm but I passed out all the same.I would've been a tad disappointed had we paid full price ($130) for this room.The Omni Charlotte is an immaculate luxury hotel that totally provides the Omni standard of service. I have stayed at this hotel on three separate occasions now, and each time I have been impressed. On my most recent stay, I arrived in Charlotte much earlier than expected; the wonderful front desk agent checked me into my room at 7:00 a.m.! The rooms are somewhat dated but still nicely appointed. As a Select Guest member, my Wifi internet connection was free (the hotel otherwise charges $9.95) and the connection was decent. I ordered room service - it arrived promptly and the food was great. Working out/hitting the gym while I travel is very important to me. At this hotel, you have two options: you can use the hotel's gym at no charge or you can go to the Charlotte Athletic Club, located in the same building, via a guest pass issued by the front desk. The pass costs $15. The hotel's gym is not what I have been accustomed to in four and five star hotels. It has a couple cardio machines and some free weights - if you want a full workout, you won't get it there. The Charlotte Athletic Club is a wonderful gym and is just as easily accessed as the hotel's own. It bothered me that I had to pay $15, however, to use the gym. The hotel should either provide its guests with a gym comparable to other hotels of its class OR using the Charlotte Athletic Club should be complimentary. Other than my frustration with the fitness aspect, the hotel is great, the staff are helpful and polite, and the location is superb.Decent hotel, and we would stay here again if we got the same Priceline deal ($80/night), but not our favorite.The hotel is definitely a little dated, but here is the rest of the pro/con list:Pro's- Great location- Great Service/Staff- Nice Amenities- Nice Lobby- Affordable Parking- $10 (Compared to many major cities)- Free Wi-FiCon's- Firm Beds (Personal Preference)- Thin Walls- Older rooms- Small Bathrooms- Hard to reach/Few wall outlets (I have a lot of gadgets)I will say again though, that the staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Also, the location is the main selling feature as others have stated. There is a walkway over the street to the Epicentre. If you are going over there, make sure to talk to the desk in the parking area, they have discount coupons for a few of the nicer restaurants.A few other tips:- You can get a free corkscrew if needed from the front desk that is great for traveling.- Get the mini fridge key for storing your own food/beverages. It's small, but works.- Sign up for their loyalty program for free Wi-FiIt's true that the bathrooms are teeny. It's true that the hotel feels a little dated. But I've stayed here twice and had pleasant experiences both times. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly. I would probably put it at 3.5 stars if possible. Given the brand, I feel like it should be better than it is. Certainly, if I were paying sticker price for the room, I would be disappointed. (I booked through Priceline.) There are newer hotels close by with similar rates.Stayed here for one night.   Great location great staff. Perfect location for visiting Charlotte, stayed here for UNCC move-in and wan't a better option than those hotels by the campus. Looking forward to my next visit.My in-law stayed here while visiting/job interviewing a few days ago, so based on her feedback...The staff was happy and helpful, and she got a pretty good deal through Orbitz.- the cost ended up being only a few more dollars per night than the shiesty Holiday Inn that the company she was interviewing for had put her up in.  The location is quite ideal for uptown shenanigans.  And yes, the beds here are FIRM.  I would hate it, but she likes a firm mattress.However, these fools need to invest in some sound proofing.  Bands are often playing in front of Bank of America next door,the EpiCentre entertainment complex is also nearby, and frankly this city is growing so it ain't gonna get any quieter.  Staying on the 12th floor, windows shut, and already a light sleeper, this was, in short, a problem.  So fix it.Solid hotel, pretty hard beds but clean. Great water pressure and fantastic location.  Be sure to join their club for free in room wifi.Wow...if you are familiar with the Omni in San Diego, or Dallas DO NOT come here expecting the same!! I would like to say this is a Holiday inn dressed up in a high rise but that would be doing a disservice to the Holiday Inn! The hotel feels old, rooms are tiny, and mustier than your grandma's basement. Beds feel like springy cement and AC rattles like a cage all through the night. I expected more from a name like Omni and pay per day Wifi! Are you serious it's??!! It's 2012!! Next time I will run not walk to the aloft down the street I only wish I knew there was one here sooner Omni Charlotte you get 1 star and 5 ""BOOOOOOOOOs""When we showed up our first afternoon they didn't have a room ready. We didn't make a scene and calmly went to the restaurant/bar. They didn't seem to think that we were a priority and, hours later, still didn't have us a room. That sucked. If we had kicked and screamed they would have found us something. An upgrade, if they had to. We were nice, and they took advantage. But I can get them back with a two star review :-) The other hotel services themselves were fine: decent room, clean sheets, and all that.This is where we stayed when we were first looking for an apartment in Charlotte. We came over the weekend and in those mid-recession/pre-Epicentre days the city was dead. Sunday morning you could look down Tryon and see nary a soul. It was weird, and not comforting in an apartment hunt. It also gave the Omni a post-apocalyptic vibe, which I try not to hold against it. Since then I have seen lively events (Proms, weddings, drunken frat/sorority mixers) that prove my first experience was an exception.Just know that you are paying for location rather than over-the-top luxury. You literally cannot get closer to the center of town.","Stayed here for work and will never ever stay here again. While the service is passable, the rooms, furnishings, and overall decor are deplorable (dirty and outdated). Add to that beds as hard as a barely carpeted floor. Next time I will stay at the Westin even though it is a walk. Omni Charlotte= ICK !!For the price this is a 2 star.  For location this place is a 4 star.  The rooms are small and they even gave me a corner room that said was bigger.  I would hate to see what a normal room looks like.  The corner room has 2 full size beds and is like a triangle.  You do have space but very little and the bathrooms well the toilet and the shower are like touching each other.  You can barely close the bathroom door if you want to do business in private!  The corner rooms also that face 4th street just expect a night of loud music as that side faces several rooftop bars and they play music loud late into the night.  Only saving grace is putting in the AC fan but that is loud as well.  Either music or white noise.  The signature lounge...again...small.  Overall the lobby is nice, nice restaurant and attached to BofA and the center of town with everything in walking distance.  As I said....for location unbeatable.  For a luxury hotel for the price NOPE.It was a nice hotel, and if you are member of Guest Select (which is free, by the by), you get free wi-fi and other goodies in your room.    The front desk was very helpful with printing out boarding passes and the exercise room had water for you to rehydrate.I also had to take a cab to the airport at 4:30 in the morning, and they made sure that I wasn't waiting around for that.My knocks on the place are few, but should be noted.  The AC was on 63 when I got there.  Completely jet lagged, I fell asleep with that running all night and was definitely feeling sick the next morning. blech.   Also, the shower took a tad bit of time to get warm.Yo, deese burries were crazy dat I ate right daiyurr. Iz about $24 fo a buffet and red drink. Damn, shawty, that shits 'spensive. Go downsturrs an getchoseff some Chik fil A and a starbaays coffayy!! Fo real, son!!chris Jackson, out!!Stayed here for a conference.  They took a while to get the room ready, but they took my luggage and we all left to go about our business, and they called us when they were ready, which was nice.  I ended up trying to go to the wrong room because I couldn't read the desk agent's writing, but someone came to help me out and take me to the right place and they were very pleasant about it, which is rare these days!The rooms themselves were more than adequate and spacious enough, but they weren't particularly thrilling.  I wasn't expecting anything scintillating for this conference though, so it actually exceeded expectations.  I wish the TVs were flat screen.  But the rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable, and the housekeeping leaves you nice chocolates on the bed and make up your room at night (turn down service).  The front desk agent was very helpful about getting me a map when I needed to drive somewhere and even let me  behind the counter so I could input directions myself into Mapquest.I joined their free loyalty program and got free internet and goodies delivered to the room.  Also, I banked my three company-paid nights towards a free night at a different Omni for my personal enjoyment :)Let's be honest with each other on this review. Yes, it's downtown Charlotte, NC but who cares. For the prices that this hotel charges, they can do much better. I'd suggest that they call the Omni in Pittsburgh and find-out how its done.The first 'official' weekend with my boyfriend. I fly into CLT and he has a suite booked.. Top floor.. Corner room ... as a surprise to me... :-) Huge room... 2 beds??? Poster beds.. BUT my boyfriend was a bit shocked.. A W T H moment... tells me how perfect this weekend was to be... Dinner at Capitale... partying with friends within my boos industry at EpiCenter... I loved the room.. BUT he wasn't happy. He had booked a king.. got 2 beds... right place ... wrong beds.. Good points... Room was large.. bathroom was seperate of the dressing room... Bad points.. Starbucks closed on weekends???! ... A/C in our room ended up not working so well: we had it set at 60* and we were still hot... OR maybe that was just us:-) By check out time.. we both were sneezing.. BUT location is awesome..AND if you want the 2 bed scene of a romantic weekend... well. Here you go! I still like the Omni.. it's my boo and my place... of 'officiality' :-)Perfectly happy with my brief stay at the Charlotte Omni.  Located uptown, with lots of good restaurants and attractions in the immediate surrounding area.  I came for business and had several good nights.  The staff is extremely nice, helpful and responsive.Comments below about pay wifi and tv's:  I was in two rooms and both TV's were flat screens so it seems that issue has been resolved.  As for Wi-Fi, if you're paying for it, you're not too smart.  The hotel has a great rewards program and as long you sign up (it's free to do so) you receive complimentary Wi-Fi AND complimentary beverage service brought to your door every AM.  It's a really nice touch that I really like.  And their Select Guest program has some other great perks, which has made me a very loyal customer over the years.  One other helpful hint:  look on Expedia or other travel sites for rates before going to the hotel to book.  Very often you can find the room at a greatly discounted price online and the hotel can't match it.  My room for this stay was $95 online and the hotel was charging $219 to book through them.  So do a little shopping first.When some friends of mine visited this hotel, we spent as much time in their room and at the hotel bar as we did out on the town. They were here for a meeting, and so they were exhausted after a long day at work, but I was really impressed by the accommodations and the customer service. The rooms are beautiful, clean and elegant. The hotel is centrally located to everything you could possibly want from uptown, and the convenience of the parking deck is really nice for this area. The pool is great, and the staff was all helpful. My friend had a puppy with her who kept having accidents, and folks were even friendly about that...I call that good customer service.This Omni came highly recommended based on its location and the size of the suites.  As I was planning a bachelor party to include the Panthers game, this was a perfect fit.Check-in was speedy on a Friday evening.  I had two suites and the rooms were as advertised.  The tv was not working in one of the rooms, which was fixed within 30 minutes.  Also, after speaking to a room service attendant and telling him the purpose of my trip, he offered to send up a platter for the groom-to be on the house.  Upon returning to the rooms, there were platters with snacks and beers from the hotel with a kind note wishing the groom well.  A great gesture and great service. No complaints with any other part of the hotel.  The parking system, while annoying, was standard, especially considering the garage is shared.  The charge for internet in this day is ridiculous though.  I mean, there is free internet in every park in NYC, every fast food restaurant, etc., stop wringing people's pockets.   I went to Starbucks, which was 500 ft away, and used their internet...Overall, cleanliness, location and service was great.  The decor is not modern and but the great service earned the fourth star!It's a hotel.  Great location.The goodGreat location, good lobby, decent rooms.The BadThe TVs are from 1995, how do hotels not have flat screens by now?The bed is probably the hardest, most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept on.I'm staying here for a workshop. I regret not booking at the Hilton, Marriott or aLoftThe toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.  I can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful, but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel.  There are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration, but I wonder if it's all because the Ritz is being built across the street...I recently stayed here during a business trip, and it was so bad I had to cut my stay short and go to another hotel.I've stayed at the LA Omni numerous times, and they have nice accommodations, great service and I like staying there.  I was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed.I stayed on the preferential floors, but even then the rooms were horrible.  Small, old furniture, old TV, dingy, musty, small bathroom, stains on the ceiling etc.  I was starting to get depressed just being there.  Room service was mediocre, the complimentary drink service was not well presented, came too early, way before my requested time when I wasn't awake yet (they knocked at 5:30am).  It's right in front of the Epicenter so on Thursdays when they have bands playing there at night time, I'm sure it's really really loud.The pool is this round small pool, that I didn't even attempt to go into.Will not stay there again until they have a major remodel of the entire inside of the hotel.Wireless connection at this place is HORRIBLE. NASCAR event was right outside our hotel so it was as loud as can be. However, staff was nice and accommodating. Unsure if it's just southern hospitality or if they're actually good workers - either way, not worth it. If I were back in Charlotte and needed to be close to the Federal Courthouse would I stay here? Probably not. Westin would be a better choice for a little more money.Just attended a conference for four nights. Got great service from every single encounter - front desk, housekeeping, bartender, parking valet. I don't write many reviews, but felt compelled because I really enjoyed my stay. Terrific breakfast buffet, hot beverage delivered to my room with newspaper every morning, turn-down service. Everything I asked for, and more.I am writing this review because the Omni here had the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept on ever.  Definitely a good night's sleep.  I attended a conference here and the meeting space was very good.  Just thought they deserved a shout out for comfort.Since I live in town, I don't have much use for a hotel, but I have spent some time in the Omni Charlotte, and it's great. The rooms are nice and pretty affordable, its ideally located for any and all events in town, and the staff is helpful. There's also a decent little hotel bar there that actually has a good crowd on a lot of nights (the hotel's pretty popular with business travelers, it seems). Ask for Jeremy at the front desk. He's great and super helpful and friendly.Stayed here a few months ago and still remember the great service I received. One night, there was a knock on my door asking if I wanted turndown service. I said no thank you but I would like one of the chocolates they put on pillows. The employee said he didn't have any and said good night. Ten minutes later, there's another knock on the door and room service produced a plate of chocolate covered pretzels free of charge. How's that for service? I don't normally stay at Omnis but this one went above and beyond bringing this weary traveler chocolate after a quick comment about how much I love chocolate. Will definitely stay here again if I return to Charlotte.Great location but not the best value.  Tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug.  Noisy guests had a party - we could hear the door slam as our beds were positioned on the wall of the hall.  Poor design.  Security finally broke the party up at 1:30 am.  Lots of other hotel choices in the area.","['omni', '1st', 'choice', 'hotels', 'downtown', 'place', 'certainly', 'showing', 'age', 'older', 'property', 'opinion', 'aloft', 'much', 'better', 'choices',
